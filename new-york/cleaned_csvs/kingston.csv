1/12/2017,20170112,5,5.0,"Just had dinner here with my girlfriend after passing by while walking my dog! Menu looked great & the music had smooth reggae blasting. I ordered the jerk chicken while my girlfriend ordered the oxtail. Loved the food & also loved all night happy hour! To be honest that's what initially attracted me to try the place out. Strong tasty drinks with well prepared food! Prices were fair. Happy Hour was $6 well house drinks and beer along with $8 for their ""house punch"" (which you should definitely try). Hostess was super nice & from what I read she's the owner too so it shows she cares about her business. I will definitely be returning!"
1/12/2017,20170112,5,5.0,Kingstons is the new GEM of 116th st! Authentic Jamaican food - like my grandmothers! Interior is sleek and modern. And the own works as the bartender so the service is warm and timely! Will be coming back!
1/14/2017,20170114,5,5.0,"Came to this little piece of island with heaven with my momma. She's the one who wanted to come for the ackee and salt fish. She's originally from St. Croix, and her favorite dish is ackee and salt fish with jonny cake. (Something you can't really find to eat.) This place has my moms favorite dish and a lot of authentic options for island fooders who are looking for something other than your standard jerk or curry. This establishment serves a complementary cocktail with its brunch entrees. The ackee and salt fish was amazing and the jerk chicken with caramel waffles was great! The rum punch is recommended but they have a great selection of drinks and during dinner there is an all night happy hour. They play reggae music! And the interior is very sleek with island vibes. The woman bar tending is amazing and very hospitable! The only con I have is that it is sometimes cold inside but an order of jerk will solve that."
1/26/2017,20170126,4,4.75,Finally a Jamaican spot close to home . Had the Rasta pasta and it was pretty good. Not as spicy as I was hoping. Oxtail was delicious. The drinks are the best part of this place. All of them are delicious and they aren't cheap with the alcohol. I definitely recommend and I look forward to the menu expanding. Can't wait!
1/27/2017,20170127,2,4.2,"This is my second time visiting Kingston. I must say that the food is delicious (portions are too small though) but the wait time is too long. The place is understaffed. Seems like the one lady is doing the bartending, waitress, greeting, etc. Most of the time, you are just sitting there waiting."
1/31/2017,20170131,5,4.33,"I came across this new place randomly. It was was super cute, trendy in decor and looked clean unlike most places on the block. The vibe was very chill with great Caribbean music - almost like a tropical oasis lol. The bartender immediately greeted me with a smile and began offering suggestions. I went with the oxtails and rice w/ a side of Festival. The food was good... I have no complaints. I'll most likely go back and sit at the bar Friends and partake in the Kingston wings. Oh btw, the place is kinda small so I would avoid going with a large group."
2/1/2017,20170201,3,4.14,I would give 3.5. Oxtails-good. Well marinated and chewy oxtails. Tender boiled cabbage. Average quality of rice with beans. Jerk chicken-good. Well cooked and seasoned chicken. Sweet fried dumplings that taste like churros. Strong sauce. Small portion. Good presentation. Nice and friendly waitress.
2/17/2017,20170217,4,4.12,"Food was well seasoned, great Jamaican flavor, nice portion, but need more gravy/sauce. Must try house special drinks! Awesome! I definitely recommend this place and will be back :)"
2/18/2017,20170218,4,4.11,"I stopped in early Saturday and sat at the bar. It was not busy in this small restaurant. Thy have a Dj playing reggae, soca, afrobeats. I was greeted warmly. I got oxtails and was pleased. Oxtail is not my favorite dish and I rarely order it out because you never know how much meat will be on the bone. However I felt it was worth it. Rum punch was good. $35 bottomless. $8 cocktails. The person next to me did not enjoy his jerk chicken and waffle (waffles looked like eggo waffles). Cons: had to ask for gravy for my rice, rice and peas didn't have enough peas or coconut milk for me, no curry on he menu (I went during brunch maybe it's on the results dinner menu). Overall, I will give them another chance. This is a new restaurant hopefully they read reviews and improve. Not sure this can fill the void of Negril closing. But they can try."
3/4/2017,20170304,1,3.8,"I never give bad reviews. Check me. But this needs to be said - diners BEWARE! Saddest restaurant I've ever been to. Was really rooting for a good Jamaican spot near me in Harlem. Smallest portions, slow service, unprofessional. Bar tender is doing every job. She was nice but felt bad for her... and she also ran to a bodega mid meal. And one guy waited so long for take out that he got a parking ticket. Here is how it went down. we ordered the jerk Caesar, curry goat, plantains, and a fish entree. They ran out of fish so we got the salmon flatbread. Drink was ok...could have made at home ($12). Salad came out after 40 minutes. And to add insult to injury they forgot avocado on the salad, forgot the plantains outright, gave 4 croutons sizes of chicken on the saddest most boring ice berg lettuce salad. I mean I would expect a better salad on an airplane. Mains took 1hr 20 mins to come out. The flatbread was actually insulting - Bland taste, canned pineapple, and minuscule pieces of salmon. It was actually a shock, a PTSD event where I just couldn't wait to GTFO of there after being trapped for almost 90 minutes ... I will never get my Saturday night back. Then once she handed me a crumpled up hand written receipt, I was thrilled to pay and sprint towards my freedom.I've lived in Harlem for 9 years and LOVE supporting small businesses but this place is a scam unless this was just a bad night or something. Will close in 6 months unless they make MAJOR changes. An embarrassment to Jamaican cuisine. New Yorkers know better."
3/10/2017,20170310,5,3.91,I enjoyed this place great food great service. The rum punch is really good Very good vibes
3/11/2017,20170311,2,3.75,"The food was not fresh, but the restaurant's layout and happy hour menu shows promise. Single-staffed and we were convinced our server was also the chef. $18 rendition of chickn&waffles was just tepid chicken and toaster waffles with caramel glaze on the side. The server was very kind but average meal was not worth the money."
3/16/2017,20170316,2,3.62,Honestly this place has the potential of being a great experience the staff is very nice and the decor very cute drinks was 12 dollars not worth it me and my partner had 5 and was not even buzzed the wings was delicious the skewers not so much we ordered the Rasta pasta with shrimp and chicken it took over an hour to make only for them to give us over cooked noodles whole pieces of chicken wings and shrimp from the bag that u would find in your fried rice from the Chinese restaurant once we notified the server she was very apologetic and took it off the bill overall we won't be returning unless they get a new cook
3/18/2017,20170318,2,3.5,It really sucks that I have to give them two stars but I'll start with the positives. They have great customer service. Our servicer was extremely busy and still had a personal touch. My girlfriend had a drink and she swears by it. It's a nice small place and the Ambiance is great.For the negatives.The service was slow and I really slow. There were only two tables including us totally seven people. We ordered three different items from the sides and it took about an hour. Not only was the food over priced but the portions were tiny. Now if the food was tasty I would be giving a different review. Legitimately non of the food was good. The rice was soggy. The plantains were weird. Differently not JAMAICAN STYLE. Then the worst of them all the cabbage. Not only was it sour but with no exaggeration no seasoning at all. My girlfriend is doing a vegan diet right now and she was told that they could do the akee with out salt fish. It differently had salt fish in the meal. She also had festival which was dumpling. My friend had curry goat it was literally one spoon. When he was finished eating it look like he had the same amount of food on his plate because it was all bones.This is a great place to grab drink but no food
3/24/2017,20170324,3,3.47,"Seen this place as it was being constructed and couldn't wait to try it out. The spot itself isn't very big, which doesn't work if the place is meant to be a lounge or a restaurant.There are tables and then there are benches; you also have the bar for seating. The menu is VERY limited. I ordered the jerk pork bites.....I was expecting so much more. My food came out room temperature and there was no jerk flavor to it at all, my friend ordered the curry goat with white rice that was pretty good. The drinks pretty mediocre with potential to be better since, like the food menu, is limited as well. The ladies running the show that night were nice and were monitoring how the guest were taking to this new venue which is good. All in all I can't say that I would go anytime soon to this place. Hopefully over time this place will become better seasoned than it's jerk pork bites."
3/29/2017,20170329,1,3.31,"Warning: Very detailed, lengthy review with photos. I really hope this is read by the owners of this business.I was excited to see a Jamaican spot pop up in the area. After passing it a few times, I was happy to suggest to my friend that we each lunch there - my treat. When we got there, the bar was mostly full and most of the tables were full, which is me, is a good sign when going to any restaurant. There was no staff there to greet us and no one behind the bar. One of the patrons let us know that the barmaid would be out shortly. After about 10 seconds, someone came to seat us.We scanned through the menu and decided to order 2 Ginger Beers, the Veggie Burger ($15) for my friend and an Oxtail meal ($18) for myself. The waitress told us that the veggie burger would take some time to get prepared. Somewhere between 20-30 minutes. We didnt mind the wait, since we needed to run an errand in the area anyway. We asked if we can order and then come back in 30 minutes to sit and eat. The waitress said that I would have to leave my card behind to start the food and hold the table. No problem for me. I left my card and we left. This was at 4:55pm.We came back in about 30 minutes. After sitting down for about 10 minutes, we flagged down another waitress to let her know that we were here and were ready for our food. She looked confused and then came back and told us the food will be out in about 5 minutes. After another almost 20 minutes (no exaggeration), we started to become upset and increasingly hungry. We asked about our food again, and it finally came out about 5 mins after that.WELL, first of all the portions were INCREDIBLY tiny (see photo - i.imgur.com/EiNWivt.jpg). I just ordered an $18 oxtail meal! I expected to have food to take home, if anything. The meal was literally a child-sized portion. My friend's veggie burger was literally just a veggie patty split in half, placed ontop of a pita, with lettuce, tomato and cheese (see photo - i.imgur.com/wmzj4MY.jpg). The waitress told her that it would have plaintains on it - it did not. The food was also not warm.I asked the waitress why the food took so long. She said that she didn't put the order in until we came back. I asked her why she asked me to leave my card behind then! She explained to me that if she put the order in then the food would not be warm when we got back. The whole reason why we left for the 30 mins and left the card behind was so that the food would be ready when we got back, after she told us it would take about 30 mins!! However you keep the food warm is up to you, but I felt kind of violated that I left my card behind to stranger, for basically no reason!The meal portions were very very very small, especially for $18. I have never in my life felt so ripped off. Also, I asked for pepper sauce and it was more like a tomato/hot sauce blend. I know what Jamaican pepper sauce is suppose to look and taste like and that was NOT IT! Jamaican pepper sauce is very unique and I was extremely underwhelmed.After complaining, they discounted our order a little bit. But let me tell you, this business will not last under these circumstances. Additionally, it is not fair to the employees to have to endure the attitudes of the patrons because the food is so overpriced for the portion size. Its just not fair.I hope the owners/investors of this business are reading this. THIS BUSINESS WILL NOT LAST under these conditions. The taste of the food was good, but the service, the price, the portions are NOT OKAY. Who are you trying to cater to? Residents of the area? or the Gentrifiers? Even the gentrifiers know will feel ripped off. My family lives right around the corner on 115th and we will NOT be visiting here. My family members are also prominent members of Canaan Baptist church a few doors down, and I have already notified them and their members of my experience."
3/29/2017,20170329,5,3.41,Finally an Upscale Authentic Caribbean restaurant and great friendly customer service!My wife stopped in just for an app and couple drinks this time and still consistent service.It is awesome in comparison to a few other places we tried as we are new to Harlem we were pleasantly surprised but even our second time here still great.Try the Rum punch and a delicious selection from the Jamaican fare.
3/31/2017,20170331,4,3.44,"Great restaurant. The oxtail and the goat are my most favorite dishes!!!! The service is good and attentive, and the price is definitely a bargain. So happy that Kingston is here. Welcome to the neighborhood!!"
4/4/2017,20170404,5,3.53,Hands down by far the best West Indian spot uptown!!! The drinks are major key!! Will visit again
4/8/2017,20170408,5,3.6,"Best Jamaican food I've ever had outside of Jamaica! The service was great and the staff was top notch. They served these sweet dumplings with the Jerk chicken, which I've only had in Jamaica. Will definitely be coming back now that I know this is available in the USA. Thank you God."
4/23/2017,20170423,5,3.67,"Stopped by for a business meeting,The ladies who work there were very, very nice! I did not eat because prior to getting there I had dinner, but food looked delicious and the people I was with said the oxtails were great. I will definitely be back to try their food!!"
5/12/2017,20170512,2,3.59,"I'm giving two stars bc the girl was nice but....i'll just go ahead. I came here for a paint and sip class my friend was hosting. The place is very tiny with about 10 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.-the rest of the lower starred reviews are 100% true- the bartender is the also the hostess and the chef, yes i said THE CHEF (which means while she is tending the bar shes taking food orders, going to the back, putting it in the microwave for an hour, and coming back to the bar to tend more-of course next thing is how long it took the food to come out- when it did come out you can tell it was microwaved - it was so far from authentic west indian food that it was insulting-a guy next to me got an order of wings and when they came out there were 3 on the plate and TINY. You could tell they were microwaved-not to take away from the fact that i actually like my food (had rasta pasta) but i added jerk shrimp to it and the shrimp had no jerk at all...in fact they had no seasoning and were extremely overcooked from being in the microwave too long-not to mention i had to ask 3 times for a rum punch each time i ordered one-the sink in the bathroom was also leaking like crazyI know the girl that was tending the bar is jamaican so i guess im wondering how in the hell can you confidently serve food that is not even cooked properly? She definitely knows better and so does everyone else. She was really sweet but unfortunately i dont see this place lasting with easy bake oven meals. In fact, it won't last. This place needs to be shut down."
5/27/2017,20170527,4,3.61,It was a pleasure to check out this brand new little dive during my visit to Harlem. We are late diners and appreciated that Kingston was open well after 10 pm. The curried goat and oxtails were excellent as was the sorrel though the portions were somewhat small and service was slow for them not being too busy. The vibe of the interior (down to the corrugated iron bathroom walls) was an authentic Jamaican cook shop and rum bar combo.
6/7/2017,20170607,5,3.67,I experienced such a great time here the culture the vibes and the food. Every time I eat here the food is exceptional and I get great customer service and conversation. It a real gem to have in the middle of Harlem with drinks and food I love be able to get authentic Caribbean food here I would love to see this place grow and blossom as the time goes buy
6/14/2017,20170614,4,3.68,"Happened upon this culinary oasis on a late night stroll and instantly felt at home. The food was great, drinks were well made, and the customer service was outstanding! Left knowing that we would definitely become regulars."
6/22/2017,20170622,1,3.58,"Slow service and that just the beginning. I hardly write any reviews but I feel this is a must. As much as I'm big on restaurant hopping in my neighborhood this is one place that won't make the list. Drinks where cool but as for dinner I'd call it a total disappointment. We shared the curry pot which is more like an overload of rice. You get a small portion of Curry shrimp, goat, and chicken. No whole chicken pieces, shrimp over cooked and the best tasting goat with mostly bones. Curry very oily and not authentic Jamaican curry. Venue and location great for drinks but as for dinner I doubt I'll be returning. Complained but manager didn't to make it to our table, totally the last time I'll be visiting this location."
6/23/2017,20170623,3,3.56,"There is so much to be said about this place however I'll make it short and sweet. Pros: The place is very small and cozy. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the scenery outside of the establishment. The food was absolutely delicious. Full of flavor and cooked quite well. We ordered the run punch and the Don won and a red stripe. They were Good as well. The Ackee and salt fish as well as the ox tails were delicious. Cons: the building was ridiculously HOT. We are from Texas so we are pretty used to heat however the establishment lacked any cooling system besides a fan. I was literally dripping in sweat. The next and probably biggest con was the portion sizes. I can not believe they charged $18 for 4 very small oxtails. We left still very hungry after spending $70. The service was fair, nothing worth mention. If you're in Harlem I would recommend a different venue with larger portion sizes."
6/25/2017,20170625,5,3.61,"Just left Kingston. I wanted something quick and light to eat before I head to a party later. I had the Kingston wings and a ginger beer. The wings were really great and they came out pretty quick. Very flavorful and a tad spicy. I cant handle a lot of spice, so this was just enough. Music was chill and the vibe was good. Chopped it up with the bartender for a little bit and I was off. Definitely will return to try an entree next time."
6/26/2017,20170626,5,3.66,"Great spot. I had the pork bites as a starter, they were so tender and juicy. Then for the entree I had the jerk chicken, my plate was completely clean after! So tasty. The drinks were also nicely done by Neca. Definitely a place you want to come to when you want a great meal with flavor."
6/27/2017,20170627,5,3.7,Loved it!!! Food was definitely delicious and spicy. Reminded me of home. Service was polite and prompt and extremely accommodating. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good chill time
7/10/2017,20170710,5,3.74,"Its great to have a sitdown Jamaican restaurant in Harlem because there arent many of them. The food here is delicious and the decor with the Zinc really reminds me of Jamaica. I had the curry goat and the jerk pork. Delicious and well seasoned. The Sorrel drink and the Rum punch were on point too. One of the best sit down Caribbean spots uptown for sure, I'll be a regular"
7/11/2017,20170711,5,3.78,"I love this restaurant. The food was amazing - i would suggest the ""Rasta Pasta"". Amazing!!!!! The service was great as well, our waitress was attentive. I also love the ambiance. This is our ""new place""...."
7/19/2017,20170719,5,3.82,"Great restaurant, great customer service, support small businesses like this, highly recommended"
7/21/2017,20170721,5,3.85,Amazing food and drinks! I had the Rasta Pasta with jerk chicken and I literally cleaned my plate! The rum punch was strong and yummy. It's good to finally have a food Jamaican restaurant in the area.
7/23/2017,20170723,5,3.89,"Excellent Jamaican restaurant. Great food, good prices, great service!! Highly recommend it. Nice vine, chill relaxed style. Get some!!"
7/30/2017,20170730,1,3.81,Very slow service. Don't quite understand what goes on in their kitchen. But apparently takes a whole hour to get an $18 dollar salmon. I think they go to Jamaica to kill the fish and bring it back and cook it. Geez. Not worth the wait. Need better staffing. Won't be coming back.
8/1/2017,20170801,3,3.78,"Great customer service, super friendly bartender who makes great drinks. Pretty chill spot, I only remove two stars because the food is bland."
8/6/2017,20170806,5,3.82,Great food and fast service; very authenic flavors. Had the ackee and saltfish and the jerk wings. Drinks were on point. Will definitely come back soon.
8/9/2017,20170809,4,3.82,Spicy Pineapple Margarita isn't kidding. Nice drink.Spicy and sweet with a kick that lasts throughout .
8/9/2017,20170809,5,3.85,Very good.. I'm surprised that this place gets bad or not great reviews.. and it's mostly from people who I'm sure have never been to Jamaica someone complained that there was too much bones in the curried goat..lol.. this is a very great spot.. the bartender is very authentic..and very good.. the drinks and The food are great. This is my new favorite spot in Harlem ..
8/10/2017,20170810,3,3.83,"Spicy Pineapple Margarita ($12) isn't kidding. Nice drink.Spicy and sweet with a kick that lasts throughout . Okay, so I stayed a bit later and tried the food... not a great idea. The snapper ($18) was bland, as was the beans and rice it was served with. The redeeming part of the dish were a few bites of tender okra. The plantains ($5) were sweet of their own accord; a char would have gone a long way.If you swing by, have a drink but preferably skip the food."
8/13/2017,20170813,5,3.86,"First time coming here and the vibe was so good. I'm Jamaican myself and love the Jamaican vibes along with the music and great food. Since I've been in Harlem, I've been craving my Jamaican food and I was super excited to see such an authentic Jamaican spot. Highly recommended!"
8/20/2017,20170820,2,3.81,"I really wanted to like this place. A jamaican restaurant in the area? Yes yes yes...but my experience made it a NO for me. Came here with my fiance and i ordered the oxtails rice and peas. The oxtails did not taste like oxtails nor look like them. What was on my plate...i have no idea. The rice and peas werent bad. My fiance had the jerk chicken and waffle. He stated that it was just okay, but that he wouldnt get it again. The drinks werent bad, i had the unlimited which included either mimosas or rum punch. I tried both but didnt feel that any were as strong as they could of been. I will not be back!"
9/16/2017,20170916,5,3.84,Great food & atmosphere. Drinks are smooth and tasty! Affordable price for good Jamaican food!
9/17/2017,20170917,5,3.87,Great Food!!! The Jerk sauce on the Salmon was excellent!! Loved it! The service pleasant and informative. I will recommend and return!
9/20/2017,20170920,5,3.89,The Rasta Pasta and the Steam Snapper Fish is a delight..... make sure you get the salsa salad to begin and open the taste buds up.
9/22/2017,20170922,5,3.91,Seriously authentic and fabulous jerk chicken. The real deal. Jamaican-Caribbean vibe. Definitely a gem.
9/23/2017,20170923,5,3.94,"Authentic, Tasty food, great ambiance- chicken skewers were really good and the mixed curry was excellent. the rum cakes was the best we ever had! A great find on 116th"
9/23/2017,20170923,5,3.96,Love this spot. great food and great drinks!! Visiting from the Bay Area and glad we found this spot and easy to get to.
9/29/2017,20170929,5,3.98,"The music and ambiance in here is great, as NYC doesn't have many spots able to maintain that true Caribbean vibe. The server was super nice even though she was the only one working and every seat in the place was filled. We had a few red stripes and the oxtail but the jerk chicken was our favorite - definitely the best we've had since moving to Harlem a few years ago. We even got to have a slice of homemade carrot cake from the family celebrating a birthday beside us and were kind enough to share. That speaks more to the vibe in this place than anything else I say can."
9/30/2017,20170930,5,4.0,"Delicious food. I had the Rasta pasta with jerk chicken and it was so flavorful. I recommend the Don One if you're a Hennessy drinker and like a natural drink. It had fresh orange juice, tea, mint, and other fruit juices. Delicious!"
10/2/2017,20171002,1,3.94,"The smallest portion of food I have ever been served in my entire life. $50 bucks later and I literally left the restaurant hungry and dissatisfied.My friend and I both ordered oxtails which had a nice flavor to them but they took forever to come out, when they finally did they were just warm. The rice and beans was bland with literally 3 beans in it and the cabbage also was not seasoned with not a drop of gravy on it after I requested it. The rum punch tasted like it had no liquor in it and the overall service was just Ehhh!Definitely not a place I would recommend to anyone or a place I would ever return back to. With service like that I give them a year and the doors being shut down!"
10/6/2017,20171006,2,3.91,"Faux Jamaican We ordered oxtails and curry goat for delivery. The first hint should have been the limited selection. The food was terrible, just awful. It lacked flavor and the meat was dry and tough... when I say tough I mean pull at and hurt your teeth tough. Goat, when prepared properly, is supposed to fall off the bone. One piece of mine was actually crispy. What Jamaican food lacks flavor?!? It's some of the most flavorful cuisine in the planet but apparently not in this ""Kingston.""This was the first time I was actually happy for small portions, there was less for me to suffer through. One of the best things about going to a Jamaican spot is that they load you up. You can offer a medium meal and have lunch AND dinner. Nah... not here. There was a ton of empty space in my container but that good it was less for me to pick out of my teeth. Overall, it was all just weird. I wouldn't surprised to learn that the cook was working from Martha Stewart recipes. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my BF begged me not to be mean and give an honest review. When I asked if he liked his food... *crickets. So that 2nd star was me being nice but NEVER AGAIN. You're better off at Golden Krust."
10/19/2017,20171019,3,3.89,"Saw this newer addition to the Harlem community, and being a Jamaican transplant, I wanted to check it out. Cute ambience, friendly & attentive bartender, tasty rum punch. Rasta pasta was delightful, the burger could use more seasoning since it's enveloped by patty crust AND coco bread. The curry pot was TERRIBLE: very oily & just...ugh. There were three of us: each of our meals came out about 5 - 6 minutes apart. Cute place but, it may be a while before I return here."
10/22/2017,20171022,5,3.91,The food here is delicious and our waitress was so friendly and hospitable. I definitely recommend this place.
10/31/2017,20171031,1,3.86,"Oh my gosh, you people should know better!!! Negril Village and Miss Lilys put you people to shaaaaame! .....I feel sorry for those who think this is good west Indian food. Your portions are also comical....get it together owner!...You're better off going to golden krust for a better bite!"
11/14/2017,20171114,1,3.81,This place is fairly new with little footwork but I wanted to try it out. The space is very small so you can't celebrate a birthday here. I was w 3 adults & 1 child and was seated at a small wooden table in the front. It was cute at first until the hard surface became uncomfortable. Until the food came out and the plates took up most of the room. 2 persons ordered oxtails and I ordered the fish w festival. The oxtails were meatless and small. Plantains nor rice seemed to have much flavor. The worst of it all was the 30 minute wait for food (it may have been longer) DON'T go there hungry!
12/2/2017,20171202,1,3.76,"I noticed this place about a year ago and always wanted to stop in because I work right down the street as a server myself so today I went in there before work having about 45 minutes to spare I thought I could sit down have a nice lunch and then head to work but I was wrong, I was greeted right away and given a menu and told that I would be given a few minutes to look it over as she disappeared to the back somewhere..a few minutes was way too long for my liking especially since it isn't a very big menu and I was the only guest beside two other women that looked like they were family...anyways...as I got up to leave I finally saw her coming back, no apology no nothing, actually seemed like she had a lil attitude like I kept HER waiting, like she had better things to do...anyways... After taking my order (A jerk salmon salad minus the tomatoes,onions and peppers) she questioned my order and actually had the nerve to chuckle saying ""So you just want Romaine, parmesan and crutons?"" Umm YES!! Anyways I asked for the bill right away bc at this point I'm wondering will I be late for work, she gives me my bill and disappears in the back of again saying that she was going to let the kitchen know that I was in a rush, which I don't understand what that has to do with anything because it's not like I want raw food and besides how long does a salad take?? Besides her giving me my check there would be no other way to speed up this process... anyways... I realize when she was gone that she only charged me for a jerk salad and not a jerk salmon salad and so I'm waiting for her to finally make it back to tell her I said salmon at this point too many mistakes have the made and the damage is already done especially since now she would have to go back into the kitchen and add to the order of which I was already waiting so I decided to just leave and ended up eating at the chicken joint down the street and got better service, I am jamaican-born myself and really wanted some Jamaican food and to represent my country but this place is a disappointment there's no wonder why every time I pass it's barely anyone in there. you guys need to do better."
12/22/2017,20171222,3,3.75,"I dined here as a party of one this past Thursday. I arrived at around 6 pm and there was no one there except the server. I sat at the bar and I ordered a rum punch and oxtail dinner. Overall it was just ok. I do not eat oxtails often, but I have ordered from take out spots and it was better tasting, a larger amount of oxtails and at a cheaper price. For restaurant quality and the $18.00 price, I think they were very skimpy on the oxtails. Also these seemed to be really thin and not very meaty. The cabbage was really the star of the plate. It was really good. It wasn't too hard or too soft and with the oxtail gravy, it was really good. The rum punch was ok, it didn't make me want to get another. The server was nice and attentive and the music was good! I also liked the decor. It made me feel like I was in a local spot in the Caribbean."
1/17/2018,20180117,5,3.77,"So great!! Happy I found this spot. Great music, amazing jerk chicken and lovable staff. Can't wait to come back. THANKS FOR THE JERK!!"
1/27/2018,20180127,5,3.79,"A great new edition to this area. This hostess/co-owner ensures that customers are satisfied no matter their dietary preferences. Additionally, the Veggie Curry is well seasoned dish and would be something I would try again as it caters to the Vegan/Pescatarian lifestyles."
1/28/2018,20180128,5,3.81,"Went to Kingston yesterday for a meeting and it was some of the best Caribbean Cuisine I've ever had the jerk chicken was extremely juicy and tender, the steamed veggies were very good and well seasoned. The drinks were also very good I had a drink I called ""The Tribe"" that was extremely good and I can't remember the woman's name who served us but she was Awesome. If you're in New York and looking for something to great to eat check them out!"
2/1/2018,20180201,5,3.83,"Amazing cocktails !Amazing food !Amazing service!Amazing music!We tried the spicy margarita, pork bite and jerk chicken with rice and cabbage ! Perfect! Congratulations !"
2/7/2018,20180207,5,3.84,"Lovely food and service. As soon as we walked in, the bartender was so welcoming and warm. The rice and beans were rich in flavor. Go for the food and stay for the generous service, and welcoming atmosphere."
2/21/2018,20180221,2,3.82,Came here to have drinks and great food...Instead i got a small fish without any of the stuff in the menu...will came back for happy hrs drinks and chicken on the grill...
2/25/2018,20180225,5,3.83,what a great dining experience! we started with a couple of cocktails (delicious) and jerk chicken (very tender). the pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the bauss. the waitress was very down-to-earth and easy to talk to. we will be definitely back!
3/22/2018,20180322,5,3.85,The jerk pork bites were amazing omg! And so many for just 10 bucks! The Rasta pasta is to die for as well. The pasta is so well marinated and I highly recommend with the jerk chicken. Really good great place I've dined there 5 times in the last month!
4/2/2018,20180402,5,3.87,Really good food. I had the Pasta along with Bun and Cheese. Even the delivery man was courteous; I will definitely order/visit them again!
5/11/2018,20180511,1,3.83,"Ordered from here off on Grubhub. Spent $22 bucks on some Rasta Pasta that I have never tried and was really looking forward to it on this Friday night. But unfortunately they just took my money and never showed up ! They even sent messages saying "" on the way "" then I see it says "" order delivered "" smh it was never delivered. Never a call nothing . Sooo idk about this place that was horrible customer service and I haven't even went to the place yet . Yikes !"
5/31/2018,20180531,4,3.83,"I downloaded yelp just to write this review. Kingston is a cozy spot and it's very relaxed. Camille is the best. I came just before happy hour ended at 8:00 with me husband and 3 kids (youngest 1 months) we ordered appetizers of the jerk pork for the kids with with a sis and we shared the curry pot for 2. Kingston has an open front so if you grab the bench in front that's a good spot. Happy hour drinks were excellent, music was excellent and I will be back."
5/31/2018,20180531,5,3.85,"My first time visiting Kingston was definitely a pleasant experience. I ordered the jerk pork as a starter and it was dynamite! I next ordered ackee and salt fish and my date ordered Rasta Pasta w Jerk chicken. We both finished our plates wanting more, I even ordered Jerk Pork to go because it was so authentic and rare to find on a Jamaican restaurant menus in NYC. It was a like a little taste of home and I will be back for more. Also, not to mention the cute Irie server was so sweet! She invited me to come back on Friday nights for a Caribbean Nights Party and I will be back for the vibes and drinks next time."
6/2/2018,20180602,4,3.85,"Very, cute and trendy place ! The DJ plays the best music, and our girl at the bar kept the drinks flowing , and the food was quite delightful . Will be coming back next Friday for sure !"
6/2/2018,20180602,5,3.86,Food is fresh. Chicken is juicy. Service is pleasant. Drinks are solid. Authentic as it gets! Definitely coming back often.
6/4/2018,20180604,5,3.88,Great music and drinks!!! I will definitely go again. Place is kind of small but it is worth going. Dj played a lot of reggae and up to date music. Rum punch was strong
6/11/2018,20180611,4,3.88,Nice place. Small nice decor and lighting. Food was good. Jerk chicken and curry very tasty. As we looked inside a few passers-by recommended it was well. Great drinks very good tasting with a lot of kick! Good Caribbean food in Harlem.
6/17/2018,20180617,5,3.89,"Walked into Kingston with my cousins by chance as we were strolling the streets of Harlem. We were having one of those ""go with the flow"" Sundays. This establishment is a diamond in the ruff. Camille greeted and made our drinks. She was a kind and genuine host. The drinks were refreshing and delicious! We will definitely be back to try to food and more from the menu. Thanks for a great and relaxing time. We could truly unwind!"
6/22/2018,20180622,1,3.86,"I'm sorry, but this food is sub par!!!!! I ordered a jerk chicken dinner! For $12 I could have bought the ingredients and cooked it myself!!!I received a flimsy breast and leg! A cup of DRY ass rice and peas, and about about a fist full of cabbage!!! OH, and I had to order my plantains on the side!???What happened to the jerk sauce?? Who are you cooking this for b/c it's NOT EVEN HOT/SPICY!!!!?? It tastes terrible!!! I gave the DRY ASS, FAKE jerk chicken to my garbage can!! And why the fuck does the food smell like this???? I'm confused!!!? I thought I'd give ya'll a chance b/x you're pretty new, but this food is fucking garbage and not worth the money! How dare you call it KINGSTON!!! As a West Indian woman, I'm offended and pissed that I wasted my $12 bloodclat dollars!! My husband had to add the damn JERK SAUCE it comes with to make it taste better!!!!! I still didn't like it!!!! FUCK!!!"
6/28/2018,20180628,2,3.83,Sorry guys but I do not recommend this spot. I had hopes but there were too many issues 1. Food took an hours to be done 2. Had little flavor 3. Meat was not tender (goat and oxtail) Would not return.
6/29/2018,20180629,5,3.85,So I had the pleasure eating in Kingston. The food is delicious. I ordered the rasta pasta. It was so so good I nearly clean my plate. Almost wanted to like the plate to get every bit of the sauce and meat left. I highly recommend ordering it. My first time ever eating rasta pasta and I was not disappointed. The drinks are good as well. This is a very cozy nice place with good food. You want some good Caribbean food come here you will thank me later.
7/4/2018,20180704,2,3.83,If you know and love rasta pasta save yourself the pain! I came for Mother's Day because Amy Ruth's was overly crowded... I thought we would take next best thing but this was far from it. The food is so dry it was upsetting me and didn't taste anything like rasta pasta. I was grateful the waitress was nice but like many other reviews the place is just slow paced. I dont know how....there weren't many customers. The drinks were also super weak and over priced. I don't see myself coming back.
7/21/2018,20180721,3,3.81,I really wanted to like this place but it was pretty bad. Ordered the jerk chicken entree at lunch and chicken was super dry and tasteless. They used old chicken from day before. I wouldn't go back as miss Lily's does it right. So juicy. I couldn't get any juice out of the dud.
8/5/2018,20180805,1,3.78,"THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING THE COOK NEEDS TO BE LET GO...BUT DRINKS ARE GOOD ( I'M JAMAICAN SO I KNOW THE FOOD AND COOK IT VERY WELL AND THEIRS WAS A DISASTER) ! ...Worst Jamaican restaurant ever, as we say in Jamaica ""Dem cyaan't cook, food nuh taste nice"" basically the food is horrible, they cannot cook. Absolutely disgusting ! I tried the Curry Goat and it was so salty that I had to send it back to kitchen, it was not edible at all. I then ordered the Oxtail and they put so much browning (gravy master) on it that it looked black and is slightly bitter, whatever flavour there was was not a present because the excessive amount of browning chased it and left the meat tasting bitter. I will certainly give them feedback before I leave. Food was a disaster! I am Jamaican so cannot be fooled with the food, perhaps Yankee or other folks who aren't West Indian or Jamaican people know the difference, but I certainly do. I spoke with the waitress who even agreed that the curry goat was too salty and said that the Oxtail has too much browning and that she was tell the cook and the owner. I tried their Jerk Chicken once at the African Food Festival in Harlem and it was very tasteless and bland but this was almost 2 years ago and I said to myself the other day when a friend invited me to drinks there, let me give them another try to see if they improved but still to my disappointment the food was honestly the worst I have eaten from a Jamaican restaurant. I cook and eat the food at home as a Jamaican and from a family of restaurant owners and cooks so I know what I am saying. I certainly hope that they take corrective measures insofar as the cook because the food needs major improvements.ALSO THE FOOD TAKES FOREVER TO LEAVE THE KITCHEN...ITS COOKED ALREADY SO IT PUZZLES ME WHY THEY TAKE SO LONG TO SERVE CUSTOMERS !"
9/2/2018,20180902,5,3.8,"Love his place. Right in the heart of Harlem the food was excellent, I had the Rasta pasta!!! AMAZING!!!!"
9/9/2018,20180909,1,3.76,"this place is gross...do not go! curried goat was salty as hell, steamed veggies were bland as hell, and the whole snapper that i got was covered with boring meaningless crackers vegetables and other nonsense. wait staff was awesome though. food...terrible!"
9/15/2018,20180915,3,3.75,The food is mediocre. The space is on 116th which is not the cleanest block and it smells bad. I went on a Saturday and there was one server/bartender. She was good but service was slow. I would rather go to a hole in the wall with great JA food than this cute location with mediocre fare. Drink selection reminds me of being on a rum punch catamaran in the Caribbean- sweet drinks that arent so great. I felt like their were many flavors that did not belong together in the drinks and food selections -super sweet rasta pasta and way too much cheese on the salsa salad.
9/15/2018,20180915,4,3.76,"The Jerk Shrimp Rasta Pasta was excellent, but they have to work on their curry goat and white rice. The rice was extra buttery and the curry goat was chopped too small, with a lot of bones. There was also no gravy on the rice or goat and the cabbage was terrible, it needed seasoning or some flavor.The food was prepared in the exact timing my order indicated and delivery was right on time!"
9/17/2018,20180917,5,3.77,"This is my new favorite place for Caribbean food and Rum Punch. I was in search of Melba's and stumbled upon this hidden gem. The food is absolutely amazing. As a former employee of Citysearch my job was to review art, leasure and entertainment including restaurants. I give them 5 stars. I advised my hostess to me being a fan of Henricas rum Punch and it would be the deal breaker she exceeded my expectations. The food was flavorful. The jerk salmon was absolutely succulent. My friend enjoyed the steamed snapper. It was amazing. The broth was the type that makes you dip your bread to get every morsel. My other sister from another mister devoured the Rasta Pasta. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. I promised to come back and I certainly am going to keep my word. Scrumptious!!!!! Bon appetit"
9/20/2018,20180920,2,3.75,"My friend and I stopped by here on a whim. My boyfriend is West Indian and I love the food, so I'm always down for a West Indian spot. First, I had a pineapple ghost pepper and something else margarita. It wasn't too spicy, but the flavors did not go together. Switched to a different drink that was better, but still blah.For my entree, I had the Rasta Pasta with jerk shrimp. No. No. And, a final no. Rasta Pasta is a little sweet, but this tasted like sugar, sugar and sugar. I thought the jerk shrimp would cut the expected sweetness, but it wasn't jerk. It tasted like a honey BBQ sauce, which upped the sweetness factor. If you've had real West Indian food, you will be incredibly disappointed. None of that flavor and love you expect in the food. Go to LoLo's around the corner."
9/21/2018,20180921,5,3.76,"What a hidden GEM in Harlem! I traveled all the way from BROOKLYN and the ambiance was cute, food was superb and Camille in particular, was the bomb @ss bartender. She mek mi and mi sister ah rum punch whey PACK ONE RAAS PUNCH, yuh see? We knee dem lock up pon we, outta road! We had grilled jerk pork and chicken, roti skin, festival and cabbage. Pepper sauce was saying ""ONE"" also. Authentic yaard cooking....STRAIGHT! NUFF LOVE, UNNUH BIG UP UNNUH SELF.....LIVE MUSIC TOO! CHAT BOUT CLASS, STYLE AND IRIE SERVICE! Thanks, Camille! Love, Peaches and Tasha!"
9/22/2018,20180922,5,3.78,"Stumbled upon Kingston, while searching for a bottomless brunch spot, and what an amazing surprise! They DO have bottomless, which is a plus! They're super affordable! The food is authentic, DELICIOUS and made to order. And Camille was beyond amazing with the hospitality. It was like having that traditional island attention and accommodation that I experienced while in Jamaica. I would HIGHLY recommend Kingston if you're in the mood for authentically mouth watering food matched with phenomenal service!"
10/3/2018,20181003,5,3.79,"Loved the food and drinks, the staff was awesome... I love the amazing decor it takes you to the island"
10/3/2018,20181003,4,3.79,"I met up with a few friends here for drinks and a light meal. It's a great cozy spot for a nice evening meal and I think on Saturday nights they have a DJ spinning as well. Service was great. The bartender (possibly also the owner?) was a one woman show and took care of everyone who came in after us in a timely manner. I reccomend the rum punch. The Rasta Pasta was tasty but didn't offer much other than noodles and a delicious sauce. As my friend put it, ""there's a lot of pasta but not a lot orf Rasta!"" I'm glad I added the shrimp! I will return here again."
10/3/2018,20181003,3,3.78,"Kingston is a really nice restaurant in the midst of Harlem. In the middle of all the soul food and African restaurants, it is nice to have a Caribbean offering as well. What I like most about this establishment is the service and the music. They play classic reggae tracks that if you are a fan, you love the atmosphere. The server was also extremely nice and police and that was a big plus for me. We ordered the oxtail and the curry goat. The curry goat was very salty sadly and uneatable., and my brother had the same experience with it when he went before me so that is their main drawback. However, the oxtail was pretty good and I heard their salmon is great as well. However, a bunch of stuff on their menu was not present when we went to dine there, which was a big disappointment because we had to keep switching our order. For the music and ambiance alone, though, I would recommend this place, along with if you order the right item."
10/6/2018,20181006,4,3.79,"We had an excellent time here... The drinks are the real deal.... Great atmosphere, laid back, chill and Nice. This is a hidden gem. I didn't have the food but I will try it next time."
10/12/2018,20181012,5,3.8,"Love love this place! The customer service is amazing and their food and drinks are to die for. I had the Rasta pasta with Jerk salmon and my husband had the Jerk Chicken and we cleaned our plates! My husband also had both the Prestige and Red Stripe beers and he really enjoyed both of them. Always ask for Camille the hostess/bartender, she is the sweetest!"
11/16/2018,20181116,5,3.81,I loved my food and the bartender ( I can't remember her name now; (2months later) But she was really pretty and upon engaging with me she learned I was visiting from out of town and she even offered so places to go out to hang out around the city . Very nice and helpful!!!!
11/24/2018,20181124,4,3.81,"Love the Rasta pasta! Don't get it with shrimp they only give 3-4 shrimp, but a great portion of chicken. The drinks were a little weak and small portions for the price. Really cute ambiance and the staff is friendly, I'd def recommend if you're in the area."
12/3/2018,20181203,1,3.79,"I ordered oxtails ($18) from here yesterday, paid prior to receiving my food and left a nice tip. For spending $25, you'd think I'd receive more than THREE dry oxtails. I couldn't believe it when I got home. This was my first time here and will definitely be my last after this experience. I understand it was late, but if someone would've just said ""we're running out of the oxtails"" I would've ordered something else. It was one thing to only receive three, but for the oxtail to also be dry and disgusting on top of that?!"
12/19/2018,20181219,5,3.8,This was my first time at this restaurant. Food was delicious.....Drinks were well created. Waitress/Bartender was super friendly an ensured that my double dates were well taken care of. The environment was quite chill and felt like having dinner at Auntie Karen's house in Trinidad. Will definitely add this to my list of retiring spots.
12/26/2018,20181226,5,3.81,Great food. Great customer service. Amazing time!! Environment made me feel like it was my 100th time visiting instead of my first.
12/29/2018,20181229,1,3.78,"Went to this restaurant today because my little brother wanted Jamaican food so bad and Kingston had great reviews.....however ....the service was horrible!! The place was so dark i thought they forgot to pay the light bill and on top of that the waitress/bartender didn't have a clue. I asked for a margarita she told me that this was her 3rd day and she didn't know how to make one, which means she probably doesn't even have a bartending license. I asked her to just give me henny and ginger, again she couldn't even make that( which i make at home)and what got me really pissed is that she kept quoting how this is her 3rd day like i should care ?? This is a business and that is extremely unprofessional to tell your customers. On top of that she went out of her way to try to make a Long Island for another customer yet i asked for something simple and she couldn't even do that. The Rasta pasta had no peppers at all and I've had my share to know their was no Rasta in that pasta! Also the ""peas and rice"" disgusting! Rice wasn't cooked all the way through and thier was no flavor and no peas only kidney beans...place gets 0 s . Never again and i will be spreading the word! Again horrible it's was not worth one damn dime !"
12/31/2018,20181231,5,3.79,"This is by far the best Jamaican food I have ever had in my entire life, EVER! I really don't think there is anything else to say. We ordered sooooo much food and sort of shared and it was the best decision ever. Walking by, it doesn't look like much but don't be fooled, the food will change ya life! Don't play tour self, eat here!"
1/9/2019,20190109,2,3.78,"The food is over powering. The amount of heat used doesn't allow you to enjoy the flavor. The ""Rasta Pasta"" is a sad knock off. It's sweet and what I assume are scotch bonnet peppers thrown in to add its heat. I've never seen a ""Rasta pasta"" like this and I've tried from Suede, Caribbean social, little ochie, and various other little mom and pops in Brooklyn. This place tried to be authentic at the expense of savoring the taste of the food. It got two stars because waitress was attentive and drinks were on point. This review is reflection of the chef not of the establishment itself."
1/19/2019,20190119,5,3.79,"I don't know why this place isn't busy. Probably hands down best West Indian spot in up town. Let's start w the jerk pork. Proper West Indian spot there is jerk pork. The jerk pork is moist and spicy and flavorful. You can tell the purveyors of this fine establishment are foodies cuz they don't skimp on the fat. Nothing goes well w jerk seasoning than charred pork fat. For you wannabe foodies try it out if you don't like it I feel bad for you, you're parents did a horrible job raising you. On to the akee and salt fish. They got most of the salt out of the cod and it's not salty at all. Most places half ass it and don't take most of the salt out. It's not too oily and it's delicious w the plantain tostones (I know that's Spanish but who gives a eff). Jerk chicken wings and ox tail were on point. But for the West Indians the jerk pork and akee salt fish should be enough for you to come thru. By the way their special drink which is sorrel and Wray and nephews is fire. And Shauna the bartender/server extraordinaire hooked up the steel and brash proper."
1/29/2019,20190129,1,3.76,"A friend and I decided to check this place out, two days ago. I was in the mood for some authentic jerk chicken. Nornally, we do have our authentic jerk chicken truck that we go to, but it was cold, and it was on the other side of town. So we decided to give this place a chance. On the way in, they were having a private party, but they were still open to the public. Our waitress / bartender was Camille, she was very nice, attentive, and had a nice smile. She recommended the jerk chicken, I was skeptical to try it, because I am Jamaican, and I know how jerk chicken should taste, but she said it was grilled, and had that smokey, flavor that I was going for. So I ordered that, it comes with rice and peas, and I ordered a side of mac and cheese. I also ordered the rum punch, which was great, it was flavorful, not too sweet, I tasted the rum, and it was refreshing. I liked it. Now, the food comes, the presentation is nice. The chicken looks appetizing, but, once I taste my food, it did not have that charcoal, Smokey, grilled taste I was expecting at all, I was very disappointed. I was more disappointed in myself because I knew that I should have went with my first option which was the jerk chicken from the truck. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese, the mac and cheese was the shape of a square.. it came out like a square.. weird, it was not cheesy, it was tough, and rice and peas was dry, and the sauce they're using for the jerk chicken it has a ginger taste. It's not the sauce I was expecting. Overall, best thing about my Kingston experience was my drink and my waitress."
2/18/2019,20190218,5,3.77,Must say todays brunch was simply beautiful. Great company and the food was delicious. I had the fish fesitval and was awesome. Keep the DJ because most brunches include a DJ. The music was beautiful. I'll be back for the next brunch. As a Brooklynite that have been uptown over 25 years I'll give y'all 5+. We had a fabulous time. Looking forward to the next one.
3/2/2019,20190302,5,3.79,"I had heard of this place a few times but never knew where it was. I stumbled up on it while walking down 116th and I'm glad I did. Everything was perfect. The food was prepared well, taste delicious, and the service felt warmly familiar. I had the oxtails and my friend had the red snapper. We shared one another's food and were satisfied with both dishes. Check them out."
3/31/2019,20190331,3,3.78,"The waitress there was on point--really sweet and attentive. As for food, I had the curry pot which came with roti and rice. The shrimp was not fresh -- it seemed that it was frozen shrimp from a bag. Getting fresh shrimp would enhance the dish tremendously. Additionally, the goat was full of tendons and was difficult to eat, and the chicken was dry mostly because it was breast meat. I think using bone-in chicken would be better--just how we make it back home. As a Caribbean girl, I enjoyed a taste of home, but I was disappointed and knew that it has the potential to be better. I want Kingston to win."
4/19/2019,20190419,1,3.75,Me and my girlfriend ordered oxtails via uber eats And the food was horrible. They were hard and burnt we called the restaurant directly to let them know how dissatisfied we were and the woman who answered the phone was clearly upset that we called to complain and told us to call uber eats and they'd give us a refund..
5/5/2019,20190505,4,3.75,"Wanted to try a new spot in the area was not disappointed. Great service I wish I could remember the bartender name but she was great, very personable. Price was good and drinks and food enjoyable. Good vibe there"
5/27/2019,20190527,1,3.73,"Amazing DJ. The crowd is dope and music is on point. It's similar to places like Woodland or Milk River in a sense that it's fun, but lacking in service. It seems under-staffed for events, but maybe this is the norm. We never got our food after waiting an hour and a half after ordering. We also did bottomless drinks and they waited almost half an hour to give us our first drinks. An hour later they told us the bottomless time was done. At this point we're already frustrated. I actually feel bad for the staff because they were very apoplectic and could only do so much. To make matters worse, on top of telling them MULTIPLE times that I wanted my card back my first drink, they proceeded to charge everything from the group to my card. This could be a great establishment if they ran it logically. They'll NEVER get my money again though. Next time I'll take the trip to Negril near W4."
5/31/2019,20190531,1,3.71,"We waited over an hour for food when there were only two other customers and it was not good at all. On top of that, the meal was pricey and the food quality does not stand up.On top of that the restaurant is very rude and loud in the neighborhood. I live nearby and music is always blasting until 3am on the weekends in the summer. The owner clearly does not respect the community or those who live around. Would not support or visit again."
6/17/2019,20190617,4,3.71,Food was really good. The drinks were nice. The staff is super friendly and professional. Great place overall.
6/18/2019,20190618,1,3.68,"Ok. I never give bad reviews because this is someone's Business.  But I have never had food as salty as I had here. Went with a grp of friends (ethnically diverse bunch)on a Sunday night. The place is called Kingston, so we went with hyped up expectations and man were we disappointed. The decor was cool and the server was great. We ordered separate appetizers and main courses, but everything was supremely salty. Perhaps that Sunday the kitchen staff was having a bad day. You decide.."
7/7/2019,20190707,3,3.68,"This place had a nice ambience and friendly staff, but the good was just ok. I wouldn't make a special trip, but I'd go if I lived in the neighborhood."
7/16/2019,20190716,1,3.66,"First it's not real Jamaican food. Two it was cold and not tasty at all. The AC didn't work. There was one person working including cooking the food, which I felt bad and didn't comply because of this. The drinks were nasty and pretty much just watered down. The atmosphere was dead and dark. I felt like I was at backyard bbq in Brooklyn on Labor Day weekend. They misquoted prices and charge ya something different. It sucks because it's hard to support a black owned business when they are lack luster."
7/16/2019,20190716,2,3.64,"Came here with 2 friends on a Tuesday night. It looks like they had 2 ppl working. A cook and 1 server. We made it in time for happy hour which ended at 7p. House drinks were supposed to be 6 but came out to 7. They charged extra for the juice in the cocktails $2. We ordered appetizers. The wings crab sandwiches and pork bites. The wings were cold. The pork bites were pretty good. This is my second time coming here. First was for brunch, both times service was slow and some food was cold. Won't be coming again."
7/16/2019,20190716,2,3.63,"Food was horrible. Drinks were weak. Service was meh. Went on a Tuesday for dinner and it was 1 person servicing the whole restaurant. Only could stay and eat throw the appetizers we order crabby sliders, Kingston wings, and jerk pork. All no's."
7/21/2019,20190721,3,3.62,The food was great. My only complaints were my jerk salmon burger came with a mayo sauce that wasn't listed on the menu And my friends Rasta pasta came overdone and over spicy. The salmon burger was delicious though once it was prepared to my liking. I would come again but it wouldn't be my first choice based on this experience.
7/21/2019,20190721,2,3.61,Had the Rasta Pasta. Wasn't impressed. There were some hard dried out pieces of pasta and it was a spicier Rasta Pasta than I'm used to. I actually had to send it back. I was still charged for it (50% of the menu price). Most restaurants are courteous and take it off.

7/25/2019,20190725,1,3.57,"I honestly really wanted to love Kingston. The whole vibe and energy was great when I walked in. The restaurant was practically empty so I figured I'd treat myself to dinner and sit by the bar. Boy was I wrong! I decided to order the jerk shrimp salad. With barely anyone dining in the restaurant (see photo of empty tables) I thought this would be a quick option. 15 minutes pass, no salad-- ok cool. 20 minutes pass, no salad -- fine. 30 minutes pass, still no salad -- now I'm hangry! 40 minutes pass, still no salad -- WTH! After 40 minutes, my salad is ready, but they put it to go, when I was clearly dining in. Finally, I receive my food, and after 2 bites I find a fly in my meal! Also, my salad didn't have tomatoes, and when I asked the bartender, she responded they actually don't use tomatoes at all in the restaurant. So why was it listed as an ingredient in the salad on the menu?? (See menu photo) When I told her it was on the menu, she responded ""oh sh*t""I really have a hard time trying to understand how a basic salad took 40 minutes to cook when the entire dining room was empty when I arrived. Granted, the bartender who assisted me was sweet, but didn't even offer to re-make the order. So now I just wasted 50 minutes of my time, and forced to go elsewhere to find something to eat.I was so done after this. Moral of the story, don't waste your time here. Management needs to do a better job at working on the quality of their food, and the speed of when it arrives to the tables."
7/28/2019,20190728,2,3.56,"Ambiance is good, food is bad. Had the oxtail, save your $18 and go to a Spanish restaurant, get the same thing for $9. This is not authentic Kingston food and I wish I'd pay attention to the other reviews. Fries were overly oily and the crab sliders tasted salty, not to mention the buns seemed to have been heated in the microwave (they were tough to bite into and chew). If you're looking for stewed oxtail (instead of fried and served with their oil for gravy) and coconut cooked rice and peas, this IS NOT the place."
8/8/2019,20190808,5,3.57,"Excellent food, I ordered the jerk chicken Rasta Pasta. Also ordered the Rum Punch. Staff is friendly and even though there was a bit of a wait on food, they gave us drinks on the house to make up for it!"
8/8/2019,20190808,5,3.58,I found this place because of an article about excellent food in Harlem and was not disappointed. I ordered the Jerk Chicken (carnival style) and a punch. Both were excellent. The chicken was perfectly cooked and well spiced with a moderate kick which was more than welcome. I came with two friends and we all had an excellent time.
8/11/2019,20190811,3,3.58,Nice quaint Jamaican spot. Love the area. Food was not too bad. Tried this spot during the Taste of Harlem food and culture. Jerk chicken had more flavor of pepper than jerk. Plantains were delish. Cabbage wasn't bad. Fruit punch could have been better if chilled. Friendly staff.
8/11/2019,20190811,4,3.58,Great restaurant; good vibes; super friendly staff and not to mention the food was great!!
8/16/2019,20190816,5,3.59,"This was some of the best Jamaican food I've had in a long time. The service was prompt, the music was lovely, and the waiter was friendly and attentive. Also, the DJ played all the right tunes, and on the right summer night, if you close your eyes, it feels just like Jamaica. I'd definitely recommend to all my friends. Lastly, the drinks are strong and tasty, just the way I like it. It's the best spot for a weekend night, with comforting and intimate vibes."
9/1/2019,20190901,5,3.6,Great customer service and food. Recommend to everyone in search of good eats.
9/27/2019,20190927,5,3.62,Food (especially the oxtail) was absolutely amazing. The vibe was chill and welcoming. Staff was very accommodating for our large group and recommended amazing drinks and plates to order. This is a great place for a date or even hanging out with a large group of people. We will definitely be back and try more meals and drinks. Everyone come through and enjoy!!
10/9/2019,20191009,5,3.63,The service was very slow but the food and the cocktails were definitely worth the wait. Moving forward I think I will continue coming back to Kingston whenever I am in town.
10/12/2019,20191012,1,3.61,"Kingston, you are horrible neighbors. The volume that you blast your music at--well after midnight--is unbelievably loud (let alone illegal). And no one will even answer your phone. Selfish and self-serving."
11/2/2019,20191102,1,3.59,"I went to this restaurant with friends and it was rather empty so it took about 2-5 minutes to be seated. There was only one menu on the table and after about 10 minutes the waitress came by and gave us two more menus. We ordered appetizers and a few side dishes and drinks. The drinks were good, however this is when things took a turn south our food started to come out and we were not too pleased the Mac and cheese was bland, the festival was overdone and we mentioned to the waitress how the jerk pork and wings was entirely too spicy it was not flavorful it tasted as if someone just dropped 10 scotch bonnet peppers and called it jerk it was not flavorful. She proceeded to question what our nationality (our background which we all are West Indian but who wants pure spice) as if to justify the fact that the jerk pork and wings were simply not good. So then when we sent the pork back we asked for an order of fries which took about 20 mins and which they double fried and they were super oily. The bartender came by to grab our empty pitcher not asking did we need another or are we done. Not once did she come back to check on us to see if we wanted more drink or needed anything else she attended to everyone else in the restaurant. When we finally got her attention for the drinks she had an attitude and was rolling her eyes while taking our order. When it came time for the bill we left a mediocre tip because we were unhappy with the service and food. Soon after she then sent the bartender to ask why we left such a bad tip all while she was listening and looking at us from the bar. I will never step foot in Kingston again the service is subpar and the food is terrible."
11/21/2019,20191121,5,3.6,This is definitely my go too Caribbean restaurant! The food is amazing and the drinks are top notch ! The team takes care of you and leaves the restaurant spotless ! I took my girl there for a date night and we're definitely going to be returning frequently ! Stay blessed Kingston and keep up the good work .
11/21/2019,20191121,5,3.61,"Much, much needed local spot, but has a lot more to offer. Great place to stop by for a few drinks - the staff has been wonderful since the day they opened - and fills a nice brunch and late night niche for the block too. For drinks, highly recommend the house special, which will knock you on your ass, and the pork bites for a snack. Don't be scared off when they have music/djs - they're actually chill and good. Skip the rum flight, spend all your money on wray & nephew shots, call out of work tomorrow, and come back next week."
11/21/2019,20191121,5,3.62,"This is honestly my favorite Jamaican restaurant around. The food is authentic and delicious. The people there are extremely attentive and friendly. It's very chill if you just wanna hang out and have a conversation with friends or S.O. Not to mention, their happy hour prices are unbeatable. This place doesn't disappoint. Make sure to try the Rasta Pasta (extra spicy!!!) and an island rum punch. You won't regret coming in."
11/23/2019,20191123,4,3.62,Very low key spot. The live band is full of life and energy but not too overbearing. Drinks and food are delicious. If you're looking for a vibe on a Saturday night then this is your place. Reasonable happy hour prices as well.
11/23/2019,20191123,5,3.63,This place was beautiful. Food was amazing.Drinks were to die for. Atmosphere was intimate yet laidback. My bartender (Ivory) was not only beautiful but kind and attentive too. Loved my drinks. Diggin this vibe. My new weekend hot spot !!!
11/23/2019,20191123,5,3.64,This spot was great for me and my girl who needed a good drink on a Saturday night. The live band and the ambiance put us in a calm yet great mood on a Saturday night. Their drink specials definitely had us feeling extra good by the time we left. I will definitely be back soon!!!!

11/27/2019,20191127,4,3.65,"Went on a Wednesday night, the Atmosphere was quiet, nice and chilled! I had the shrimp Rasta pasta I enjoyed it! The Rum punch was on point! Did the pitcher, between 2 people we got 3 drinks each which was great for price. I would definitely recommend trying it out"

12/1/2019,20191201,1,3.64,"I'm giving one star because the drinks were good; however, the food was probably the worst Caribbean food I've ever had. I cannot stress how under seasoned and bland the cabbage and rice and peas were. My oxtails were cooked well but flavor was severely lacking. The other person with me said their oxtails were like rubber. It was like there cooked the oxtails and poured browning on them.. there was no flavor. Sadly, the best thing that I ate during my brunch there were the plantains. I should've known something was up when I walked into a nearly empty establishment. A little seasoning and some gravy goes a looooong way. If you do decide to come here, just go for the drinks. You'll get better food anywhere else, I promise you."

12/7/2019,20191207,4,3.62,"Walked past this spot in Harlem and decided to check it out! It's fairly small inside with a nice dim vibe, and played good reggae the whole time. Our waitress Roxanna was really sweet and attentive! We ordered the jerk chicken meal, a side of plantains, and a side of Mac and cheese. We also ordered their Kingston wings which were just jerk wings. The jerk chicken was nice and tender and fell off the bone as it should. I'm usually a fan of a crispier, dry rub type jerk, and theirs is more sauce based, but it had a nice flavor and heat. The Mac and cheese was definitely solid and the plantains were cooked perfectly and sweet. The rice and peas was slightly dry, certainly not the best I have had, but overall it was a great meal! We would come back"
12/10/2019,20191210,1,3.61,"I was in from out of town a special found this restaurant on Yelp...I didn't read the reviews because I don't like to be influenced by others...I was very disappointed, the oxtails were dry and had no flavor, I asked for gravy on the rice and it was dry. the cabbage was tough and it too didn't have any taste. Plus I had to wait 20 minutes for my to go order...now you know oxtails have to cook for hours so they were not made to order...why did it take so long to put them in a dish and paper bag."

No sangria, no wine, no coke, no chicken. I ended up ordering a shrimp Cesar salad, to drink I had whiskey and ginger beer. My cousin had the shrimp Rasta pasta and same drink. The jerk shrimp was flavored well and had a nice kick. The pasta on the other hand had a sweet taste to it, which threw us both off lol. I may go back again, I think they just had a bad night."

9/10/2020,20200910,5,3.64,Who knew!!! Last night I ordered take out from this little gem in my neighborhood. My Jerk Salmon was top of the line! It was nice and spicy without being over the top and the peas and rice were a delight - nicely spiced with cardamom. Accolades to this chef! I will be a regular customer from now on.
1/22/2021,20210122,5,3.65,"I love this place. The food is authentic, the vibe is perfect and the staff is so nice. The rum punch is one of the best I've ever had from a restaurant and if you order jerk anything you won't be mad. My favorite is the jerk salmon!! Oh em gee. Perfectly grilled and perfectly jerked and spiced...without being over cooked. The fact that it's intimate makes it even better."
10/11/2021,20211011,5,3.66,The food fresh and mimosa. Is on point indeed the location is like a hide away as well in Harlem
2/11/2022,20220211,3,3.65,"Go here for great strong drinks, preferably after you had dinner elsewhere in the neighborhood. I ate here twice but both time the portions were small with mostly bones. My friend's appetizer tasted like they were just heated up with microwave after sitting allday. My friends and Ioved the cozy vibe, drinks and music but told ourselves no more food from here. Harlem is getting gentrified nowadays so we can understand the price to catch up with the rent...but patrons should never leave the restaurant hungry! As everyone wrote, drinks are legit & amazing :)"
4/8/2022,20220408,3,3.65,The jerk chicken was pretty good. The spice and flavor were balanced. The curry goat could have been better to say the least. Drinks were good and got me tipsy but everything felt overpriced since the food was just good and not great. Nice service. I wondered why the food was prepackaged though.
6/11/2022,20220611,2,3.64,"Ordered through UberEats thinking I would get authentic Jamaican cuisine, WRONG! Ordered a jerk chicken with rice & peas with EXTRA jerk sauce on the side (willing to pay extra), as well as sauce on the chicken and rice. The only positive outcome was the extra jerk sauce I requested in my order. Which was good because the food was so dry. I received one piece of jerk chicken. The chicken tasted stale and tasteless. The rice was hard like it was stale- sitting out for a long time. Definitely not appetizing. There was more salad than rice which I'm not sure how to feel about. Also didn't get any utensils upon arrival. Not even a napkin and I would definitely not recommend, especially through any app. Rather go in person so I can correct my order and give personal feedback. They only received 2 stars because my order arrived 6 minutes earlier AND they understood HALF of my requests with the sauce on the food. Surely a disappointment. Definitely need to change cooks!"
