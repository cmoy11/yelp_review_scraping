It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."

I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes.

1/10/2021,20210110,3,3.44,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."

3/28/2021,20210328,4,3.43,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.

I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.

7/20/2021,20210720,4,3.57,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese) I forgot but we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"

We liked what we had, including the amazing cookies that I swear don't taste like they are missing anything. I wasn't thrilled with the ""chopped burger"" that I ordered because I'm a burger aficionado and it was very different than I expected. It was good but not the same. I liked my daughter's dish better (A po'boy sandwich). It took a little longer than expected but in general it was good. Id definitely go back."

We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious.
