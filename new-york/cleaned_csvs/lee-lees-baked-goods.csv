5/26/2007,20070526,4,4.0,"This place is great. They have all sort's of cakes. Layer, carrot, pound, cheese , special occasion and wedding. All types of pies, My personal favorite is the Lemon Iced Box. Standard pastries, cookies, even biscuits and rolls. For $3.50 could can get a smoke Turkey and cheese sandwich. There's a place to sit or you can take it with you. Slice all items are available by the slice it's the perfect place to pop in for a treat. The Rugelach is a local favorite and a dozen top's off a dinner like no body's business."
7/23/2008,20080723,2,3.0,Every time I swing by to pick something up they are closed.  Perhaps they need to expand their business hours. It's hard to support a business you can get into.
10/9/2008,20081009,4,3.33,"They were remodeling this summer, so the place had been closed for a while. But now that they're open, it's totally worth a visit. Hands down the best Rugelach I've ever tasted (no disrespect to my Bubbeh or other Jewish Grandmas out there). Buttery and tasty: probably not the healthiest dessert around, but it will surely bring a smile to your face!Haven't tried any of their other desserts, as I'm always tempted to just get the Rugelach ... but someday I will test and report."
3/6/2009,20090306,3,3.25,"This is probably Harlem's best rugelach. Of course, I'm not sure how much street cred that gives the place. Living in [and eating my way through] Harlem, this is the first time I've stumbled across the pastry of Jewish Ashkenazic origin. So, as far as I know, it's the ONLY place in Harlem to buy rugelach. Feel free to e-mail me if I'm wrong. Actually, please do.Although this does not necessitate expertise - like the cookie itself - I am too of Jewish Ashkenazic origin. So, let me preface my review with the following statements: I've eaten my way in rugelach across Williamsburg [go to greens for the ""babka"" (mind you, it's not actually babke - it's kokosh), NOT the rugelach!] and Boro Park. I've tried it in the shukkim [markets] all over Israel. I've sat down and snacked on them with the winter birds of the temperate Boca Raton [bridge, anyone?]. My grandparents pushed rugelach on me like martinis on WASPs. I know my rugelach.So, I was excited to try the ""Rugelach by a brother."" Very excited, actually.It was decent. The outside was buttery and soft without being overly flaky or extremely chewy [a crisp finish, if you will]. Solid texture.  But the flavor? It wasn't quite sweet enough for me - maybe they needed some vanilla. I tried both the standard and the chocolate, and found the fruitiness overpowered the flavors of the cinnamon, sugar, nuts, and chocolate [clearly in the chocolate variety]. These little babies need nurturing and balance.In addition, chocolate rugelach and cinnamon rugelach were not born equally. They should taste different. They have different notes to stress! The chocolate rugelach was too reminiscent of the cinnamon - with a chocolate coating. Oddly though, the chocolate rugelach was noticeably chewier than the cinnamon.Would I go here again if I was craving rugelach? Maybe. It's a convenient location. But, if I do get the craving, I'll probably just trek down to Zabar's. [Or follow Sam P's advice and go to Epicure in the m-i-a.]"
3/24/2009,20090324,4,3.4,"If you are looking for great customer service then you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for homemade, quality baked products then this is the right place for you! Don't get me wrong, it's not that the owner is unfriendly, just busy and focused on his craft most of the time. Mr. Lee is a one man operation run by a dedicated gentleman with a passion for baking. You might have to wait a while for him to get to you but when he does it is well worth the wait. The rugelach are about 40 cents a piece and if Mr. Lee is in a generous mood (and you've shown him your best side) he might just slip a few extra pieces into your bag! There is also lemon cake, carrot, cake, and more. Pop in next time you are in the area."
4/20/2009,20090420,3,3.33,"i had the chocolate mousse cake which was good. chocolate cake + chocolate mousse is pretty hard to mess up so it wouldnt be fair to give anymore than 3 stars. something about the place is just not inviting but i didnt care, i had to give it a try at least once. reading the other reviews i guess i'd probably give it more stars if i actually ate rugelach. not sure what its ""supposed"" to taste like but everytime ive tried it ive hated it.  im not going to try it again---nope--not even from a black bakery in harlem. sorry, cant do it."
5/9/2009,20090509,4,3.43,Not a fan of rugelah so don't care but love this shop and support it. It's a grab bag for walk ins but the upside down pineapple cake is the closest to the caribe version I've had in the States. Yum
10/3/2009,20091003,3,3.38,"I got 4 rugelach for a little over $2 so maybe Mr. Lee jacked up the prices. The regular ones were much tastier than the chocolate drizzled ones but DAMN the rugelachs were delicious. If it were cheaper, the rugelachs would get 4 stars for sure."
3/27/2010,20100327,5,3.56,"Lee Lees is a slice of heaven in Harlem. Love, Love, Love Lee Lees. His red velvet cake is my family's favorite; it is now the only birthday cake we ever have. His rugelach are amazingly good -- flaky, just sweet enough... much better than Zabars -- and much less expensive. (And they freeze well-- we buy by the dozen and freeze them.) Carrot and chocolate cakes are delicious. The yellow cake can be a little dry--it's the only one of his products I'm not crazy about. And ""Mr Lee"" is one of the sweetest guys you'll ever meet. Lee Lees is the only business I've ever seen where his customers are constantly telling him to charge more for his food. The birthday cakes are the best bargain you'll find among NY bakeries, as well as the most delicious."
7/20/2010,20100720,5,3.7,"On a sidestreet in Harlem is NYC is a still undiscovered spot for the BEST rugleach. Mr. Lee Lee's bakery is a throwback to the days of yore, when small, quaint places run by independent shop-owners who poured their soul into their product abounded. And make no mistake, this gentleman bakes his rugelach with love, from the crispy, flaky melt in your mouth crust to the nuts and chewy raisins stuffed inside each roll that have your tastebuds screaming --this is one terrific cookie. This is rugelach for those who scoff at calories, diets, who have scoured the earth for good rugelach and have been disappointed. I have read every review on rugelach in NYC and after eating Mr. Lee Lee's cookie, knew I had finally been granted entry to rugelach heaven. Walk two short blocks from the train- station to this charming nook and you will be transported to another decade where time stands still and the only hum you hear will be the purr from your stomach. I was there one afternoon and three older ladies were just whiling away the time, sipping tea and eating their cake. Mr. Lee Lee makes rugelach in both chocolate and raisin; get both, savor the first, be addicted to the raisin. He also bakes Southern style cakes and has a Southern breakfast, with grits. Sadly, Mr. Lee had closed down recently due to a lack of pedestrian traffic. He re-opened after local furor--and many tears from those stomachs that were bereft of his amazing cookie. Put this rugelach artist on the map finally. Your belly will growl with pleasure and you will understand what soul food really means.A word of advice-the master takes his time. Call before you go to make sure he has rugelach. He does not mass produce. He coddles each piece to perfection. So call ahead and ask him to put aside some rugelach if you don't live in the nabe."

7/22/2010,20100722,5,3.92,"Agreed! The homemade ginger beer and sorrel are fantastic as well. They are the nicest people - I called to see if they were still open the other night, just before 8pm. Apparently they were about to close but they offered to stay for 15 min so that I could stop by and pick up a few things."
9/19/2010,20100919,5,4.0,"Lee Lee's is one of the older institutions in Harlem that can be overlooked by newer, flashier establishments in the neighborhood. As said in many posts, the rugelach here is amazing. The pound cake reminds me of my Grandmother's pound cake; the cake it's dense and the top is crispy. One can go in expecting to buy rugelach, and come out with scones, a characteristic I feel is unique, and unlike the mass-producing chain bakeries that have their goods delivered from an off-site factory. I just picked up a cupcake this afternoon!"
11/6/2010,20101106,5,4.07,"When the African American woman at the store around the corner told me I should go to Lee Lee's for ""arugalah,"" I was seriously suspicious, but my shopping companion insisted we try.  Truly terrific rugelach. My great grandmother would have been impressed."
12/24/2010,20101224,5,4.13,"We can't speak to the rest of the baked goods--the bread pudding looked tempting--but the rugelach is hands down the best these Ashkenazi Jews have ever had. We include as comperanda Zabar's, the late and lamented Gertel's, and some very tasty 'rugalitos' from an excellent (Dominican?) bakery under the elevated subway at 225th Street. Perfect texture--flaky, slightly crunchy outside--caramelized raisins--some kind of sublime cinnamony goo nestled within. Worth a trip."
4/2/2011,20110402,5,4.19,"Seriously amazing rugelach. All of the flavors are delicious, but the chocolate and raspberry border on life-changing. I can't eat rugelach anywhere else now. And the feel of the shop is like going back in time. I love it here.(Note: in the same storefront is Seasoned Vegan, which is also incredibly delicious, whether you're vegan or not!)"
6/10/2011,20110610,5,4.24,Great shop with delicious treats and a friendly staff. It is also a bonus that it is right across the street from my hair salon! Totally worth the visit!
10/17/2011,20111017,5,4.28,Rugelach...Rugelach...RUGELACH!I am in no way a rugelach connoisseur - in fact i was recently introduced to Rugelach from Lee Lee's at a dinner party. This was a trans-formative moment - so much so this Brooklynite had to track down the exact location and has made several treks up to Harlem to get the rugelach for any & every gathering......do yourself a favor and try it out...it will change your life...My favorite is the chocolate - but I am never left unsatisfied. This is a must try!
11/13/2011,20111113,5,4.32,Agree with other reviewers! Great place! Very nice people! Awesome Rugelach!
11/26/2011,20111126,5,4.35,"In honor of Small Business Saturday, I'm writing a review of one of my favorite little New York gems! Although I live in Chicago, my husband and I both try our best to make the trek out to Harlem for Mr. Lee Lee's wonderful rugelach when we are in town for the holidays. We've turned more than a few friends (both New Yorkers and out of town folks!) onto this buttery sweet goodness. Make sure to call in advance to see if there are any still around... They're so good that they go fast!"
12/21/2011,20111221,5,4.38,"The rugelach here is really good! There are multiple flavors: cinnamon and chocolate. One of them has nuts (I think the cinnamon does).I look forward to trying their other culinary delights!At certain times of the day, they run out of stuff, but they are always baking."
2/12/2012,20120212,3,4.32,"The store certainly has that neighborhood-y feel to the place. The operations are low key and the selection is nice and simple. Sadly, the quality of the goods are very mediocre.Everything here is suppose to be made with butter, but I could not taste it. Yes, butter is suppose to have a taste. I tried the rugelach, apple pie, the cookies, and the both types of rugelach. The only thing I enjoyed was the carrot muffin, not for the taste, but for its texture; crunchy on top, soft on bottom. The rugelach had the worst performance, which was ironic since this was the most well known item from this bakery.Perhaps it's famous because of its tag line 'Rugelach from a brother'. I'd say people just love the 'idea' of this place rather than the goods sold here.Overall, highly disappointed... I like supporting small businesses, but golly, I would like to know that it's made with quality. This place has been open for 9 years, and the owner has been a baker in Harlem for a good 30 years. I mean... that's impressive and all, but.... again. I am being wowed by the shop's history, not from the rugelach.The store closed business sometime in 2010 but reopened with the help of community support. Yea, the people in the neighborhood are nice and very supportive, hence with all the very positive reviews over here. But for a fellow like me who travels an hour to taste a special treat, it certainly wasn't worth my trip.You guys are nice people, and Mr. Smalls himself is a laid back guy, too. But... Yeah. That's all I can say..."
2/21/2012,20120221,5,4.35,"The only rugelach they had the day I went was apricot, but it definitely left me wanting more. Delicious and fresh, in a cute, cozy shop to boot. Definitely worth a visit."
3/16/2012,20120316,5,4.38,"Love, Love Love!!!! We live only a few blocks down this small bakery. I always pass by by but never have cash (they dont accept cards)....until this past wednesday!!! The Rugelach is the best we've ever had. We also got some chocolate chip cookies (YUM), and a yellow cake with chocolate glaze (heaven). The rugelach is a little pricey ($1a piece) but so worth it. Cant wait to try their other goodies."
3/23/2012,20120323,5,4.4,"As a baker who cut my teeth on Bread & Circus (Whole Foods now) very decent rugelach in Cambridge, MA I was excited to hear that a mere block and a half from my sister's apt was rumored to be the best little rugelach bakery in Manhattan. Mr Lee Lee does not keep regular hours but I was fortunate enough to find his shop open for business, and so I bought 2 dozen of the flavor of the day that had just come out of the oven and were still warm. What a delight! Sweet but not too sweet, buttery, crunchy and chewy all at the same time, filled with just the right balance of fruit to pastry. Immediately transported me back to childhood memories of my Scottish grandmother's kitchen, who would roll up her homemade pie crust scraps with cinnamon, sugar and a bit of preserves for us to snack on when they came out of the oven. OK New Yorkers and folks in town for a visit, get thee to Lee Lee's and I guarantee it will be worth the trip!"
3/27/2012,20120327,4,4.38,"Okay, I'm a convert. While initially skeptical that I would find delicious rugelach in Harlem, my taste buds have convinced me otherwise. The dough is light and flaky. There's a slight crunch of caramelized sugars on the edges. The insides are moist, studded with raisins.I've never been a huge rugelach fan; but then again my memories of them are of a small, hard, chewy puck. This is anything but. Definitely recommended."
4/6/2012,20120406,5,4.41,Perhaps the best example of my favorite kind of business: Choose one thing and do it right. I got the last of the chocolate rugelach this afternoon and Lee had to close the door behind me until more batches come out of the oven. Sneaked one before my friends come over for dinner - Dee Freaking Licious.
5/16/2012,20120516,5,4.43,"The rugelach is heavenly! I stumbled upon this little shop while walking in the neighborhood. I was about to walk past when the smell lured me in. I bought two rugelach and tried one on my way home. I was oh so tempted to turn around and walk 6 blocks back to get more! They are so good! Warm, moist, buttery. Everything that a typical rugelach should have but lacks."
8/22/2012,20120822,5,4.45,"A true jewel in harlem , the reviews don't lie on this one this is a must go to if you're in the area treat yourself don't cheat yourself."
1/25/2013,20130125,5,4.47,"Best rugelach I've had - buttery, flakey, perfect! My mother-in-law who is a superb cook and baker loves Lee Lee's rugelach - she always says she can taste they've been made with real butter. I've had both the apricot and chocolate drizzled rugelach. Though I love both, the chocolate ones are probably the yummiest baked goods I've ever had. I've tried Lee Lee's other baked goods, and his chocolate chip cookies and honey nut cake are also favorites. This place is definitely worth the trip if you don't live in the neighborhood, but it looks like from Lee Lee's website you can now mail order his delicious rugelach."
4/18/2013,20130418,5,4.48,"the kind of place you would never enter unless someone told you to do so. As soon as I saw the almost empty counter I knew I was in the right place This is the kind of place that only has a few items. When I got there they only had a few rugelach and some kind of white cookies. They looked ugly, not like those cute little rugelach that seem croissants that usually stand elegantly close to baked to perfection shiny cupcakes. No, these are unshaped, all different, some are darker, you know that they are completely handmade. Ok. Then, price.1$ each. What? one dollar for an ugly tiny (tiny!) rugelach? They must have been made out of gold. They are. What you pay it is totally worth it. And you know you are not paying for the place (they didn't even have the lights on), or the presentation of the item. The whole dollar is on the quality and flavor. And I would have payed more."
4/21/2013,20130421,5,4.5,"I didn't know that I liked rugelach! Wow, incredibly buttery, cinnamony and moist. Also, and I've been a Make My Cake devotee for years, but Lee Lee's red velvet is better. The cake is moist, the frosting has a nice cream cheese tang and isn't overly sweet... wow. If I lived in Harlem, it would be a serious problem to live close to Lee Lee's. Also, you can't beat the friendly, familial feeling of the place."
4/21/2013,20130421,5,4.52,Amazing red velvet cake. So moist and great frosting. Also the rugelach is great as well. This place is also a pillar of the community. I think the son was the one we spoke to. He was so nice and had a real pride in his work.
5/2/2013,20130502,1,4.41,"No wonder this place is going out of business....Terrible customer service, no assortment and the cookies were rock hard...ghetto"
5/20/2013,20130520,5,4.43,I went to NYC to visit my cousin this past weekend and she told me I had to try this place. When we walked in it smelled literally like all that was good and yummy in the world and the owner Mr. Lee was serving the pastries himself. The two people in front of us insisted that my cousin have me try to chocolate and the apricot rugelach. Literally these were the best desserts I have had in a LONG time. I will be working hard this week in the gym to burn that off but it is welllll worth it!
5/29/2013,20130529,1,4.33,"I kept hearing that this place had the best rugelach in all of Harlem. Never having rugelach before, I decided I might as well give it a try. Let me just say, if this was the ""best"".... then I certainly don't want to try the rest. They didn't have the chocolate ones on the day that I went so I got what I believe to be apricot. It had a very distinct taste - burnt that is! I didn't like it at all. Also, at $1/pc, the tiny size is a complete rip off. They allegedly open at 9 am. However, when I went in at 11 am, they looked like they just walked in. I had to wait 10 minutes for them to come out of the oven. Hind-site being 20/20, I should have just left when I had the chance. On a different day, I decided to give them another try. Obviously first impressions are indeed lasting impressions because they disappointed me again. This time I tried their chocolate chip cookies, that were 3 for $1. Again, they were tiny.... and rock hard. Mr. Lee, I'm sorry. I gave your establishment a chance. Two in fact, and I was disappointed on both occassions. I recommend getting better help in the front- because the ladies are not too friendly. Will not be returning"
6/15/2013,20130615,1,4.24,"I heard a lot about the rugelachs at this place so I decided to give it a try....I didn't like it...at all. It tasted burnt, it was hard and extremely overpriced. $1 for a tiny pastry the size of an Oreo seemed a little much. The staff was not inviting and the owner seemed a little mean. I won't be returning."
8/13/2013,20130813,5,4.26,"Right now, my mouth is full of the best rugelach I've ever eaten. I was skeptical - I always am - of others' claims that the city's finest is to be found on 118th Street in Harlem. So I biked up there to find out. Lee Lee's is nothing more that an almost empty display case, a few battered chairs and a table or two. On one of them sits a computer that will soon be eligible for an Antiques Roadshow appraisal. The color scheme is an aggressive red and black. Not conducive for lingering to enjoy a pastry.Frankly, I was disappointed to find just a couple of sheet pans of rugelach and a few slices of cake in plastic clamshells. And the rugelach was only one flavor: apricot. I'm not wild about dried fruit, so only ordered one piece.The first bite was a revelation. The rugelach was not overly sweet, just sugary and buttery and nutty. The outside was crackly and the inside soft. Perfect in every way.I ordered three more. They're all gone. Guess I will be going back tomorrow."
8/29/2013,20130829,5,4.28,"Deelish!Mr. Lee is an incredible baker and citizen. I do believe Mr Lee had to raise rugelach pricing, but if you think about how much pleasure (and calories) is contained within each roog, the cost is reasonable. Also, this is a local small business and the baking is done on-site. Haters--of course you can get a mass-market cookie elsewhere for cheaper, but that's a matter of personal priorities. On quality and value, Lee Lee's is beyond reproach in my book."
9/15/2013,20130915,3,4.25,"This is in my neighborhood but it's a little hidden so I'd never been. I found it searching for dessert on Yelp and came in to get a little dessert to bring to a dinner I was going to. I went in Saturday around 4pm. There was a case with some yummy looking chocolate rugelach and some various cakes. I asked him if that was the only flavor and he said he had some original ones in the back. I took 6 of each kind. I also got a piece of choc/vanilla cake with coconut frosting.The total was $14 which is a bit steep. I did read that the rugelach was $1/piece but you would think you'd get a discount for a dozen. I guess not...oh well. I wasn't too worried though, figured it would be worth it.The outside of the rugelach was flakey and fell apart. The chocolate was amazing. The inside was chewy and soft. It was a good piece of rugelach. It's different than what I've had before but very good. The original (apricot) was very good. Everyone at the dinner thought it was the better one, even those who don't normally like apricot. I think everyone else liked them better than I did. I want to come back earlier in the day and get them when they are fresh. And the cake? Yum. The cake itself was moist and the icing was pretty sweet but I love it that way. I'll be back seeking freshly baked rugelach! Maybe next weekend..."
9/23/2013,20130923,4,4.24,"Let me tell you about the time my inner fat kid followed her nose to the greatest little gem in Harlem.I was walking about the neighborhood early one morning when all of a sudden, the most delicious smell stopped me in my tracks. Mouth watering, I scanned the apartment building in front of me, envious at whoever was housing a little Keebler elf and being treated to breakfast. Because I was insistent that this was not the smell of a mere mortal's Sunday morning cooking, I decided to literally sniff out the source.Alternating between deeply inhaling and taking quick sniffs, I found myself rounding the corner and stumbling upon a tiny little darkened store front- almost like a grown-up lemonade stand if you will. Inside was a friendly-looking man who chuckled when I asked him, ""May I please try one of whatever smells so good outside?""Like a good business man, he bagged up a little bar of rugelach, handed it to me, winked and said, ""The first taste is free."" I stood on the street corner and popped the innocent-looking nugget into my mouth. Suddenly my mouth was filled with a symphony of flavours: cinnamon, buttery, nutty, happiness. I now frequently find myself ducking into the small storefront, quickly sliding a dollar across the counter in exchange for a tiny slice of Heaven. Sometimes I'll pick up a few bars for when I'm meeting friends for brunch so that we can share the goodness after mimosas and eggs benedict. Food is love and Lee Lee's Baked Goods are the perfect little treats for the most special people in your life (you know, the ones that support your $1 rugelach addiction)."
12/20/2013,20131220,5,4.26,"This place is an adorable mom and pop bakery!Never had a rugelach before, but definitely enjoyed it and will def come back for more. Had their chocolate chip cookies, 3 for a $1, very good! It's a tiny place, can't really sit down. But there is something just cozy about this place to me.Try it out!"
2/19/2014,20140219,4,4.26,"I come here mainly for the rugelach which is excellent! Chocolate, original, doesn't matter.. just load up and take them home. They run about a buck a pop. The people that work here are great. Always nice, they always greet you and are never impatient. One guy even remembered me and spoke in passing around the neighborhood. I definitely recommend supporting the great small business"
4/6/2014,20140406,4,4.25,I give it a 4 for the hometown feel and service. Maybe I'm not the biggest rugelach fan but they were good.
4/6/2014,20140406,5,4.27,"Love this place, my 1 bakery. Rugelach is the best in the city! Cookies are also good 3 for $1. I recommend the pound cake it is delicious."
5/4/2014,20140504,5,4.28,"I've been staying on 116th street for the past week and only on the final day of my visit, and by chance, did I find this little bakery. The rugelach is fantastic, nicely browned and with a wonderful tender crispness. Great biscuits too. And the proprietor and his son are lovely people. I only wish I'd found them sooner..."
5/8/2014,20140508,5,4.3,"WOW.... wow ....WOW. I started giving LeeLee's rugelach as a gift for friends of our company. The recipients were raving, so I continued giving them out. I only just ordered some for my own office and WOW. It's really amazing. This is the best rugelach I've ever had ... hands down, amazing and rich (and I'm a lifelong New Yorker... I've had a lot of rugelach). I'll never look at rugelach the same way again! And Lee delivered them himself -- I felt like I was meeting a star!"
5/10/2014,20140510,5,4.31,"The Rugelach is the BEST I've ever had and I have had a lot!People from all over converge to buy these tasty treats and after one bite you will see why. The prices are PHENOMENAL and coupled with top tier customer service this has become the go to bakery and they ship too!Lee Lee's Baked Goods, a little piece of heaven!"
6/13/2014,20140613,5,4.33,Family owned and Lee Lee is still baking everything himself in the kitchen. The mini sweet potato pies are worth every bite and they sell out very quickly!
8/4/2014,20140804,5,4.34,This is one of those places you're very happy to get acquainted with. Greeted with a genuine smile and a sample of their best seller. Definitely a contender for best uptown pastries
8/9/2014,20140809,5,4.35,"Lee Lee's is a no-frills bakery with a limited selection. The inventory fluctuates day to day with a few staples you can count on finding, like the famous rugelach and tasty scones. It's a small operation so things sell out throughout the day, but they always have a smattering of treats to make your visit worthwhile.The rugelach are atypical, which adds to their distinct appeal. Unlike the traditional crumbly jelly roll style I've come to love from kosher bakeries Mr. Lee Lee's beautiful recipe is nutty and crisp, not unlike fine Italian cookies. Prices are extremely competitive, especially in this pocket of Harlem. Fancier French places dot the area, but you can take home a sack of conversation worthy pastries from Lee Lee's for about $10. Don't miss the scones, and unless you can't resist skip the cinnamon rolls as they're the sole disappointment at this heartwarming (and potentially heart-stopping) establishment."
8/9/2014,20140809,5,4.37,Lee Lee's makes the most delicious ruggelach. We especially like the apricot flavor. Definitely worth a trip to pick some of these up!
8/24/2014,20140824,5,4.38,"H: ""Can we have a chocolate rugelach please?""Lee-Lee: ""No, only apricot left.""H: (stares at the last piece of rugelach under the glass dome and contemplates how different apricot is from chocolate)H: ""Okay, we'll take an apricot.""Lee-Lee: ""We might have chocolate tomorrow,"" she glances to a wall for a response, ""maybe tomorrow.""One dollar later, on the sidewalk outside the Rite-Aid, we unwrap the wax paper back, take a bite of the beautifully cinnamon and sugar dusted rugelach, taste the buttery crunch followed by the tender pastry inside, dotted with giant raisins and sweet apricot.We exclaim how we had no idea what rugelach was, but if this was rugelach, we could no longer live without it.I'll be back tomorrow."
8/26/2014,20140826,5,4.39,"If you are anywhere near this bakery and wondering where that delectable aroma is coming from, it is Mr. Lee's delicious cooking--better yet, the ""lightning"" is even better than the ""thunder."" Mr. Lee and his family are all so nice and hospitable. Definitely one of my favorite bakeries in NYC, if not the USA."
10/2/2014,20141002,5,4.4,I have been having Mr. Lee's Rugelach for over 2 yeas and every time I have it it is just as amazing as the first time. I have had some good rugelach nationally and abroad and this is just a WOW factor. Have it with your tea or coffee and you will become an addict as well.

1/5/2015,20150105,4,4.41,"The rugelach is real good. Tiny little spot with a very small selection, but it's definitely a gem. They let you try some of their stuff completely free before you even buy anything, that's how confident they are that you'll like it - and they're right!"
2/7/2015,20150207,5,4.42,"My favorite bakery in America. Period. The staff are incredibly friendly, and sometimes they sneak me free goodies! They also have THE MOST AMAZING chicken noodle soup during the winter. (Or did. I really hope Mr. Lee brings it back!)"

2/24/2015,20150224,5,4.46,"The carrot cake is also unbelievably good. Miraculously, though it seems to hold roughly the same volume of fruit and nuts as a Christmas pudding, it is not dense. It has an excellent crumb. It doesn't have any frosting--it doesn't need any. A glass of cold milk is the best and only accompaniment that these generously thick slices need."
4/11/2015,20150411,4,4.45,"4.5 starsTiny shop. The chocolate rugelach is crack cocaine. The apricot is crack.Only the two versions are offered and it is more than enough. Both versions consist of a soft, chewy center with raisins. You can definitely tell that a high grade of chocolate is used. I am not typically an apricot fan but that version is also amazing with its crisp, sprinkled cinnamon shell.The rugelach was not warm as some reviewers previously stated but it was very good. The woman at the counter did not offer me a sample although it did take me a while to make a decision. I asked a number of questions, all of which she happily answered.Aside from the rugelach, which is the main attraction here, they also carry a number of home made cakes such as yellow, red velvet and carrot. Rugelach is $1 a pop and $12 for a baker's dozen (13 pieces).I'm a fan and will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area."

4/13/2015,20150413,4,4.44,"Rugelach, Schmugelach! It is all about the carrot cake at this place. Seriously. I ordered a slice as an afterthought to go with a half-dozen rugelach, and wound up falling in love with its dense, moist texture and subtle sweetness. I had actually hesitated to try it because I'd read someplace that Lee Lee's cakes tended to be on the overly sweet side, and I hate overly sweet. But this was not toothache inducing at all..nor was the cream cheese icing. (It does include walnuts and if memory serves, raisins if you are not into those).As for the rugelach, I was so looking forward to trying these and have been scheming to make it here for years -- from Brooklyn. But sadly, I just wasn't feeling it. I tried both the apricot and chocolate, and found them to be a bit dry and flavorless. The salesperson mentioned that Mr. Lee Lee's son was baking them temporarily, so perhaps that is why they did not live up to all the raves. I am giving 4 stars for the lovely carrot cake and also, the friendly, welcoming service I received. But the rugelach..not so much."

6/7/2015,20150607,4,4.47,"Went to shop yesterday, wanted something different. Checked yelp for something in area I was in. Lee Lee's came up. Rugalach??? Never tried or even heard of it. Had the apricot, it was delicious. Brung a 12 piece home and my wife couldn't put them down. Can't wait to go back and try the chocolate and raspberry. There were all out. Thumbs up!"
6/14/2015,20150614,4,4.47,"The Rugelach here are really something to write home about. They keep things simple with only a few rotating flavors, and will usually run out of at least one flavor on any given day, so you just have to rely on luck and hope they have what you want. I haven't tried the other desserts. They look good, but for now I just come here for the Rugelach. Theirs are a little bit different than the kinds I have had in the past. I think I prefer theirs because they are more crisp on the outside and the flavor seems richer and nuttier. They sell for $1 each and man are they good!!! I like to treat myself to a few whenever I am down that way."
7/8/2015,20150708,3,4.45,"I wish they could bottle the smell just outside the door and sell it. Talk about alluring! Staff was incredibly friendly, but this place could definitely use a face lift as far as decor and stepping into the 21st Century. I'll let that slide, because in the food business...the food is what matters, anyhow.That said, I decided to swing by after reading so many rave reviews (especially re: rugelach). I'm not disappointed, but I'm certainly not going to add to the hype. I only tried the raisin rugelach, chocolate rugelach and carrot muffin, so keep in mind I haven't had a a chance to give anything else a fair chance. This review is really about my experience and the two classes of baked goods that ended up in my belly.We'll start with the winnner: carrot muffin. It was fresh out of the oven (+2 points), it was light and moist and fluffy (+1 point), it was pretty excellent-tasting (+2 points) and not overly sweet (+ 1 point). I would definitely return to try a muffin of another variety or perhaps a different baked good altogether.And now for the rugelach: Not my personal favorite and I LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOVE rugelach. I tried both the raisin and chocolate, which really were exactly the same except that one was cinnamon and raisin and the other was the former but without raisins, and add a heaping spoon of melted chocolate on top. The texture was a little...crisp for my personal taste. I prefer a softer, more pillow-like pastry in a rugelach. Then, of course, there's the fact that I don't like when people sell me two takes on the same treat, but they are essentially carbon copies of one another...with a super slight twist. They tasted very much the same, and were definitely pretty good, but I don't know that I would label it ""best"".I would give Mr. Lee Lee another visit and definitely hope that next time is an improvement on today's experience. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area or passing by."
7/20/2015,20150720,2,4.42,"Let me start out by saying, no..I did not try the rugelach. I'm certain that most of these reviews are probably for this so-called delicious rugelach. But that's not why I gave Lee Lee's a try. Let me paint you a picture...Me and my girls stopped in on a Sunday around 4pm for a midday sweet treat. We wanted the real deal, and we knew that rugelach wouldn't cut it. We walked a few blocks to try Lee Lee's and upon opening the door to the establishment, I was being screamed at by the woman behind the counter to take some dirty, black shopping bag off the door handle. I complied, because..I didn't want to be petty. I went to hand it to her, and she says ""I don't want it, just throw it over there."" By this time, I'm kind of disgusted that I just touched a bag that clearly did not belong to her. So yeah, I'm doing housework now. I shrugged it off..I've been in worse situations. You'd think that after cleaning up the garbage from her storefront, the woman behind the counter would be a lot more welcoming and humble. Nope! Me and my ladies tried to create some small talk...but homegirl wasn't having it. We quickly ordered our sweets. I ordered the carrot cake and my other friend ordered the lemon cake. The carrot cake was upsetting. It was dry...and they did not use cream cheese icing for the frosting. When do you have carrot cake without cream cheese icing? That's like..unheard of. I had a bite of the lemon cake, which was reallllly sweet. But my friend enjoy it nonetheless. Lee's Lee's is a no no. Someone pick me up some rugelach the next time you stop by. Thankssss."
7/22/2015,20150722,2,4.38,"Visited Lee Lee's after buying groupon. The voucher had restrictions: M-R, 12-7pm. I thought, wow this place must be jumping on the weekends. And, after all the amazing reviews, I thought 'why not'.Arrived on Wednesday midday. A woman was behind the counter, and a man - I think Lee Lee-- was seated at a small table. The display had very little offerings: a couple of whole cakes, and cake slices. The slices were all yellow cake (never really sure about what flavor this generic cake is), with lemon, vanilla or chocolate frosting. They all look dry and not particularly fresh. There was a whole bundt cake, again yellow. And a chocolate cake, with walnuts I believe.Nothing else was available. The woman advised that the rugelach would be ready in 20 mins or so, so I left and promising to come back shortly.When I returned, the woman had packaged the dozen rugelach. It smelled fine, and it didn't cross my mind to check the package. I presented my printed voucher, and she asked if I could bring it up on my phone. She said folks have been printing vouchers and reusing the same voucher repeatedly. I could see how that could be a problem, but all Lee Lee's had to do was redeem it on their end. And, my battery was too low to use.  I also reminded the lady that the voucher clearly says it can be printed or presented on the phone. Anyway....Got back to work, opened the bag and I was so disappointed. The rugelach did not look appetizing. They had an odd shape (see review pic and then google rugelach). How did they taste?  They were dry, very crusty and crumbly in a bad way. They were supposed to be apricot but all we tasted was raisins.  They were edible, but not worth the trip or the hype.  I would not buy Lee Lee's rugelach again. There is a posted menu with all sorts of enticements, but not everything is available every day. There's no schedule either. You just need to show up, get what you get and don't get upset. There were items on the menu that the woman said they don't even make anymore. It's great to support local business. However, if a business offers vouchers, in many cases it's a sign of hard times for the business. I think that's the case here. I'd go back, only if I were within a 3-block radius and I would call first to see what they have decided to bake that day."
8/3/2015,20150803,5,4.39,"Definitely the best rugelach I have ever eaten. They are the perfect consistency and the flavor is delicate and delicious. Truth be told I don't even really like rugelach, but these? I love them.  I have to stop myself from eating them. The proprietor is a wonderful and kind soul. Don't be put off by the storefront. It may not have the snazziest decor, but the low prices mean that you are paying purely for the food, not for a glamorous counter that you would really rather not have to subsidize. Fabulous rugelach in Harlem. It's what makes New York the greatest city on the world."
8/5/2015,20150805,5,4.4,"My review is exclusively for the cinnamon roll.Ohhhh, the sheen of that heavenly glaze just pulled me in like a crystal ball. I took it to go and before I even crossed the street I had ripped off an end and the soft, tender texture alone jolted my stride and made me pause to look back in the bag to confirm I had gotten what I ordered. The soft cinnamony pastry was filled with confectioned air and the glaze melted on my fingertips and before I knew it, it was over. All I had left was a brown paper bag with 4 tiny c-fold napkins sticking to my hands. I felt betrayed by my instant infatuation. Felt that it started and ended too quickly. But I live in the neighborhood. I'll continue my love affair ;)"
8/6/2015,20150806,4,4.4,"After trying on 3 previous visits to score some rugelach and finding them sold out (and the staff awkwardly whisking me out door despite other supply being available, presumably assuming that being white I came just for that 1 item), I went with the $1 apricot rugelach and really enjoyed it."
8/19/2015,20150819,5,4.4,"At 74 and still making the best rugelach in all of New York, Mr. Lee Lee should be certified as a bona fide Harlem icon. Harry H. don't be discouraged--call ahead before you go and try not to come too close to closing. This gentleman doesn't have much help, and his rugelach is labor intensive. Yes, Mr. Lee Lee takes his time, but years of passion for his craft and his skill will be evident in every bite you take. He's producing more inventory, thanks to his son helping out, but on some days you do lose out. And probably because of loyal fans like me who come to score a dozen or two. My hypercritical sisters can make short work of a dozen in two days. To the Yelpers who say this place needs a facelift, Lee Lee 's Baked Goods doesn't pretend to be a gentrified, artisanal bakery and I doubt he wants to be. You can get your $17 lb dried out rugelach at a fancy bakery downtown or pay the gentle price of $12 for a baker's dozen of flaky cookies filled with plump raisins or apricot. You can even go to the new Levain that opened nearby and get your $4 chocolate chip cookie fix, and a fabulous one at that. But if you ever come in and see the neighborhood folk just hanging out at one of Mr. Lee Lee's few tables, you will understand what he means to the nabe. The décor that seems frozen in years past means a step back to a time when NY was filled with these mom and pop stores, filled with character and their owner's souls and patronized by folk who came for conversation, camaraderie and not just for the goods. I am grateful he is true to what he is, has managed to keep his business afloat and supplies us with his magnificent rugelach. Live well, Mr. Lee Lee and bake on!"
10/15/2015,20151015,5,4.41,"Oh gosh. I keep finding new good things to say about Lee Lee's. Here's one: Lee Lee's Baked Goods is proof that god loves Harlem and wants us to be happy. I recently tasted the chocolate pecan pie (it has a lovely pudding-y filling, and is only available on weekends)--and the honey walnut cake, which is just the right amount of sweet, and, like the carrot cake, super-moist. Mr. Lee is like a close family member who loves to bake. Not every single thing he makes is extraordinary, but everything is good, and he or his friendly staff will serve it to you in portions so generous that you sense they are trying to fatten you up."
10/23/2015,20151023,5,4.42,"This place is incredible! I can honestly say that they make the best apricot rugelach I have ever had. The carrot muffins are to die for. These two particular items are my absolute favorite, but I encourage others to sample all the other delicious baked goods that this master baker Mr. Lee prepares. The only drawback - it's cash only."
12/8/2015,20151208,5,4.42,"This place is just waiting for a cameo in Louie (or some other IFC comedy set in New York, take your pick) before it blows up. This old school bakery in Harlem has everything it needs to become a tourist destination, in the same way that Yonah Schimmel exploded in popularity after it was featured in an episode of Curb your Enthusiasm.And to be fair, I think that's what Lee Lee is going for. He certainly isn't shy when it comes to advertising. Mr. Lee has his face on bags of rugelach, but he's also in the store, chilling by the counter. Hey, he takes pride in his brand. But what matters is the quality of the baking, and the truth is that the rugelach is one point. Flavorful and crispy, it's plenty clear that this stuff is home made and fresh. They aren't uniformly shaped, each one is unique, but the quality is there in each bite. They might be a little small for a dollar each, but the flavor is worth it.I tried both the original and the chocolate, and they both hit the spot. If you are walking through Harlem and want a little something sweet and maybe a cup of coffee, this is the place. If you're maybe entertaining a couple of out-of-towners, and you're looking to get off the beaten trail in Manhattan, this is another nice pitstop."
2/2/2016,20160202,5,4.43,"Considering I don't have anything to compare this Rugelach to, I claim it to be an amazing Rugelach. You'll never forget the name of this hidden gem, mr Lee is everywhere you turn."
2/3/2016,20160203,4,4.43,"This is a true gem. You will smell the baking goodness as soon as you walk into this intimate spot (two small tables). Found it here on Yelp and thank goodness, it was the perfect spot for our sweet craving. I would've given it 5 stars, but they did not have coffee (They sell whole beans and we were told they are going to get a coffee machine the week after). Kevin, the attendant, let us buy coffee from elsewhere and eat the black & white cake and carrot cake we bought there. Both were delicious. My friend got into a conversation with the owners (or Lee's partners) who were friendly. They let us try the freshly baked rugelach they were giving as a gift to a group of people. It was divine! It was sold out when we ordered our cakes. We are coming back when they get the coffee machine!"
2/7/2016,20160207,5,4.43,"Lee Lees is my new favorite baked goods spot in all of NYC! The rugelach is beyond delicious and we ate the whole bag in one day! This spot is going to blow up, you should get some now before the lines get crazy. Keep up the awesome work."
2/8/2016,20160208,5,4.44,You can't beat this rugelach! I'm not in this neighborhood often but will definitely be making the trip for more of this yumminess. Would be perfect to bring a bag of it to someone's house that's entertaining...or eat them all on your own ;)
3/7/2016,20160307,5,4.44,I don't really know where to start when talking about this place. First off the atmosphere and ambiance are perfect and fit the whole culture of the bakery. Lee Lees is extremely customer friendly and feels family run. They make you feel welcomed and you immediately want to come back just because of that. Not to mention the rugelach is unreal and they other baked goods are delicious as well. I have been in there about 10 times so far and I live in mid town. It's definitely worth the commute.  I would definitely recommend Lee Lee's for anyone traveling or living in NYC. It's a spot you cannot miss.
3/15/2016,20160315,5,4.45,Rugelachrugelachrugelachrugelachrugelachrugelachru­gelachrugelach... this place beckons me from the other side of Harlem all too often. Best. Rugelach. Ever. And that is saying something in NYC. Mom & pop bakery with magic going on in the kitchen.
3/22/2016,20160322,5,4.46,"THE BEST RUGELACH IN NYC.I'm born and raise in New York, so was my Mom, Dad and brother. We've gone to all the bakeries that ""specialize"" in rugelach and other Jewish desserts, but Lee Lee's is like no other. Many people (like myself) sorta felt for years ""if you've had one rugelach you've had them all"" and that was the case until Lee Lee put a new spin on it.His rugelach is soft on the outside like a French puff pastry/palmier, but still has that traditional crunch that we all know and love in rugelach.You really have to try it to understand the taste and texture -- Lee Lee's rugelach is truly one of a kind."
6/6/2016,20160606,4,4.45,"Yeah so the hype is real the rugelach is as good as you have heard. It has a slightly crunchy exterior with a soft center and an apricot filling. It isnt too sweet and the nuts/raisins inside add a nice touch. The carrot cake was decent, but I wish they went a little easy in the icing as it took away from the flavor of the cake.Off the beaten path for sure. But If you like rugelach or treats then I would pay this place a visit."
7/10/2016,20160710,4,4.45,Had Mr.Lee make me 3 pound cakes for my family reunion and everyone enjoyed the cakes Mr.Lee thank you again it was good.
7/12/2016,20160712,5,4.45,"Oh, how I love Lee Lee's! Their rugelach is some of the best I've had outside of Israel, and I'm always looking for good rugelach. Chocolate, apricot, whatever they have in the display, you can't go wrong. Their cookies are pleasantly flaky and dusted with cinnamon on the exterior with a dense, chewy, almost juicy, interior. Tell your friends."
7/15/2016,20160715,5,4.46,"People freak out about the rugelach here, but I personally don't love it. The COOKIES, though. oh my god. I swear to god they put heroin in them; I've never had a better classic chocolate chip cookie in my life. I'm currently going through withdrawal because they're doing renovations until August 2. EAT THEM YOULL NEVER STOP"
9/8/2016,20160908,5,4.46,Cute spot!! The chocolate chip cookies are SOOOOO good! Looking forward to trying someCheesecake when I come back!! The woman behind the counter was really sweet too :)
10/26/2016,20161026,5,4.47,"Lee Lee's looks like a simple neighborhood joint, but the rugelach really is all that it's cracked up to be. The exterior has just a bit of crisp to it, the dough is just the right amount buttery, there are a few but not too many walnuts to give them a very subtle nuttiness, and there's the perfect amount of filling. I've mildly liked rugelach since I was a kid but never considered it the sort of thing that one would go out of one's way for... Lee Lee's changed that.The place has a simple look. It's sparsely decorated, except for the pictures of Lee Lee and the newspaper clippings about him. When I stopped in, Mr. Lee was out but the two ladies working there were friendly.And at $1.25 each (discounted a bit with volume), the rugelach isn't dirt cheap, but it's not expensive. Given the quality, it seems like a good value."
10/27/2016,20161027,5,4.47,"Rugelach is $1.25 !!!LEE LEE, I have this love-hate relationship with you. I love you because your Rugelach is uncomparally good; I hate you because I cannot eat you during breakfast time.Location: Lee Lee is a unique shop in Harlem. It has its tradition and stands for how an African American man successful his business as well as maintaining the culture. Lee lee doesnt have much indoor seating, mostly it's a to-go place.Rugelack sells quick but you can still choose to have cake for pleasure.They now start to sell mike's like it ice cream!!DONT MISS IT!!WOWWILL COME BACK !!"
11/6/2016,20161106,5,4.48,"Just heaven these little bites of buttery, flaky, fragrant deliciousness! Wish I could buy them un-baked and frozen to bake in my oven at home in Washington State. Worth the trip!!"
11/21/2016,20161121,5,4.49,"I never thought another man's rugelach could rival my grandfather's.*tear rolls down one crumb-covered cheek*I'm so sorry grandpa, but by the transitive property, I've found a new grandpa. *goes back to frantically eating 8th consecutive piece of rugelach*"
11/21/2016,20161121,5,4.49,"I can't believe I've lived in East Harlem this long and haven't gone over to Harlem to taste these delicious treats. I was on my way with a couple friends to go check out Jazz at Marjorie Eliot's (if you haven't been, it's a kickass way to spend a Sunday afternoon) and figured we'd stop by. We could smell the rugelach from down the street - and trust me, the smell was as intoxicating. The place itself is really small, and they bake the rugelach on the premises. It really does sell out, and the person at the counter told us that she constantly is replacing the trays over and over again. She was so welcoming and kind and really was so lovely in explaining the display. The display is small, but pretty much everything is SOLID. The chocolate rugelach contains the perfect amount of chocolate and nuts, while the apricot is just classic. They also have these pecan sandies type cookies that were to die for. At $1.25, these are fairly priced I think for homemade and freshly made. I also love that they weren't cloyingly sweet (hate to say it, but it is a stereotype of Asians that many can't stand it when things are too sweet) and it was perfect. I took a few home and had them for breakfast over the next couple days -- perfection."
11/22/2016,20161122,5,4.5,"This place is great! We pick up a couple dozen rugelach every year for Thanksgiving to share with friends and family. Not only is the rugelach amazing, but so is their customer service. I tried calling yesterday to place our annual order but the line was busy, so I emailed. Scott emailed me back within the hour and then called me to make sure I could place my order. So glad to have this place nearby!"
11/26/2016,20161126,5,4.5,"LeeLee's is one of my two favorite bakeries in NYC. I gained weight going to LeeLee's almost daily one summer. It was worth it. I usually go there for cake and I'm always pleased. The red velvet, pound cake and lemon cake are my favorites. The chocolate chip cookies are good. So was this glazed cinnamon pastry thing I had...can't recall what it was exactly, lol. I've also had the rugelach and that was good but not something I'm a feem for. Every employee I've encountered there has been friendly and pleasant, which makes it even easier to give them my coins. I no longer live in NYC full time and every now and then I find myself longing for a slice of cake from LeeLee's, lol."
12/21/2016,20161221,5,4.5,I can't imagine Rugelach being any better than this. The chocolate was good and the apricot was spectacular. Can't wait to return.
1/2/2017,20170102,5,4.51,"Updated Review: Following the mix up below, the owner Scott personally called me this morning and apologized asking what it would take to make it up. His call was genuine and he clearly cared about the business and was disappointed about this incident. Even though I was frustrated by what happened, I have to say I will give this place another chance based on how much the owner went out of his way to try to make things right. That's a very rare quality these days in a business! ---------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This review is for their service only! I saw the great reviews on Yelp and so I thought I would order my wife's birthday cake from here. - The women who answered the phone was very rude and did not know whether they would be open on new year's weekend for me to pick it up; even more frustrating, she did not want to find out whether they would be open!- Fine, so I asked if they would be open Monday, Jan 2nd so I could pick up the cake that morning, which is when I needed it by. She assured me they would be and took my order. That morning they were in fact not open. - I purposely made sure to note that I needed the cake by this morning; even though the receptionist was horrible, no one else who viewed the order bothered to call me back to tell me this date was not possible."
1/21/2017,20170121,5,4.51,Amazing Ruglach! Best I ever-had. Superior to anything I have had in New York or Israel. Normally prefer chocolate to apricot. But the apricot is even better at this place in my opinion.
5/5/2017,20170505,5,4.52,"Truly a must go if you are making any kind of trip to Harlem, or anywhere past 90 St. really. The apricot rugelach is the way to go."
5/14/2017,20170514,5,4.52,This rugellach is so darn good. Hidden gem in Harlem. Take the D train and head over to 125 St. and give this place a try. The outside pastry is so flaky and rich. The filling so satisfying. This little piece of heaven has got to by the best tasting treat by far. The brother can make a fine rugellah
5/20/2017,20170520,5,4.53,"This is one of the best bakeries That I have eaten at In a long time, that is family owned Business with fresh baked goods That you can smell down the block. The owner and his son are both nice people And even gave us samples. The shop is a little small but they easily make up for it with their baking. If you have a sweet tooth I'd recommend trying them out"
5/20/2017,20170520,5,4.53,"If your ever in New York and find yourself in Harlem stop by and pick up some of there DELICIOUS Baked cakes ect... It's a Mom and Pops store and Pops has been baking for years. Home made pumpkin pie, lemon pie, sweet potato pie, the list is endless. Very welcoming and they make you feel like family. So make sure to stop bye even if it's to say Hi"
6/20/2017,20170620,5,4.54,OMG - Lee Lee's rugulah are absolutely the best rugulah we've ever had! They are melt in the mouth delicious - made with lots of butter and the finest ingredients. AND they deliver all over NYC - what a fantastic and unique gift!
6/24/2017,20170624,5,4.54,I had the apricot rugelach and it was really good. It's not overly sweet and has a nice crumbly texture to it.
7/1/2017,20170701,5,4.54,"OH MAN, the rugelach is so good.Always love a small business who kills it!Mr. Lee is a throwback to another time, does this guy know how to make mouthwatering treats or what. When in Harlem stop in to Lee Lee's and prepared to be delighted."
8/19/2017,20170819,5,4.55,"Everything in this joint is delicious. So good. I don't care what you're looking for, they make the best of it. This is a must stop."
8/19/2017,20170819,5,4.55,"Sort of in an odd location but, once you enter you're engulfed in total sugary bliss. The red velvet cake is moist and the icing is light. Great sandies too! Everything is home baked and delicious. Not good for dining in--it' s a little steamy. SO YUMMY!"
8/23/2017,20170823,5,4.56,"lee's rugelach, is tasty... enjoyed the little shop and advice the peeps to stop by to support Lee but also to have a nice sweet."
11/17/2017,20171117,5,4.56,"I am currently reading Food and the City for my book club, Lee Lee's was featured in the book. His story was very inspiring that I wanted to try the rugelach for myself. It's so perfect because I just moved into the neighborhood 2 weeks ago. I was lucky there were still some rugelach left, and it was only 12pm on a Saturday. The rugelach from Lee's is a standout because of it's own unique flavor, with the right amount of chocolate, nuts and the like. While enjoying my rugelach, it made me think of home because my dad would buy rugelach from this Jewish bakery from the San Fernando valley and that one was also stellar. The unique part about the pastry chef is Lee is not even Jewish and he was able to perfect the staple pastry. The place is tiny, but there are seating if you choose to eat in. I took mine to go since I wanted to pair my rugelach with coffee in my apartment. There are other pastries to try as well and since I live fairly close to the bakery, for sure I'll try other treats."
12/24/2017,20171224,1,4.53,"Perhaps they're a good bakery. Arrived at 10:30 (they open at 10) and were told that nothing was available and to return after 11. They assured me they wouldn't sell out. Returned at 3:30 and, after waiting on line and placing my order was again informed that they were sold out and we'd have to return (not likely) later. Sold out status probably indicates that they're a good quality bakery but they are a barely amateur business."
1/2/2018,20180102,5,4.53,"Several weeks ago, I began to get some articles in my Facebook feed about the magnificent rugelach turned out by Mr Lee. I'll be the judge of that I thought. After all, I have a lifetime of rugelach eating experience. Who better to test it out?Harlem isn't the most convenient destination from my neck of the woods. Thankfully, there is mail order. I ordered 24 pieces, chocolate and apricot.My package arrived quickly and I dug in. The verdict? The hype is well deserved. It's magnificent stuff all right. My rugelach loving wife agrees. Perfect after dinner with a cup of coffee or espresso.Go order some now!"
1/5/2018,20180105,1,4.5,"Lucie S. - I read your response to my review and understand that the bakery was challenged by overwhelming demand. For me, the issue was how your employee (the young woman who was behind the counter on both of our visits) handled it. It is one thing for you to say that ""every customer is important to us."" It's quite another to train your employees to reflect that message. On both occasions the young woman had no expression and no affect. On our first visit, it seemed strange that you would open at 10AM but at 10:30 would have nothing available for sale and be told to return after 11. Why not just open at 11? I'm sure there is a plausible explanation but your employee couldn't have cared less.When I returned later that afternoon, the customer in front of me ordered a dozen rugelach and was told there were only two flavors left. I was prepared for a similar limitation and when I placed my order faced some initial confusion only to be again told to return later. When I asked, with a degree of incredulity, whether the person in front of me had bought the very last piece, the unapologetic, humorless response was a blank-stared ""yes.""If, in fact, every customer is important to you then you need to train your employees to reflect that. For the time being, I'll pass on any future visits since I found your response somewhat lacking in any empathy and seemed to ask that I be understanding of your circumstances but provided no indication that you had any concern for mine.Steve S."
2/12/2018,20180212,5,4.51,Lee Lee bakes the best rugelach in the world! The raspberry and apricot are my favorites flavors of rugelach. I highly recommend Lee Lees to anyone in nyc.
2/22/2018,20180222,1,4.48,"Hubby just returned home from getting some morning breakfast for us. Had read good things about Lee Lee so he made the special trip. The croissant he brought me back is so old and hard, I would have a hard time believing it was even a day old! Inedible and was not advertised as a day (or more) old. He bought it before 9 am."
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.48,"Each Holiday, I like to give my Clients Food Gifts. When a favorite brownie bakery closed; I looked on line for a candidate replacement. I wanted good quality and for the supplier to be based in the NY Metro area (buy local vs. chain). I am very pleased with the Rugalech from Lee Lee! In fact , I am now sending out Birthday Rugalech in addition to Holiday Gifts. One recommendation, if you need to have Lee Lee send out from their shop; make sure you speak to the Manager, and not the clerk who answers the phone....the transaction just goes more easily. Everyone who receives the ""Rugalech By a Brother"" is very pleased with their gift!"
5/14/2018,20180514,5,4.49,"This is a great rugelach. A little different. I guess it's old school but yeah I love it. Slightly expensive, but it's cool."
6/14/2018,20180614,4,4.48,Lee Lees rugelach is delicious simply put. And the prices are gigantic! Typically rugelach is expensive and you get these teeny weeny pieces that are delicious but do nothing for you. Not at Lee Lees. He's giving you legit pieces right in the middle of Harlem all year round. It doesn't get better than that. He has a couple of desserts but I only get the rugelach and that's all I want! I stop in whenever I am close. It's getting a 4 star rating because it has a grade pending right now. Sooo yea... but I love the rugelach and I love that it's made by a black man and will keep going back
7/8/2018,20180708,4,4.48,"Very different from the other coffee shops and bakeries in the area: you get what is advertised: a guy named Lee sells you his baked goods, ""rugelach by a brother!"" (as the sign says--funny).  I had a couple chocolate covered ones and it's great stuff.  The coffee was decent and cheaper than the other chains around. Has the feel of a home shop which may make you doubt up front but the reviews attest to the great traditions."
7/14/2018,20180714,5,4.48,A Harlem gem. The history is so neat and the rugelach is very good. It also feels great to support a family operation like this one.
7/19/2018,20180719,5,4.49,This place is amazing!! My husband and I got two of the raspberry and two chocolate Rugelachs and once we ate them we drove right back and got 10 of the raspberry!!! Best description is pie on crack!!! AMAZING and definitely a MUST HAVE!!!
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.49,"So worth the trip from Queens!!! Excellent rugulah and the most darling spot! The staff is so kind, and good natured; I want to work there too. Brought a pound home and they lasted a minute! Go!"
9/2/2018,20180902,4,4.49,Yum! I have tried lots of rugelach around the five boroughs and this is definitely up there with the best. I tried chocolate and raspberry - both were flaky and excellent. I especially enjoyed the chocolate. Will definitely be going back to try more of their treats!
9/8/2018,20180908,5,4.49,"Pretty darn tasty. It's different than what my grandma used to make, but I applaud his willingness to take on a staple like this, in a city like NY where he has some tough competition. It's about style. Are you a traditionalist? Are you curious enough to expand your idea of what rugelach can look and taste like to enjoy something wonderful? Do you like butter? Raspberry is my favorite. Adorable little shop and friendly staff. Five stars for marketing."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.5,"Yes, the chocolate rugelach really is that good. Flakey dough on the outside, nutty filling on the inside, just the right amount of chocolate and cinnamon."
10/9/2018,20181009,5,4.5,"As soon as we walked in, we were overwhelmed by such amazing aromas! Warm, chocolatey air, if that makes sense.We bought a few apricot and chocolate Rugelachs and were SUCH fans! They were warm, the perfect amount of flakey, and yummy. Also, the staff was very nice and patient with our large group in the tiny shop. Loved this little place. We'll definitely be back!!"
10/17/2018,20181017,5,4.5,"I've been eating rugelach for more than 60 years. Most of what is sold as rugelach is junk. Lee's is the real deal. The flavor is right, not too sweet. Flakiness and density are right on as well. Real hand made too, so each one is unique. I buy them by the dozen. Once these were ubiquetous but now Lee's is a rare treasure that is well worth patronizing. Kudos! Try them. You won't be sorry."
11/28/2018,20181128,5,4.51,"All the goods are Amazing and delectable. This place you must try and do yourself a favor when you go. Come a little hungry, simply cause it's so tempting and delicious and smells so good."
12/10/2018,20181210,5,4.51,"The rugelach here are as good as people report. They are clearly house made, judging by both the look and the taste. We got apricot, as it was the only flavor available today. The pastry is buttery and rich, with a discernible apricot tasting filling. If you want rugelach that looks like the perfectly rolled layers of bakeries that aren't doing all the work by hand, this isn't it, but if you want to try delicious handmade rugelach, from a local kitchen, make the trip to Lee Lee's. The man knows what he's doing. The counter staff was friendly and knowledgeable about their products, too."
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.51,"Rugelach!!! Rugelach!!! Rugelach!!! Who's got Rugelach? My grandmother would be very proud of Mr. Lee..He done did it great!!!!! Chocolate, raspberry, or apricot!!!!! It is all good!!!! Which one is my favorite..It depends on what my taste buds want at the time of consumption, the weather, my mood.etc..so if he has all three available I would get a few of each flavor.. and if I didn't have a choice buy whatever is available and by the next day whatever flavor you purchased, your taste buds will say..'Hell yeah; open that bag/box and let me get some!!"
12/11/2018,20181211,2,4.5,do not do a phone order then know how to take a order and process the payment for the order on your credit card  - and with a 30.00 dollar shipping fee ----They just do not know how to mail out the order. I have called numerous times to get this straighten out and i have had no luck.there email contact site is down. I am writing this so others do not fall victim to giving them money.
12/14/2018,20181214,1,4.47,Ordered online 11/26/18- never delivered. Emailed 3xs and no response; tweeted and no response. Just called-no one answered the telephone and there was no voicemail option. Guess I'm out $55.
12/18/2018,20181218,5,4.48,"LeeLee's has been my favorite since I discovered them (fresh out of the oven!) years ago -- best rugelach ever!!! Have been enjoying them and giving them as gifts ever since and everyone who tastes them jumps on the ""best ever"" bandwagon. Am grateful to Mr. Lee for the care he puts into his fresh baked product, and to Mrs. Lee and their staff for their wonderful, personal service."
2/16/2019,20190216,1,4.45,"I'd give this a zero if I could. I placed an order a month ago for $153.00. I never received it. I sent two emails that were never responded to. And I just placed a phone call and was hung up on. If you go on this site's Facebook review page, you'll see I'm not the only one."
3/27/2019,20190327,1,4.43,"Worst experience I have ever had! I ordered Rugelach December 5, 2018 and my order was just delivered! It is now Mid March 2019! I called a couple weeks after I ordered and spoke to a women who was so rude and asked for my number and said she would call me back after she looked into my order....Well, never got a phone call back so I figured I was out $30! I got a call last week from my mother in law telling me she just received her Hanukah gift! Will never order from these guys again!"
3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.43,"The...Best...Tastiest...Moistest rugelach that I have ever tasted. Think of the most magnificent dessert you've experienced. Lee Lee's will replace that memory. As a southerner and native NYer, I like to think that my palate for desserts is pretty sophisticated. I grew buying desserts from both Jewish and southern bakeries and as far as having quality sweets..stop by Lee Lee's. My mouth is watering as I text."
4/26/2019,20190426,4,4.43,"Went here to try the famous rugelachs.First off--they were fresh out of the oven, which was pretty great. I ended up getting a chocolate, apricot, and raspberry one.The chocolate was definitely my favorite of the bunch as it had that little bit of almond flavor in it which was delicious. My second favorite was the raspberry and then the apricot.Overall, these were great and super flaky, which I enjoyed. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood."
4/29/2019,20190429,5,4.43,"I heard about Mr. Lee Lee's Rugelach from reading something by Tamron Hall where she said it was the best she had ever eaten. I was a little dubious, as I've eaten Rugelach from 100s of places over the years and never found any that were half way decent. I grew up eating homemade rugelach from my Grandma Rosie. I even sat with her in the kitchen one time, while she made it and I regretted not having paid attention to her more. We never appreciate the history and the people who surround us while they're alive, only after they pass, and then it's too late. I think about it often now, trying to remember my grandma's cooking, her recipe, and even her voice, and her calm loving strength. So i went into Mr. Lee Lee's tiny storefront bakery with the front door, a screen door like my grandparents country house. I thought that was a charming touch but the Rugelach would have to stand the test on it's merits. I bought two of each, raspberry, apricot, and chocolate, and went back to my car to try them. I bit into the Raspberry and it was transforming. I was back in my grandma's apartment kitchen, sitting next to her on her step stool and she was kneading the dough and rolling it out. And she was next to me giving me her half smile, quietly nodding at me, half listening to me as I talked about school, about our softball league, about comic books, about the Yankees. She couldn't have been that interested in anything I was saying but she listened so patiently and was so attentive. I never thought about asking her things. I was so wrapped up in my own teenage life. I started crying almost immediately. It was silly I knew, crying over a piece of rugelach, but it was so real, a flood of memories took over, my Grandma Rosie's living room, the Roman mural that was painted above the couch which was so tacky but I didn't think it back then, the tiny kitchen that seemed so full of her, even though she was a tiny woman. The little hexagon dresser that had schnapps and sour ball candies in it.  I'm even tearing up as I write this. I went back into his store and asked the woman behind the counter if I can see Mr. Lee Lee. He came into the small shop from the ovens, behind the counter, and I walked towards him and hugged him. He must of thought, ""What is up with this crazy white boy."" Mr. Lee Lee is a national treasure and everyone in this city should buy rugelach from him. This is a man who has brought my past back to me. I can't say enough good things about him or his Rugelach."
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.44,"This was my first experience with Lee Lee's and I can't praise them enough. My daughter and grand-daughter live in Vancouver, British Columbia and had heard about Lee Lee's from friends. So on a recent visit to New York, they went there and tried some of their rugelach and became enthusiastic fans.I went to visit them in Vancouver this week (in fact, I'm writing this review from Vancouver) and thought they would appreciate some Lee Lee's rugelach. It would have been difficult for me to get to the store before I left so I called the store this past Monday to see if I could order some to have them shipped, either to me or to my daughter. The shipping costs to Canada were prohibitive so we arranged for them to send me the rugelach. I told them that my plane left late Thursday afternoon.They told me that the rugelach would be mailed to me and I would receive them by Wednesday. Wednesday came; no rugelach had arrived in the mail. I called them to complain and see if they could be mailed in time for me to receive them on Thursday before I left. I was told that I wouldn't get them on Thursday, but I would get them Wednesday evening.THEY DROVE TO MY APARTMENT IN QUEENS ON WEDNESDAY EVENING AFTER THEY CLOSED TO DELIVER THE RUGELACH TO ME SO THAT I WOULD BE CERTAIN TO HAVE THE RUGELACH TO BRING TO VANCOUVER.I was so impressed by their doing this - going above and beyond what one would normally expect a vendor to do. To me, this is a perfect match - the makers of outstanding rugelach behave in an outstanding way in customer relations."
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.44,"Awesome rugelach! You really can't go wrong with any of the flavors, but I do love the raspberry and chocolate. They also sell other baked goods (cookies, slices of cake). Very friendly service. Cash only."
6/17/2019,20190617,5,4.44,"Hands down, Lee Lee's has the best rugelach that's store bought! Everyone who has tried them raves and can't get enough!"
8/11/2019,20190811,5,4.45,"Visited on our Tour of Harlem Food and Culture. This is the cutest shop. I loved how they decorated the place to appear like grandma's kitchen. Quaint and warm. The rugelach was amazing! The gentleman behind the delicious treat was featured as Oprah's Favorite Things. I would say this place, you must visit."
9/1/2019,20190901,5,4.45,"Lee Lee's rugelachs are so good! The peach is my absolute favorite. FYI. Cash only!His rugelachs are so soft, warm and perfectly layered. I was hesitant to try the shop because I had a rugelach once before and wasn't crazy about it but his tasted so much better. I would recommend his shop to anyone who enjoys pastries in general. You don't have to be a super fan of rugelachs to enjoy Lee Lee's, they're that good.I met Lee Lee when I went into his shop and he is a very friendly older man who is clearly enthusiastic and hands-on with his product, which is hard to find nowadays. I look forward to visiting Lee Lee's again soon and highly recommend his sweets.In my opinion, Lee Lee's is much better than the nearby Levain whose cookies I find intensely overly sweet."
9/16/2019,20190916,4,4.45,"Lee Lee's seems to be quite the establishment in the neighborhood. When you first pull up to the store, you see a huge board in the window that shares its beautiful story with passerby's. The story of its humble beginnings is the perfect precursor to the store itself. When you walk in, it almost feels as if you've walked into somebody's grandmother's home. It's cozy and super homey which and completely unexpected from the city streets outside.We tried three types rugelach (Apple, chocolate, and maple?) and the carrot cake. Each rugelach was $2. My favorite was probably the chocolate as it was the most distinct of the three. If I went back, I'd probably go for that one. In addition, I wouldn't go back for carrot cake. It was good, but not the best I've ever had. Overall, my experience was very pleasant. The woman who helped us was extremely kind and made us feel right at home. I recommend stopping in for a bite if you're around!"
10/2/2019,20191002,3,4.44,I was expecting great things from this place. The rugelach was good but the cookies and pastries were sub-par.
10/17/2019,20191017,5,4.44,"Holy *%#*. This is the real deal. Worth every mile to get here and every minute of exercise to work it off. Having had my fair share of regulech, I can honestly say these are the best I have ever had. They are moist and full of a great filling to dough ratio. Very sweat but in the right way, not overly sugary, don't know how to describe that, but very good. I got a bunch for the family but had two one day and two the next and I cannot allow my self to fall in the trap of having any more If you are anywhere near hear and like baked goods, this is a destination location!!!Cannot wait till my next visit, and now, probably most NYC visits will involve a stop here."
12/23/2019,20191223,5,4.45,"My husband and I discovered Mr Lee's bakery when we moved to Harlem in 2005...and have been enjoying his rugelach ever since! The taste and quality is still as good now as it was then...despite the fame he's now garnered through Oprah and others. This rugelach also makes the best gift - especially now that they have the cutest old-fashioned gift tins! If you haven't yet tried Mr Lee's rugelach, what are you waiting for?!!"
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.45,"I love this place so much. My own ruggelach have earned me marriage offers, and yet...well, these might just be as good, if not better (and I say this as someone who thinks most commercial ruggelach is pretty meh). Seriously, these are superlative, both the chocolate and raspberry varieties. Not sure what the fat they use is but they are beyond flakey and moist, and just the right amount of sweet. Also - you will not find a tastier, more affordable breakfast. I came here Christmas morning and left with 2 ruggelach, a coffee, and a ginormous piece of cake for just north of $6. Everything is so affordable, in fact, that I worry for the future of this business, which is in fact older than I am. I'm trying to do my part, which mainly involves eating more ruggelach more frequently - and hope that you decide to do the same."
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.45,It's so rare to find such high-quality rugelach at such affordable price in the city! One of the best rugelachs I've ever had in the city! What's more touching is how the owner is all about baking for the people and the community!
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.46,Love the apricot. It's usually the only option when I go but I don't mind. Friendly service and a reasonable price for quality dessert!
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.46,"Lee Lee's baked goods are sooo good!! The apricot rugelach ($1.75) was my favorite. I ate them so fast that I didn't have a chance to take a picture (never happens). If you get the chocolate make sure to warm them up for 7 seconds before eating, makes a difference! One of the best bakeries in Harlem."
4/25/2020,20200425,5,4.46,Transcendent as reported. This rugelach is pure magic. Heart and soul. Worth walking many miles for.
5/24/2020,20200524,5,4.47,"Incredibly good. They've spoiled me for all other rugelach. Also, the shop smells divine and the people working there are very friendly. Am willing to gain an extra pandemic pound or two for these."
6/7/2020,20200607,5,4.47,"What a gem of a shop. The rugelach (on June 6) came in 3 flavors (chocolate, raspberry, & apricot) and each one was heavenly. The gentleman who helped us was so pleasant as well. Love a small business that really gets it all right. Worth every second of the hour and half walk to get there! Will definitely be back for more."
6/17/2020,20200617,5,4.47,"These rugelach are heavenly! When I went to the bakery, they had three different types and all were amazing. One had cinnamon and walnuts, another was stuffed with raisins and the last had almonds and chocolate I believe. The pastries were soft yet just the right amount of crunchy. They are also not overly sweet, which I also liked - each pastry had the perfect flavor. You can tell that the pastries are made with a lot of care. I also tried one of the fruit Danish pastries which was also delicious. I definitely recommend this little bakery!"
7/15/2020,20200715,5,4.48,"Delicious. This is a destination bakery, go and get the rugalach. It lives up to the hype."
7/29/2020,20200729,4,4.47,Very delicious Rugalch. This is a must try when in Harlem. Try all 3 flavors. Raspberry is my favorite. Large in size and great quality.
9/28/2020,20200928,3,4.46,"I tried the rugelach, if that's how you spell it, and was underwhelmed by the hype. I got the original and chocolate. It's alright, maybe because I'm not a fan of dried brown fruit type things in pastries. Their other baked goods are probably better if youre like me. The decorations are super cute though, i love it."
10/5/2020,20201005,5,4.47,"Love this place. The rugelach is always stellar. My favorite is the raspberry, but the chocolate is also very good."
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.47,"I just had Lee Lee's rugelachs for the first time and they truly are some of the best rugelachs. I had both the chocolate and raspberry ones and my entire household loved them. Entirely recommend, will be returning."
10/30/2020,20201030,5,4.47,"Love this place. Local shop with such an interesting story. They're known for their Jewish Rugulach - apparently one of the most authentic ones left in the city as it's been carried on by the former staff that now owns the place. My favorite here though is completely different - it's their cheesecake. Underrated but so decadent. Even a friend who doesn't like cheesecake let it pass. They don't always have it though - even if it's on the menu, it seems like it's something they make only when they feel like it (made with love!) maybe that's their secret ingredient? Lol Support this local business, met the owners before when I was there and they truly are kind people and it shows because their staff can be as well. :)"
1/21/2021,20210121,1,4.45,"Stay away! They don't stand behind their service. Ordered November 28, 2020. Paid 15.00 to ship. DONT REALLY KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS. We did not receive until January 2, 2021. Stale.And now they want me to chase down the Postal Service. Any other vendor would just send me a new order and deal with the business semantics.It was a gift. USPS wants a claim from either the vendor or the recipient.IT WAS A GIFT. You try saying to someone you just gave a gift to file a claim with the USPS."
1/27/2021,20210127,1,4.43,"I placed a $78 order on January 25. No delivery. Emailed them twice, just left a phone message. Very poor customer service. Now I see reviews from other customers that delivery can take a whole month. Will cancel this order. Very poor customer service. Don't do it."
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.44,"Simply amazing rugelach , the best. Nice guy. The chocolate ones are devine."
2/28/2021,20210228,5,4.44,Chocolate rugelach is insanely good. Definitely best I've ever had (with apologies to my grandma's efforts). Place smells amazing when you walk in too. Definitely a must try!
2/28/2021,20210228,5,4.44,Lee Lee's Rugelach is the best I have ever tasted. Please order from him when thinking about ordering this amazing baked good! Oprah was right in 2018 and in 2021 it's still true!
3/10/2021,20210310,5,4.45,"I am a rugelach maven, and this is the best in New York! Mr. Lee Lee is very nice. I want to support him as long as he keeps going. Whenever I get rugelach other places because they're more convenient (especially all the bagged and boxed kind mass produced in Brooklyn) I'm comparing them unfavorably with Mr. Lee Lee's artisanal rugelach with the authentic Yiddisher geschmack!"
3/19/2021,20210319,5,4.45,"Yum, yum, yum to the yum, yum! The cakes are my favorite! Please don't sleep on the bread pudding! I love this place and I have the weight to prove it!"
4/8/2021,20210408,5,4.45,The shop is open again after some months of mail-order only!
7/14/2021,20210714,5,4.46,All I can say is mmm mmm good. These home made rugula are the beat in all of NY. Lee Lee is a Baking magician.
11/21/2021,20211121,1,4.44,"My husband and I have purchased from here twice before, so I called today at 12 noon to place an order to ensure I would have the items we wanted. They said i could pay credit card over the phone so i said sure let's do it. There was immediately some confusion over whether or not there was carrot cake available, so my full name was taken and I was told I would get a call back to finish placing the order I had started which included multiple rugelach, coconut cake, potentially carrot cake and other items. At 3 pm I called back after never receiving a call. No answer, voicemail full. The voicemail message sounds like someone's personal cell. Call again, phone is answered but hear nothing on the end. I probably called 5 times. Then I had my husband call and they answered immediately. He mentioned we had been calling and been promised a call back, and the person working said she would put us on hold because there was a customer right in front of them. And he said well we have been waiting all day and we were told ""it's a holiday"". It's not a holiday, yet. Anyway - 3More minutes on hold and we decided to hang up. We understand busy businesses around holiday time on a weekend, but this type of service is a big turn off so we will be going elsewhere. Don't offer phone ordering if you are unable to call customers back in a timely manner (even though we waited 3 hours to follow up without issue)."
11/26/2021,20211126,5,4.44,You already know Lee Lee's has the BEST rugelach you will every eat. We are also a fan of the pecan sandtarts cookies and Kenya's lemon blueberry cheesecake is what dreams are made of! So light and fluffy and yet still dense like a cloud. The flavors are unbelievable and the crust is perfection.Lee lee's is small- and capacity is currently 3 - but they have seating outside while you wait so bring your patience because as soon as you step inside you will be greeted warmly by the delicious smell and friendly and hospitable service.Either Kenya or Lee Lee himself will serve you and they always make sure to let you know what is warm and fresh out of the oven!The sweet potato pies were such a hit this Thanksgiving we couldn't even get a picture before they were all gone! No one even touched the pumpkin pie our guest brought.
12/2/2021,20211202,5,4.44,"Amazing !!! When you walk in smells like Butter !!It's small & warm you can tell everything is made from scratch . Great selection. There are pies , muffins , cookies and of course their famous rugelach in three flavors chocolate, raspberry & apricot ... live up to it's reputation!! . Very slow paced . But all worth the wait !!"
12/16/2021,20211216,5,4.45,"I have lived in NYC for 15 years and consider myself well versed in baked goods, particularly rugelach. These are THE BEST I've ever had. We will be going back this weekend."
1/10/2022,20220110,5,4.45,"The Rugelach King Mr. Lee is well stocked for the new year! I stopped by today and was expecting the usuals but the incredible Kenya has added so many wonderful treats to the menu- don't sleep on the cookies! Pumpkin spice w toffee, oreo fudge w walnuts or rainbow sprinkles- or the classic chocolate chip- you really can't go wrong!They had plenty of cake slices today- we opted for chocolate and carrot cake but they also had pound cake (iced classic or w lemon), cobblers: Apple cobbler! Peach cobbler! Cherry cobbler made w rugelach dough! All w double crusts and Mr. Lee made breadpudding yesterday so those looked delightful as wellCan't go wrong here!"
1/29/2022,20220129,5,4.45,I ordered four special assortments for the holidays and each of the recipients were thoroughly happy. I'm especially impressed with their ability to manage a busy store (I called) while also fulfilling online orders (and I ordered!)
2/7/2022,20220207,5,4.45,"Friendly service from behind the counter - I asked for recommendations and received a fairly lengthy answer (although she wasn't just listing off everything they had). I was told that this bakery was known for their rugelachs, so I ordered a raspberry rugelach and a russian coffee cake.Raspberry rugelach - fairly small, $2.50, and good for 2-3 bites. It's not as crispy as one from Breads Bakery, and the interior texture is a little crumbly. But the raspberry shines really well, and it feels like a relatively light dessert.Russian coffee cake - Good for sharing between two people! The bready foundation of this reminded me of a cinnamon roll, sans icing. Each bite was pleasant because you get the crunchy nuts on top, the soft bread, and also the pineapple that had a special taste to it, like it was soaked in booze. The store is fairly small but welcoming, and I really enjoyed the home-made taste and feel of the rugelach and coffee cake."
3/9/2022,20220309,4,4.45,"Mmmm. I likes rugelach very muchly, and this place delivers. The chocolate is a must, but the apricot isn't too shabby either."
3/15/2022,20220315,5,4.45,"If your looking for authentic quality pastries this is the place with the flavor from when you was a little youth. The Customer service is so rewarding. They always make their customers feel like your an old friend. Such a warm & pleasant environment. Here is the kicker, you gotta, and you must try the rugalech, This small bite size pastry will make you lose a friend if they happened to have eaten the last piece (thats how good they are). Please give Mr Lee Lee a try you wont regret it! Tell em Brother Jones sent ya !"
4/4/2022,20220404,5,4.46,Transcendent as reported. This rugelach is pure magic. Heart and soul. Worth walking many miles for.
4/15/2022,20220415,5,4.46,"Was looking for something extra after having brunch and was delighted to see a bakery that sold rugelach. Upon opening the door, you're met with the most heavenly smell rushing out. You just know from that moment it is going to be good. The people here were so friendly. The rugelach is perfection here, the right balance of everything. Definitely worth a visit, even if you're just picking up one!"
5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.46,"Probably the best rugelach I've ever had! I think the raspberry is best. The service was friendly and patient. The store itself is homey and simple. They seem to have cookies and other baked goods, but not much else."
5/12/2022,20220512,5,4.47,Tried all three flavors of rugelach and can confirm all three flavors are baked with love and soul. Warm them up for 10 seconds in the microwave. So heavenly.
