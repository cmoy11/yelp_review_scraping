10/13/2014,20141013,5,5.0,"This restaurant just opened over the weekend. It has the vibe of a seafood shack. The staff is friendly and helpful about the food options. I tired the soft shell sandwich, it was great! I had never tried a sandwich like this and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised the items are served inside of dough that taste like it was just baked. I also tried the sweet plantains, I will defiantly get a side of these the next time I come in. If you are looking for something unique and authentic, you should definitely try this place out!"
10/14/2014,20141014,5,5.0,"A casual, seafood shack with a friendly staff. Just what the neighborhood needs. So far at Lolo's we've tried the soft shell crab sandwich, the ribs and the gruyere and callilou crab dip--all winners! I'm getting hungry as I type. I can see a lot of meals on their back patio come the Spring. I'd love a few more sandwich choices like a spicy dolphin or grouper sandwich but not on the menu (yet); hey they just opened. Other restaurants in the area, this is what the people want. Take notes: Affordable meals, fast, friendly service in a chill atmosphere. No uptight fa√ßades here."
10/24/2014,20141024,5,5.0,"This joint is a real gem. Delicious food, good prices; great vibe, friendly staff. I had the bake and crispy shark with fries... Wishing I was eating one as I type this."
10/26/2014,20141026,5,5.0,"What a great addition to the neighborhood!!! Great seafood!!! Amazing bakes!!! If you are in Harlem, I strongly recommend it. Great service and worth every penny.  I can't wait to go back to Lolo's."
10/26/2014,20141026,5,5.0,"My experience at LoLo's was amazing. Let me paint the picture. I was warmly greeted by the proprietor and staff. I was given a tour of the restaurant and enlightened on the concept. The menu boasts some seafood classics like the jumbo shrimp while other items are unique like the johhny cakes with honey butter. We sat outside in the back patio on a picnic table as we listened to carribean music playing in the background. Are appetizers were mind blowing like the parmesan plantains. Our main course came out slightly after and we ordered the lobster bites and the crab bake. This place is awesome, definitely a great place for date night. Seafood lovers will never forget the experience."
10/26/2014,20141026,5,5.0,"One of the best seafood places I have ever been too. Great service, nice ambience, and simply amazing seafood. Everything is very fresh, clean, and flavorful. The staff is incredibly nice and great in service. The atmosphere is very Caribbean like, it makes you relax and not worry about the stresses of New York City life. I would definitely come here again. My favorite dish was the shrimp steam pot. Fresh jumbo shrimp, seasoned generously and steamed to perfection. Perfect serving size, and excellent taste. Another favorite of mine is the soft shell crab sandwich, truly a sandwich that you cannot get anywhere else. Also on the menu is Chef Ray's specialty corn on the cob, it is just simply mouth watering. I recommend this place to any New Yorker, it's a nice family atmosphere and the owners treat you like you're part of the family. 5 stars for sure!!"
10/27/2014,20141027,5,5.0,"Great food, friendly staff. The owners were on hand to greet us and I found the atmosphere to be quite island like and festive. The food was great. I had the ribs and johnny cakes and my wife had the crab legs and shark. My wife is a tough critic with seafood and she was blown away to the point she almost had a third serving. A true gem to the area. I only wish I lived closer to have it more often. NJ is not that far and I will be back."
10/29/2014,20141029,4,4.88,"The bottom line is; this place is great. the vibe is perfect, friendly staff, good food and they have a great backyard space.We ordered a shark bake, crab bake, shrimp pot, fries and dirty rice. We also had some plantains to sample. Everything tasted great and fresh. I don't know if I was starving and needed a lot of food when I dined here or the portions just weren't big enough. Regardless I will be back here and can't wait until next spring/summer to enjoy the backyard more. Go here and support a new local business that adds something fresh to the neighborhood."
10/29/2014,20141029,5,4.89,"Amazing food, friendly staff & great prices. The conch fritters were to die for. I will be coming back again !"
11/6/2014,20141106,5,4.9,"Stopped by recently and had the crab steam pot, chicken wings, johnny cakes and corn. Everything was great! The food came out fast and we really liked the backyard space. A cool, casual spot."
11/11/2014,20141111,5,4.91,"What a delight to enjoy such amazing food ! The Shark + Bake was a mouthful of heaven, the jerk ribs practically melted off the bone and are the best ribs i've ever tasted by far. The selection of house sauces really blew me away which go well with the Johnny cakes and anything else for that matter. Also tried the jerk wings which are amazing also.I highly recommend Lolo's for true island street food treats.Staff is very friendly & the rustic nautical decor compliments the goodness of the eats."
11/18/2014,20141118,5,4.92,"Having this place open on my block is so dangerous. Went in and had their avocado sandwich while my date had the shark, SO GOOD. We shared both and we're delighted by how delicious and fresh everything tasted. We also got the cauliflower and it was an excellent addition. Excited to go back and try the Johnny cakes/crab sandwich. ALSO, the owner is the sweetest lady. Happy to have this in the neighborhood!"
11/30/2014,20141130,5,4.92,"I've been in this neighborhood now for more than 15 years. This is my new favorite spot. There. I said it. The secret is out. I go for the food (great for sharing with a small group of 2-5 in my opinion so you can order one of everything and try more!), the funky and chill atmosphere, the quality sourced ingredients (I did the research!) and the friendliness of the staff. I went when it first opened and have been back more than 6 times (trying to taste everything and I STILL have things to try!) Tonight I had my go-to Seared Cauliflower- I'm ADDICTED- and the salmon sandwich. Delicious. Every time! I guess I was holding off writing this review in part because I don't want it too become TOO popular.... especially come summer with the backyard outdoor picnic tables, but..... secrets this good aren't meant to be kept! Plus I want the owners to be successful and stick around."
12/1/2014,20141201,5,4.93,"I love the Caribbean feel to this small establishment. I felt like I was back on my cruise and made a stop to eat in the Bahamas. Don't just stay in the front, go past the counter and have a seat, there's even an outdoor area. A close friend and I came here after having happy hour drinks at Harlem Tavern, which was on the same block, steps away. We were tired of the regular fried happy hour food so I dragged her here. Great choice I made!I don't remember the names of what I had since this was like 2 weeks ago. I just know it was GOOD! The sweet potato slices were great, they are cooked then I think baked or fried for a second (couldn't see the grease). The stuffed fries had a subtle taste but we're good and not over fried. Ugh the wings were so yummy you have no Idea. The picture I took should be a bit more helpful. Also loved that when we were leaving, the owner and her crew were toasting, I guess to another great night. That was awesome to witness! Although I moved to the Eastside, Every time I come to visit my mother and sister I'll be coming for a taste of LOLO's."
12/14/2014,20141214,5,4.93,"Amazing. The bake is mind blowing, the fish is fresh and tasty, the price is right, and for now it's Byob."
12/17/2014,20141217,5,4.94,"This is some life-changing shit here, y'all.I've basically tried everything on the menu in the short time that Lolo's has been open (what? 6 weeks now). I think that I've had all of the steam pots, all of the sides, most of the snacks, and the shark & bake. Having acquired this vast level of experience, I can say, without a doubt, that this place is getting it right in all ways and at all times.The seafood has all been super-fresh, the sauces delicious, and the sides -- both fried and fresh veggies-- really flavorful. I also think that the portions are good, as are the prices. The one exception to that is the side of fries ($7), which I think is a bit mispriced, but on the other hand is way more delicious than normal fries. If you want a little direction on where to start, let me suggest the shrimp pot, johnny cakes, cauliflower, and dutty rice. Followed by everything else..."
12/24/2014,20141224,5,4.94,The price and the freshness of each bite shocked me at first. Usually you have to compromise in some area but at Lolo'S I didn't have to. I left feeling content yet not lazy. I ordered a steamed seafood pot of shrimp with the ginger butter and scallion sauce to go with it. I let the shrimp sit for a few mins while my friend and I shared the yummy conch fritters and cauliflower. Both were a delight: the cauliflower had the perfect crunchy freshness. The conch fritters were a surprise because for the first time ever I ate a conch fritter from a restaurant that actually had actual conch meat in it. Go Lolo! Our waiter tied a bib on me and I cracked open my steam pot. Such a delight and great for sharing. Homemade condiments are a must and your allowed to try as many as you want. Seating in the back is nice and cozy. Love the reggae vibe!

12/27/2014,20141227,5,4.95,"Thank you Yelp for directing us to LoLo's. Quite an unsuspecting facade yet inside very pleasant service and a simple menu based on a Caribbean or specifically a St Martin style beach shack serving snack food. Thoughtfully put together, and everything we tasted worked well. Highlights included the conch fritters, the ribs, shark and bake and the shrimp pot with the Lolo sauce. Very simple and small seating area in the back from the front order and take out counter. Good luck Laticia and Raymond, who could not be nicer."
12/29/2014,20141229,5,4.95,"Lolos has the best Gourmet Caribbean seafood I have ever tasted. The food is so flavorful. The Jerk Ribs, the Shrimp, the smelt...mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm mouth watering. The owners are the most polite, personable down to earth people. Laticia and Raymond may your business continue to Thrive and spread throughout the world!! Lolo's a great Caribbean family restaurant that makes you feel like you're in the Islands."
1/18/2015,20150118,4,4.9,"Spotted LoLo's as I was trudging up the soggy downtown-bound B/C train stairs, the blue-painted tropical sign like a warm beacon in this wintry wasteland. Inside, the staff's smiles instantly melted the chill off our bodies, and soon we were engorging ourselves on:+ the shrimp steampot cooked in Lolo's Special Sauce which is a combination of all the delectable sauces - so comforting, so perfect over rice, with coconutty sweetness + the shark bake which has the lightest fried shark stuffed inside a beautifully thin johnny cake with salsa verde and shredded cabbage - so light and so flavorful !/ the smelt fish and chips - if you like fishy little fish, these little smelts will melt in your pungent little mouth. fun and crispy, but I'd much rather eat a lot more of+ the belizean conch fritters - light on the conch and heavy on little bits of corn and bean, these are crispy and chewy and wonderful+ extra johnnycakes to sop up that Lolo's Special Sauce (and have an excuse to eat honey butter)+ garlic fries (free with check-in!) - the fries here are thick, coated with itty bits of garlic and coconut sweetness; they aren't particularly crispy, but they're still pretty goodWe left the restaurant with bellies fully swollen with Caribbean happiness. So nice to have a taste of the islands in Harlem !"
1/29/2015,20150129,5,4.91,"The food is great, the staff friendly and helpful.It is small but cozy and welcoming. I would definitely recommend it!I went there with three friends and ordered a variety of dished so we could all try a bit of everything. It was a great decision. Everything is good"
1/29/2015,20150129,4,4.87,"Read the Times review and stopped in. Really cool ambiance, nice owner, great customer service and lovely friendly people with great music in the background. We were new so the owner gave us some food on the house to try which is a really nice gesture. The conch fritters are amazing, as was the snow crab legs with the special sauce. Only reason not 5 out of 5 was because the corn on the cob could have been a bit more generously sized. Will be back for sure!"
2/6/2015,20150206,4,4.83,"Went here last Friday for a quick dinner with friends. The ambience is really causal, and looks like a shack. I actually learned that LoLo's are the names of the seafood shacks in Belize. I ordered the shrimp steam pot with ginger and scallion sauce. The shrimp was fresh and perfectly cooked but that's all you are going to get in the pot. I suggest getting a side of the garlic fries, or the flat bread, which was really delicious. My friend got the crab cake sandwich which tasted awesome. It is convenient to get to. It is right at the C subway stop at 116th and right next to Harlem tavern if you are craving drinks after your meal. Definitely want to come again, to try the rest of the menu."
2/12/2015,20150212,5,4.84,"Lolo's is a truly a slice of Seaside/Seafood Heaven in Harlem! I have managed to eat my way around the entire menu and I can't wait to get back for more. The food is authentic, creative and undeniably delicious. It's quality ingredients with island flavors and a lot of love from the owners/chefs. The staff rocks- truly a delight to dine in at Lolo's.Everything on the menu is delicious, so here are few things that I literally dream about:Jerk Ribs- perfect dry rub, juicy, meaty ribs, love the sauce on the sideShrimp Steampot w/Ginger Scallion Special Sauce- WOW!! Succulent and Savory!Shark & Bake- Literally the best fish sandwich you will ever sink your teeth into.Crabby Dip- Fantastic Flavors + Fresh made Plantain Chips = party in my mouthI'm in Love with Lolo's. Experience. Enjoy. Repeat."
2/15/2015,20150215,4,4.81,"This is an interesting little place! Very, very small inside.The shrimp bag with garlic butter and old bay was SOO delicious. I do wish there were a few more shrimp in there but I guess it was fairly priced. Want to try snow crab next time.Got free plantain with my yelp check-in. Not even worth it, I thought they were pretty awful and had a bizarre texture that I've never experienced before.Johnny cakes were SOOOOOOOOOO oily. They were really good with the honey butter, but I think I got a few pimples from eating it. They also used a johnny cake as the bread for the shark sandwich that my friends had. The corn on the cob was so delicious. I got an extra order to take home.Dutty rice was ok but it didn't have many beans or much flavor. Would be good if used as a bed for the seafood you order. I poured some garlic butter on it and it was much better. They give you gloves for peeling the seafood which was much appreciated by a neat freak like me because I would've been in the bathroom washing my hands every five minutes without them. I would come back again.Skip the coconut soda, doesn't even taste like coconut :("
2/15/2015,20150215,5,4.81,"As i drive up, i thought I'm not going to this little hole in the wall. Then i said I'm here so i may as well. Very small but the cashier was very big on being friendly & recommending things. To my delight they had a prix fixe menu for $30.15, which allowed me to sample a lil of everything. The Belizean conch fritters were very light & tasty, really enjoy the mixed in corn. Just when i thought my mouth tasted it all, the shark bake sandwich was to die for. I really enjoyed the spread & homemade bread it was on. I also had the shrimp steam pot, garlic butter & old bay seasoning. which was good & perfectly steamed. I was really contemplating on the chilled broccoli salad cause i wanted my brocc hot but i must say it was VERY good. Light & a lil lemon zesty taste. I will definitely be back, probably tomorrow, lol"

2/19/2015,20150219,5,4.79,"You got to try their Conch Fritters, & the Shark and bake sandwich! Their snow crab with garlic is the best. They have great service and food!"
2/20/2015,20150220,5,4.8,Delicious foods in an intimate space where the owners/chef come out to greet their customers. Must dos:- conch fritters- wok fried Dorado with Chandon Benai sauce- the dragon sauce on anything (but spicy!!!)- snow crab with garlic butter
2/20/2015,20150220,4,4.77,"totally worth it. dont be fooled by the unassuming front, its not just a takeout place, theres a cute room in the back.great seafood and carribbean cooking served by super friendly staff.they currently dont have a liquor license but you can byob from one of the nearby bodegas a block away"
2/22/2015,20150222,5,4.78,I happen to have come out The blistering winter cold into LoLos to the surprising pleasure of my palates on the deliciously seasoned wings and garlic fries. My pockets were pleased but my tastebuds were in love!
2/24/2015,20150224,5,4.79,"Great food, friendly polite staff, amazing plantains, sauces are incredible and the prices are totally worth it. Only thing is there's not a lot of seating but when summer comes the back garden will be open which will be GLORIOUS. This is a definite go. A LOT of gluten free friendly options too! Conch fritters are gluten free who knew!? Ever since my first time there, I crave Lolo's weekly!!!? Recommendations are the dog fish sandwich (shark and bake), crab legs, fritters, plantains, and of course ask for that amazing ghost pepper sauce that will light up your entire mouth."
3/4/2015,20150304,2,4.71,"I ordered takeout from here for 2 people. Had the shark and bake, conch fritters, shrimp steampot, and crawfish steampot. The shark and bakes was good. I would order that again. The rest of it was very bleh. There really wasn't a lot of shrimp or crawfish in the steampots. We also got the special sauce and it had very little flavor. The conch fritters were okay but I couldn't really taste any conch. I've eaten conch fritters at a hole in the wall place in the Bahamas. There it was absolutely amazing. At Lolo's, I couldn't even taste or see any conch in them ... might not even be any conch in it as it's stated that there is bacalao (salted codfish) in them. I could hardly even taste that, just the cornmeal. As hush puppies, they were great but they're terrible conch fritters. I am very surprised at how much Yelpers liked the above items.So after spending $42 on takeout for 2 people, I was still hungry and unsatisfied. Pretty disappointing since I was looking forward to this seafood addition to the neighborhood. I guess I'll be trekking downtown to The Boil for any future seafood cravings, sigh."
3/7/2015,20150307,5,4.71,"Not gonna front, this place is the shizz. Came here with the bf on a Saturday night and was politely greeted by the staff at the counter (you order at the counter first and then you try to snag a seat). We ordered the Smelt Chips and Fish basket, the Crispy Shark bake, the Crab Cake bake, and the Garlic fries. We took a seat in the back and were promptly served our Fish/Chips and Garlic fries. I forgot to ask what type of fish they served in the Fish/Chips, but it was so goood. It always amazes me when I don't have to worry about bones in your fish, you know what I mean? :) The counter staff came back to serve us our Shark bake and Crab cake bake and wow, between the two, the Shark wins. I've never had shark before, but if that's how shark tastes, I'm going to go hunt me a shark (err.. on second thought, maybe not). The counter staff (who also double as servers) came back to check on us regularly to make sure we were taken care of and I appreciated that so much. You can tell how successful a restaurant is by how happy their employees are and I could definitely tell that Lolo's employees were happy campers. Will definitely go back !!"
3/11/2015,20150311,5,4.72,"This place is fantastic! The decor is super fun - Caribbean funky - and the owners are very nice. We loved everything we had especially the smoked wings, plantains and conch fritters. Snow crab legs with coco curry sauce are also delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any dish. They all come tapas like and are perfect for sharing. This place is right off he B or C train, just 12min from Columbus circle and you'll be transported to the islands!"

Whatever sauce they had with the shrimp was so good I would buy it by the gallon if they bottled and sold it. Pretty quiet for a Saturday night but people are seriously missing out. Love these small home grown joints. Once the summer hits and they get a liquor license I have a feeling I'll be spending a lot of time here."

3/22/2015,20150322,4,4.7,"New fave in my neighborhood! It used be a Chinese takeout place when I moved to SoHa, now it's a great seafood restaurant. Tried with Amazon local deal for the first time. Me and my boyfriend had a crab sandwich, a salmon sandwich, grilled corns and garlic french fries. The sandwiches look small, but it actually works for the balance of meal if you want to enjoy the side menus. I don't know what type of spices in the sandwiches, but the mixture of ingredients is interesting and they offer variety of sauces. The menus are unique that I want to try every meal eventually. Sophisticated Caribbean with high quality blend of spices. The space itself is also very creative. Now my boyfriend is super obsessed with their food and went there 2 days in a row. Just slightly over-priced that he cannot eat them 7 days in a row..."
3/22/2015,20150322,5,4.71,"Lolo's never fails to warm my cold cold heart that's frozen over from winter. First, the crabby dip. Crab combined with callaloo and gruyere scooped up with plantain chips - need I say more? The shrimp steampot with the Lolo's special sauce is so flavorful and goes well with a side of plantains or garlic fries. Everything I've tried has been delicious but my favorite would have to be the shark sandwich with that magic green sauce. What makes Lolo's stand apart from other restaurants is its hominess and the staff's friendliness. When I stumbled in last October and asked if they were open, Skai led me and my friend to the backyard where there were about 15 people. There was such an open, laid-back vibe. Little did we know that it was a private party with Skai's family and friends. Everyone made us feel so at home that we must have stayed for more than 3 hours. Can't wait for warmer weather so I can stuff my face with more seafood there!"

We had more too, but it's all a blur now, we just kept eating all the deliciousness until there wasn't a crumb left!See you soon, Skai!"
3/27/2015,20150327,5,4.68,I LOVE Lolo's. Give me gloves with my buttery shrimp steam pot? Sold. The coconut shrimp special was fabulous. Really can't recommend this place enough. The vibe is cool too and the staff is super friendly and knowledgable. Can't wait to come back in the summer and eat on the patio!
3/29/2015,20150329,5,4.69,I am soo happy this amazing seafood place opened up in Harlem! I had the shrimp boil with the Lolo sauce and it was sooo good!!! My husband had the soft shell crab cake and loved it as well. The conch fritters were delicious. I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about Lolo's. Love the setup and it's a less than 5 min walk for us. Go eat there!!
4/3/2015,20150403,2,4.63,"If you've had Bake & Shark on Maracas Beach or even on Eastern Parkway during Labor Day weekend, this does not measure up. They don't give you a choice of condiments. The bake is thin and small. It's not the traditional bake & shark. If you know bake & shark, you will be disappointed. The staff is friendly."
4/4/2015,20150404,4,4.62,"On my first trip to LoLo's I had the snow crab in garlic butter, my gf had the shrimp, and we shared an order of Johnny cakes and garlic fries.  Everything was great. The Johnny cakes were light and fluffy, and went well with sauce. The fries were crispy and well seasoned. And, although the crab steampot here can be a little messier than those served elsewhere, it's so worth it. The sauce on the crab was to die for. Additionally, the vibe at LoLo's is super comfortable. Staff was friendly and the restaurant had a very family-like feel that I enjoyed.If had any issue, it would probably be seating. While I understand the vision/inspiration they were following here, seating can be a little cramped and uncomfortable for those dining indoors. However, we were told that there is outdoor seating which will become available once warmer weather permits. I'm hoping that makes dining a little more comfortable. Otherwise, I'm still perfectly fine taking the food to go."
4/4/2015,20150404,1,4.56,"I was disappointed with the food. The conch fritter didn't taste like it had any conch, the curry shrimp was colored a light yellow had no curry flavor and was rubbery the spare ribs taste like it was reheated too many times. Anyone from the Caribbean know what real Caribbean food taste like and would be disappointed. The only thing I liked was the rice and beans which was made with coconut milk and very tasty"
4/6/2015,20150406,2,4.51,"New York Times wrote a hype piece for this little eatery, but I think they got a different menu.The prices aren't high because proportions are small. The sauces are decent, but mostly owed to butter, not unique spice combinations. Don't make the mistake of ordering the fries. They taste the same as a frozen grocery store product. I desperately wanted the Conch fritters to be a success. Sadly they are 90% breading and very greasy. I got the shrimp steam-pot with lolo's special sauce. The taste was good, but not special. You'd have to order 2 to fill you up. The space is intimate. Too small for groups but a nice if you just brought one friend along."
4/8/2015,20150408,5,4.52,Amazing food at this Seafood Shack! Super fresh and flavorful. The colorful interior of the restaurant is very cozily set. The staff is super nice and friendly. Can't wait to be sitting in the garden during the summer.Very highly recommended!
4/9/2015,20150409,4,4.51,"Perfect little hole in the wall place. Very good fresh seafood and yummy pickings. They put a bib on you and give you rubber gloves so you can dig into your food. What's more to love?! Bring your inner kid and dig in! And trust me you will need the bib, I proved that once I started to eat their most AMAZING wings... their smoked wings. Seriously who knew smoked wings would be so much better than fried wings. Came here during vacation, after getting off a 10day cruise, you know where you eat practically every hour on the hour. So it was definitely time to grab some grub. We found this place and on the way to another local restaurant and knew I had to pop in after reading the reviews on Yelp. We placed our order, grabbed our number and some waters and went to sit in the back of the restaurant where they had Caribbean reggae house music playing. Felt like I was at a tikki bar restaurant like in South Florida almost. They even have a backyard porch for eating outside in the nicer weather. A very pleasant waitress came and fitted us with bibs, which I never wear but she said it was definitely worth wearing, so I did (she was right, which was proven when their smoked wings literally fell off the bone when attempting to shovel into my mouth, and a MISS! plop, bib saved my shirt lol)My friend and I were moaning and groaning so much from all the different flavors and textures that another couple who came in turned around at us and we had to apologize for our loud foodgasms. We explained it was our first time, and we were from out of town and they said it was their first time too, they got their seafood pot, but now they had to order their smoked wings because how we were carrying on. They also agreed that it was one of the best tasting wings they ever had too. All of us agreeing ""who knew smoked wings were so good"".Now let me say one of my favorite go to items when ordering out is shrimp, I LOVE shrimp. Even better than lobster. This place does not disappoint. - We had their coconut shrimp with garlic fries... Hallelujah Hallelujah (that's me worshipping) and their Lime zest remoulade was drinkable it was so good- We had their Jumbo Shrimp with LoLo's special sauce. OMG!!! - Jerk Ribs were so banging we forgot to take pictures of it before devouring a few. Sorry lol- Smoked wings were original and truly the best wings non fried I ever had. Hence there is no picture for them because we inhaled the wings before remembering to take a picture. lol- Their corn on the cob, was perfect. Crispy, plump, juicy, flavorful cooked perfectly!Loved the vibe of this place, loved the food, loved the service, and was serviced fast!!! Definitely had a perfect afternoon lunch here :-)We spent $65 for 2 people to pig out, and seriously can't wait to go back to NYC and Lolo's !I was a little disappointed that we ordered so much stuff and the gentleman didn't bother tell us that we should check in on yelp and we would get a free app. I will remember the next time. So FYI, be sure to check-in on yelp to see if there is a coupon."
4/10/2015,20150410,5,4.52,This place is amazing. Everything is delicious. Best cauliflower that I've ever had. Also love the ghost sauce.
4/11/2015,20150411,5,4.53,"I was staying at Aloft Harlem for an event at Columbia University. Looking for something to eat locally, I found Lolo's... they are in a small spot that's easy to miss. I stopped by around 8:00 on a weekday and there wasn't a wait. You order at the counter and there is seating towards the back of the restaurant. I had dirty rice, curry shrimp and conch fritters. The rice and curry shrimp were excellent and the conch fritters were OK. I had a Ting to drink... service was great, they gave me another drink to go. If you're visiting Columbia, you need to visit Lolo's."

4/12/2015,20150412,3,4.51,"Here's the major, major drawback to LoLo's: the portion sizes are all ridiculously small.$11 ribs only included 4 ribs.$10 bag of crawfish had about 6-7 crawfish: not even enough for an appetizer. I would guess a true crawfish entree would require about 4-5 of those bags.Having grown up eating crawfish in NOLA, an order of crawfish means a heaping mound... at least a few dozen, which makes sense given that each crawfish only has a small bite of meat. This is how it's been served at every crawfish place I've eaten at (including BOIL in NYC). I understand we're not in NOLA, but serving 6-7 crawfish in an order doesn't seem to make sense, portion-wise.We spent $56 on our dinner at LoLo's and left hungry (when we got home I made steak tacos for dinner #2.)The food is absolutely delicious: the conch fritters were the best I ever had; the ribs and the accompanying sauce were amazing, and the johnny cakes were delicious. And the staff are great as well!We desperately want to like LoLo's:  but it doesn't make any economical sense to go there for a dinner. I really don't know what to order there that would actually fill me up."
4/12/2015,20150412,5,4.52,"We loved it! Great service, and pleasant, casual setting. And the food!! Shrimp Steampot, Smoked Wings, LoLo's special fries (Cojito, pickled jalapenos and herbs sprinkled on top!), corn on the cob (also with cojito), and chilled broccoli salad for a bit of crunchy, green. Lots of homemade condiments to choose from, which is something I really love - salsa verde, ghost pepper sauce, pineapple salsa and LoLo's special sauce. Everything was fresh, delightfully seasoned and cooked just right. Also, great music, decor and lemon water...and a small but darn good selection of soft drinks.. A solid FIVE star experience. We will be back often :)"
4/14/2015,20150414,3,4.49,First time here. Ordered 4 items.- Shrimp steampot: absolutely delicious. Fresh. Seasoned to perfection. - Broccoli salad: very good. You can taste the high quality olive oil in it.- Conch fritters: plain and flavorless. Would not recommend.- Smelt fish and chip: terrible. Very soggy. Too much fishy smell. Couldn't finish it. (It was 90% potato anyway)Maybe the chef was having a bad day.
4/19/2015,20150419,5,4.5,"cute little seafood shack. delicious food, friendly staff, byob"
4/27/2015,20150427,2,4.46,"Update: Food Poisoning. Started violently throwing up a few hours later, mostly the conch fritters (don't ask me how I know). No shellfish allergy personally. Or maybe the gills ARE inedible? I don't want to speculate...Below is my original 4 star review.-------------------------------------------------------Today is Monday but they are actually open, so they successfully stole a customer from Streetbird across the street (me).I got conch fritters, soft shell crab bake and broccoli salad. My meal cost me $30 which is definitely on the expensive side. But I do think the food is good enough to justify that price (or almost). The crab and fritters are both deep fried but not greasy at all. The bake is basically soft shell crab, tomato, bacon and slaw in johnny cakes (cornbread flatbread). I really loved this dish. It has a hint of sweetness without being too heavy. This place is called a seafood shack but man the chef knows how to cook bacon. It was crispy without being oily and added great texture to the sandwich. Note that the gills of the crab were not removed.The conch fritters have bell peppers and cod in them. Flavor is simple but satisfying and the other ingredients really bring out flavors of the seafood. Broccoli salad is refreshing albeit a tad salty. I am a fan of their coconut soda also. Backyard seating is relaxing. Service is quick. Also don't forget they give you a free order of plantains if you check in."
4/27/2015,20150427,5,4.47,"I LOVE. THIS. PLACE. If you're looking for a cute place to get your seafood fix in Harlem look no further than this gem. A friend and I got a couple different things including the fries (amazing), the steamed shrimp (seasoned well), we also got some wings that I wasn't crazy about but the food all in all was yummy. We checked in on yelp and got a free order of plantains who can be mad about that?!The staff and the decor really make this place what it is. They are super sweet and attentive and there is a back patio I want to dine on when it gets a little warmer. I'll be back."
5/1/2015,20150501,5,4.48,"So far I've tried steamed shrimps, shark bake sandwich, garlic fries and cafe habana style corn on the cob. Above and beyond flavor and the back patio seats are nice in warm weather."
5/6/2015,20150506,5,4.49,I think I found my new favorite uptown spot! This place is a hidden gem. I walked in and was open to suggestions on what to order. I was steered towards the crispy shark and bake which I ordered to go. While I waited the super sweet owner offered up complimentary plantains which were beyond tasty. I snuck a peak of the outdoor dining area which was so cute especially now that the weather is heating up. I got home and the second i bit into the homemade bread and fish I realized I made the right decision. I've already told my friends we need to go back and the Caribbean rice and peas was the icing on an already delicious cake.
5/7/2015,20150507,5,4.49,"My mouth is singing praises right now!!! Just finished up a feast for a Caribbean queen! I had the Coco curry steamed shrimp (amazing!) and chilled broccoli salad (delicious and simple but taken to new levels when dipped in the coco curry). BF had wings and conch fritters. He liked both but I only tried the conch fritters which were just okay in my book. HOWEVER, the freebie plantains rocked my world!!! They were so delicious and flavorful. Will be hard to resist next time I visit. On top of it all, the kitchen busted out complimentary garlic fries which were just as great quality as the rest of our meal. So happy to have experienced this new resto in our hood AND bonus points for their chilled out back patio."
5/7/2015,20150507,5,4.5,"The wings, the conch fritters, plaintains (free with check-in),the shrimp steam pot and even the broccoli.. ALL was phenomenal! This place is such a gem. Very glad to have it our neighborhood. Thanks guys!"
5/10/2015,20150510,4,4.49,"Great food, relaxing backyard, and great staff! My kind of place. My husband and our friends loved it, too. I loved all the food I tried but my favorite was conch fritters (that was the reason I went)! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't have liquor license yet and I thought it was BYOB, but found out that wasn't the case. Ice cold beer would have been so great. Will definitely go back! P.S. makes me want to go back to the Caribbean."
5/13/2015,20150513,3,4.47,"I remember the epically nasty Chinese takeout that used to live at this location and always wondered if anyone would have the vision required to do something fun an unique. Well hats off to the owners here for taking that plunge! I ordered the steamed shrimp paired with coconut milk sauce, steamed/boiled crayfish and the chilled broccoli salad. The best of the 3 were the shrimp for sure, the shrimp was fresh and the coconut sauce very tasty, i'd definitely recommend this dish. It's more an appetizer size though so tame your expectations. The crayfish was far too meager of a serving. It's a dirt cheap ingredient to purchase and really very very little meat to be had as it is which is why you ought to beef up the weight per serving to accommodate this fact especially when charging $10 for it. I'd give the chilled Broccoli salad a pass. It tasted like when you over-microwave the frozen broccoli you buy from your grocery store. It was also completely void of any seasoning except for a little olive oil with not a hint of salt or even pepper. Am I missing the point of this dish? Is it simply for fibre to get regular? Will try other dishes for sure."
5/14/2015,20150514,3,4.45,"Definitely, not the worse but not the greatest either. The portions are small and slightly overpriced. The shrimp with garlic and ole bay was a little on the salty side. The jerk ribs lacked in flavor and they could have used a better bbq sauce. I wished I was able to give it a better review since I appreciate the new options of restaurant openings."
5/16/2015,20150516,5,4.46,"Wow this place may be my new favorite in Harlem! I recently went with a friend on Friday night around 7pm. First you place your order up front and they give you a number. We sat out back in their patio area and they also have some indoor seating too. It was busy but not too crowded. I am sure that will change once word gets out about this place. I felt transported to the Caribbean as soon as we walked in. I haven't seen conch fritters in a menu since I was in Turks & Caicos! The staff was very friendly, the food was amazing and I will def be back! Be sure to check in on yelp and you get a free plantain chips!Crabby Dip - had a little spice with a crispy topping. Comes with plantain chips for dipping. Conch fritters- OMG these were so delicious. Fried with conch and other delicious filling!Crispy Shark Sandwich- this is one of their staple items and I highly recommend it. It comes on ""homemade bread"" but my friend got the Johnny Cakes which looks exactly like the homemade bread. So basically it's Johnny Cakes with shark sandwich. You must try this!"
5/22/2015,20150522,1,4.41,"1. The Coconut Soda was served warm with no ice! ( they don't carry ice!)2. I don't even know how to start talking about the greasy gloves! 3. The Cold Broccoli SALAD was just cold broccoli, no frills and a $1.00 extra for butter.4. The red beans and rice are step below Zatarain's."
5/26/2015,20150526,4,4.41,"Love this place! Food is tasty, staff is friendly, and the restaurant is comfortable and fun. And now that it's summer, their back yard is open so you can eat seafood the way it's meant to be eaten."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.42,"Don't pass up an opportunity to eat at Lo Lo's! This unpretentious, colorful little jewel serves up food with down-home personality that you won't forget. The ribs are to die for, the dipping sauce perfect. The crab & shrimp were supremely tasty. You choose the sauce, good luck just picking one. Taste the pineapple salsa at the self-serve table-- you can dip anything in this one. All the sides we tried were delicious-- Lo Lo's fries, omg! The corn is absolutely celebratory, the dirty rice perfect, the Johnny cakes fun, and I didn't expect the seared cauliflower to be so good! Plantain chips are beyond belief. Wish we had tried the conch fritters & crab dip-- next time! I think Lo Lo's will be a tradition for us now, every time we come to NY to see family. Love the colorful, cheerful decor, and the entire staff was friendly & attentive, the service perfect. Sweet outdoor seating in the back. Easily accessed by bus & subway stop right outside the door. Oh yeah, and refreshingly affordable."
6/2/2015,20150602,5,4.42,"LoLo's is one of my favorite spots in the area. The food: Always amazing - we usually go for the steam pots and have never been disappointed. If you're really hungry, you may want to double up though; they are somewhat on the small side. All the sides are great too. Just recently tried the softshell crab sandwich special and that might be my new favorite.The atmosphere: The first time I walked in and they were playing reggie Pink Floyd, I fell in love. This is a no-frills place, but they keep it clean and nice. There's a surprising amount of seating for how small it is. In the back are a few communal tables, and they just opened the backyard area. The staff is always really friendly as well."
6/2/2015,20150602,4,4.42,"Overall this place has a great location and the food is tasty. They need to work out some of the service kinks but that will smooth out over time. The servers were a bit confused bringing orders to tables and making sure everyone got the right order. I ordered the shrimp, plantains,crabby dip, cauliflower and shark bake. All were delicious ! I would definitely go back"
6/3/2015,20150603,4,4.41,LoLo's a GoGo's. Very very tasty. Will definitely go back and this time I'll sit and try the rest of the menu. Shark and Bake. Delicious. Crisp cabbage and peppa sauce that had just enough heat. The bake was wonderful. Smoked wings fell off the bone good. LoLo's honored my free plantains with first order offer. Con: A little pricey but I'll go again and had to wait until 4pm to enjoy.
6/4/2015,20150604,4,4.41,"Dear Skai,My boyfriend works for the NY times and I saw your review in the paper and I had been meaning to check it out. So I went for my birthday looking forward to trying it out again"
6/5/2015,20150605,4,4.4,"Oh so good! Space is a little. Tight but the food makes up for that. Some of the most unique (to me) seafood dishes. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
6/8/2015,20150608,4,4.4,"We visited LoLo's yesterday, and it really was amazing. The food was reminiscent of food we've had in the Florida Keys but in the city! The Conch Fritters were delicious and everything I had hoped they would be. My boyfriend had the jerk ribs, and he said they were great. We also ordered LoLo's fries, and they were pretty yummy as well. We got the plantains free for checking in, and they were the best we've had anywhere! Gave it four stars for their outdoor seating. While it was nice to sit outside, it was a little dingy. Food far outweighed that though!"
6/13/2015,20150613,5,4.4,"Just left Lolo's. Great addition to the neighborhood and wish I had discovered it sooner. We had the fries with Jalape√±os and Cotija cheese, wings, corn on the cob, and crab legs with garlic and old bay seasoning. We loved everything and the wings are a must have. Service was super friendly and it was such a cute place. We cannot wait to go back again soon and get the ribs. Happy to see they're on seamless too."
6/13/2015,20150613,4,4.4,The crab bake sandwich is ridiculous. Seriously mouthwatering goodness. The back patio is so nice and super chill. I wanna come back and get all the sammies. Conch fritters were good but the sandwiches killed the fritters the people next to us were raving about the crab legs and the wings!! Try it you will be happy
6/17/2015,20150617,5,4.41,"I went here on a brunch date & at first, I was skeptical about eating here. My date & I had ordered our food. I forget what he ordered, but I remembered having the Crab Cake Bake! *Gasps & clutching pearls* I've died & gone to heaven! Then, we shared the wings with the sesame seeds! Oh my sweet Jesus! I recommend you guys check this place out! Reasonably priced & worth the trip to Harlem!"
6/27/2015,20150627,5,4.41,"I was not disappointed at all, my co workers took me to this place after work and it's the best caribbean seafood fusion place ever. I had the shark and bake with the help check in plantains and fries. It was too delicious, the salsa verde and pineapple salsa are amazing condiments. Service is good and it's nice seating in the back"
7/3/2015,20150703,3,4.4,I was so looking forward to eating here and was disappointed. Lobster roll and Salmon bake was not what I expected. .home made bread was rather dry and not to flavorful. Wings just tasted grilled but with no flavor. The best thing was the durty rice amd the Honey Sweet Potatoes.
7/7/2015,20150707,4,4.39,"I'm a big fan so far of MOST of the things I've tried on the menu. Before I tell you what's good and what's totally bangin', let me start off by saying that as a girl who lives for condiments and sauces, Lolo's did me great. There are a variety of house sauces, including: pineapple salsa, habanero sauce, salsa verde, ghost chili sauce and pico de gallo. MMMMM. I'm in heaven having this selection and also, the lime zest remoulaude is crack...not sure what that's like, but damn they've got me hooked.The crab and bake is awesome, deliciously fresh lump crab meat that I find to be perfectly seasoned. It's a tad pricey, but that's to be expected when you get a literal handful of crab between two little, sweet cakes. The fries--both garlic and Lolo's special--are bangin. Obviously, don't complain if you get these to go, they'll absorb some moisture from the container, but I'm very particular about garlic fries and THESE HIT THE SPOT. The corn is wonderful, as is the crabby dip. I have more to try on this menu, for sure, but appreciate their efforts thus far.The wings, I must say didn't thrill me as much as everything else...I have to say considering how flavorful everything else was, they left me wanting to add something to that sauce. The meat was tender, but the wings and sauce were bland. I like the sesame seeds, but would like to see the flavor profile stepped up a notch on that sauce. Has great potential, and I think Lolo's has won me over as a customer, but I'd like to give everything else on the menu a try and let them know how I feel...since we're neighbors and all. Until we meet again."
7/11/2015,20150711,5,4.4,We went there today for dinner and it is the best seafood place we have been to. The shrimp in the garlic old bay sauce was amazing as well as the Johnny cakes and rice and beans. Can't wait to go back again!!! We also sampled the sweet plantains and they were delicious!!! What a great place service was awesome too!! You need to try this place you will not be disappointed!!

Went with my family, and I had the soft-shell crab sandwich, and fried smelts, The others who dinned ordered crab cake + bake, belizean conch fritters and johnny cakes. Everything was sooo good, I couldn't get enough of the pico de gallo, and pineapple salsa. Very casual appearance on the outside, small. You order your food in the front and there is seating in the rear of the cooking area, plus down the stairs and outside in the back of the restaurant. They will serve you if you are not taking food out. (not wheelchair accessible). Will return."

The portion of fries was huge for me but it was great. Definitely coming back again."

7/25/2015,20150725,4,4.36,"The food was ok...I am west indian and I felt that everything needed salt. Loved the ambience and the staff. I gave it 4 stars because I felt that the service is spectacular and different, but I am a tough critic when it comes to west indian food."
7/26/2015,20150726,4,4.36,"YUM!Someone referred me to this spot. I don't know a lot about authentic Jamaican flavor profiles. But my taste buds do know delicious food! I took my daughter and we enjoyed our shrimp steam pots featuring GIGANTIC peel and eat shrimp! The Johnny Cakes were a perfect side note and the fried plantains were soooo good!We ate outside in the back! Nice colorful and open space that feels beach side.WE LOVED LOVED LOVED our food and our service! It was a hot day, so the complimentary lemon water pitchers were welcomed and made us feel right at home."

7/28/2015,20150728,3,4.34,"My date & I had our 1st date here. We were so in the mood for fish & chips. Overall the experience was good. We sat in the back, outside. It was almost like stepping into a new world. Kinda nice. A shack in the outskirts of the carribean where the locals eat, if you ignore the huge tenament building & don't look up! LOL I had a fish sandwich, (i think it was catfish).. my date had crab cakes, we ordered garlic fries to share & redeemed a check-in coupon for free plaintains. We loved the sandwiches. But the fries were processed & oily.... for $5/order they should be freshly cut! Very disappointing!"

7/29/2015,20150729,4,4.33,"Confession: I never make it this far uptown, but my family saw this place on a news segment and wanted to check it out. LoLo's has the feel/decor of a small seafood shack but transported into Harlem. You enter, order and pay at the counter, and your food is brought to you. There is a room in the back with seating, and a quaint backyard outside (down a steep flight of stairs).We ate a bunch of things: the smelt fish and chips, the conch fritters, the soft shell crab and bake, and the crab cake and bake. Loved the fritters and the crab cake and bake--I filled up on fries and had to take my crab cake and bake home, but snacked on it later. Make sure you ask about their specials.Service was great, from the friendly woman behind the counter to the woman who brought our food out and was clearing tables in the backyard. The crew in the kitchen even said goodbye as my family exited. A very welcoming environment. Nice to see new places popping up--I'll make the trip uptown again!"
7/29/2015,20150729,3,4.31,"This place was pretty good. The shrimp steampot was very good, best thing I had and I would definitely order it again. The conch fritters were very underwhelming. The corn was interesting, looks very unhealthy but isn't bad, I'm sure some people like it. The duty rice was good, I'd definitely order it again.It was nice to sit outside but be away from the busy street. I would say this is a good place to go get some seafood and sit outside."
7/29/2015,20150729,4,4.31,Great space out back makes you feel like you are at a beach shack. Very friendly staff. Peel and eat shrimp is very good.
7/29/2015,20150729,5,4.32,"This is the best food I've ever eaten, seafood or other. I've tried 75% of the menu and every new thing has brought me closer and closer to nirvana. Last time I swear I saw the face of SpongeBob appear to me in a life-changing vision of superior sea knowledge, approving my choice of fishy protein consumption. The conch fritters almost cured my schizophrenia except for the SpongeBob thing. 5/5 would highly recommend."
7/29/2015,20150729,5,4.32,The Shark Sandwich is hands down the greatest thing to eat in all of Harlem. Definitely worth the trip to 116th Street!

7/30/2015,20150730,5,4.33,"I have never heard of or had any better seafood in all of the city. Really enjoyed the shark sandwich, and all of my friends enjoyed their meals as well. Would definitely recommend!"
8/2/2015,20150802,5,4.33,"SO AMAZING!!I've been wanting to come here for a few weeks now and so glad I finally got a chance to check it out. If you've ever been to The Boil downtown... it's a similar concept, but with even better food and more options! Not to mention the variety of hot sauces to choose from. Must try:- Peppa Boil (includes snow crab legs, shrimp, sweet potatoes and corn) with the special sauce. The sauce was amazing - I was tempted to drink it.- Garlic fries. Fresh fries tossed with a roasted garlic cream. ahhh so good.- Plantains with cojita cheese and lime- Roasted cauliflower+ finish it all off with a ginger beer!!*** the verdict: a must try for anyone in the Harlem area, and worth the trip for anyone who isn't!! ps. there's even precious outdoor seating for the 3-4 months a year the weather is nice in NY!!n"
8/2/2015,20150802,5,4.34,I've been dying to come here. You won't be disappointed. Yet another amazing new spot in harlem. Can't wait to come back and hang in their backyard
8/5/2015,20150805,5,4.34,"BLACK OWNED BUSINESS! SUPPORT! :)~~~~~~~The first few times I came here, I was drunk. Giggling in after day-drinking in central park or cocktails up the block.But it was good right? Like, really good? But was it really good, or was I sobering up? lol But alas, sobriety kicked in on Saturday night and I made it in clear-headed and empty-stomached, only to confirm my drunken rants....LOLO'S IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I've always enjoyed restaurants with small, concise, smart menu choices. Shows good planning and makes for a less stressed kitchen and better made food. If you love to support black owned business, love to support Harlem, love seafood and Caribbean cuisine, if you like a relaxed vibe and friendly staff I'd definitely recommend Lolo's! :)"
8/5/2015,20150805,5,4.35,"What a find! My husband and I went there on a whim after looking for seafood joints in the neighborhood and seeing other yelper reviews. We had the most fantastic time - the staff are awesome and friendly and helpful and the food was soooo delicious. We ordered the special of mixed boil- shrimp, snow crab, corn and sweet potato with the old bay butter sauce, lolos special fries (with queso and pickled jalape√±os), wings and the crab cake bake. Everything was superb-I honestly wouldn't change a thing - well seasoned, perfectly cooked. The place is super casual and dare I say - a little run down- but it is such a gem! It's one of those situations when I'm torn about writing a review as I want it to thrive so I can eat there all the time, but don't want the world to crowd this special place! Service is a little haphazard - you get the food as it comes after ordering at the counter in the front- but totally worth the wait!! Love!!!"
8/7/2015,20150807,5,4.36,Hidden Gem. Food is really amazing and the atmosphere makes you feel that you are on a much different island. Snow crabs with garlic butter sauce were superb!
8/9/2015,20150809,5,4.36,"Well worth the trip to 116th for this southern boil style stop. Order at the front desk and grab a seat in the back at a picnic table to be served. The mains are modestly sized, but the sides are large so would recommend sharing a few among friends with your main. The plantains are awesome!Don't believe they serve alcohol, but didn't look into it."
8/10/2015,20150810,5,4.37,"Their food is AMAZING. If you're craving some good, fresh, island style food then Lolo's is where you need to be. When I went I had the dutty rice (sooo good) and the sweet plaintains (addictive) as sides and as a main course I had a special that was being offered (snow crab legs, corn, shrimp and sweet potatoes and chose Lolo's special sauce as the seasoning) which was $30. The food was great. The sauce wasnt as spicy as I anticipated but overall it was good. The only cons I would give this establishment is the lack of seating and the ""ran down"" appearance the restaurant has. But, once you get past the appearance the food will definitely win you over. I'm definitely going back & I'll definitely be spreading the word!!"
8/12/2015,20150812,5,4.37,"I love LoLo's. Shark and bake, crab bake, ribs -- all delicious. Go get some. Just a tip: you do want those bakes piping hot and crispy out of the kitchen, so if you take out keep that in mind. Go!"
8/16/2015,20150816,5,4.38,Ate here today. Mind blown. Best Pico de gallo I've had in nyc. Elotes was fire. Shark sandwich was like a party in my mouth. The Verde was also amazing. Definately must try. Their sauce man is killing the game!
8/18/2015,20150818,4,4.37,"I've only had takeout but what I had was really exceptional. I had the shark sandwich, the conch fritters and the corn on the cob. I usually am not a fan of conch and definitely not of anything that's a ""fritter"" because of the batter - but these were so good! Everything tasted so fresh! My first experience trying shark and it was delicious. Highly recommend!"
8/20/2015,20150820,4,4.37,"Scrappy, my friend had called Lolo's and didn't want to eat here. So I came back on my own and well, bf missed some good eats. Lolo's isn't scrappy at all, but a colorfully painted space designed to mimic a rustic seafood shack you'd find in the Caribbean. The front and back of the restaurant is small, with limited seating. There's a charming outdoor garden, for those who want some fresh air with their food. Heading down some stairs leads you to several small tables and benches, and two larger picnic tables. One side has two umbrellas. You order your food upfront, pay and then are given a number. Later, your food gets brought to you. The whole atmosphere is festive, and casual. On a humid day, you can almost imagine you are in the islands, sans the sand and skies. The food, true to it's Caribbean roots, is flavorful, with sides of salsa and sauces available for you to take as much as you can handle. One made from ghost peppers had a real bite. I had the shark sandwich, fried dogfish with a green sauce on a bake. The bake I thought a mite too greasy and tough, chewy, as if it had been made and then re-fried or had been sitting for a while. I didn't like the heavy taste of the baking soda in the bake and didn't taste any of the green vegetable(chive?) that was in the bake.  The dogfish, however, was juicy and succulent and married well with the green sauce and the slivers of slaw. Slathered with some of the ghost pepper sauce, it was delicious. I could have just eaten the dogfish with a side of salad. Yelp check-in gives you a free side of plaintains. Do fried sweet plantains ever taste bad? These were no exception, less greasier and more firm than others I've tasted. They sell Reed's ginger beer here, one of my faves.This is tasty, well flavored Caribbean food, if not the cheapest for the portion size. I thought my sandwich small for $11. If you see in my pics, my sandwich was smaller than the side of plantains. But this is Harlem, rapidly being gentrified and giving the impression of a dive is not being a shanty with dive prices. Note that signs posted do say there is a 45 minute limit at the tables, a gentle reminder that you are not quite on Caribbean time. I absolutely loved the vibe of the garden and would have stayed longer and ordered the conch fritters to try if the bugs weren't feasting on me as I was devouring my food. Two bites before I even finished eating and five welts after I was done. The more bites I suffered, the faster I ate and swatted. If management could stick out some bug repelling lights or candles, dining here would be more pleasurable. I'd come back because I still want to try the conch fritters but I'd seriously consider takeout."
8/25/2015,20150825,4,4.37,"LoLo's was pretty great. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is neat - with tables inside and out. You get a bib and gloves so you don't get too messy. I loved that they had a little bucket of ice in the back room to add to the self serve water.We tried the shrimp and the crab johnny cake sandwich. Both were very tasty. The shrimp were some of the best I have ever had and the crab a unique preparation with the johnny cake. I wasn't crazy about the fries, but the seafood was great! And hey it's not called LoLo's Fries, it's called LoLo's Seafood."
8/25/2015,20150825,3,4.36,This place is way too expensive for the amount of food you get. The food is ok. The wings are probably the best but don't think I'll be coming back.
8/28/2015,20150828,5,4.36,"Delicious!! Visited LoLo's with friends for the first time and it was absolutely great! I'm a southern gulf coast girl who knows seafood and this was some of the best I've had in a while. I had the snow crab legs with LoLo's sauce which were great; my friends had the crab cake sandwich, fries and crab dip which they also loved. In addition to the great food, the folks at LoLo's were awesome. Customer service was amazing, will def be back!"
8/29/2015,20150829,3,4.35,"I came here the other day during late lunch. We ordered the shark + bake lunch box (includes corn and durty rice) , lobster roll, garlic fries, and the wings. The highlight of the meal was the corn and the wings. The corn was seasoned like mexican street corn and who doesn't love that? The wings were flavorful and delicious and they were piping hot when we got them. The rest of the meal seemed like it may have been sitting for a little while (at least the fries did). The fries were good, but not outstanding. I wasn't impressed with the shark + bake (first time I've had this kind of sandwich) or lobster roll. I felt like the vegetables and sauces overpowered the sandwich and didn't really taste the seafood as much in either of the two. If you put those two in front of me, I would definitely eat it. It wasn't bad. I just wouldn't go there to order those things again. I also was not a fan of the rice. Again, not bad, just not flavorful enough for me to want to order it again. I would probably go back for wings and corn and garlic fries. The food runner was nice and friendly enough. There wasn't a waiter that we ordered with (not sure if that's how it normally is), so we ordered in the front. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to someone, but I would not try to dissuade someone from trying it out. It just wasn't for me."
9/3/2015,20150903,5,4.36,"Well-seasoned seafood! Loved the softshell crab sandwich on johnny cakes, plantain, and garlic fries."
9/5/2015,20150905,5,4.36,"This looks unprepossessing from the street but the food and the back yard are fantastic so persevere people!The staff are lovely, the free plantains with a Yelp check-in are wonderful and the music (reggae covers of pink Floyd) is memorable"
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.37,Loved it. Great vibe. It's very casual. We ordered up front and ate outside on a picnic table. They did forget one of our orders which was a pain but it was fine. Get the crab legs!! Soooo good!!

9/7/2015,20150907,4,4.36,"Almost 4.5 stars. As of this review, I've been to Lolo's 3 times. Things I love: -Their outdoor seating in the backyard. Makes me feel like I'm out of the city. -Their salmon and bake. Prefer it to the bake and shark, which was a bit chewy, almost rubbery when I got it. Like that the salmon is steamed and the sauce that comes with it complements it well.-The honey butter in their johnny cakes. yum. yum. yum. Love honey butter on most things.Things that can be improved: -The fries can be hit or miss. The first time I got the garlic fries, it was ridiculously oily. Literally had to squeeze oil out of it. The second time I got it, there was less oil, but it was still oily. -The plantains were meh. Much too soft and oily. The cojita cheese sprinkled on it does nothing for the plantains. Wish they'd come up with a better, more creative dish with plantains.-The sauces you can help yourself to should came with larger self serve containers. The ones they provide are super tiny. Even better, make sauces available at every table. As I've been to Lolo's three times already in the span of a month, I'm clearly a fan. The little tweaks I mentioned could make this place even better. Could see myself giving Lolo's 5 stars if tweaks are made."
9/15/2015,20150915,4,4.36,"Dope little seafood shack, gives you that I'm in Jamaica getting that real deal feel. Crab cake sandwhich which comes on the Johnny cakes are phenomenal, dutty rice isn't bad and the shrimp with garlic sauce was too litt!!Food is good but a bit expensive when you look at the portions they give. All in all it's a good spot and would def eat againOOOOOOOOOOOH forgot the plaintains are bomb too!!"
9/15/2015,20150915,4,4.36,"Lovely black-owned business in Harlem. Friendly waitstaff, chill environment and great food to boot! Would definitely recommend. I had the fritters and garlic fries for my first go at this place - fritters were something special; garlic fries I will pass on for next time (emphasis, on the fact that there will be a next time!)"
9/18/2015,20150918,5,4.36,"This joint is the BOMB!!!.... Thank you ""I Don't Do Clubs"" for putting together this Black-Owned Restaurant Month...Ordered Dishes that I absolute LOVE... 1) Avocado Bake (so fresh)2) Side of sweet plantains 3) Crab legsPls look at the pictures for other choices...Bon app√©tit!!!"
9/18/2015,20150918,5,4.36,"This is exactly what uptown needed! Now I don't have to travel all the way to City Island for great crab. The crab legs, and softshell crab sandwich are so delicious. My friend got the peppershrimp & we were both ready to drink the old bay & garlic sauce out of the bowl. I love that they give you gloves and wet wipes, real down & dirty & totally worth it. Hope they start serving alcohol soon lol the whole vibe of this place really does make me want to hang there for hours. A great addition to the neighborhood kudos to the staff."
9/20/2015,20150920,4,4.36,Pretty good food here. It was good but it wasn't great. I do feel this is. Hidden gem within harlem as there are many places to go. But nonetheless I would recommend you try it out for yourself. The johnny cakes were amazingggg though!
9/22/2015,20150922,2,4.35,"I've gone to Lolo's a few times over the last several months. I've always found them to be a little over priced for the portion size you receive. But, I was okay with it because it was tasty and fresh. Not to mention there's not a lot of competition for Caribbean style seafood in the area. However, I'm noticing a drop in taste and quality. I always get the broccoli salad. There's not much to it but olive oil, lemon and some salt. It's always been tasty and satisfying but my last 2 orders were disappointing. Broccoli no longer that vibrant green color. Clearly over cooked and lacking in taste. My garlic fries were salty and the salmon bake also lacked flavor. But just to add insult to injury the prices have gone up. This place is starting to fall off."

9/24/2015,20150924,5,4.33,"Let me preface this by saying we (diners) are of Caribbean descent. Saw this place on the news, read up on it, saw they were running their version of 'Restaurant week.' $35 for an appetizer, a side sigh, a sandwich, and either shrimp or crawfish. My aunt and I were overdue for a dinner out. We met up and this place was a legit hole-in-the-wall. We were tempted by Streetbird right across the street. I told her if it didn't work out, we would go there. So we walk in, and there are lots of colors going on, and it really does look about the side of a small chinese take out spot. The front end guy asked if it was our first time, we said yes. He immediately gave us the promo menu and asked if we had questions. I ordered the conch fritters (conch!), bake and shark, fries, and shrimp in garlic and old bay. Shark is very rarely seen on a menu, and i absolutely take the opportunity when i can. My aunt got the smoked wings, salmon and bake, the rice, and shrimp in ginger sauce. We went through a super narrow hall, saw 2 benches, but my aunt insisted on sitting outside. so we sat at park benches outside (it's an outdoor picnic style set up.) Brings the conch and wings. The wings are not hot- they are smoked. I have 0 idea how they got that level of smokey flavor into those wings without them being dry. I pause, go inside, and get a sampling of all the hot sauces. Gotta be adventurous right? back to table, my aunt mixes habernero and ghost and puts it on the wings. awesome. The fritters, oh what can I say. Sweet corn, dried cod fish and conch fried in rice flour. What does rice flower do? STAY CRISPY! That is a really old school trick my grandmother uses. Kudos. The remoulade they served with it- I could have drank that stuff. Then the shrimp came in the little baggies and we were given surgical gloves. At this point, I can see how they keep costs down- no fancy dishes or anything. Paper containers, plastic silverware. So we open the bag, and the shrimp are huge. 7 shrimp made up the 1/2 pound. The shell was on them, and we opted for no gloves. I ate them with the shell-on- the sauce has seeped between the shell and shrimp and was wonderful The shrimp was sweet and not overcooked. You can always tell when a sauce is 'hiding' poor quality ingredients- not the case here. My aunt's shrimp was mildly gingery, definitely not overwhelming. It was a nice hint. We dumped the bag out into our little paper tray and ate off eachother. Let me interject and say, there was barely any salt on anything. For something with old bay, and the rice and everything, there wasn't a crazy amount of salt. The rice was perfectly cooked in coconut milk and had black-eye peas and kidney beans. This is not my favorite type of rice, but I know when it has been made well. The fries were good- they had something on them, for the life of me, i cant identify, but yummy.We gave up on the sandwiches and took them home. I reheated mine (I know, bad idea.) The bake was sweet and fluffy even after reheating, and had scallions in the dough. Let it be said, I love bake. My grandmother makes it once a week for either breakfast or dinner. This bake was as flavorful and sweet as hers. Bigger, but just the same. There were 3 generous pieces of fried shark fillet, salsa verde, and cabbage, and tomato (yes, i removed prior to heating up!) The shark was flaky and sweet. I will say, on our way out, the front desk guy gave us loyalty cards- 10 visits and you get $10 off. Um, awesome?! Already planning on bringing my mom on Sunday!Only suggestion (and i know its not their fault, they are still in the process)- a liquor licence would be great. Nothing would beat a nice beer with our food. That being said, their beverage selection is good, with my favorite brand of ginger beer. Def coming back!!!"
9/26/2015,20150926,5,4.34,"I was hesitant to tell folks about this place at first because I knew it would catch fire, but I can't help but share. LoLo's is my uptown go-to. The flavors are fresh and exotic, service is fast, and the staff is lovely. Must try's - conch fritters (never had a more flavorful fritter in mah life and my family is Caribbean), shark bake, steam pot (I always get the shrimp, but I also recommend the Crab legs, as they soak up more of the sauce flavor - personal fav, LoLo's sauce!!!), and the Lo Lo's fries. Lawd have mercy. Atmosphere is super laid back. You order your food in the front and snag a table in the back or downstairs in the beachy patio area. I don't think they have cocktails yet, so you may wanna grab a quick one at Harlem Tavern then step on over. Bon app√©tit mes amis. Hope you love it as much as I do!"
9/28/2015,20150928,5,4.34,"I have been trying to recreate the food ever since I left NYC!! This place is a must do. Don't wear your fancy clothes, it's not necessary, but bring you appetite.The food is to die for. I am a restaurant snob and a picky eater but I have been dreaming about this place ever since I got back to Chicago. It will be my first stop when I return."
9/29/2015,20150929,5,4.35,"Lolo's is lovely. I had the crab legs and shrimp. Both were cooked to perfection. So delighted to find this little seafood gem in Harlem. And as someone from Maryland, I know good seafood. The ambiance at LoLo's is welcoming and comfy, you literally feel like you are having a seafood feast in a relatives backyard."
9/29/2015,20150929,4,4.34,"Decor is adorable! We ordered for pick up and the food was warm, well-spiced, and packed conveniently for us to take - they even included gloves with our crab legs/steamed shrimp to prevent a mess!Crab legs were meaty and extremely fresh and the shrimp were large and well seasoned. no complaints at all!"
10/1/2015,20151001,5,4.35,i love this place!!!!!! if you haven't tried lolo's yet it's a must!!!! trust me you won't be dissapointed. everything on the menu is delicious
10/2/2015,20151002,4,4.35,"I was in a crab leg mood so my bestie and I drove to Harlem to check out Lolos. This place is legit mad small, I believe previously it was a chinese take out spot (I peeped the gate that's right by the ordering counter). They've definitely utilized the space to its fullest capacity though as there is seating in almost every nook and cranny. Two seater table here, a communal table towards the back, small seating area in the front; They've made the most of the space fa sho! They also have an outdoor patio with lots of bench style tables (we didn't check it out bc of the rain) that I'm positive gets super crowded in the warmer months. The vibe inside is warm and welcoming with an authentic Belizean feel (I heard the owner is from Belize). The colors are vibrant, framed photographs and a few paintings are hung along the walls with some awesome reggae tunes playing in the background. We placed our orders with Jose who btw was mad cool. He looked genuinely happy to be there and was very friendly to us; he also slid us some loyalty cards as we were leaving. 1 lb crab legs (coco curry sauce), one salmon shrimp and broocoli combo, jerk ribs, one cauliflower and sweet potato sandwich on their infamous Johnny cakes, and two Yelp check offers for free plantains. We were given a number and found a table in the back.The food came out very quickly and we tore everything up. The salmon, shrimp and broccoli combo was great! The salmon was broiled to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist and flaky on the inside. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and the broccoli was drenched in all the drippings from the salmon and shrimp which made it crazy good; I would most definitely order that again. Cauliflower and sweet potato Johnny cake sandwich was deliciousness. The sweetness from the sweet potatoes were a nice contrast to the charred goodness of the cauliflower. My crab legs were good but the curry sauce was a bit overwhelmed with coconut milk. I'm not a huge cojita cheese fan so the plantains were just ok to me. Only thing missing is the alcohol! I was told their in the process of getting their liquor license so hopefully by the beginning of the year they should be offering those options.Lolos is a great spot, in my opinion more so for the locals and take out. It seems like an amazing summer chill spot especially with it being in a highly populated area in Harlem."
10/3/2015,20151003,3,4.34,"I live in Philly and when ever I go to Ny I generally check yelp to see the best rated spots. If you want to see photos of my food check my photo page on my profile.( I can't seem to load photos on my general photo page but I will try again) Here's the deal I got the smoked chicken wings and the garlic fries. I do think the chicken wings were different it just seemed like when you take a bite out the first part it doesn't come off the bone enough for me but I would still recommend. I love fries there garlic fries were a little different because there were moist like they put a garlic sauce on them. I'm not sure if I like moist fries .My sister tasted them and she said they have a plantain after taste. I know they sell Plantains, but I wonder if they share the same oil. My sister had the shrimp with butter four stars and the corn on the cob four stars. The only thing I would highly suggest to the owners THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THAT FRONT WINDOW IT IS HIDEOUS. EVEN IF THEY ADD HIGH QUALITY PHOTOS OF THERE FOOD .OR A NEW WINDOW IT JUST LOOKS OUTDATED. IN PHILLY EVEN SOME OF THE MCDONALD'S HAVE UPDATED THERE LOOK IMAGE IS EVERYTHING."
10/10/2015,20151010,5,4.34,The best cray fish I ever had! The house sauce is amazing. We also got the special blue crab in tamarind lime sauce and conch friters.. The raspberry ginger ale brought it all together
10/13/2015,20151013,5,4.35,This was my FAVORITE restaurant of the summer! I kept looking for excuses to go here and went with lots of different groups of people. I love their pepper sauces and the prices are awesome for the quality of food. I'm sad that I missed out on the BORW deals!
10/14/2015,20151014,5,4.35,Great place. The shrimp was well cooked the fish and chips were well seasoned and the crawfish was delicious. Highly recommend it.
10/17/2015,20151017,5,4.36,"Dont let the outside appearance fool you. It looks sketchy from the outside but its totally a legit place once you walk in. I didn't check out the entire place but just from the front of the establishment the place looks clean.My first time here. Both the gentlemen behind the counter were friendly and helpful. They gave of samples of the special sauce and the plantains to help my bf and I place our order. Great customer service. I ordered the shrimp, salmon and broccoli basket which was good. Enough food to full me up but not overstuffed. My bf had the jerk chicken basket which he enjoyed. There is free lemon infused water off to the side.The only downside is the establishment isn't big enough for the amount of people that were coming in."
10/21/2015,20151021,3,4.35,"Ok so I called for delivery an they only have a 5 block radius for delivery so that sucks, so i got a pick up I got home I opened my bag and plated my basket jerk chicken dirty rice an a Johnny cake a side of plantain chips with mango salsa they only fill 25% of the ramekin with salsa so cheap. The Johnny cake wasn't that good to oily an greasy I throw it out but the rest of the food was delicious. You guys need to delivery further your food is really good think about it."
10/23/2015,20151023,5,4.35,"Just get everything with Lolo sauce. Crab dip was questionable at best, but everything else was a must order"
10/26/2015,20151026,5,4.35,"I had the broiled salmon on Johnny cakes...AMAZING!!! Between the crisp cakes, the succulent salmon and the satisfying salsa, there were so many layers of flavor and texture! Heaven is in Harlem!!"
10/31/2015,20151031,4,4.35,"Great food, get's you full off not too much money, and loved the free plantains that they gave with the Yelp offer.The ambiance was by no means ""cutesy"", nor was it particularly elegant. However, I think the roughness made it a great location to grab a late-afternoon lunch (in this case 3:30pm). The rice was nothing special; honestly think collegiate dining hall. However I did really like the plantains (fried plantains can't really go wrong) and the fact they were free made it so much better. The crab cake sandwich was not particularly crabby, but it was also not particularly expensive so it passes muster.All in all, its not a ""must-go"" location, if you are rolling through the area, its quite a good choice to grab a bite to eat."
10/31/2015,20151031,5,4.36,"Food is so great and staff is very friendly. Really original recipes with caribbean roots ! The term ""shack"" is appropried for the decoration and ambiance, with counter ordering and seating in a room in the back or in an exterior patio. Music is nice too. I highly recommend"
11/6/2015,20151106,5,4.36,"I saved this place on my list of ""places to try"" after seeing pics of the food on a blog page. It was definitely worth the trek uptown after work on a Friday night. Cute little place! You order (and pay) in the front and then seat yourself in the back (inside or outside) and they'll bring you your food. I had the Pom Pom shrimp and garlic fries as well as the sweet plantain. All delicious! I will be back to try the conch fritters among other things. My only wish is that the music was less ""hipster tries to produce reggae"" and more ""Caribbean native actually made this soundtrack""."
11/7/2015,20151107,5,4.36,"A hole in the wall place in west Harlem! We love the snow crab leg, shrimp and crawfish. The ribs and crab cake sandwich were awesome too! Would love to try more stuff next time=)"
11/13/2015,20151113,5,4.37,"I've been to Lolo's a couple of times and I'm always impressed. Unfortunately it's rained every time I've gone, but I'm looking forward to checking out the back patio. Food is delicious and really affordable, and service is great. Skai is very personable and the staff is all very nice. Highly recommend."
11/14/2015,20151114,5,4.37,"Everything, I mean everything is good! Soft shell crab sandwich! Crab dip! Snow crab boil! Peel n eat shrimp boil! Jerk chicken! Dirty rice! Mm mm Do urself a favor and get the lolos special sauce. We went at 6:30 on a Saturday and didn't have a problem getting a seat. U order at the window n then the waitress brings it out and ties ur bib on to keep you from getting the deliciously messy food on you. We are already planning a trip back for the soft shell crab sandwich!"
11/20/2015,20151120,5,4.38,"Nothing beats the food at this place. They've catered several meetings we've had at my work place, and it gets rave reviews each time! We keep ordering from them by popular demand! There's not a single bad item on the menu! I even went to the restaurant in person to try it all for myself, and wow wow wow! Do yourself a favor, get the plantains and shark sandwich. You'll thank me later!Five stars for customer service, too!"
11/20/2015,20151120,4,4.37,"Great sandwiches! Great vibe! I wish I could go there more often!!! As soon as I arrived, they offered me the plantain, So good and I admit I am not a big plantain fan! Then, I ordered the salmon sandwich. Really really good. I am not giving 5 stars because the bread was very oily but if I forget the oil, then the salmon was just amazingly grilled! Hiwever, I need to admit that the service was very slow. While the place was empty, it took them more than 20 minutes to prepare my sandwich... that was very annoying..."
11/28/2015,20151128,5,4.38,"This was an amazing experience. Jeremy we enjoyed meeting you. Friendly staff, the crabby dip, the Lolo's curry ginger coconut butter sauce that the snow crab legs came in made for great dipping for my Johnny cakes, the sweet plantains were excellent. Can't wait to go back. My friend and I shared, for $21 each it was a lot of food for us 2"
11/29/2015,20151129,5,4.38,"I ordered the Salmon sand which without the green sauce and it was amazing. I usually get the crispy shark. My boyfriend got snow crab legs in coco curry and bread for dipping (OMG). Love the low key look of this place. The garlic fries and plantain chips to dip in ALL of their homemade sauces (usually on display) is extra yummy. Just overall good, consistently. Which matters the most to us."
12/1/2015,20151201,5,4.39,Amazing food! Amazing outdoor back patio. Inventive menu and a great new Harlem staple. They're also great for catering and take-out. We order them all the time at our office!
12/9/2015,20151209,3,4.38,"Have to take away one star because I was expecting the same ""wow"" factor that I experienced several months ago. I ended up here last night very unexpectedly and ordered the plantains, which were still beautifully done and a crab cake and bake sandwich.I love that the Johnny cakes are made-to-order, but when I received my sandwich, my cakes were cold. Meh...OK, but the crab cake inside wasn't as full of crabby flavor as the other times I'd ordered it. Didn't ask for much else, because I wasn't so hungry and couldn't even finish my meal. I hope they return to the greatness that once made me a regular at Lolo's. I hear they'll be opening up for lunch every day by March 2016. That's nice, but they should always bring their A-game because when they do, they're f*ckin' awesome! I"
12/11/2015,20151211,2,4.36,"I'm a huge fan of boils and all seafood. I had the crab leg boil here which really paled in comparison to Claw Daddys and the Boil. There is also no alcohol. My group sat out back -- very cool they they have an outdoor area. Unfortunately, it was super dark. There were some lights around and some broken candles on our table -- we could barely see our food. Would not come back."
12/30/2015,20151230,3,4.36,"The idea of visiting a true Caribbean seafood shack was very promising. The menu sounded very good but it was far from it. The fish was more of an afterthought on the smelt and chips dish as it was more fries than fish and fries should of been home cut to give it that homemade feel. The conch fritters were more dough than conch and bland. Shark & bake was good. So at was graciously friendly & hospitable, but For the price, food needs improvement."
12/31/2015,20151231,5,4.36,"Five stars because it's the best of what it aims to be: delicious, with practical and friendly shack style. Mostly I return often to restaurants only if they are fairly priced and offer delicious fare that, for whatever reason, I can't replicate at home. Mysteriously scrumptious for me personally are LoLo's steampot combos. I've sopped up the sauce with the leftover corncob, feeling like a greedy slob, or a refugee (while pretending to myself that I'm just a waste-not-want-not-er), but it turns out that I am far from alone in this behavior. The cauliflower is another winner. It seems simple but what is that subtly-flavored deliciousness? Conch fritters, smelts, fries all excellent. That's all I've tried so far. I've more to explore on their menu. Super-friendly staff."
1/2/2016,20160102,1,4.34,"So disappointed! After reading all the reviews on here, I was eager to try the food. Everything I ordered tasted so bland. The food wasn't even average. I got the conch fritters which had no conch or taste for that matter. The garlic fries were just freezer fries no garlic taste either. I also order the crab dip and jerk ribs and it was same quality as the other items. Will never order from here again."
1/4/2016,20160104,4,4.34,"A must try!! Super friendly staff and awesome food!Highly recommend the coconut shrimp (comes with fries). Probably some of the best that I've tried. Wonderful flavor and texture (both the shrimp and fries).The shrimp in their ginger cilantro sauce is also very good! Try dipping the fries into the sauce because it's a perfect pairing! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had amazing flavor! Grabbed a free plantain order with the checkin but sadly it wasn't for me. I think the plantains weren't ripe enough but that could just be me. Also tried their cauliflower and surprisingly I liked it as well. Mildly tender but still had a crisp and goes very well with their sauce. The soft shell crab sandwich was also a very popular items but I think it could use some improvement. The flavor was good but the crab itself was just way to oily. Overall, I had a great lunch here and will be coming back in the future."
1/7/2016,20160107,5,4.34,This was my first time at this establishment. The service was excellent and the food was as well. I receiveced my order very quickly and it was hot and delicious !! Please check this place out if you everhave the chance.  I will be bsck!
1/9/2016,20160109,3,4.33,"Let me first start by saying I've been wanting to try Lolo's since they opened I just never got around to it. I saw a gilt voucher a few months ago and said I guess here's my opportunity. Location: perfect right off the B, C train on 116th. Ambiance: island seafood shack feel. It's like you have been transported to another place. It's pretty small inside. Which should be expected . The height of the table and chairs were a little werid to me. We were sitting at a four person table and two chairs were for me to short to sit at the table and the other two chairs were somewhat high. Food: so here's where things get a little dicey. Not for me but my date. So the gilt voucher allowed us to get 1 shared appetizer we chose the chicken wings. Those wings were absolutely delicious. I practically ate all of them by myself. We both got to choose an entree. I chose the shrimp and my date chose the crawfish. My shrimp were good they were huge. I tried my dates crawfish and it was okay. That was my first time having crawfish and honestly I just didn't like putting in the work to get to the meat lol. But my date was a pro and I watched him crack those things quickly. We both also got to choose a sandwich. . I orginally was going to get the shark since that's what I heard was the best but I decided to get the crab cake sandwich. I told my date about how I had read some great reviews about the shark sandwich so he said he would get it.... my sandwich crab cake was good. The shark here where things get a lil HAIRY. So at this point I am practically done with my food. I ate all the wings myself except for one lol. They were really good . My date was eating somewhat slow because he still had crawfish and his sandwich. The shark sandwich that he had not even opened or touched yet. So when he decides to take the sandwich to take a bite after the second bite I noticed this mortified look on his face. I said what happened he was so quiet he just started pulling a hair from his mouth that he almost ate with the sandwich. I felt so bad. So he is pretty much traumatized lol so i said well let's tell the waitress and maybe they could make him another sandwich etc. So the waitress apologized offered to try to come up with some resolution. Which was nice. My date wanted no parts of that though he actually was so bothered by what had happen that he literally lost his appetite. Trust me when I say this man never turns down food. I convinced him to at least get the wings. So they got him the wings, brought out some dirty rice and they even replaced his orginal sandwich. The man still didn't eat so i made him take it home. I get it sometimes things like this happen. But no one ever wants to be the person that gets the dish with the hair in it. I liked the way it was handled by the waitress. As we were leaving the owner actually asked us how our meal went she didn't realize we were the ones that had experienced the hair incident. She then offered to return the money for the sandwich but I said no we had already got all this food that probably go to waste and I of course liked my food. Anyway her in my date were kind of going back in forth for a little bit. She pretty much was saying that all of their food is made fresh at the establishment and sometimes these things happen. Almost trying to minimize what happened. I get it defend your ish. I would have. Probably done the same anyway i think she got offended when my date said that when he bit the sandwich and found the hair it was a little bit disconcerting.Anyway would I come back I don't know. Maybe if I get a taste for some seafood."
1/11/2016,20160111,5,4.34,"I LOVE LoLo's! It's such a personal place for me, I only take the people I love. It's like my little secret I can share with dear friends and family and for some reason every other customer and employee seems to feel like family and friends too. It's the vibe this restaurant gives off, such a happy delicious low key place to eat!"
1/11/2016,20160111,4,4.34,"Food is good and always made to order once your seated. The service is friendly. The only thing missing is the liquor license, which from what I understand is coming soon."
1/13/2016,20160113,4,4.33,"My boyfriend and I are HOOKED! Gimme some jerk ribs, some rice and beans, a crab cake sandwich, some corn on the cob and we are good to go!This place is great for a quick bit, pick-up or delivery. Really yummy Caribbean food.I love this place, I would say it is a bit expensive though. As you order all smaller portions, dinner for 2 can easy run up to $50. Which for dinner at home I personally find pricy. They do try to make it up every now and then by throwing in a free order or rice or another side, which is appreciated.Amazing Harlem spot!"
1/14/2016,20160114,4,4.33,"I'd read about this place months ago, but was a bit nervous to make the far trek uptown for what seemed to be a limited seating situation. Alas a friend dragged me and another friend to Harlem to run some errands on a late Friday afternoon and we finished up with one goal in mind: food.We arrived at 4 or 5 pm and that was by far our best decision. At that time there was ample seating. You order at the counter, get a number, take a seat and your food is brought to you. I like to think that we ordered a medley of well seasoned goodness. I was happy with everything. I likely could have gone with larger portions, but this worked. This is definitely a summer destination as you do feel like your in a Caribbean shack and the indoor seating is pretty limited, so it's best left for a day to leisurely eat outdoors."
1/16/2016,20160116,5,4.34,This is my first time here and it is a quaint little place. The food is delicious. I will definitely come here again and recommend customers. I had the salmon and shrimp with broccoli and my fiance had the crab legs with shrimp and sweet potatoes and corn on the cob. Also we had 2 orange Fanta sodas
1/16/2016,20160116,4,4.33,"I got a Groupon deal for 1 appetizer, 1/2 lb of shrimp, 1 pom pom shrimp and two soda for $25. so we stopped by on a Thursday night. The place was empty and the service was excellent. We order the Groupon deal plus an extra 1/2 lb of shrimp. We then took our number and sat in the back. This is a really cute little place and the food was delicious. For the appetizer, we got the crabby dip (normally $9) which packed so much flavor in it. I loved it, especially with the plantain chips flavored with curried powder. Omg I can eat that all day.  The 1 lb of shrimp that we got was also more than enough, it was small but the shrimps itself was a pretty good size (normally $9.95 for 1/2lb).  The Pom Pom shrimp (normally $16) was also delicious but the fries was not anything special. The deal that we got ($25) plus $10 for 1/2 lb extra shrimp was definitely well worth. This was a meal that full price would be about $50. However, my husband is not sure he would pay full price for the food, given the location and the small bag of shrimps. However, their food and taste were four stars but the price not so much. I would come back again if we can get another deal like this for sure."
1/28/2016,20160128,4,4.33,"This was my first time here with a friend and we'll definitely be back! Its a casual and cozy spot with super nice staff. We were a little worried about the indoor seating but we came at a perfect time and snagged a table. I got the jerk chicken and Johnny cakes, they really put their own spin on the dish. And the Johnny cakes were awesome! My friend got the salmon and broccoli-she loved it! Perfect amount and the ginger scallion sauce was very well balanced. Not too much for the non ginger loves lol"
1/30/2016,20160130,2,4.32,"Food was bland, the garlic butter sauce was the best thing I had.....the conch fritters were tasteless and chewyThe crab legs were OKMy soft shell crab sandwich was OK not good not great but ok"
1/31/2016,20160131,5,4.32,"The food at this tiny gem on 116th Street is absolutely superb. We had the Shrimp Boil, Fried Smelts with Garlic Fries, Jerk Ribs, Wok-Seared Cauliflower, and Conch Fritters, and each and every one was to die for, and the accompaniments in the form of Ghost Pepper Sauce and Pico de Gallo were deliciously spicy as well, without being overwhelming to the palate. The staff in Lolo's is so friendly and efficient, and though the place is small in the wintertime, the backyard garden makes Lolo's a go-to spot, and a place that is worth the wait if eating-in is what you are after. What a wonderful place to eat!"
2/4/2016,20160204,5,4.33,"We went for my sisters birthday with a deal voucher. It was worth the deal and much more. I will be back and very soon! The service was pleasant and the Food was on point! It was quick with a fresh and flavorful taste. Every bite was perfect. The jerk chicken and rice was so moist, with the right spice. I love Johnny cake but this Johnny cake with honey butter changed the game. Crab legs were fresh and moist. I'll be back for the shark and bake. Everything else was so fresh and MOIST, I know the shark will not be a let down. See you soon lolo"
2/5/2016,20160205,5,4.33,"Definitely worth the trip uptown. Great food. Friendly staff. The jerk chicken, dirty rice and Johnny cakes were superb."
2/6/2016,20160206,5,4.33,"My favorite place around. Great vibe to eat casually inside and food is unique and, more importantly, mouthwatering good. My personal go to is the shark bake sandwich, but also recommend the fried crab and avocado. Love their conch fritters. and sometimes I go for the crawfish. I heard their wings and jerk food is amazing also. Something for everyone, especially beautiful outdoor seating in the summer."
2/7/2016,20160207,5,4.34,"Wow. Just wow. This place has the best crab cake sandwich I've ever had. When I ordered the second one, they gave me a portion of rice for free."

2/11/2016,20160211,5,4.34,I always leave this restaurant satisfied. They have great vegetarian options and the staff is always cheerful and happy to help (shoutout to Jose!). My favorite thing to order is the avocado sandwich with garlic fries around $16 total for both. Plus they have a cute backyard where you can hang in the warmer months.

2/18/2016,20160218,4,4.35,I stopped in for some wings and shrimp after work on Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised with what I was received. I had a friend tell me they had a less than stellar meal here but I had the opposite experience. The wings were juicy and had just the right amount of sauce in them. The shrimp really shined. I couldn't finish everything so I took some home for a late night snack which was delicious. I would like to try some more items on the menu.

There are always samples on the counter and guaranteed, the sample item will become one of your favorites too. Seating is limited but it has that ""island shack"" feeling and the food is so good the size of place doesn't really matter."

2/25/2016,20160225,5,4.35,This restaurant aims to please. They have great service. They greet you with a warm smile and hello upon entering. The specials are posted. They can suggest an appropriate dish to suit your needs. They create homemade sauces that are perfectly paired with each meal. This last time I tried something new in addition to my usual. I ordered the Pom Pom shrimp with garlic fries that melt in your mouth. I ordered coconut shrimp and received a side of the dirty rice. The Johnny cakes and conch fritters. The Johnny cakes had a very unique taste that I could not get enough of. Unfortunately there are only 2 per order. This is why I am going back today and I will make 2 orders! The place is small and quaint a quick in and out to order and eat if you choose. I've done both. There is additional seating in the back.

2/26/2016,20160226,4,4.36,"Last year the BFF and I took a little trip down to St. Martin and St. Maarten to bake in the sun and of course find us some amazing Lolos. This place did not disappoint, a little on the pricier side for the amount of food you get but what do you expect you're in the city. So I happily pay the cashier for an opportunity to relive my travels. The best part of the place is the decor, brightly color picnic tables out back and open air to the NYC sky. What we ate: Crab Legs in Lolo SauceLove the Lolo sauce and of course LOVE the possibility of getting crab legs in the city. At $19 for two clusters I was going to town... sadly i'm a fatty and those two cluster didn't do it for me. So get delighted in their GARLIC FRIES, wonderful garlic friends! Soft shell Crab + BakeTranslation Soft Shell Crab between Johnny Cakes. These Johnny Cakes are different but still tasty!"

3/1/2016,20160301,4,4.35,"The space is BEAUTIFUL here and the staff are really amazing. Very helpful and patient and you can clearly tell they want you to enjoy their food) I got the crispy shark and bake and the plantains that I got from the yelp coupon. The sandwich was good, the homemade sauces they offer are really what make it amazing in my opinion. My one complaint is the 'bread' (a.k.a. Johnny cakes) that it is served on is a little oily, which makes it difficult to eat. I would go back, mainly because of how awesome the setting is, nice communal tables and very comfortable :)"
3/1/2016,20160301,3,4.34,"So my husband and I went on a Saturday. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. So i cant complain about that aspect. However, the food was not so good. I got the crab cake sandwich and a crabby dip. The sandwich was decent, nothing special. But the crabby dip was HORRIBLE. Full of cheese, burnt and not tasty AT ALL. My husband got the lunch box and garlic fries. The fries were ok. He wasn't really impressed by the lunch box. I really wanted to love this place considering that people always provide good feedback about it. But I was left unexpressed."

3/4/2016,20160304,5,4.34,"This tiny ""shack"" of a restaurant made for some delicious seafood! Our Crabby Dip, and fried shrimp, along with curried peel-n-eat shrimp were nothing short of amazing. Plus, I want to give a big shout out to the staff, who were very friendly and helpful. We love this place and will return."
3/5/2016,20160305,4,4.34,"Love the relaxed vibe of the place. You order and pay at the counter, they bring the food out. Highly recommend the conch fritters and steampot boil. I'm sure all the sauces are great - we had the ginger butter and scallion - so good!! Will definitely be coming back."
3/5/2016,20160305,5,4.34,"Wow! Everything we ordered here was good. Loved the conch fritters, the snow crab legs 1lb amazing butter sauce. The crab sandwich on the Johnny cakes was excellent and authentic. The plain rains were good and the sauces were really outstanding. Would def come here again."
3/8/2016,20160308,5,4.34,I love this place it takes great traditional Caribbean food and puts a modern twist to it. I can't wait to go back. I'm just waiting till they get their liquor license.
3/12/2016,20160312,5,4.35,Ok so this is an authentic Caribbean food I highly HIGHLY recommend the shark and bait with rice and peas to die for smaller portions but made with so much love and finesse !!! If your looking for authentic food eat here !!!! You won't regret ... In myOpinion taste better than Negrils
3/17/2016,20160317,4,4.35,"I've walked by many times, finally got around to ordering dinner tonight, delivery. The food came quickly, less than a half hour, was still warm. Three out of four of the things we got were delicious - the conch fritters, the avocado and plantain sandwich and the corn. In fact the corn was a 10+. But the cauliflower was burned and was not tasty. I will definitely get dinner from Lolo's again and we'll eat at the restaurant next time, I just won't get the cauliflower."
3/19/2016,20160319,4,4.34,Took advantage of a Groupon and was very delighted with food received. The pom pom shrimp and fries were great and the crab legs with lolo's special sauce is by far finger licking goodness. Also pulled up yelp and was able to get some plantains. This could have been a 5 star but the prices are on higher side.
3/19/2016,20160319,4,4.34,"I've eaten here a few times and the food has been consistently good. I recently had the crab cake sandwich. Crab cake wasn't your standard crab cake, but that is because it was almost entirely crab! I've only done take out, but I really want to return when it's warm to sit outside. The menu is full of options and I think this place is great for the neighborhood."
3/28/2016,20160328,2,4.33,"Our initial visit to LoLo's wasn't bad. We had avoided this place for awhile because of its divey ambience coupled with the ultra narrow and claustrophobic space. But one day we ordered the coconut shrimp, garlic fries and a broccoli salad and everything was pretty good, so we went back for a second visit. Unfortunately, that second visit ruined things for us, probably permanently. We ordered the same thing, but this time the fries were a barely warm, soggy, greasy mess. The shrimp was also greasy---we ate most of it and then later felt sick to our stomachs. This place that had seemed quaint and charming quickly turned back to feeling like a cramped grease pit. Sorry but, you mess up once like that and it takes a long time, if ever, to recover from it. Especially in a city with so many options available. This one ultimately gets a thumbs down from us."
3/30/2016,20160330,5,4.33,"My goodness , is like going to Ocho Rios in Jamaica , food is delicious. And it's a lot of food so I'll suggest order an appetizer and an entr√©e .Love love love the steam pot combos with the garlic butter , finger liking good. This is definitely a new spot I recommend and comeback to eat."
3/30/2016,20160330,4,4.33,"Lapin and I been here a couple of times and we keep coming back. The restaurant is right near the B and C (116) subway stop and it can be hard to miss if you are not looking for it. Beyond the doors, the restaurant has a beachy seafood shack vibe -- read - limited space(they do have an outdoor area but the three times we been there it was never open) and benches/stools for seating. The staff is very friendly and polite. Upon entry, you place your order and you grab a seat and your food will be bought out to you. While you wait, on the shelves take a look at their hot sauce selection as they have some weird and delicious flavors and super hot flavors like the ghost pepper. We have tried the Crabby Dip (tasted okay, barely any crab taste), smoked chicken wings (Lapin loves these), Pom pom shrimp with garlic fries (delicious, a hint of sweetness), Johnny Cakes (okay, a bit dry), sweet plantains (okay, nothing super exciting -- just average), Soft Shell Crab (this was interesting as it was a whole crab with bones and all -- just deep fried...I am still on this one) and the seafood boils ( I like Lolo's Special Sauce which is a mixture of all the sauces while Lapin likes the Garlic Butter and Old Bay). The prices are very affordable but some of the portions are a bit on the smaller side but it's a worth the trip at least once."
3/30/2016,20160330,5,4.34,"I'll jump on this bandwagon. Been here once, Saturday. Everything was great and reasonably priced. Loved the conch fritters. Great soft-shell crab sandwich. Smelts were great. Only complaint: No beer when we were there."
4/1/2016,20160401,5,4.34,Just came from LoLos tonight and as usual they did not disappoint. The 40 minutes was worth the wait. We were more than happy to leave the dreaded Harlem Tavern and go feast when our number was called ( really convenient). The supervisor gave us a discount card so we will definitely be back.Also my boyfriend loved the place 2/2.
4/12/2016,20160412,5,4.34,"Love this place, it's small but cute, cozy, and has a nice laid back atmosphere with a unique and creative decor. You order in the front and they bring out the food to you. The food smells and taste great. Super friendly service!Will definitely come back when in the area."
4/12/2016,20160412,4,4.34,GET THE CRABBY DIP! everything is delicious so you cant go wrong. I just deducted one star because theres a long line usually and only one counter for orders. Otherwise one of NY's gems !
4/14/2016,20160414,4,4.34,"A really small place. I haven't expected that. But since I came with my friend who I really enjoy being with, the food and the environment would not be a big deal. Well, I've always liked the seafood no matter in what way they are cooked. So I enjoyed the food very much. The restaurant is of Latin style, with great music!"
4/17/2016,20160417,5,4.34,"Im from Long Island and will take a trip for some good food.The food is delicious.... first time I went, I had shrimp, jerk chicken, and johnny cakes. Then I came back again.. and between me and my friend, we ordered about 5 times"
4/17/2016,20160417,3,4.34,I wasn't thrilled. It's a cute place but the food is pricey and pretty blah. When we went (which was a while ago) our waitress kept forgetting to bring us what we ordered. I also thought it was weird that we had to go to the counter to pay (after we were seated but before our food arrived). It kind of messes up the flow of the evening especially if you're catching up with friend (as we were doing). There are so many great places in NYC I can't see me coming back to this establishment.
4/20/2016,20160420,4,4.33,"Can I say how great this place is? Yes? OK. This place is great!My boyfriend wanted to go out to dinner here one random night. Knowing he's not the Yelper in the relationship, I was intrigued that he was so excited to visit any restaurant. ( He even told me to Yelp it and learn TO-DAY!)Let me say, when you walk in you think this is a hole in the wall small place. Its not, theres a whole dining area in the back (and an outside patio). When we entered it was super crowded so we were unsure of what to do how to order or where to stand. We were greeted by the friendly host (order taker) who explained to us how everything worked. Thank you!The menu has endless options of seafood and meats galore. We really didn't know what to order so we over did it and ordered a bunch of things:LoLo friesReg friesSalmon sandwichCrabcake sandwichOyster dipsweet plaintains.It was all very very good. Oh and there was an assortment of sauces you could dip in. Now let me say I love a good sauce. The fact that there were multiple good sauces, I was just in heaven! The items came out at a staggered pace for the most part. (cook/deliver to order style). This was so helpful because we were able to really enjoy our order. The first to arrive was the salmon sandwich that we split. It was delicious and because it came out first we could really savor the taste of it. We both really appreciated the service and vibe of the place. The staff was so nice, letting us know about the business and how they enjoy working there themselves. You can tell its a super friendly place where they mean business about their food.Needless to say that we will be back. We have to enjoy that patio!"
4/20/2016,20160420,5,4.34,"My goodness , is like going to Ocho Rios in Jamaica , food is delicious.

This is definitely a new spot I recommend and comeback to eat.Birthday was 4/13 and yes I was here again this is definitely my new spot , the sauces you guys need to start selling them because every time I come I'm going to pack some home!!! Your food is just delicious."
4/23/2016,20160423,2,4.33,"I'm pretty underwhelmed by my Lolo's experience. The food was average... we had the Conch fritters, crab dip and Pom Pom shrimp and garlic fries. The conch fritters were all batter, hardly any conch. The crab dip seemed undercooked as it had a watery texture. The shrimp were delicious but nothing you can't find anywhere else in the city... I was disappointed by the garlic fries because I wasn't expecting slobs of garlic smeared on the fries. Overall, I wouldn't come back here again. I did love the charm of the place... very cute outdoor seating. They need a liquor license because a rum punch was necessary!"
4/23/2016,20160423,5,4.33,"I was shocked when I realized this place was so close to my neighborhood and I had never been there. Everything we ordered was delicious and the portions were great. Already dreaming about going back this weekend. A little small, but that adds to the charm in my experience. I recommend the crab legs, the jerk chicken, the corn, and the plantains. So good!!!"
4/23/2016,20160423,5,4.33,"Been staying in Harlem the past two weeks and LoLo's has quickly become my favorite spot. Walked in as the restaurant was closing one night and the owner and his wife invited us to join in on a fresh Crayfish feast! SO GOOD. They are the coolest, most genuine people. The food is delicious and the energy is always on point. It has that hole-in-the-wall, neighborhood vibe in a big city, and really feels like stepping into the Caribbean every time you go.I love how their menu samples a variety of flavors from all the Caribbean Islands. Ribs are a must -- so tender and delicious. Crayfish and conch fritters are also amazing, but honestly everything on the menu looks good. For the saucy types there is something for everyone --- from hot habanero to sweet. Mix the sweet with the rib BBQ sauce! Yum! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in NYC & try the rest of the menu. Definitely check this place out if you're in the hood! The patio is perfect for a summer day."
4/23/2016,20160423,5,4.34,"The owner, Raymond, is the nicest dude in Harlem ! My friend & I stopped in one night & they were already closed but him & his wife offered us some crawfish to take home. But then instead of sending us on our way they invited us to sit down & we ended up hanging out for awhile.. They fed us some of their rice too ! This is my fav spot in Harlem now. Went back tonight & got the ribs & conch fritters.. Anything you get will not disappoint. Amazing food, amazing vibes & amazing folks making it all happen."
4/23/2016,20160423,1,4.32,"I really don't understand these review. I was intrigued when I saw the great ratings so I checked it out. Definitely wouldn't recommend or return, the fish was skimpy portions and somewhat fishy, also it tasted like they hadn't changed the frier oil in a while. Also, there is no seating! I indicated that I was willing to wait for my order so that I could be seated out back but they went ahead and prepared it anyway so i had to sit on a tiny cramped table by the order counter. Sorry guys but def not that good."
4/26/2016,20160426,4,4.32,"Liked this place! The plantains were really yummy. They had a different kind of taste. I ordered the crab leg and shrimp combo and my cousin got the crawfish. It was really good. Fresh, flavorful seafood!"
4/27/2016,20160427,4,4.32,A little pricey for the small portions but overall great seafood in a really cool atmosphere!
4/28/2016,20160428,4,4.32,"I love seafood so LoLo's was a no-brainer. I was first introduced to LoLo's on the Yelp Holiday hangover cruise and couldn't stay away from this place. The conch fritters reminded me of a shack I go to in the Bahamas which brings me waaay back to paradise. Their shrimp and snow crabs were cooked to perfection and its a must to go all-in on their special sauce.Shack describes this place well with only 5 small tables in the back with tiny stools. Wait time was about 50 minutes but besides that, this place is on point."
4/29/2016,20160429,4,4.32,I like it!!! Had the jerk chix this week and while it's not 100% authentic it is good enough for me to want to try other things on the menu. And I would order the jerk chix again! I like the 3 side sauces and during warmer weather I look forward to sitting in the back.

4/30/2016,20160430,5,4.32,"Finally made it here after seeing it on the mews over a year ago; and it was well worth the wait!! It a small hole in the wall spot. Kinda remeinds me of a Jamaican basement party. Its small but simple. I used a groupon; that allowed me to order conch Fritters, pompom shrimp and fries and half pound of jumbo stewmed shrimp and 2 can soda... to be honest this is a meal for one bu ttwo can share. Everything was hot and cooked perfect. Seating is limited so be prepared was. All in all it was an amazing experience. I'll be back"
4/30/2016,20160430,3,4.31,"I am here for LoLo's Seafood Shack! The food was amazingly, well seasoned. I love the corn on the cob, it was flavorful. The craw-fish was pretty good, it was my first time having craw-fish so I didn't know what to expect or what to compare it to...but I enjoyed it. It was fun to put the gloves on and really get into your food without a care. The only thing missing was a good cocktail but they currently don't serve alcohol. There is the matter of the space it self, I wish it were lager. Everything else was great, the service and how attentive the server was. I'll be returning in the very near future."
4/30/2016,20160430,4,4.31,I bought a groupon to this place and the experience and food was well worth my $25 that I paid! Food was tasteful and the environment was fun!
5/2/2016,20160502,5,4.31,"I happened to be in Harlem this past weekend and had the pleasure of Yelp leading me to this gem of a place. The staff members were very helpful and explained the menu with patience. The seating area is a pleasant experience and seating comfortable enough for my four year old to sit still. The food. Oh my GAHHH. We ordered the shrimp, salmon and broccoli basket, plantains, conch fritters and garlic fries and enjoyed every last bite. The shrimp and salmon were fresh and the sauce they sat in was tasty enough for me to ask for a spoon. The conch fritters were so tasty that I was able to convince my picky eater that it was a new kind of chicken and he loved it. They've got me as a customer whenever I'm visiting the neighborhood. If you're giving this place a second thought, give in and take trip."
5/2/2016,20160502,5,4.32,"This place is amazing, went with my family and the experience as a whole was perfect, the staff was all friendly and knowledgeable. They explained all the food in detail and recommended the shark sandwich. Needless to say it didn't disappoint. All and all I recommend this place to everyone into great food and great atmosphere."
5/3/2016,20160503,1,4.3,I placed an order online at 7:45pm to pick up. 45 minutes later I'm still in the store waiting on my order. I'm paying $25 for salmon shrimp & broccoli I expect it to be ready in the most 30 minutes. Very disappointed. Will not return.
5/5/2016,20160505,5,4.31,"Absolutely delicious. I love living so close to this gem! Great patio, great service and amazing food!"
5/10/2016,20160510,5,4.31,Great food! Had the shrimp w/butter and garlic - totally recommend. Jerk chicken was good also. French fries were amazing. Place was small with rudimentary table amenities. Basically everything is disposable. They do provide you with rubber gloves so you can eat with your hands if you want to. Basically good food that you enjoy eating. Will be back.
5/12/2016,20160512,4,4.31,This.is.my.joint.right.h‚Ä¶! garlic butter strimps is the bomb! period.
5/13/2016,20160513,5,4.31,"Atmosphere, friendliness, deliciousness for days. Wish I lived closer - we'd be regulars."
5/15/2016,20160515,5,4.31,"My favorites: The salmon, broccoli salad, any sandwiches on their amazing Johnny Cakes and those plantains! Fish and seafood is cooked perfectly, but there are lots of veggie sides and veggie-friendly options. Owners Ray and Skai are ON POINT and take care of you. Love the garden."
5/17/2016,20160517,4,4.31,Tasty and plentiful. Great sauces and nice staff!
5/17/2016,20160517,5,4.31,"This little shack has spunk! I love it, my bf introduced this place to me the other night. The Caribbean/seafood vibe is everything I need. I had the fried Mahi Mahi with the garlic fries. YUM. And the corn was so good! I was very satisfied"
5/19/2016,20160519,4,4.31,The snow crab with shrimp was exceptional well worth the $30. Decor and atmosphere was super laid back and actually fun. Obviously a seafood shack so the food is messy but the atmosphere made for such a fun experience.
5/20/2016,20160520,5,4.32,"The food is awesome,great service and the restaurant takes you to a tropical island here in New York. I recommend that anyone give it a try for yourself. My family,friends and I have been to Lolo's at least 5 times and I plan on returning back soon."
5/23/2016,20160523,5,4.32,"Yes, I've reviewed this place before, but they deserve another! Last Friday, they catered a luncheon at my workplace for 60 people. They were so on-point and organized, and created each sandwich boxed-lunch style--labelled, with the side and sandwich inside. So easy to grab and go. A couple of weeks before this, we had a work event there, and they were so accommodating with us. Everyone loved it.I recently went on my own to dine-in just so I could try other things, and WOW. Seriously, guys, go to this place and go hungry. I was sad when we finished the conch fritters and chicken wings--they are a must! The shark bake is the bomb, but the crab cake sandwich is my new favorite! Their hospitality always puts them on the top of the list, too. So happy to have found this place!"
5/27/2016,20160527,5,4.32,"OMG I am a native NewYorker I have eaten seafood all over the city, these crab legs at Lolo were so good me and my friends ate and then reorder and shared another order, have decided to meet there once a month."
5/28/2016,20160528,5,4.32,"Selfishly I almost don't want to give them 5 stars, just so this spot can stay under the radar. It was AMAZING."
5/28/2016,20160528,5,4.33,"I'm so pleased we checked this place out. The food was soooo good and really well priced. We got to enjoy the food in a great court yard out the back which was well shaded on a hot day. We had the fried shrimp and fish and chicken wings. There was a long wait for the chicken wings, however the staff were very apologetic and gave us a free rice for the wait.. The wings were well worth the wait so we didn't mind (they were amazing!!)."
6/1/2016,20160601,4,4.33,"I went back to try other options from the menu... Mmm mmm good. While I'm still accustom to a ""drier"" jerk chicken, I would order the jerk chicken from here again."

6/2/2016,20160602,5,4.33,"On a stellar summer day, supping alfresco on some seafood & sides is where it's at. One of the tastiest spots I've dined in lately. You can sit in the garden or inside right next to it and eat your seafood on wooden benches and stools- kinda reminds me of the vibe at the Palace Hotel in Charleston- divey in the best possible way.Ate:Peel & eat shrimpWok seared cauliflowerTotal $16The feature is shark & bake- a West Indian fried fish sandwich.i opted for a lighter option. You choose your sauce- ginger scallion butter was mine. The hot shrimp with the sauce was tasty enough, but you can help yourself to sauces like habanero, spicy pineapple, salsa verde, or a vinegary pepper sauce. These add zing to the food. My wok seared cauliflower was outstanding- clean tasting with char. Everything cooked to order. Loved the Lolo experience altogether. Mucho value!"

6/2/2016,20160602,4,4.33,"This place is interesting. I like the cornmeal buns; it's cool and different- and seems homemade. I've tried the Shark Bake sandwich; it's good, but prefer the salmon sandwich. The fillet is always tender and cooked perfectly. The vibe is Caribbean- very low key and there's a backyard with seating. Oh the sauces and dips are phenomenal! The only thing not cool about this place is that they are not open for lunch on weekdays!"

6/5/2016,20160605,3,4.32,"Walking in LoLo's was a bit awkward for me because at first I thought it was take out only. However, they assured me it was seating in the back. You have to order your food in the front as soon as you come in, which was a little weird. They then let us go to the back to sit at a table. All of the tables are pretty small & they rock back and forth, and the chairs were completely uncomfortable for me (I've got back issues). I was still super excited about waiting for my crab & shrimp steampot. However, once the waitress came to our table with our ""steampot"", it was a little paper basket instead. I definitely expected more. I didn't feel like I got what I paid for, and I left there still hungry. It was literally a 1 claw, with two extra pieces from another claw, 4 shrimp, not even a half of a sweet potato, and 1 corn. However, the food tasted okay."

6/10/2016,20160610,5,4.32,Great spot! I'm a Harlem resident and sadly have never really patronized any of the great restaurants in the area. Today I decided to hit this great hidden gem and I'm glad I did. Food was great and priced well. My only wish is that the portions were a little more and that they served liquor!
6/10/2016,20160610,3,4.31,"After reading many positive reviews about Lolo's Seafood Shack I was mildly disappointed to come away with mixed feelings regarding the varying quality of foods ordered during my recent visit. My table ordered the appetizer sampler, fish fry basket and crab leg boil. The sampler was a mixed bag; the conch fritters tasty but with too much batter, the dip delicious pared with mariquitas, and the ribs overcooked with no flavor, having to rely of jerky dip. The roumalade accompanying all dishes was tasty. The Mahi Mahi was moist and delicious. The crab leg boil was tasty, but made difficult to eat without any crab crackers available. All in all I would recommend Lolo's but not deserving a Zagat rating."

6/11/2016,20160611,5,4.31,"Very cute swanky place. I definitely got a ""hipster"" vibe from the decor as soon as I walked in. I seriously thought I was in Williamsburg, BK aka hipster town. Now on to the food, it's kind of a Caribbean-seafood fusion. Im hosting out of town friends from Florida who loveeee seafood, so I figured this would be a hit. And it sure was!!! We got a fish basket with garlic fries that were ever so delicious, and an order of jerk ribs which my friend said were also equally yummy!!All in all pretty awesome place. Seriously a hidden gem for sure! Friendly staff...Check it out!"

6/11/2016,20160611,3,4.31,"I went there with a grpup of friends coming visit from Singapore! This place has a great review but to be honest, the food is pretty average in my opinion. It is a family-run restaurant which I nornally like, but their seafood is less flavorful and lack of proper seasoning. We ordered almost everything on their menu that day since we had a hug group...but northing stood out. The only thing I remember I ate are the ribs!!"
6/12/2016,20160612,5,4.32,"Thanks to Raymond for this fantastic recommendation.Note that this is my first review, and sorry for my bad English in advance. This was my second visit to Lolo's. This time, I ordered the one of the same dishes I had last time, shrimp+ salmon+ broccoli in mixed sauce (which recommended by the cashier) and a Lolo's fries.I was pretty hungry and I visited alone, which made me felt the waiting time was a little bit too long. Every time a server passed by with FOOD made me hungrier.First, the fries served on my table. It tossed with a kind of cheese (Cotija, if I am not wrong) jalape√±os and herbs. Perfect seasoning and crunchy on the surface, soft in the center. Those ingredients tossed into it was amazing, the cheese provided a body to the fries, the jalape√±os gave it a kick of heaty taste and the herbs infused into the fries. [I tried with their homemade sauces, pineapple sauces and a mild-spicy mustard-like sauce. From my personal view, the fries itself was already flavorful enough, so dip in to sauces just give it a kind of moisture.]And... My seafood basket is here, finally... (although it's just 3 mins after the fries is served, it felt like forever)Jambo shrimps and a pinky broth salmon on top of broccoli and curry-like sauce. I picked up a shrimp, it was bouncing on my finger tips!! I had my first bite.... ""is this a taste of beach in heaven?"" It was super good! I could say that is the best shrimp I ever had. The shrimp was perfectly pan-fried, slightly caramelized, the naturally sweetness from the fresh shrimp, coated with the curry sauce. There is coconut milk in the curry! Which is a perfect combination for the shrimp into the curry.The salmon, emhmm! Amazing! Pan-fried then broth. A clever plating, the salmon was on top of everything, it just slightly touched the sauce. I could taste the passion of the chef who cooked the salmon. Just amazingly beautiful, the perfection of the doneness and seasoning, the chef given full respect to the salmon, the moisture from the salmon made my saliva dripping out of my mouth.And the broccoli... omg... can you imagine that tender and soft happened together in every broccoli! I understand why they used broccoli instead of other vegetables, just because broccoli could hold up more sauce! The server was pretty busy, which was fine to me. As long they served my food. Thank you Lolo's for serving the best seafood!! I will definitely be back!"
6/12/2016,20160612,5,4.32,"Lolo's is definitely one of my favorite places in the city. It's really hard for me to be in Harlem now without finding a reason to saunter into Lolo's. It really does look like a shack up front, but a short hallway leads to more seating and a decently sized outdoor patio.My favorite things on the menu are johnny cakes (sweet, soft bread like things), the crabby dip (so creamy, so crabby), and two sandwiches, the avocado toast and the cauliflower + sweet potato. I also love the durty rice and the plantains as sides. Okay, so I just named a quarter of the small menu... but that's the point. Everything here is yummy and dusted with some sort of magical island seasoning, that will have you salivating and craving a return within days of your first visit. Consider yourself warned! Hopefully soon they'll get their alcohol license, and then I'll really come by every week! Of course then, hopefully they'll be open a little later, because on the nights I need some Lolo's lovin', the 9:45pm close cramps my style.Anyway, come find me in the Flamingo Room!"
6/12/2016,20160612,5,4.32,"Overall, Lolo's is amazing! The wings were the best thing we tried but everything else was also good! Definitely looking forward to another trip down to eat there!"
6/12/2016,20160612,2,4.31,"Went here yesterday while over on 8th. I've been meaning to get here for a couple of years now. Well, I finally made it and everything was delicious. I had the 1/2 lb shrimp boil with old bay and garlic butter. The shrimp were a nice size. And cooked perfectly. The old bay and butter was good. The main and only complaint was the amount of shrimp. There literally were 6 shrimp. Yes, only 6 shrimp. Not only did that leave me extremely hungry after, but there's no way to justify charging $9.19 plus tax for 6 boiled shrimp. There needed to be at least 6 more shrimp for that price OR something else to accompany the shrimp. For that reason alone, I am giving two stars. My date had the chicken wings and a garlic fry. He said the wings were delicious. Again, he also left feeling very hungry. The wings, shrimp, fries and a dr. Browns soda came to about $30. Bottom line is, no one wants to spend 30 bucks for food and leave hungry. What a disappointment."
6/17/2016,20160617,5,4.31,What a gem in Harlem- went here on a Friday evening and sat outside. The snow crab legs and shrimp were amazingly fresh. We ordered the garlic butter w Chesapeake seasoning and the lolos special. The crabby dip was prob 3/5 but I think it had a lot to do w the fact that it was served after tasting fresh seafood. All in all we loved the place and would def come back again--it def hits the spot if you're craving perfectly seasoned fresh crab and shrimp! Ps they could use more lighting in the outside area but they also were very receptive w bringing extra tea lights for us.
6/24/2016,20160624,3,4.31,"I was very excited to bring my boyfriend here because he absolutely enjoys seafood! Now I'm not sure if it was the time I arrived which was why the ordering wait time was 20minutes ( We arrived around 8pm on a Friday) or if this is a usual thing. However we ordered take out and had to wait an additional 30minutes for the food to be ready. I have to admit the customer service was great! They're very friendly!! Now I ordered the smoked wings with jerk sauce and garlic fries. The fries were delicious!! However the wings not so much. My boyfriend got the salmon, shrimp, and broccoli basket and absolutely adored it! So he strongly recommends it. Overall I give it 3 stars, wasn't as great as I was expecting it to be. But I would go back on a less busy day and try something different."
6/24/2016,20160624,5,4.31,"Great place!!! Great food, great service, great people!!! When I walked in the place the people were so nice and made sure what I wanted to order is what I wanted.8 got taste samples of the different sauces. It was very pleasant that I had great service"
6/25/2016,20160625,3,4.31,"I took Pom Pom shrimp with garlic fries and a side of plantains. The shrimp were ok but the quantity was not on par with the price. The bad side was the garlic fries that were awful, they were soggy. The plantains were good."
6/28/2016,20160628,5,4.31,Loooove it. So delicious. Wait can be long but the atmosphere is amazing and the food was great. Can recommend the crab cake and the fruitpunch
6/28/2016,20160628,4,4.31,Cool little oasis in the middle of Harlem. They have an outdoor patio that reminds me of something out of BVI. Snow king crab legs and shrimp in lolo's special sauce was fantastic. Corn on the cob and grilled cauliflower for some vegetables.
6/30/2016,20160630,4,4.31,"Randomly found a review for this place and had to check it out. Even on a Friday night with nice weather it was pretty easy to get food and find a prime outdoor seat. Food was above average- the jerk chicken in particular was great. Just so-so ribs and would try the steamed seafood next time. Called ahead to ask about the alcohol situation- they confirmed they sold beer but welcomed us to bring our own alcohol. Not sure if that's actually legit but we brought in a bottle and no one bothered is at all about it. Good spot for a nice night out, fairly cheap and a novel experience in Harlem."
6/30/2016,20160630,5,4.31,"Terrific snow crab. If you like coconut curry, get crab with the lolo sauce. If you like Mexican corn, get the lolo fries. If you like a fun place with friendly service, get the lolo."
6/30/2016,20160630,5,4.31,Our favorite place in Harlem. Totally chill on a hot day or night feels like you're on a Caribbean island.
6/30/2016,20160630,5,4.31,"Wow another great meal at Lolo ' s my friends wanted to go to city Island, I said just try this restaurant Lolo, if you aren't happy I will pay the bill, needless to say I got a free meal, and (3) people that loves the food at Lolo ' s Thanks for the best seafood in Harlem NY."
7/4/2016,20160704,4,4.31,"Our city-dwelling friends had been to this restaurant before and knew my hubby loved seafood and the Caribbean and thus recommended it for our lunch date with them. We went on a nice sunny summer Sunday afternoon. The restaurant itself is small but has a nice section in the back with picnic benches, tables and a bar to enjoy the outdoors. The service is incredibly friendly- everyone was smiling, welcoming and helpful in answering our questions. We ordered a ton of food so that we could try multiple items on the menu. I think my absolute fav dish was the jerk chicken basket which came with johnny cakes and durty rice (aka rice and peas). The chicken in this meal was delicious, none of us could stop eating it. We also got the conch fritters, shark and bake sandwich, roasted cauliflower and sweet potato sandwich, and the shrimp boil. We also got a sampling of the different hot sauces and pineapple sauce which were all great and the perfect addition to our meal. As we scarfed down our food we sipped on some delicious grapefruit beer and rum punch. The rum punch is made fresh by Lolos using their own spiced rum and sorrel- it's quite good and not too sweet. Overall we enjoyed our meal very much and left happy with full bellies. It was the perfect meal for a nice day and we'd definitely come back!"
7/6/2016,20160706,4,4.31,"A little Caribbean treasure in the middle of Harlem .I have just done a restaurant review for Blunt Squad TV show on 18/6/2016Great seafood ! Salmon ,shrimp and broccoli basket was great.Im not a fan of shark but the crispy shark bake was quite good.Delicious snow crab legs-well worth a tryThe staff are amazing ,friendly and look like they really love working thereGreat ambianceBe sure to keep checking bluntsquadtv.com to see the upcoming show with footage on Lolo's Seafood Shack"
7/10/2016,20160710,4,4.31,"I remembered coming here last Summer for a job interview. The place was small, however. The place is a few hundred feet from the train station entrance."
7/13/2016,20160713,1,4.3,"Terribly overrated as far as I am concerned and pricey . We went there my wife and I, after reading all these reviews, decide to give it a try. After taking our order, craw fish, Belizean conch fritters, garlic fries, wok seared cauliflower, we went to the back in the garden and sat at a rustic narrow table, our food came, first mine, then 20 minutes later my wife's Crawfish. So much for eating food together at the same time. The staff answer was, we'll bring the food as soon as it comes ready and not necessarily in that order. So i ate alone my conch fritter, mostly batter, with a vegetable and microscopic pieces of conch. Then the fries very greasy soft and not appetizing at all, plus they gave me the wrong order , and charged me for it. Also my wife's order was given to the next table by error, which delayed her food more. Then came the wok seared cauliflower. After making a comment to the maitre d', he made it up by offering a drink . After that experience, I just wanted the wrong order to be refunded to me. By the way the craw fish were small , in NOLA, they would not even think to offer them to you. the maitre d' tried first to give me a store credit for the refund, so we would have to come back, but we had no interest in returning in this place. So finally he gave me my refund. Also in view of the quality of food and service, the check was very steep, with tip included, it came closed to $60.!!! wok seared cauliflower was the only good dish we enjoyed."
7/17/2016,20160717,5,4.3,"Great sea food at a low key walk up counter (with outdoor and indoor seating though) type place on 116th It was SUPER sweltering out in the backyard area but server came out with ice, extra wet naps etc for us and did a good deal of check in in on us I had the soft shell crab sandwich (so good) which included complimentary garlic fries (yum and sorry to anyone I talked to afterwards). Soft shell crab sometimes tastes fishy to me but this was perfect. Friend had crayfish boil in lolos curry sauce. Sauce was awesome for fry dipping (friend didn't care for it as much but I thought it was great). They carry beer but we didn't partake. I tried Ting which was way sweeter than expected (just this very second I wondered if Tang and Ting somehow inspired the others name).Anyhow...I'd highly recommend!"
7/20/2016,20160720,5,4.3,"Best damn food period. Felt like I was in Jamaica when we went to sit down. Beautiful little spot. Quick service food fresh and delicious. Had conch fritters, johnny cakes (TDF - to die for), crab cake sandwich jerk ribs (OMG) and the peel n eat shrimp. Can't wait to go back!!!!!"
7/21/2016,20160721,2,4.3,"After reading many good reviews I decided to come see what the hype was all about at LoLo's at 9pm on a Tuesday night. I came with a good friend who loves to share food and we were both in the mood for some seafood. I'd say a shack is a good way to describe the ambiance of the location, lots of wooden furniture, the type of vibe you'd find in the Caribbean. I personally enjoyed the ambiance. You order at the counter as soon as you walk in and you get a number that you can take to any table you want. They have a nice outdoor section in the back with another bar that was closed when I was there. There could be more lighting in the back section, but its a shack so you can't complain.We ordered the crab legs with the house special sauce, Mahi-Mahi with garlic fries, a Caribbean lager and some punch. The service at the counter was friendly and pleasant. We got our crab legs and broccoli within a reasonable time and they said they'd bring the rest of the food soon after. The crab legs themselves did not taste fresh. The sauce was ok but nothing to write home about. Overall they tasted like the kinds of crab legs you get at an all you can eat seafood buffet at a casino. We then sat around for about 45 minutes with no service of any sort waiting for our punch and Mahi-Mahi. Finally someone came over asking if we had received our punch. We ended up having to go to the kitchen to inquire about our Mahi-Mahi and finally got it about an hour after receiving our first dish along with our punch. The punch was ok, the Mahi-Mahi was actually really good. I've never had fried Mahi before but it was very tender which is rare in my experience when eating this fish. My friend also really loved the garlic fries. It was the only thing that redeemed this dining experience. The people sitting next to us said the ribs and wings were good."
7/23/2016,20160723,2,4.29,I tried this restaurant out through Uber Eats. I guess they didn't take the order serious and sent over overcooked food. The fries were so crispy they should have been chips. I had fried fish that was the same. Their sauce is good and they should have sent over more containers to drown out the crunch and dryness of their food.
7/24/2016,20160724,3,4.28,"Had Lolo's bookmarked for a long time and was super excited to try it out even more so because it's a Black owned business. Finally made my way there and I was a bit disappointed. I hope management is open to constructive criticism because if they are the sky is the limit for this establishment. Here are the issues I had;1. The food doesn't come out all at once. MAJOR ISSUE especially if you're dining with a group or even if u want to enjoy the different dishes/flavors at the same time. There is too much of a gap between dishes getting to the table. Which leads me to believe that the kitchen is not equipped or properly staffed to make multiple orders at once. 2. The back yard seating is very nice but the trash and dog shit in the neighbor's backyard attracts flies to the area...not too sanitary or appetizing. 3. The backdoor leading to the outside seating needs to be fixed, it doesn't stay closed and is hard to open. 4. No bibs or paper towels on the tables???? For a seafood restaurant, that is a must! The seafood experience is less fun when you're worried about ruining your outfit. 5. The pay before you seat approach actually does more damage than good. Who wants to get up a million times to put in a new order or to get a soda and continue paying separately, especially when the minimum to use a card is $15?? It's an inconvenience for customers and they probably lose money on busy days. Most restaurants make a lot of money through beverage sales and a customer ordering more food. That can't be done if ordering is inconvenient. As far as the food goes, it was good but with all the 5 star reviews I was expecting more. If you've been to places like The Boil, then you might find the flavor here lacking. I would give them another shot sometime in the future but there's way too much competition out there for them not to get it right the first time."
7/24/2016,20160724,4,4.28,"Came here for lunch on a hot Friday afternoon. Was a little disappointed to find out they don't serve alcohol till 4pm. Actually I was very disappointed since it was 3:06pm but decided to stay anyway. The indoor seating is small, didn't get to see or try the outdoor area because they were filming. The place isn't cheap but it's not expensive either. For instance a beer I think was $5 but a can of soda is $2.75. Almost a no brainer to have beer but when don't I think like that?The food! Had the conch fritters and absolutely loved them and wasn't expecting them to taste that good. The chilled broccoli was also better than expected and a descent sized portion. The combo boil of crab legs and shrimp tasted good with the seasoning and sauce (spice it up and garlic butter) we picked. The sweet potatoes inside were cooked right and delicious. There's a few items I'd like to try next time I go but only if they can make them without cheese, the conch fritters alone are worth the trip."
7/24/2016,20160724,5,4.29,"This place is the best! We came when they were in theirninfancy and it is great to see how they have grown both in space and cuisine. While Lolo's still has a laid back, hole in the wall feel, the food is delicious, the staff so friendly and accommodating, and there's a great outdoor space in the back! Most definitely worth the trip uptown if you're not already up here. Enjoy!"
7/29/2016,20160729,3,4.28,"This hole in the wall spot is one not to skip out on. After picking up a treat from Levain bakery around the corner, I saw this seafood oasis where local junkies used to reside, literally. Thank God for HGTV and flipping! I ordered a bunch of diff things. Here're my thoughts:Conch fritters were ok; slightly overcooked. Jerk ribs were a bit salty, but the flavor was good. Brisket sammie was just ok. The free Yelp check-in plantains were cold and the cotija cheese on too didn't add anything. The crab dip that went with it was good. The go-to is definitely the seafood boil. I got the snow crab legs with the garlic butter and Old Bay sauce. AMAZING!"
7/29/2016,20160729,5,4.28,"i've lived in harlem for well over three years now and i only just recently visited lolo's. the shame.only after finding lolo's listed in various local NY publications (i don't recall exactly which, but think Time Out or Gothamist), did i finally realize ""OKAY, I MUST GO TO THIS PLACE. IT IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. NO EXCUSES.""no excuses.so one sweltering summer weekend day, my boyfriend and i trekked a few blocks to lolo's. it wasn't as difficult to find as i expected it to be, which makes the delay in my visit all the more shameful.every staff member we encountered was super nice, friendly, and helpful. service definitely gets FIVE sparkly stars. service is a HUGE make or break in my opinion, so this was a great aspect of lolo's that my boyfriend and i both enjoyed.on to the food. oh, geez. how does ANYONE make a decision? i wanted a little bit of everything. based on reviews, i knew i needed an order of johnny cakes. along with the cakes, we got some jerk ribs, peel and eat shrimp (with lolo's special sauce), and as it was happy hour, we also got drinks. a red strip for him ($5) and a lolo's punch for me ($5).erm. that punch was bomb. i had two servings. i could have had two or three more, but i didn't want to be a lush . . . (one day, tho).they bring out the food as it becomes prepared, so you don't get your entire order all at once. this isn't ideal . . . but only because i couldn't decide whether or not to wait for everything else as a bag of 1/2 lb. peel and eat shrimp sat right before me . . . deliciously buttery and just begging me to peel and EAT them!!!whatever. we couldn't wait. we ate the shrimp before everything else came out.my boyfriend and i are resourceful, so we ended up peeling all the shrimp at once and putting them back in the bag, so they could continue to soak up that lolo's saucy GOODNESS. this was a brilliant idea. time consuming. but brilliant.we were over the moon for our shrimp and we sat there wondering why we only got a 1/2 lb. instead of a full lb. #Amateurseventually, the ribs and the johnny cakes came out. the ribs and the sauce were amazing. my boyfriend thought the ribs could've had more meat on them, but mine were nice and meaty (because obviously, he sacrificed the meaty ribs for me - good guy, he is).the johnny cakes were fabulous. there were only two in the side order, but that was probably more than enough . . . they're fried. so they're amazing. and less is more, unfortunately, when it comes to fried delicacies.on to the fun part. we ordered more shrimp.sure, i was kind of full. but the shrimp were so delicious that the thought of having more was obviously super tempting. so, we went for it. and i'm glad we did.another 1/2 lb. of shrimp, please!obviously, we had a blast and loved the food. this place is super welcoming, very cozy, and the food is on point. don't hesitate to head over to the shack. we'll be back, for sure!"
7/30/2016,20160730,5,4.29,Salmon sandwich on their homemade Johnny cake with garlic fries was delicious and I would definitely come back to try more of their foods.
8/4/2016,20160804,3,4.28,"The food was mediocre. I got a beef brisket sandwich and fries. The sandwich bread was super oily and the fries were even worse. Also the so called ""garlic fries"" are just regular fries but they charge $5 or $6. Also there was not much fries either."
8/8/2016,20160808,4,4.28,"I really enjoyed my dinner here on a sweltering August evening.It gets really hot inside and all of the tables outside were reserved or taken but no problem. I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich which was good, I did ask for avocados and instead they gave me bacon, no problem. Also love plantain chips so I chose those and they were well-worth it.During happy hour beers are $5 and they have a nice selection ranging from Heineken to Montauk Summer Ale to cider. Also there's rose if you're more inclined to that sort of thing. Overall had a great time besides the tiny ass tables which can barely fit all of the food. Music was also excellent, well-worked mix of reggae, house and Pink Floyd"
8/11/2016,20160811,5,4.28,"Yes! This place gets it all right! It's doesn't seem like much from the outside but once you enter, you know you're in for a great experience. There is somewhat of a ""hole in the wall"" vibe but it's clean and neat. The menu is pretty extensive for a small place and after having tried almost everything, we can say that you simply can not go wrong. The front staff is always really sweet - one girl in particular is so welcoming and charming. Entire staff is really helpful and nice. The outdoor seating area is so adorable and perfect for peel and eat shrimp. We love this place and hope you do too!"
8/15/2016,20160815,4,4.28,"Food was great! A girlfriend and I shared the shrimp, plantains & salmon sandwich. I did expect a little more food considering their pricing and that's my only complaint!"
8/18/2016,20160818,5,4.29,"Solid neighborhood spot for when you want a good sandwich, plantains or seafood. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere and backyard are just as festive as the food. I highly recommend the Shark bake, don't let the name mislead you."
8/21/2016,20160821,1,4.27,There food was not great the place is tiny and its not very clean. They dont have a large menue. Its cash only. Its def not worth the money very expensive five star price with 2 star service
8/22/2016,20160822,5,4.28,"The bake & fried shark is the best fried shark & bake I've had yet... & It's always on point, I just wish they were open during lunch time everyday & not just Friday."
8/24/2016,20160824,3,4.27,"This review is only for a to go order. I ordered the crabby dip and the soft shell crab sandwich. The crab sandwich was delicious and I asked for extra crispy bacon, which they delivered on (and it was perfectly crispy and not burnt at all ). I loved trying all the sauces on each bite. I got the pineapple, ghost pepper, and habanero. All were delectable with lots o flavor but nothing too spicy. The crabby dip, however, left much to be desired. I saw the rave reviews about it on here which is why I ordered it but I just didn't like it at all. I'm not sure it's even made with real crab- pretty sure it's imitation and u can barely taste any ""crabby"" flavor. The Gouda they use is the only thing I could taste. I tried to save it by slathering on all the sauces on top but with no avail. I did not finish it, actually I left more than half the dip. And I hate throwing food away. Overall I think this place definitely has potential and I plan on going back when I can chill and eat there."
8/24/2016,20160824,1,4.26,Delivery sucks. I only live within the area and it took them more than an hour I decided to cancel my order. Will not recommend this place!
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.26,"As a foodie who LOVEESSSS seafood (crablegs especially) I was thrilled to discover, and ultimately VISIT, this hidden gem! From the moment my friend and I walked in (with a Pulsd voucher, no less) we were greeted by smiling faces who seemed genuinely happy to see us and eager to help us navigate the menu.Although there was the threat of rain -- because, Summer 16 -- we opted to sit outside on the adorable back patio. I am all about dining/visiting anywhere that transports you to somewhere else, and the vibrant colors, kitschy decor and no-nonsense sign (if you've been then you know what Im talking about!) did just that. I felt like we were at a family-run seafood shack, somewhere in the Caribbean away from my 9-5!Now -- the food! It was delivered to our table and looked as delicious as it tasted. The crabby dip was decadent, the jerk chicken was juicy and well seasoned and the crab legs with Old Bay & garlic sauce HIT THE SPOT!I cannot wait to go back. Thank you for a great first experience, Lolo's!PS: On the way to get us two punch drinks, my friend found out that ""Lolo's"" stands for ""Locally Owned, Locally Operated""! This really just seemed to elevate the experience even more."
8/27/2016,20160827,4,4.26,"Crab cake&garlic fries basket and boiled seafood are highly recommended!! however, personally I think the shark sandwich is tooooooo salty(seriously how could fish be that salty i really dunno what happened). Other than that, the envirionment is nice! They have two AC in the back, and each table has a finish your meal in 45mins limit(but no one actually follows this rule), theres also a backyard, which is cool. Music here, well, hard to tell the style, very funky and latino. Lolo is around the corner, near the subway station, but easy to miss. A lot of customers are regulars, and its a place I definitely will visit again."
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.27,"Awesome food, great service... Love the atmosphere. Definitely coming again, maybe I'll order; hear they're delivery is super fast!!"
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.27,"The absolute best customer service and food that I have received. With Harlem having so many new places to eat, it's kind of tough to get places that are able to offer you great food and service. Lolo's does both well! I'd recommend this place to anyone!"
8/27/2016,20160827,5,4.27,"Great food, great service and a great backyard. Portions are very good size and extremely tasteful"
8/28/2016,20160828,3,4.27,"My fiance and I decided to check out LoLo's after seeing it in one of Yelp's list of ""Manhattan Restaurants With Awesome Backyards"". I wouldn't say that the backyard is awesome, but the space is quaint, cozy. The tables and benches were wobbly, but not a big deal. I hope they would put up a sign for people to keep their noise level down. I hope. The space is not that big, so to have an annoying loud laugh ruins the atmosphere. We both had the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. So strange how it came with bacon. But I would think it's because the bacon added the sodium instead of having to add salt to the crab. I was not a big fan of the sauce that my fiance brought. It was orange in color. It didn't add flavor but heat to the dish. Overall the sandwich was good. I wasn't blown away by it though.We also ordered the jerk ribs. Meh..nothing amazing. The outerpart of the ribs was burnt, hard. But the inside was juicy and soft. Same problem though, lacked seasoning. You would have to add salt or something.Their Corn on the Cob and Cotija Cheese 4 Halves was very good. Very flavorful. Although theoverall flavor is lacking, except for the corn on the cob, we would go back and try other dishes like their ""Lolo's Seafood Boils and Steam Pot Combos""."
8/29/2016,20160829,5,4.27,"We ordered on uber eats and the meal was perfect. Best plantain chips I've ever had in my life. We had ribs, chicken and rice, shrimp plus more. Everything was super tasty!"
8/31/2016,20160831,4,4.27,"Food was really good. I had the coconut shrimp and garlic fries . I love the atmosphere. We sat in the in the backyard. You must try the sweet plantains, nobody makes them this delicious!!!!"
9/3/2016,20160903,5,4.27,"Yo, this is my new favorite spot. The Pom Pom shrimp and fries are out of this world. The wait is totally worth it. 10/10"
9/3/2016,20160903,5,4.27,"Excellent food- a little pricy but worth it. Friendly service and a cute atmosphere. Would definitely go back. Enjoyed the conch fritters, plantains and shrimp boil."
9/5/2016,20160905,3,4.27,The food was good but everything was separate which made it a lil more pricey. It is a small place and the atmosphere is friendly but a nice spot to enjoy good food.
9/7/2016,20160907,4,4.27,"Had a really nice meal here! My friend and I went to celebrate her first day of grad school at Columbia, and it was a great experience! We weren't too hungry, so we each got a 1/2 pound of the peel n' eat shrimp boil, and split the appetizer of chicken wings.The peel n' eat shrimp were GREAT, but what made them so good was the sauce they came in. Seriously, it was addictive to the point where I wanted to drink the remains. It was the ""special sauce"" which I asked about, and apparently it's just the other three sauces combined. Definitely get this.The chicken wings were also very good - they were seasoned with fresh dill which I have never had on a wing before and loved. We also each got a drink (she got a glass of rose, I got the rum punch) and it came to $25/pp inclusive of tip. Very reasonable.Also loved the fact that we could eat in the yard outside, but it did get quite dark. Would recommend getting those outdoor bulb strands to keep it light and make the mood a little more cheerful. Will definitely be back!"
9/11/2016,20160911,5,4.27,"Loved the atmosphere and the seafood was delicious! We purchased a Groupon that included a ""Feast for 2"", and we definitely had a feast! We had the plantain chips with the pineapple sauce which was spicy and tasty, we had the 1/2 shrimp in a bag, it comes very hot and not peeled so make sure you take your time with it, we chose the garlic sauce. We had the conch fritters, make sure you dip in the sauce they give you which is very refreshing, and lastly, We had the smelt fish with garlic fries. I wasn't a fan of the smelt fish but that's my particular taste, the garlic fries were delicious. My bf ordered the shark n bake separately and he could barely finish it since we were so full but he said it was pretty good."
9/12/2016,20160912,3,4.27,"Good food but really bad service. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was 2nd or 3rd in line for 15 minutes. Customers must all order at the bar and watch the cashier fumble, stumble, mumble, and fail to open bottles of beer while the line grows ever longer, angrier, and sweatier. You have to actually TRY to be this inefficient. That aside, the indoor seating is really uncomfortable as it was dark, cramped, and felt kind of dirty. There was outdoor patio seating out back too but it's surrounded by a bunch a buildings and feels kind of musty. I don't recommend getting the seafood boils as the portions are super small but I do recommend getting the baskets. The jerk chicken + dirty rice + johnny cake basket was $15 but portion was very large. Jerk chicken was super juicy and johnny cakes were excellente. Lolo's gives everyone gloves so their hands don't get dirty--great plus--and does happy hour, although the drinks don't taste good at all."
9/14/2016,20160914,5,4.27,"Your dip with plantain chips is delicious but, you give way more chips than dip, what's that about? It's the Crabby Dip and its weighed and measured to a healthy portion. That's what it's about. I love it!!"
9/15/2016,20160915,2,4.26,"I really don't get it. I was excited to try this place with all the great reviews but I'm baffled as to how this place has so many great reviews?! It was my parents birthday, I got them Cajun Sea takeout before and they loved it. I love 10 minutes away from Lolos so I figured takeout would be a great idea! Boy was I wrong.. Ordered the crab legs and shrimp, my shrimp order probably came with 5 shrimps and the crab legs were quite pathetic. They were soggy and they were not flavorful at all.Soggy crab legs ... I was so disappointed. Please don't tell me because it was takeout and I need to eat it fresh. I've gotten takeout from the Boil and from Cajun Sea, not once have my crab legs been soggy.I think those $10 all you can eat buffets had better crab legs ... THAT bad.I definitely won't be returning. Although 10mins away I rather make the commute downtown for something more worthwhile, I'll stick with The Boil."
9/16/2016,20160916,4,4.26,I felt like I was on a Caribbean island in the middle of the city. I loved the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend checking Lolo's Seafood Shack. Good eats and good people.
9/17/2016,20160917,4,4.26,"I enjoyed my salmon sandwich on their specialty home made bread and the cauliflower as well. It's a simple place with fresh food, good menu, small place but clean and staff is nice and professional. It's a walk up, self seating, take out kind of place. Give it a shot!"
9/18/2016,20160918,3,4.26,"I came here a second time and the food was equally delicious. The main problem was that the food took 30 mins to arrive. We sat outside, which is a very nice space, but we waited and waited for our food to arrive. It also got to us pretty lukewarm so it wasn't as enjoyable as I know it can be. I'll be back here soon again and I hope that the service will improve"
9/25/2016,20160925,5,4.26,I truly enjoyed my experience at Lolo's. My son loved it more than anything and he's a 7 year old foodie. He walked out telling the staff that he will be back 1000 more times.
9/25/2016,20160925,5,4.26,"On a whim we decided to stop into LoLo's and what a nice surprise. It was so incredibly good! For two people, we shared the shrimp steam pot, an order of sweet plantains and some johnny cakes. Everything was so tasty and the backyard makes you almost feel like you're at the beach. I'll definitely come back to try all the things!"
10/1/2016,20161001,5,4.26,"The bake & fried shark is the best fried shark & bake I've had yet... & It's always on point, I just wish they were open during lunch time everyday & not just Friday."
10/6/2016,20161006,4,4.26,"Location: Harlem, is not longer Harlem. Good food, rising coffee shops, whites occupying and gentrification. Harlem is no longer harlem. LOLO is incredible. The food is carribean cuisine and they decorated this place like you are right at Caribbean whereas still get a sense of new york.Food: I had their bake sandwich and luckily while I was checking in on yelp, i got a free sweet plantain. Although the sweet platain is different from what I had back in Ecuador, it was still delicious and innovative because it seasoned with cheese. Baked sandwich is incredible with their sauces - seasoned and fresh fried fish with flavored fried bun aka incredibleServece: so nice. VARY patient.if you are looking for fresh, had mde"
10/8/2016,20161008,4,4.26,This restaurant is one of my new favorite places in the neighborhood. Ordered it at a client's request and it was a pleasant surprise. The seafood and sauces are delicious and the jerk ribs and smoked wings will make you slap your mama. I'm sure I will be in this place at least once a week now.
10/10/2016,20161010,4,4.26,"Loved finding the shack. Four of us ordered several different items. The group loved the Avocado Toast, Lunch box, and a crab cake sand which. I ordered the steam pot combo with Lola Sauce. We all enjoyed the food for the cost. A special shout out for plantains. They were the best I ever had."
10/10/2016,20161010,4,4.26,"Loved it! When I found out about it I kept saying I would go but kept postponing the visit. I finally went one day for some take out and was happy I did. The food was good and well done, as I like everything. I will go back again for sure."
10/16/2016,20161016,5,4.26,"Here at Lolo's for the first time, feeling transplanted to a Caribbean paradise. Hanging out in the new heated patio cabana snacking on lobster rolls (""the best my friend has ever had""), jerk chicken, conch fritters, sweet plantains, Johnny cakes & more! It's amazing that such a small kitchen can pack so much flavor & love into their creations. Come check them out! You won't be disappointed if you are looking for creative takes on Caribbean favorites. Thanks for the love, Lolo's!"
10/18/2016,20161018,5,4.26,The shark and bake is so good!! We drive here all the way from the Bronx and they never disappoint.
10/23/2016,20161023,3,4.26,"Lolo's has a cute ""shack-y"" vibe and solid food, but my boyfriend and I definitely did not feel good after eating there. I would not call it food poisoning, but I think the overall greasiness of the food was really not good for our stomachs.You order and pay at the front, and then go find your own table in the back. It's not the most comfortable because it's just wooden stools and tables, but that's that ""shack-y"" vibe I mentioned earlier.We tried a bunch of dishes including the conch fritters, the crab cakes and garlic fries, and cauliflower and sweet potato sandwich. I looooooved the cauliflower and sweet potato sandwich, for a seafood restaurant they make a pretty mean vegetarian sandwich. Everything had good flavor and food is cheap, but everything was also greasy to the point where we had legitimate stomach aches for the whole night. I would come back here if I was in the area, but probably try to order some lighter fare (if that exists)."
10/23/2016,20161023,5,4.26,"Lolo's is a gem! If you want to be transported to an island paradise to include a totally chill vibe this is the place. The food is absolutely amazing- absolutely the best chicken wings I've ever had- Chef Ray uses intuition and experience and doesn't cut corners- in fact my understanding is that it takes several different methods to make it both crispy and juicy - and super flavorful. Lots of other creative versions of traditional island food and drink options like ting from the islands. And in case you can't fully imagine it your self, the ambiance transports you to the colorful relaxed islands- check it out!"
10/23/2016,20161023,5,4.26,This is one of the most incredible place to eat. A Gem in New York. The food is phenomenal and the service is outstanding and so friendly. Leaving here is like leaving the island to go back to reality. I cannot wait to come back to be transported back to wherever in the carribeans.
10/26/2016,20161026,5,4.27,This was my 1st time & it won't be my last. Everyrhing was good & at a great price. Its simple but very good
10/28/2016,20161028,2,4.26,"Just got home not too long ago from Lolo's and threw up immediately--my boyfriend and I really aren't feeling well at all. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but our experience did not match up to all of the positive reviews I had read. The atmosphere was pretty cool, the menu and flavors were good, but unfortunately the seafood itself was just NOT FRESH. Big miss for a seafood spot! Beginning to think that these glowing reviews are coming from New Yorkers who just don't know any better... I'm Filipino and grew up in Va Beach, and my boyfriend grew up in CA/CT and has family from New Orleans. Suffice to say we both know what good, fresh seafood should be. The crawfish boil we had at Lolo's was like farm raised crawfish that they seasoned, froze, and boiled/defrosted right before serving it to us. Something very rancid about it that you basically HAD to douse it in the sauce to drown out the rot. I think we only continued eating it because the owner was sitting at the next table with some VR vendor and we were trying to be polite. I will say the corn and the bake on the lobster roll were very good, but again, none of the seafood was. Really wish I could've left a better review. Sadly we won't be coming back."
10/29/2016,20161029,5,4.26,"This place is really cozy. The food was good. It was just my husband and I and we shared a few things. Enjoyed the peel n eat shrimp/Lolo's sauce, Pom Pom shrimp, crabby deep and conch fritters. We had descent weather but it was still a little chilly to eat outside but Lolo was prepared and we sat outside in their heated cabana. Really chill spot. Would like to try it again in the summer."
11/3/2016,20161103,5,4.26,"Recommended by a dear friend this place is as amazing as I was told. Walking into this amazing little cozy restaurant I was greeted by a great staff member named Jose. We then walked past the kitchen, decided to sit out back since the weather was amazing. Beautiful outdoor as well as inside felt right at home. Received menus and decided on fish fry basket and an order of crab cakes. Wow!! The fish was cooked PERFECTLY and the taste was SUPERB! The best fried fish I ever had, the fries were also amazing. Need to say I didn't share my food. I also had an amazing drink. I can honestly say I love, love, love, love this place. I would definitely keep going back, next time I'll try a new dish. Amazing staff, superb food and cozy restaurant. Thank you so much lolos seafood restaurant!!"
11/5/2016,20161105,5,4.27,"My supervisor took me here for lunch one day last spring. It is such a pleasant departure from so many other restaurants. They keep very low profile, we weren't even sure if they were open. And they keep a easy going Caribbean vibe. The inside is def nothing fancy, if you have to sit inside then it's ok, but the real star is there backyard patio with picnic tables and flamingos and seashells hanging overhead. It's like a tiki party. The food is prepared fresh and the seafood is out of this world. The shrimp were humongous and the flavors that they use are unlike other recipes. The staff are easy going and pleasant. One of my fave places. Def try it out. Sometimes they have Groupon specials which are quite a deal ;)"
11/8/2016,20161108,5,4.27,Small little place. But the food is SOOOO good. Highly recommend the crab sandwich. and the jalapeno fries. YUM YUM
11/15/2016,20161115,5,4.27,"Awesome and pleasantly surprised I wasn't sure what to expect but once I started I just kept going and going, from the fried Johnny cakes to the rice and peas, shrimp in garlic and old bay sauce topped off with the Hefeweizen Beer deeeelish. The owners were very accommodating they took the time to make us comfortable and explain the menu to us. The surprise was definitely the heated cabana in the backyard I felt like I was back in the Caribbean sitting in the backyard of a friend"
11/15/2016,20161115,5,4.27,"This place is a hidden treasure!!! From the outside you may not think much of it too go in but once you get inside you feel like you're away somewhere on an island at a local shack and please keep in mind we're in November. It feels homey. The food here was AMAZING!! And the service was great! Everything about the ambiance was on point. The music was great and the drinks to go with your food was even better. I mean ginger beer, Ting, you name it they got it. The portion size was more than enough. I would so come back again."
12/7/2016,20161207,4,4.27,Check out my review of Lolo's Seafood Shack for Blunt Squad TV Show :youtube.com/watch?v=4HDZ‚Ä¶
12/10/2016,20161210,5,4.27,"Love this place, lots of great options. I had the fried fish with a great aioli. Also tried the coconut shrimp, could have used a little more spice, but still very good."
12/15/2016,20161215,5,4.28,"My friends surprised me last night and took me here for dinner. When I say I LOVED everything we ate...I LOVED IT!!!!! The ribs, the corn, the crab-cake sandwich and the steam crab legs...Oh let me not forget about the Sorrel!!!! This place is truly AMAZING plus they gave us coconut long boy candy when we left....my favorite childhood candy!!!! Keep up the amazing work!!!!!"
12/20/2016,20161220,4,4.28,"Stumbled upon this place after our initial restaurant choice in Harlem had a long wait on a Saturday night. What a fun surprise! LoLo's is a small, narrow, cool spot on 116th Street with Caribbean cuisine and very friendly service. There's some seating in the front and then a larger space in the back behind the kitchen with some picnic tables. The staff was eager to give us recommendations about what to order and definitely steered us in a good direction. We checked in on Yelp so got the free plantains deal (delicious) and also tried the broiled salmon, the fish fry basket, the salmon + shrimp + broccoli basket, and the avocado toast. Everything was unique and delicious.Would go back when in the area!"
12/26/2016,20161226,4,4.27,Food was awesome but the staff was kinda rude. They wouldn't give me salt and pepper even though I asked for it many times?
1/1/2017,20170101,2,4.27,"Overwhelmingly, ok.The food will do if there's nothing else open around.The greeter/service folk are very friendly."
1/1/2017,20170101,5,4.27,This place is awesome!!! I had the crab legs w/old bay and garlic sauce and corn...omg so good!
1/3/2017,20170103,5,4.27,"My low-key, chill, Caribbean, beach-vibey (made that word up) seafood spot. We've gone here a few times to get the shrimp boil and wings. The wings are super good - they come with this garlic cream and what I think is Dill and an achiote glaze. The best time to come I think would be in the summer or when it is warmer since there is an open area out back with patio tables (although, I'm told this is heated in the winter as well). This is one of the few places I would like to keep coming back to, just so I can try everything else from the menu. Wholeheartedly recommended."
1/9/2017,20170109,5,4.27,"Definition of money can buy you happiness.I was craving crawfish and made the trip up to LoLo's. WOW. The staff could not have been more helpful about food suggestion when we were there. And our crawfish, pom pom shrimp, garlic fries, complimentary Yelp plantains, and corn on the cobs could not have been more on point. Honestly I don't know which one to highlight because they were all so f**king delicious. Never knew I was a plantains person until LoLo's. The crawfish was so fresh and awesomely spiced. The Pom Pom Shrimp basket with the garlic fries...just simply amazingly indulgent. The corn was there to top everything off. Everything was flavorful and so so good.The space was also super cool. We sat at the back patio with cute colorful picnic tables that had a Carribbean vibe. There was also a bar area there that seemed like it'd be a great time at night with music and booze. The staff let us put on the radio since we were the first party there that day. Loved it all!"
1/11/2017,20170111,4,4.27,"Being from the Bahamas I have to say that every time I go to Lolo's it reminds me of home. The food is out of this world delish and the atmosphere is so homey. During the summer months if you sit on the back patio, you can feel like you've been transported to some Island and can hear the ocean in the background. I know I am going back and would definitely recommend this place."
1/20/2017,20170120,5,4.28,"Oh man where to begin. The great atmospheres or the great food. Been here twice and I love it. It's so good. And I seriously love the ambiance so colorful and comfy. They have different hot sauces. Cold tap water. We had the seafood boil, sweet plantain, corn, fried shrimp, crawfish. Etc. we went on two occasions and not too busy, staff was friendly. We ate like piggies. The cook is great because the food is delicious. It's a small place and seats not super comfy but I will definitely keep coming back."
1/20/2017,20170120,5,4.28,"Lolos is a cool small Caribbean feeling restaurant. The decor is bright colors and and the food is delicious. There's seating in the back and further back, outside there's a heated shack in the back. The food is so good you need to throw your ego to the side, roll up your sleeves and jump right in. I ordered the steam pot(1 lb of crab legs and 1/2lb of shrimp). They don't give you seafood crackers so it's a bit difficult to get all the meat but the sauces mixed with the meat is absolutely delicious. I will certainly return and will bring a group next time"
1/23/2017,20170123,5,4.28,"Alright.....Alright.....Alright! I finally landed the opportunity to sit in at this shack. And I love the theme by the way of a cozy seafood shack. It runs through the place seamlessly. The minute you walk in......it's a seafood joint with friendly workers and happy ""readable signs"". Let's get to the palate: I ordered the crabby dip and salmon shrimp/broccoli. Let me tell you what was fantastic about the menu......it truly described every aspect of what I ordered. It was beyond my expectations. Seasoned, fresh,cooked well, and smelled delicious. Now the appetizer, was a bit disappointing bc of the choice of cheeses. The intensity of cheese layed low and allowed the crab to shine through......I mean great pieces of real crab but I wanted a cheesy....unhealthy version to dip my plantain chips in.Okayyyyyy okayyyyy.....the best part was the rum punch. My goodness!!!!! Refreshing and electric.....it had ginger and sorrel!!!!! #NeedISayMore"
1/24/2017,20170124,4,4.28,"I don't know where to start! Every time I come here, I order like $50 worth of food. I've tried almost everything on the menu. But I love the bake and shark and Johnny cakes with honey the most! It's nice to eat out in the back in the summer. In the winter, it's cozy but a little too small. The staff is nice. Prices are a bit high for some things. Always a favorite go-to spot for my best friend and I."
1/31/2017,20170131,5,4.28,"Delicious hot fish soup, shrimp, potatoes, and corn. Almost a Gumbo no okra.Crab cake sandwich Amazing. Service ver nice, price just a tad high for a shack.Friends like the shark bake.Will be definitely back."
2/13/2017,20170213,5,4.28,"Today was my second time ordering the soft shell crab during the lunch special. It comes with garlic fries and everything was A OK. I did call the mealin and picked it up to go. I prepared ghost pepper, salsa, and habenero sauces as I waited for my meal. I also paid 65 cent for the pineapple sauce which was very tasteful (thank you to another Yelper who mentioned this sauce). I am not afraid to try what others deem is great, :-). The first time I had this meal, it was better, yet, I guess my taste buds changed, lol. I also purchased a Ting with my order and it was okay. Ting is a grapefruit kinda bubbly, for anyone who loves grapefruit, you should definitely try it. Additionally, I was able to get a side of complimentary sweet plantains because I checked in on Yelp (great deal). In total, everything was 17$ and change. I recommend trying this shack :-). The guy who took my order was also engaging with his conversation after I told him I am Caribbean. He shared with me that the executive chef is also Guyanese and makes the sauces daily. I recommend that the chef start making a wiri wiri sauce."

I always get the snow crab legs with the special sauce, and occasionally I splurge and add the jerk ribs to my order. I have eaten here a couple times and they never disappoint! The food is always consistently delicious, and the customer service is always on point. They are conviently located just steps away from the 116th subway stop."

Space is a bit limited, but they were happy to accommodate a large party which we really appreciated!I shared the Belizean conch fritters with a friend. I always thought conch fritters were more of a Bahamian thing, and beats me what makes them Belizean, but they are delicious. Really flavorful and only fried as much as necessary - you won't feel gross after eating them.My main was the Shark + Bake. YUM! This was my first experience with shark (spiny dogfish). I was reassured that LoLo's cared enough to advertise that their shark was sustainably sourced, which has been the main concern preventing me from trying shark in the past. It was delicious! The texture was kind of like scallops, and it was super flavorful. It was served in a johnnycake. Growing up with a mother from Rhode Island, I had always thought a johnnycake was a Rhode Island food item, like a pancake but with cornmeal. Apparently it is also a thing in the Caribbean, and it was a pleasant bit of surprise nostalgia.Their drink selection is pretty good too - classic Jamaican beer Red Stripe for those who drink, and Ting (Jamaican grapefruit soda available throughout much of the English-speaking Caribbean) for those who don't!"

2/25/2017,20170225,3,4.29,"Closer to 2.5 stars based on the experience we had...I'm kind of bummed I can't add another 4 or 5-star review for LoLo's, but I just wasn't crazy about it. My boyfriend ordered the cod special and received the fish and chips instead. Luckily an employee pointed it out, so he was able to get back the difference in money, which we did appreciate. But still, it would have been nice to have just gotten what he ordered.I ordered the crab cake sandwich, and it took me a full 15-20 minutes to receive it after my BF got his order. While I waited, I nibbled on some of his fries, which were drizzled with kind of a lemony sweet remoulade-like sauce. These were pretty good, and I enjoyed the array of side sauces -- the banana pepper with ghost pepper and salsa verde were particularly tasty. Once I received my crab cake sandwich, I was sadly underwhelmed and remember why I rarely order that dish outside of NOLA or Maryland. There wasn't a lot of meat, and the crab tasted frozen. The portion was also small. All of the above was kind of disappointing for a $12 sandwich. The free plantains with the Yelp check-in were Okay but greasy. There's nothing even remotely healthy-ish on the entire menu. As for the interior, I get that they're going for a rustic shanty vibe, but that's no excuse for how the place looked. Boxes piled up everywhere, tables not bussed and things generally in disarray. No toilet paper in the bathroom either. The bathroom also had mouthwash, which is a nice touch. But it was empty! Why even bother offering an extra amenity if you can't keep up with it? If I manage to return in the future, I will update my review, but I won't go out of my way to go back."
2/28/2017,20170228,5,4.29,"Everything here is delicious and fresh. The best menu items are the conch fritters, wings and jerk ribs. Food wise the best are the Pom Pom shrimp n jerk chicken baskets. I'm forever in love with this place. I live in Brooklyn and travel here for good seafood"

3/2/2017,20170302,4,4.3,"03/02/2017 Update: I'm in Harlem again for an event at Columbia University and stopped in at LoLo's for dinner. It wasn't too busy at 7:45 on a Thursday night. I ordered the Shark Bake and plantains. The plantains were excellent.. sprinkled lightly with cheese, which sounds strange, but it works, trust me. They were hot and very tasty. The Shark Bake was very nice. Spiny dogfish in a pita-type thing with tomatoes and other goodies inside. A little greasy, but in a good way. They were all out of Ting (my favorite Caribbean soda) and also sold out of Caribe (one of my favorite Caribbean beers). I had a coconut soda instead. The total for the meal came to less than $15 before tip. Despite the aforementioned AWOL drinks, everything was very good. I'm docking one star because how can you run out of Ting??The other negative was listening to ""sophisticated"" Manhattanites ignorantly discuss politics. I felt like saying, ""Just Google the Logan Act already! You clearly have no clue about what you're discussing.""Nevertheless, I love LoLo's and will return whenever I'm visiting Harlem."

We checked in with yelp and got a free order of plantains, which was very good, and proceeded to share the crab legs and shrimp steam pot with Lolo's special sauce, and the wok seared cauliflower. It was just enough food for two people, but I would recommend ordering another dish if you're really hungry. The steampot was very good - the seafood was light retained its original flavor, and the Lolo's sauce was a kind of curry that you could dip your seafood into if you wanted additional flavor. The cauliflower was ridiculously good, with a little bit of a crunch and a nice smokey, savory flavor. The price for the steampot was a bit steep, $30 for only a smallish portion, but the quality is good. I will be taking my other friends here next time they visit NY."

I love the fusion fusion of wonder flavors they have to offer with their variety of menu items. Everything about this place is great. You walk and and think hey this is so small but BOOM ! You walk to the back they have a bigger space and there is even outdoor seating available. The decor is beautiful. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. Can you say free food !! You check in on yelp and you get their side order of sweet plantains that are too die for. I mean everything on the damn menu is good. I would know I have come here many of times and tried something different.

The fried stuff was good but the corn and plantains were my favorite. We came in the winter so it wasn't busy at all, but I can see there being a line out the door in the warmer months."

3/22/2017,20170322,3,4.3,"Wednesday evening 7pm, 2 people First time here, I thought the food was very overpriced.Skip on the baskets - absolutely not worth it. I got the pom pom shrimp which was ONLY 6 PIECES OF SHRIMP and fries for $16?! And my shrimp was a little rubbery, which was adding insult to injury.My gf got the crab cake basket, which was fine but the crab was too salty. Like, really salty. Another thing that bugged me was they wouldn't allow a substitution for the fries from that basket for cauliflower. I don't get why these days restaurants just flat out refuse - I'm okay even if you charge me $1-2 extra for the substitution. But nope not allowed, so we ordered a side of it. Was tasty, but not worth $6The friendliness of staff got a star, the free plantains with yelp check in were delicious and totally worth the star, and the availability of the sauces gets half star (because even though they said ""ghost pepper"" and ""habanero"", they weren't spicy AT ALL. And no scotch bonnet? Womp)Idk why this place is so highly rated - I will never come back again. Unless I F'ed up by wanting shrimp and got the crappiest thing on the menu"
3/25/2017,20170325,5,4.3,"I love this place, a really good time, the food was outstanding, ribs as good as they get!! The shrimp, amazing and I loved the Johnny cakes. Everything was great and it was like being in the Caribbean!! A unique dining experience, really nice people and great food, what more could you ask for. I'll be back!~"
3/31/2017,20170331,5,4.3,"First time visiting LoLo's (and certainly not our last...) and we really enjoyed it. The atmosphere and the quality of food were great! We bought two dishes to share and the portions ended up being pretty big (great if you want to take some home), so if you're not too hungry you could probably share one dish between two with one or two smaller sides. Highly recommend the jerk chicken, sweet plantains and the fried fish basket. The only slight downside is that the place is pretty small (and usually quite busy), so if you're going with a group of people then I guess its better to reserve a table ahead of your visit. We were just 2 so we quickly found a place to sit."
4/1/2017,20170401,5,4.3,"Such a gem located in Harlem. The decor is so cute and really transports you out of Manhattan. There is spacious and nice seating located in the back, where you can sit after you order and have your food brought to you. It is designed to look like a beach shack, with fun decor and bright colors. There are lots of benches to sit at with smaller groups, and also a separated area to sit with a larger group. There is also a heated cabana in the back! The food here is DIVINE! As a seafood from Maryland, this place does not disappoint. I have had their jerk chicken, coconut shrimp with garlic fries, and the crab pot. All of these dishes were so flavorful! They also have a wide selection of great sides to split with friends, like their sweet plantains.I also didn't know that they offered a happy hour deal from 4-6pm during the weekdays! Their deals were on beer and wine. Will definitely be back for happy hour!"
4/4/2017,20170404,2,4.3,"My love of seafood and with the location being so close to my house, I could no longer avoid LoLo's. Cutting right to the chase, the food is good but overpriced...especially for the portion that you get. Even though LoLo's is close to home, I would rather troop it down to The Boil."
4/9/2017,20170409,4,4.3,"WOW! Service and food were great! Decided to check this place out after seeing a deal on Groupon. Its a cute ""shack"" just off 116th. It was a rainy day but the interior still made me feel like I was somewhere tropical. Pom Pom Shrimp - A M A Z I N G. I would be happy with just this. Fried shrimp were crisp and the sauce wasn't an overpowering slop. It was enough sauce to keep the shrimp from becoming soggy.Pineapple salsa & plantain chips - Perfect amount of sweetness and spicy. I would buy a jar of this.Crawfish - Good, but I could do without. Crab dip - nicely warm and cheesy. Definitely something to share.Prices aren't too bad for it being seafood but with a Groupon its definitely a steal! Will return when the weather is warmer to take advantage of the back patio seating and drinks!"
4/16/2017,20170416,4,4.29,"I had the 1-lb shrimp combo. It was excellently freshly sweet! For people who love seafood, you must try their non-deep fried dishes. You won't be disappointed. Also the atmosphere just brings to you a seaport. Casual but not chaotic. It's self-service but staff there is super friendly and helpful."
4/19/2017,20170419,4,4.29,"Context: Came with my wife for lunch on a Sunday.Pros: Love the ambience in the outdoor seating area in the back. Feels exactly like a seafood shack should. Sweet plantains and fries were both excellent. Plantains were juicy and exploding with flavor and the fries had a great texture.Cons: Food took a bit longer than I had hoped. I thought the wings and coconut shrimp were both just ok. The wings were cooked well, but the sauce was missing a punch of flavor (that said, my wife really enjoyed them, so maybe you will too). The coconut shrimp's batter was a little heavy for my taste, and the sauce a little one note.Bottom line: A great place to grab a casual meal in Harlem. Would love to come back and try something else."
4/19/2017,20170419,5,4.3,"I want to say that this was my first time here. My son treatrd me to dinner and it was the best seafood i have had in such a long time. The staff were extremely respectful, helpful, and provided excellent service."

Lolo's uniquely creates and serves a variety of seafood and Caribbean food of the Cape. Their menu includes everything from deliciously fried conch fritters to jerk ribs. But, before you put your food order in, order the Lolo's Punch and mention Simplypamarie for a large Lolo's Punch for only $5 (available in April only.)

The food was decent but portions are weirdly sized, some seem really small (half a pound of shrimp was like 8 shrimp) and the pound of King Crab was huge and took me like 40 min to finish it.All around this place just feels too expensive for what they're selling and the service is very slow."
4/22/2017,20170422,4,4.29,"So I had the wings, fries, and ribs. Everything was good, the ribs needed some BBQ sauce."
4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.29,"This is my first time writing a review on yelp for a restaurant and I must say, the food is amazing. I dislike curry but when I tried it here, it was delicious. I had the jerk chicken and it was perfect. The portions size was great as well. Worth the money. I can't really rate the service since I ordered for delivery. I'm sure the service is just as great as the food. Will definitely be eating here again and I may just eat in next time."

All I went there for the crab cake but when they suggested for me to try the fries, and the crab legs. OMGGGG !!!! I'm speechless. Once again thanks Lolo's!!!!! Thanks Geremy and Jeff!!! Can't wait to go back"
4/24/2017,20170424,5,4.3,"Small place but worth going to. Cute decor they've made the best of the small space and that includes the outside eating area which gives you the feeling of being in the backyard in the caribbean eating and catching a good breeze (it was too early to get an alcoholic drink but I'll try one out next time). I had the coconut shrimp with fries which was delicious, the plantain chips and salsa which had just the right amount of kick (spice) and the rice and beans which was also delicious. Geremy (with a G) was excellent I informed him that this was the first time that we were eating at the restaurant and he took great care of us giving great descriptions of the items on the menu and suggestions on the sauces that best compliment each dish. The staff as a whole were great and attentive without being forced or overbearing, Geremy (with a G) and the staff made everyone feel like they were invited over to dinner by good friends. Great experience when great food, atmosphere and staff that make you feel at home. Will definitely be back to try some other items off the menu."
4/29/2017,20170429,5,4.3,This place was amazing! The food was delicious and the lolo punch was on point! Jeremy gave the best table service and was super personable. We would definitely come back to experience that type of hospitality again!

5/11/2017,20170511,3,4.3,"I was excited to finally try this place. I had heard 100 stories of how amazing the food was and how often people ordered from here. The fiancee and I made it a point to make it a stop in our plans for the day. We ordered the ribs, plantains, and the fish basket. Each and every bite of each dish disappointed me. I always like to leave a small disclaimer: I am from the South. Houston, Texas to be exact, ok? The food/seasoning/RIBS are second to none ok? The fish was rubbery and felt like I was eating a steak. The ribs were baked it seemed and tasted day old? The plantains had parmesan cheese on top. The plantains had parmesan cheese on top. I said that twice for effect if you didnt notice, and not the good way. It is not worth your time. But 3 stars for existing. Also, the staff was super friendly."
5/18/2017,20170518,5,4.3,"Amazing!!! Simply amazing!!! I had the steamed pot that brought crab legs and shrimp. It was seasoned to perfection! Right along with the garlic fries. Service was great and the young man was attentive and kept asking us if everything was okay. It's a little hole in the wall, but once you find it step right in to some great seafood. I will definitely be coming here every time I need my seafood fix!!"
5/19/2017,20170519,4,4.3,"YUM! Loved eating at Lolo's. We came for dinner on a hot evening in May. At the shack, you order up front and a runner brings out your food ""when it's ready."" This makes it ideal for sharing items. All staff were very friendly. We ordered the salmon shrimp and broccoli basket, the coconut shrimp with garlic fries, and the broccoli salad. All the seafood tasted fresh and the garlic fries were bomb.We sat outside on the adorable patio and met some really cool people. Great hang out spot! A few recommendations would be to add more/stronger fans on the patio because it gets very sticky out there"
5/21/2017,20170521,1,4.29,"I am a first time customer to Lolo's and I HATE to do this, but I went there today on this nice Sunday hoping to get a amazing meal... I ordered the White Fish and Chips . It was sooo AWFUL. I mean the fish was so dry I could literally choke. Honestly, it was GROSS and I wasted my money. Thanks I wanted to return to get an exchange or refund."
5/29/2017,20170529,5,4.29,"In my opinion, the is the best restaurant in Harlem. I eaten here a lot and the food is consistently good, the staff is always fun and helpful, and it's just an overall great place to eat. I grew up in South Florida and this is probably the closest I'll come to eating the really ecletic mix of foods you can get down there. Lolo's does a great job of bringing together seafood, great Latin and Caribbean inspired side dishes, and even some traditional northern seasonings (looking at you, Old Bay) to create a really delicious menagerie of menu items. Also, don't be food by looking in the window and thinking it's really small, there is seating in the back and even more seating outside, which is a great place to sit, and they even keep it super warm and cozy in winter."
5/31/2017,20170531,4,4.29,"Crispy ""shark"" + bake-very good. Spiny dogfish tastes like crab meat. Very flavorful. Chewy bread. Pom Pom shrimp + garlic fries basket-good. Flavorful crispy shrimp. Tasty garlic fries. Sweet plantains-very good. The best plantains I have ever had. Sweet and buttery with cheese and herbs. Johnny cakes + honey butter-good. Sweet and chewy pan fried cakes with butter. Reminds me of mama's cooking. Interesting outdoor seating area. Excellent service."
6/3/2017,20170603,5,4.29,Lolo's is one of my favorite places to eat in Harlem. Everything is delicious and the Johnny Cakes are to die for.
6/5/2017,20170605,3,4.29,"Came on a Saturday for a late lunch around 3pm.Beautiful day out, snagged a table in the backyard garden pretty easily.From other reviewers it sounds like this place is pretty exceptional for the area...I'm not familiar with Harlem, so you can take my review with a grain of salt. Lolo's is charming, the prices are fair, no complaints on the food or service. But I wouldn't say its worth going out of the way for... nor would I say it's the best seafood deal out there. As cute at the garden area is, the seating is uncomfortable and the wood on the benches and tables will give you splinters if you happen to brush against them too quickly. We ordered ribs, wings, crab cake sandwich and a 1/2 lb of shrimp. The ribs were nice and tender- falling off the bone, the bbq sauce it came with was fine- but not exceptional. The crab cake sandwich was disappointing. I enjoyed the mild curry sauce the shrimp came in- but the sauce could've used some salt and when I think peel and eat shrimp I expect the heads to be on- these were headless, also seemed a little skimpy on the portion... The wings were actually our favorite part of the meal, loved the sauce on them. Lolo's is okay and we had a nice time- but not worth a trip up to Harlem."
6/7/2017,20170607,3,4.29,Place looked cute. Happy hour rum Punch seemed like it would be real good. Menu looked appealing. Maybe it was our food choices. Ribs. Coconut shrimp. Crawfish tacos. None of those really popped flavor wise. Shrimp was greasy. Food didn't satisfy in a way sadly. And worse of all the $7 rum punch happy hour mind you was like weak fruit juice with not a hint of rum. I'm not even sure they gave me punch. Could've well been juice. I will give high praise to the work staff ... everyone was super friendly and chill and seemed to enjoy their work.  Atmosphere was catchy and low key. Just no satisfaction on the food and drink. Personally won't return.
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.29,"Went on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, had the jerk chicken, the salmon and crab legs the food was EXCELLENT! Will continue to go back until I've tried everything on the menu. The place is small, but the service was great and the food arrived to our table quickly and piping hot. Keep it up!"
6/12/2017,20170612,4,4.29,"Lolo's is definitely a secret little treasure in Harlem. They offer a cute indoor seating area and a nice, outdoor backyard area as well. The vibe is Caribbean chill.You come in and place your order at the counter in front. They give you a numbered sign and you find a place to camp out until your food arrives. The shrimp and crab legs are pretty good although the fritters are a little too battered for my taste. The plantains are definitely a local favorite. All of the food is made-to-order, which, especially for the mammoth legs, can take some time. Be sure to order extra beer/soda if you come during peak. Once your order is completed, you have to wait on line to start a new tab if you wanted seconds."
6/12/2017,20170612,5,4.29,"Delicious! Great, chill, atmosphere. Just like being in the Caribbean. Pricing is high, but the food is worth it. Bring a bottle and be prepared to wait on yourself. This is not typical waiter service. They bring your food, but you get your own tableware and napkins and water, and clean up after yourself. Loved it!"
6/18/2017,20170618,3,4.29,"I read many good reviews of this restaurant, but the dish that I ordered did not leave me greatly impressed. I got a fried whitefish with fries and dirty rice. The remoulade seasoning on the fish was very good when paired with their tartar sauce, but I wish that there would have been a little more remoulade seasoning because the fish tasted a bit plain. I was disappointed in the dirty rice, which was also rather plain. If I go again, I will probably order something else on the menu."
6/19/2017,20170619,5,4.29,"+++- bess coconut shrimp++- awesome service+- rum punch is good- delightful sweet potatoes- if u like fried and greasy food, you good  (lucky for them, i do)- - wife was not fan of crawfish- good garlic friesTIPS- order first, then sit"
6/22/2017,20170622,2,4.28,"I've never felt compelled the leave a yelp review for anything before but here we are. The good: great atmosphere, friendly staff, good menu options The bad: literally everything else. Our order took forever to come out, we had to ask for gloves/napkins which should just be brought out with your meal, but the worst part was that the dish we ordered was completely inedible. We got the crawfish shrimp set. The shrimp were good (why no heads though?) but the crawfish were horrible. Not sure if they had gone bad or were frozen but they were literally grey and alternatively tasted flavorless, mildly rotten or overwhelming salty. We ended up leaving half the dish unfinished and for that price that was a real disappointment. Even the old bay garlic butter sauce, which I personally consider to be the sauce of the gods, did not make it edible and actually was also not very flavorful in itself. If you are looking for good similar food, would highly recommend the boil, crabby shack, or Gladys. This was pretty terrible."
6/22/2017,20170622,5,4.28,Excellent service and wide variety of menu options. The baskets come at a decent price and fill you up well. Decor of the restaurant is also pleasant and homely.
6/24/2017,20170624,4,4.28,I took my partner here for Father's Day last Friday if you've never been to Lolo's you order first and then you head downstairs. There appears to be no seating in the front but there is seating in the back and even outside is very reminiscent of a actual place in the Caribbean which I thought was really really nice. I ordered grilled salmon and my partner order fish and fries. My salmon was good actually very tasty not much broccoli but that didn't stop the food from being good. My partner enjoyed the fish I believe he had some type of shark but it was prepared as though it was your traditional fried Whiting or Cod. This place carries Island Vibes and serves lots of Louisiana style dishes such as crab boils and fried shrimps. I thought it was impressive how they gave people gloves to wear while they were eating there crabs. If I had to change anything I will probably change the tip procedure the tips are actually taken when you pay for your food in the beginning which can be kind of weird what if you didn't like the service the cashier was nice. I love how the staff tend to work together. Another thing that I could pass on is the lack of selection of the beverages they have limited space to keep them cold so the drink that you order on the menu may not appear in the cooler. Another word about the drinks the mixed drinks signature drinks that they offer were very weak and served and very small cups pointless over priced. Overall very nice establishment I will come again but definitely on date night it is pricey but the Ambiance is everything
6/26/2017,20170626,5,4.28,"This was such a cute place. I found it on Yelp and am so glad I stopped and ate here. I was here in the winter and sat outside. They have an outdoor seating area that's heated. It was really nice. I would definitely eat out there again. The inside of the restaurant was a little dark and cramped. The food was so yummy! I had shrimp, corn, and seafood. The place is definitely worth the hype! I can't wait to come back here and eat more delicious food. The staff was friendly and the service was speedy, too. This place is centrally located and easy to get to. And street parking or a lot is the best place to park when coming here, unless you're taking the train."
6/28/2017,20170628,4,4.28,"Wonderful. First off the service from the staff in front and the waitress was amazing. It's hard to find good service in New York and we found some.I checked in and got the free sweet plantains. They were so good my wife decided to go and get her own cause I was eating them so fast. Then we down outside at first to decide on the menu but after a few creepy crawlers fell from the wood beams above us on too the menu is was time to get out of there so we sat inside which was perfectish. We ordered what we call the Simon smorgasbord. Which means we ordered everything that peaked our interest.Simon Smorgasbord -Bake and Shark-Jerk Ribs- Smoked Wings-Corn on the cob w/ cotija cheese -Eat and peel shrimp -Coconut shrimp basket- Garlic fries-Lunch order up grade garlic fries- two Rum punchFood came out as soon as it was ready and was delicious overall. My bake and shark was phenomenal a lil of the habanero sauce and it was perfect. Jerk ribs, wings and corn on the cob were also real good. We got the peel and eat shrimp which was cooked perfect and got it in the garlic butter and old bay which was good but we also ordered a side of the ginger butter ($1) and it was the only thing I used.  My wife loved the coconut shrimp basket and would not share with me. So the bake and shark stayed with me. The garlic fries were delicious as well not over garlicky and the fries were crispy. Now for my uh oh's  Uh Oh 1 : I love rum punch having a Caribbean background has nothing to do with it either. I just love rum punch. One time in Puerto Rico I drank my body weight in rum punch over a weekend. True Story Bro. So when I say it tastes like medicine. It tasted like medicine. I mean just like cough syrup medicine. I drank mine quick and stuck to water my wife could not finish hers. I would definitely avoid the rum punch I don't know if it's the rum they use or the juice sat too long or what but but if you have a slight cough go for it. Uh Oh 2: The table we sat at was next to an employees only door. Which employees went into several times and with it so close that I felt it on my back once. It would have been nice to get an excuse me, warning, pardon when someone went into the door. I would have even settled for a don't let the door hit you as you eat. With that said that's all my Uh Oh's. Avoid the rum punch. And sit outside at your own risk. The food is good, portions are a bit small for the price. But delicious. Enjoy."
6/30/2017,20170630,5,4.29,"This is a fun neighborhood place. The food is excellent. They have bibs and gloves if you're venturing into the crab legs, etc. They have a ton of tasty sauces. The staff is happy and mostly attentive - that tells you a lot about an establishment. Definitely dine in the back patio area (reservations accepted)."
7/2/2017,20170702,5,4.29,"Awesome seafood boil! Fun little restaurant in Harlem. You feel like you are in Key West if you sit outside on the colorful deck. Delicious peel and eat shrimp. Make sure you don't come in your finest clothes, it sure does get messy!!"
7/3/2017,20170703,4,4.29,"Great fries, great crab cake sandwiches. Their fried plantains were delicious. Which by the way, if you check in on yelp, you get for free!We arrived just before a huge party took over the back of the store so service was a little slow. Not their fault. The employees working here are friendly. In addition to the outdoor seating, there's also two areas to eat indoors. One in the front near their entrance. Another in the back of the store with about six tables. I saw a lot of people dining in ordering the bake + shark but I didn't get to try that. Next time!"
7/4/2017,20170704,1,4.28,"I saw all the postive reviews and was hopeful for a good experience at Lola'sThe ambiance takes me back to my trip in New OrleansA shack in the back for seatingOrdering was not a postive experience as the cashier taking my order was extremely slow to take it making me wait in favor of people he had calling in on the phoneAnd the reason I came to Lola's was I had a hankering for crab cakes, only be told by the cashier they no longer had any. That deflated my visit, as I really only came cause I was craving crab cakes. I did stay and had the ribsChicken with fries (cause they also ran out of the rice?)And the fishThe fish was the best, though definitely undeseasoned and a little undercookedThe ribs were bland. Its easier to find better ribs anywhere in NY where they actually put a sauce on them.The chicken was fine. They served it over the fries, which were also fine, but their presentation of how they served it was bad. They placed the chicken over the fries when they really should be served separately.And to top off my visit here, I see several people that came in after I did with crab cakes, which I was told they were out of!Too shady I won't be back!"
7/4/2017,20170704,5,4.28,"I've been here several times over the past couple years, with large and small groups. I've never heard a complaint. I also order delivery. The smoked chicken wings and coconut shrimp are fantastic. The fried smelt is my least favorite dish. The jerk chicken is great. The crablegs and shrimp boil are my favorite. Pay the $1.50 for the extra sauce with the crablegs. You're welcome."
7/13/2017,20170713,5,4.28,"We ordered Conch Fritters, Fish Fry Basket & Jerk Chicken Basket..... All delicious and tasty. We sat outside and I thought I was in a Caribbean shack experience music and all. I found it on Black owned restaurants site in Harlem was very pleased will return. When leaving had the pleasure of meeting the Chef Sylvia and thanked her... chicken fell off the bone and was not too spicy, and the rice I could eat solo. Thanks again."
7/19/2017,20170719,5,4.28,Jennifer and Syliva are a dynamic duo!! Best Jerk Chicken basket ever- lolos is a gem in Harlem...love this place!
7/22/2017,20170722,5,4.29,"This place was so delicious, my husband and I had 2 rounds of the 1lbs crab& 1/2lb shrimp in the Lolo special sauce and regular Old Bay butter sauce. I dont know if it's in the sauce or how they cook it, but the crab legs cracked perfectly each bite, didn't even have to use the crackers. Grapefruit beer was perfect to wash it all down. Also the price is super affordable, you can't find anywhere in manhattan. Definitely coming back for more!"
7/23/2017,20170723,4,4.29,"Super cute seafood shack, we went early but by the time we were leaving the line was out the door. For nice days the outdoor space is great but it was hot and I wanted AC so we sat in the room in the back.Crabby dip: so good def worth a try Seafood boil with the curry sauce is amazing!!!Soft shell crab sandwich was good but I only recommend it when it's season and right now is the season!Drinks: some tequila cocktail I had was so good and pretty strong."
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.29,"Make sure to try the fish and chips, salmon and sweet plantains. I loved their cute little outdoor area."
7/29/2017,20170729,4,4.29,"I decided to try this place out, but I only ordered take out. I got the pom pom shrimp and garlic fries -- so good. I also got an order of plantains, thanks to my Yelp checkin. Everything was delicious, and the garlic dipping sauce added the right touch. The price point did seem a bit high at $16 though. I may come back and actually dine in the next, just so that I can get a proper feel of the restaurant."
7/31/2017,20170731,5,4.29,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! That food is DELICIOUS!!! Crab legs in a garlic butter sauce, shrimp, garlic fries with a lemon aioli sauce & those plantains YUMMM. The service is great, everyone is so friendly & welcoming. LOVE the decor. I felt like I was at a restaurant in the carribean. I can't wait to go back."
8/1/2017,20170801,5,4.29,"They have such a delicious selection of foods. I had the pom pom shrimp and garlic fries. Everything was awesome, including their frozen drinks. And please try their plantains and crab dip, soooo yum."
8/3/2017,20170803,5,4.29,"Eat in, carry out, or deliver (locally). I waked in for lunch. Said I had to be dairy-free. The counter person knew the menu in its entirety. I asked about gluten-free for my husband and he went through the whole menu to go over what was safe. I took home a copy all marked and plan to talk my husband into a dinner date on Friday. Good price range--plenty to choose from for all budgets. Great for summer and probably great for winter when you need a dose of summer."
8/8/2017,20170808,4,4.29,What I love the most about Lolo's Shack is the vibe. The restaurant has a lot of character. Its not particularly fancy. I mean it actually feels like a shack (kinda worn down) but the overall esthetic works. The food is about 3.5 stars for me. I had the bake and shark (dogfish) and it was alright. The fish was on the blander side and the johnny cake fried bread was tasty but not an effective vehicle for the sandwich. It fell apart quickly. Some of the people I was with got different sandwiches that stayed together. On the bright side the fish was fresh and well cooked the johnny cake is yummy and their sauces are good. I had some plantains and a ting and it all came up to $16. A couple friends got shrimp and white fish and they LOVED it. Additionally they have a large variety of menu items to choose from. I saw some crab boils leave the kitchen that were mouth watering. On the service side it was a bit slow for my meal (everyone elses food came out pretty promptly) and there was a bottle neck up front to order that they really need to do something about.
8/8/2017,20170808,5,4.29,Great seafood. Casual place. Great service also. I love their fries with the white sauce. Their crawfish sauce was also very spicy but I loved it!
8/9/2017,20170809,5,4.29,Chandler was the best host and made the customers feel like LoLo's is a very special place to be. Favorite place in Harlem.
8/10/2017,20170810,5,4.3,"Stumbled across this little place tonight, just off the 116th C/B trains, and very happy to have done so. Really nice selection of island seafood, freshly prepared in front of you. Soft shell crab sandwich was excellent, and the fried plantain with some kind of cheese sprinkled on was amazing. (checked in on the app, and it was a free bonus). I ordered to go, but the really cozy seating in an outdoor garden ""shack"" in the back looked so appealing that I definitely gotta come back here with friends soon. Oh, and Chandler, the guy at the counter was really nice, introducing me to the cooks preparing the food as well. Highly recommended...FIVE STARS!"
8/10/2017,20170810,4,4.29,"I must say that I was surprised with the quality of the food and service. Both were great. They made me feel that they wanted to serve like they enjoyed my patronage. I felt it. The food showed the quality. The taste was great too. However when you first see the front of the restaurant, you will question this opinion. Trust me...it is an experience."
8/11/2017,20170811,4,4.29,"Had to take food to-go, but goddam it was GOOD. I had conch fritters, chicken wings, and cauliflower. SO MUCH FOOD for such great prices. I wasn't able to go further in, but it was a cute chill place with awesome music. The conch fritters didn't skimp on the meat and were a great mixture of veggies and meat. Only 3 pieces came with chicken, but it was both flats and drumettes. The spices on the chicken were out of this world, a nice mix of ancho and other spices that were evocative of the yucatan and caribbean locales. The cauliflower was good and there was enough so I had some for breakfast the next day. Definitely would recommend going here if you're in Harlem!"
8/11/2017,20170811,4,4.29,"Food is very good (B+) and unique idea, good concept. Food is kinda heavy and place is not very comfortable to sit in ('vintage'=rickety chairs and tables). A lot of buzz, but does not quite live up to it."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.29,"Ordered the coconut shrimp and garlic fries they were amazing ! But I fell in love with the 1lbs of crab legs in the lolos sauce !! Also the reason why I gave you guys a five star review is because if the service. As some of you may not know they have a delivery radius that's 110-120th street I believe. And they still allowed my order and delivered it to me. I'm located a block too far, so I was impressed by the service. So thank you very much for the amazing food. Can't wait to order again from there"
8/14/2017,20170814,4,4.29,"So I am giving Lolo's Four Stars. Why Four and not Five.....I love the set up. It really looks like Belize right in Harlem, U.S.A. The music was cool and eating outside in the back was even cooler.Starting off with Conch Fritters was how the meal started. They were aight. Maybe I am not the biggest fan of Conch Fritters but hey, they weren't nasty. The white sauce they came with was amazing. I ordered an Avocado, plantain Johnny Cake sandwich. I didn't really know what to expect. I thought it was would be fine, I expected way too much cotija cheese but the amount of cotija was perfect. The sandwich was A+! Great flavors! I want one right now just thinking about it. I miss it. It was that good.I tried the Jerk Chicken. The Rice and Peas were greatness. It even had some chickpeas in there. Great flavors on the Rice and Peas and the Jerk was right. Not all chopped up Jamaican style. I would recommend you either go extra hungry if you are doing the Jerk or you share it with someone along with a side because the chicken was huge. The Four Stars are more like 4.8 stars pending 5(can't wait to return). I can understand not having salbutes (my favorite Belizean food) but I totally expected to see some Panades. So because of that and not being wowed by the Conch Fritters, a very strong Four Star rating. ""Yay! I'm a fan."""
8/14/2017,20170814,5,4.3,"Amazing seafood, Lolo's shrimp and plantains were insane! Great date spot. Staff was super friendly"
8/20/2017,20170820,5,4.3,"This place is the best! The front staff probably knows me by now as I like to come here to buy crab legs often. Their sauces are great and customer service is always friendly with smiles to greet you. This spot is so unique in offering Caribbean seafood cuisine. One day, I will expand to trying their other stuff, but for now, I am addicted to their crab legs and special sauce. If you want to goto a restaurant that is truly unique in what they have to offer in terms of food and interior experience, Lolo's should be your next spot."
9/5/2017,20170905,5,4.3,"Super nice placesimple and very relaxed, Staff was friendly.Food was Amazing, lot of nice flavors in all dishes.will come back for sure"
9/5/2017,20170905,4,4.3,"I loved having this spot right down the street from me, and miss it so much after moving out of Harlem just last week. I never got around to trying their crawfish boil, but can say I am a big fan of all the sandwiches. The plantains are awesome here as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute - Caribbean decor and an outdoor patio"
9/5/2017,20170905,5,4.3,"From the outside, it looks like a tiny spot with no seating, but there are seats inside in the back, and they also have outdoor enclosed seating. Had the crab legs with Old Bay seasoning, Johnny cakes, and plantains, and they were all tasty. They also sell my favorite grapefruit beer, which was a bonus. Service was spectacular, of course. Will definitely come here again."
9/7/2017,20170907,3,4.3,"I was not overall impressed! They are overcharging for the portions that they are providing. I had the crab cake lunch special sandwich and I felt like it was lacking flavor, even the fries felt like a false advertisement...but that's only because mine had gotten so cold from waiting on my friends food to come. And to make matters worse I was unable to use my Yelp First Time Coupon (highly disappointed). I will admit I came with a group of people, but no where did it list that I couldn't use if i was coming with a group. I would go back to try another meal option."
9/19/2017,20170919,4,4.3,"Just got done walking through Central Park and I'm famished. Luckily I found this gem in Harlem. First off, I love seafood. Second, I have worked in seafood for a couple of years. My point being I know good fish when I see it. Well this was phenomenal fish. I haven't tried all the items I'd have liked but I'm definitely coming back. I also loved the backyard area. The seats were a bit wobbly but the atmosphere and service were great. Will come back"
9/20/2017,20170920,4,4.3,"Loving Lolo's! came here for the first time because I had a sudden non-preggo Preggo craving for seafood LOL! Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to choose, but I ended up getting the conch fritters (and picked at my friends' jerk chicken and fish n' chips =D). Service was ok, they mainly bring you the food but our waiter was really nice! The fritters were amazing, outdoor seating was accommodating, restrooms were clean, and staff is friendly. I'll def be back!"
9/22/2017,20170922,1,4.29,Food was horrible. Seriously the greasiest fries I've ever had in my life. And the plantain chips were straight from a corner store. SMH. Never again I tell you.
9/24/2017,20170924,4,4.29,Good food and cool staff at this no frills place. Food is satisfying. Drinks (alcoholic and otherwise) could be cheaper. Music adds to the positive vibes. I'd definitely eat here again.
10/9/2017,20171009,5,4.29,"LOVE this place! One of our favorites in the neighborhood. It's tucked away and truly a hidden gem. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious, and we love the backyard shack. It's got an authentic vibe to it. Our favorites to get: the crawfish/shrimp combo boil; the crab dip w plantains; and a side plantains is a must. Can't say enough about how good it is!"
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.29,"I always got the shrimp and loved it, never needed to try the other options. The appetizer wings are amazing, you get 3 full wings."
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.29,Ya'll....Im telling you this was the best food that Ive had in the city so far. Me and my date ordered the crab legs with sweet potato and shrimp and it was the best thing I've had ever! It is also very affordable. I keep convincing my date that we can't possibly eat the same place two days in a row but he is insistent ...thats how good the food is !
10/22/2017,20171022,4,4.29,"I've dined here on 2 occasions. If you love seafood and just looking for a cool vibe, this is your place. But if you love seafood and you are trying to impress a date... This isn't the place for you. Lolo' s has a garage feel to it. When it's nice they have ""back yard"" seating. I've heard great things about their rum punch, ive yet to try it.I love their Lolo sauce... It's like a coconut, curry sauce. You can add it to your crab legs, and I promise it's delish!"
10/26/2017,20171026,5,4.29,"All Right All Right All Right. Just ordered for the first time and the food was great. I ordered the Jerk ribs, Pom Pom Shrimp, Durty Rice and Johnny Cakes. Ribs was good, Pom Pom shrimp 100% must get. Rice was OK and johnny Cakes on point. Will be ordering again."
11/5/2017,20171105,1,4.29,Please folks choose another restaurant no taste food is very bland absolutely not what we expected I would rather the old Chinese restaurant that was originally there
11/21/2017,20171121,5,4.29,"Y'all! Harlem has really good food, but there aren't enough Caribbean restaurants, especially places that offer bake and shark. Bake is a Trini dish, it's a type of soft/sweet bread that you use to make sandwiches.You guys need to go there. I ordered bake and shark, fries, codfish fritters, and plantain. My friend ordered fried soft shell crab and bake. The food came warm and quickly, and we first had the codfish fritters. They were very soft, fried well, and full of flavor. The fries were fried perfectly; they were crunchy with a good taste and fluffy inside/dense.The bake and shark was my favorite piece of the meal. I added avocado and bacon, and it was a wonderful addition. The plantains were also a surprise delight; they have cojito cheese on top, and it paired perfectly with how ripe they were.Definitely will go again, and definitely will take friends."
11/28/2017,20171128,3,4.28,"Such a cute little seafood shack. There's nothing fancy about this place, but the food is good. We ordered the soft crab sandwich, Pom Pom Shrimp Basket with garlic fries, sweet plantains with cotija cheese (courtesy of Yelp checkin!) and corn on the cob with cotija. Everything was really delicious. The Pom Pom Shrimp was very well seasoned and def my fav. The soft crab sandwich was interesting lots of different flavors and the bacon added even more , the homemade bread is amazing. I'd go back just for that.So you may ask, why only 3 stars, well when we entered we were hit with a strong smell of marijuana. So we were a bit hesitant, we inquired with the cashier to find out why the smell was so strong and she explained that the neighbor smokes and the smell seeps in. That's something I think they need to get a handle on because it was really strong. As a result we opted to sit outside in Lolo's Cabana (which was heated) and very cute!Because of this I am giving them only 3 stars unfortunately."
11/28/2017,20171128,3,4.28,"After doing sip and paint activity nearby, we decided to visit this place. As we walked in, there was an overwhelming smell of marijuana. So much so that I inquired with the lady at the front just so I know if I'm at the wrong place. She stated the neighbors smell and the smell comes from their apt. Anyways. We proceeded to make our order in the front and paid. We continued to the cabana all the way to the back, and downstairs. It's a cute little warm sheltered area where you can peacefully devour your food. The very nice gentleman brought our food as it was ready, and was quite pleasant. I had the soft crab sandwich which was tasty, but left me wanting more crab. I also ordered some corn on the cob, which was good, and tasted some of my friends shrimp which was fresh and combined with the fries made a decent portion. All in all, staff was friendly, and food was good. Not sure I'd come back though"
12/2/2017,20171202,4,4.28,"Love this spot (especially for a fun date)! Nice ambiance, great service, good music, and yummy food. I typically get the Pom Pom shrimp and mango slushy (which comes with a shot). Also make sure to use the yelp check in for free sweet plantains!"
12/6/2017,20171206,3,4.28,Food was quite average. The outdoor seating is cute but small. I would recommend just for appetizers and a drink on a summer's night.
12/11/2017,20171211,2,4.27,"Didn't love it here. Was surprised that the reviews were so off from my experience. The food was mediocre, the environment was not very clean - or somewhere you want to stay and eat - (admittedly the name shack should inform that it's not a fancy ambiance) - I would be semi okay with that if the food was spot on... and I would get it more maybe if the prices were more modest."
12/12/2017,20171212,1,4.27,"surprised by the good reviews because the pom pom shrimp batter was so oily, it was mushy and just slid off. at least the shrimp were big. the garlic fries were oily and hard. biting into it was difficult and there was barely any potato inside, just oily emptiness. maybe it's because we ordered 40 mins before they were about to close?"
1/5/2018,20180105,5,4.27,Quality eats coupled with amazing service. The host was extremely knowledgeable and patient. The Chefs were all friendly cooks ‚Äãand displayed great customer service as well. My only issue is the lighting. I'll definitely be back again with my seafood loving friends!
1/22/2018,20180122,4,4.27,"So Yelp recommends this place in Harlem near the Hamilton House. It's a combination Caribbean and Cape Cod fusion place, so of course we had to check it out. After taking the E train to Queens instead, Lyft delivered us to the right address in the right borough. Lolo's Seafood Shack is in a small storefront right next to the 116th Street Station, if you catch the right train!The menu is quite extensive with lots of options. Most of the menu focuses on seafood, but there are several land options. On a Saturday, the place was full of locals which was a good sign. I opted for the crab cakes and fries with my friend having the jerk chicken with rice and johnnycakes.The food was really good. My crab cakes were just lumps of wonderfully flavored crab which turned the dish into more of a crab fries option. My friend's chicken was also very good with a great flavor and texture. It paired well with the coconut rice and the bread. The interior was a bit cramped, but there is a back patio used in better weather.Lolo's is a great reason why I use Yelp. You can find neighborhood gems like this easy and fast. They were a great place and a great value. We enjoyed a flavorful meal and had a nice time while exploring New York."
1/28/2018,20180128,5,4.27,Shrimp boil + johnny cakes = divineYelp requires a minimum number of words but divine sums of up perfectly. Not to be be missed!
2/3/2018,20180203,4,4.27,"""Hmm, that was interesting...looks like in order for us to get to Manhattan we'll have to deal with some insane shutdowns and reroutes on the subway this weekend...and the Q60 bus will be packed""Hence began a journey to find a better way to reach midtown on a brisk, cool Saturday in Feburary for a spot of brunch. Step 1: Q70 airport bus to get to LGA Terminal B. Step 2: From Terminal B, M60 airport bus to get to Harlem.Step 3....Screw it. Midtown is boring as hell, the people we are trying to brunch with has the personality of IKEA Furniture, might as well look for something interesting on West 116th and walk then down Morningside/Columbus to 72nd. I'll make no mince of it - I enjoy grabbing lunch in Harlem/Morningside Heights area since you are consistently inundated with good choices. There's the Senegalese/Ivorian joints, the Pakistani cab stands, the soul food restaurants, and with the influx of Columbia Grad school kids from East Asia, plenty of Korean and Szechuan options where it previously does not exist. Sometimes you even run into things that seem a little out of place, and then you realize ""Oh yeah. Harlem is gentrifying - Acceptable instance of crazy"". Like gourmet soul-fusion (you know, Red Rooster or StreetBird), maybe a hookah bar with Shakshouka and laffahs. Or it could be a Caribbean-style seafood shack with rum punch.So okay, first thing to know about Lolo's - it's in a converted townhouse on the quieter side of West 116th - it's 2 short blocks off the cliffs of Morningside park. There is a large open-ish kitchen/service counter in the front, a passageway to its side leading to the small self-service dining area out back, and if you are keen, there is a covered outdoor dining area in the backyard. There's also a hut there that hosts a bar during the summertime. It's fairly no-frills - step up to the front, order, grab a sign and someone will courier the food over to you. The napkins sauces and bibs are at the side, and if you want more food just order up front. The Atmosphere is good - the music is classic 90s hip-hop. When I got in they were playing ""You got me"" from the Roots, then some James Brown. Something that encourages you to lay back and take in the atmosphere. Now, about the food - it's what you expect from a seafood hut - plonk down a grip of Jacksons (or your favorite form of plastic currency), and based on your preferences, pick up a sign so the victuals can be dropped off later by the friendly staff, or, oh, picked up when they call your name. The choices on the menu are similar to the offering at the crawfish boils around the city, but with some island touches like coconut curry sauce, conch fritters and rum punch. Me and the missus shared a bag of the pepper peel-and-eat shrimp, except we made the mistake of ordering it with the Lolo sauce, which is coconut curry with scallion, butter and the works - good (and surprisingly Malaysian in flavor), but whatever pepper they used was trampled all over by the curry. That being said, the sauce was good enough for me to suck it off the shrimp shells and then dip it back onto the bottom - makes me wish that I have some garlic bread or rice to dip it with, seems like a pity to waste that sauce (not sure if JohnnyCakes will work, though). The shrimp was perfectly tender and flavorful, and there are pieces of sweet potato and a single corn on the cob. Good thing we got gloves.My wife ordered the fish-n-chips, which came with garlicy fries and a large piece of scrod filet that was delicately coated. Good stuff, and will work well with a Red Stripe, me being used to the Friday evening Buffalo fish-fry and the English Chipsy, though, I was looking hopefully for the Malt Vinegar (doesn't exist). It was good though. We were worried about the relatively small size of the portions, but after we polished it off, it was just about right. Overall, a good friendly experience - seafood's getting expensive (in general), and it's definitely not something to cheap out on. If I am back in the area and in the mood for some seafood island-style, I'll totally return."
2/12/2018,20180212,1,4.26,I just walked 20 blocks over to eat here and it was closed!! Had an amazing Birthday dinner here a year ago.. So upset...is this Lolos Seafood Shack shutdown for good?
2/14/2018,20180214,3,4.26,"Food was decent: had the conch fritters, crab cake in a Johnny cake (fried bake), and a free side of plantains (courtesy of using the Yelp app)... conch fritters were ehh, just really lacking flavor. The crab cake in the Johnny cake was pretty good. I did not like the plantain side AT ALL. They were cut too thick for my liking and didn't seem to be fully ripe."
2/19/2018,20180219,3,4.26,"Despite the ratings on Yelp, I was left pretty disappointed. The portion size and quality at this restaurant definitely does not justify the price. I ordered the crab crakes and fries basket which came out to a little over $28. The portion was very small. It was just two crab cakes sitting over your average fries. It looked like something you could get at a food truck for way less the cost. Neither were enough to rave about, nor pay nearly $30 for. My friend ordered the half pound of shrimp and elotes and paid about $20. The shrimp was small and the seasoning was bland. The corn used for the elotes was extremely tiny. I'd never had such small cons of corn before. I think this restaurant tries to emulate that southern seafood style of cuisine, however, its attempt really falls flat. I've had much better elsewhere. However, I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 because the staff is friendly."
2/25/2018,20180225,5,4.26,"Randomly found this place on yelp and I'm now in love! The service was great and the food was even better! I got the salmon, grilled shrimp and broccoli in the butter garlic sauce and SMASHED it all! We also tried the plantains, they were cooked perfectly! I will definitely be back!"
3/4/2018,20180304,3,4.26,"I've passes Lolo's many times but this my first time stopping by for food. The inside is super cute with lots of surfer decorations, which gives it a nice island, beachy vibe. I went around 2 on a Sunday and it was pretty empty but as I was leaving more people started coming in, so that may be when it gets busy. I just wanted something to munch on so I tried the Belizean conch fritters. There were a decent amount of fritters for the $10 price, but taste wise something was missing. They were very crispy which is how I like them but some on the bottom were a little too chewy and didn't seem to have much conch inside. They fry them mixed with corn and peppers, and it comes with a sauce that gave them enough extra flavor for me to enjoy them. I did see that they have a happy hour from Mon-Fri. I may go back again to try the boils, but may have to pass on the conch fritters next time."
3/4/2018,20180304,4,4.25,"Jerk chicken plate is amazing! That jerk chicken comes out super juicy. Whatever you do, get some Johnny cakes!! Omg I'm reliving the experience now. This place is definitely one of my favorite Harlem go to."
3/8/2018,20180308,3,4.25,"ordered the johnny cakes, broccoli salad, and the crab boil with dirty rice on side Johnny Cakes-amazing authentic and flavorful, covered in butterbroccoli salad very fresh tasty and lighthowever the crab boil was good but the crabs used were small and there was a huge slab of butter that was unmelted at the bottom of the boil bag--wish the sauce had more salt and garlic and WAY less butter"
3/11/2018,20180311,5,4.25,"One of my favorite best kept secrets in West Harlem. A divy, Caribbean-themed row home-turned-seafood shack. Good seafood is surprisingly difficult to find in New York (especially Manhattan) so I was ecstatic to find Lolo's in my neighborhood. The food is a bit pricey but not outrageous knowing how rare this kind of food is in the city. The dishes are always delicious and cooked well, the house punch is made strong, and the outdoor eating area is phenomenal on warm summer evenings."
3/23/2018,20180323,4,4.25,"I've wanted to check out Lolo's for quite some time. Tonight I decided to get a take out order - Salmon + Shrimp with Broccoli and a side of Garlic Fries. Took me some time to get home but once there, I discovered that there were no Shrimp in my order!!! Instead, the salmon was on a bed of rice & beans. Not a Shrimp in sight! I'm sure the rice & beans will be good but it's not what I ordered and the original dish is $23! Very unhappy. But it is delicious. After finally getting through on the phone they've agreed to give me a shrimp basket gratis tomorrow at lunchtime. Thanks, Jos√©, for the quick resolution!"
3/28/2018,20180328,2,4.25,"Smoke wings were soggyNo seafood crackers, it was a bit difficult to crack open the snow crabs. The garlic butter old bay sauce was not good enough...no chopped garlic, not enough spice. The fries were not bad though."
4/3/2018,20180403,4,4.25,"This is a nice little gem for seafood lovers! I came during happy hour so the rum punch was only $5, and it's tasty and gives a nice kick. We sat in the tiny backyard which would be lovely in the summer I can imagine. The coconut shrimp and fries were so good, along with their dipping sauce we didn't think about ketchup. The salmon and shrimp basket was filled with yummy garlic butter, it was devoured within minutes. My main thing would be that the proportion size was on the smaller side considering the price($24), we thought with one app it would satisfy us two ladies- the alcohol helped :) The entire ordering process was slow, maybe they were low on staff. But every one was really nice except for the stressed out lady chef yelling at every employees there. Hence one less star- Overall great experience and would def go back!"
4/6/2018,20180406,5,4.25,"Its definitely a shack. The appearance might scare you away. It actually kept me away for a while but I was at harlem food bar and didn't like the menu selections and the waitress suggested Lolo. My friend and I wanted seafood. The food is amazing. Amazing!!I was surprised and impressed. The happy hour is really good. Not many food choices for happy hour but what's there is winners.My only issue with Lolo is that the Sorrel and rum punch is the same thing Now every west Indian person knows Sorrel and rum punch are 2 totally different beverages. So whoever is mixing those drinks needs an accurate recipe for rum punch because that ""rum punch"" is definitely Sorrel"
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.25,Seafood with an island twist. This place has some of the most Most unique flavors in the city
4/8/2018,20180408,4,4.25,"Wanted some seafood while driving through the Bronx and took a look at yelp. This restaurant popped up as a reasonable commute. It was well worth it. Me my husband and toddler ate a variety of our favorites. We LOVED THE FREE PLANTAINS that came with our Yelp check in! They were fried to perfection buttery with cheese sprinkled on top, my baby loved them. We also had crab cakes , shark and bake with snow crab legs and corn! We loved everything we had."
4/10/2018,20180410,4,4.25,"Visited this establishment back in February for my anniversary. It's been on my radar ever since I saw an article about them in the NYT a few years back. Not hard to find but very easy to miss if you're not paying attention. I didn't realize how small this place was, it is literally a shack but it's cute and cozy at the same time. My husband ordered the salmon and shrimp, I ordered the shark and bake and we had conch fritters for an appetizer. The only word to describe the food is yum- the shark and bake was delicious as were the fritters. My husband isn't big on seafood but did enjoy his salmon and shrimp. My only issue with this place is the set up. We sat in the room right off the bathroom and it was a little too close for comfort. It was also February and it was freezing outside so each time someone opened the door to go to the outside seating area the temperature dropped about 10 degrees. Other than that I loved it, although I'd probably come back during warmer weather."
4/17/2018,20180417,5,4.25,"My friends and I came here with a coupon for some type of seafood feast. The first thing you notice upon arriving is that it definitely lives up to the name! Its interior is artfully designed to look like a shack that you'd find in the Caribbean. The staff is friendly and attentive, and greeted us very warmly.We sat on the back patio and the weather transformed the place into a tropical paradise. They bought plate after plate of delicious seafood until we were bursting at the seams! The shrimp is something I could possibly eat 1000 of. Everything was spectacular and I look forward to returning!"
4/17/2018,20180417,5,4.25,"So crispy and delicious! Went for happy hour (4-6 pm) and food items were each $5! The corn I paid $6 for in order to get 4 pieces of corn compared to the happy hour special of $5 for 2 pieces. Glad I got four pieces of corn because it was super flavorful and the corn was really fresh and sweet. Ribs (2, not pictured) had a nice rub to them, fries with garlic shrimp were super super crispy, and the crab cake slider was good as well. We sat in the booth in the front because it was empty, but we were informed that there was more seating in the back. They had free water with lemon and paper placemats for the table. Chill vibes and nice service - everything got brought out piece by piece but that was fine with us, means it's more fresh!"
4/18/2018,20180418,5,4.25,"Fabulous place. The food is excellent and service is wonderful. They were super patient and accommodating when my large family get-together lasted almost an hour and a half past closing. Can't wait to go again.Also, get the Johnny cake. Does not disappoint."
4/24/2018,20180424,5,4.26,"Loved Lolo's Seafood Shack!They aren't joking when they say it's a ""shack!"" It was everything I look for in a Caribbean food spot. It was very rustic, cozy, and nostalgic.I spend a ton of time in Jamaica visiting family and this felt like somewhere I'd been before in Negril or Kingston. Only difference was that they had stairs. Shacks in Jamaica aren't that expansive, hehe!Anyways, about the best part--the food! I had the Pom Pom shrimp and garlic fries, which came with a 'special sauce.' These were the BEST garlic fries I've ever had. They were well-seasoned but moderate on salt, which was nice. The pom pom shrimp was so delicious! It was lightly battered, but full of flavor! Couldn't explain to you the taste behind the 'pom pom' but just know that you won't regret ordering it! I got a grapefruit flavored German beer on the side and that was also good. Expensive, but it was tasty.My friend had a salmon + shrimp + broccoli basket served with durty rice. I had a scoop of the durty rice and it was great. It's like rice & peas with veggies and chickpeas mixed in. Durty, indeed (in a good way, of course)!Oh! Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a free side of sweet plantains! They are served hot with crumbled cheese on top. Scrumptious!You'll see me again when the weather gets warmer, Lolo's.p.s. Round of applause for this black-owned business!"
4/25/2018,20180425,5,4.26,"OH em GEE! Three words: LOVE THIS PLACE! Love their Caribbean aura and their hole in the wall sitting area in the back! Food is on point! If you walked away, turn back!"
5/1/2018,20180501,5,4.26,I love their food!!! The shark sandwich is to die for. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I brought my friend to try out the food and he fell in love with this place. I'm glad I'm sharing my taste with others ;) great job guys!
5/6/2018,20180506,1,4.25,"Do not eat here..... we ordered the crab dip - Burnt, crab cake - also burnt, smelt - bland, shrimp - barely any. Everything was served on a mountain of greasy fries. When we walked in to the restaurant there was an off putting smell of mold like an old dirty building. We sat in the back ""cabana"" where they had the heat on in 70 degree weather. There were also old food crumbs in every crevice on the table. After sitting down we were told that we had to set the table ourselves and to help ourselves to the tap water from the dirty water cooler that you would see at a construction site or sports game. Someone unplugged the radio to charge their phone and the silence was very awkward. The table next to us was complaining about everything too. All in all terrible experience I do not know how this place is even in business."
5/8/2018,20180508,3,4.25,"Everything was going well. I had the crab cake & fries. Very tasty. I decided to step outside of the box and order the Jerk Ribs. Very bad idea. I was so sick the next day. I was sweating, feeling lightheaded and doubled over from stomach cramps. It wasn't only me. My aunt got sick as well and has the same symptoms. I never wanna feel like that again. I don't know if it was the sauce, if they were severely undercooked or what but, now I know why I don't eat ribs in public. Just beware!"
5/9/2018,20180509,4,4.25,"I enjoyed my visit here. I didnt realize that I didnt even write a review for this place. I first arrived for lunch solo. I made mybnb order and then I went down a lil narrow hallway and made my way to the back. I showed them my yelp check-in and received these delicious plantains. Then I had some hugh shrimp, I found to be ok, because I think they were just to big and seemed to have less of a shrimp flavor. The sweet potatoes that came with was the bomb. I think that was a very creative idea, rather than use white potato all the time. The side of corn that I ordered was also good, the only thing that I was off about was that lil rose bottle of wine, $9.00, Really!! Overall the people were all nice and very pleasant. I had no complaints about the service. I would make another visit."
5/17/2018,20180517,4,4.25,"Have been wanting to try this place for decades and decided to order delivery one rainy night. The food arrived fairly quickly. We got the snow crab legs (didn't get a picture), a crab cake sandwich, ""durty rice"", and belizean conch fritters. The crab cake sandwich is phenomenal. it was so dang good. The crab legs were big and juicy but also very oily. The conch fritters and rice were fine. Will make a point to stop in to restaurant for an actual meal and will update my review then."
5/22/2018,20180522,2,4.24,"Lolo's is a cool spot with decent food. BUT, I absolutely have to comment about the ""Belizean Conch Fritters"" because the whole situation has me quite perplexed. A close read of the menu reveals these ingredients: bacalao, fresh corn, diced peppers. Yup, that's it. What?!!!!! They are cod fish fritters! And that's exactly what they taste like and not very good ones. I'm just so confused. Do they not know the difference between conch and cod? Is the blatant false advertising not clear?! How am I the first person to point this out. If you are going to sell Belizean Conch Fritters, put some Belizean Conch in them. Thanks."
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.25,"Favorite seafood place in the city, super laid back! Love the backyard and the cabana... we can always find a seat, and the cabana in the back is heated in the winter so it's still enjoyable. Food is great and staff is friendly"
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.25,"Great place with great food and attentive staff. Love the outdoor seating, with a Caribbean vibe."
5/28/2018,20180528,3,4.24,"I was really excited about this place based on the reviews and overall rating. However, it was just ""okay."" I might be a harsh critic given that I am from the south and seafood boils were the norm. I ordered a steam pot (shrimp/crab legs) in garlic butter sauce and old bay seasoning. Let's just say at the bottom of my tray was huge scoops of unmelted butter, and all I thought about was high cholesterol (no lie). I also tried the jerk ribs and plantain. Overall, the ribs and seafood lacked flavor. The BBQ sauce for the ribs is really good along with the plantain. The other dipping sauces available (that were told to me) are hot sauce and ghost pepper...mmkay; but every seafood establishment needs tartar and cocktail sauce, right? I just don't think it was worth the ~$70 paid for all items including beverages. I gave the establishment 3 stars because it's really cute (including back patio), workers were nice and attentive, and just maybe other food items are really good."
6/2/2018,20180602,3,4.24,"Fine. I do not believe there is enough conch in the Belizean Conch Fritters. But there is a ton of bacalao, which is cheap. So, in the absence of sufficient conch and the addition of cod (not an ingredient in conch fritters on any island, btw), they are effectively cod fritters. And they're not very good."
6/3/2018,20180603,4,4.24,Cute low key place with a great backyard. The garlic fries are soooooo good and the seafood seems fresh. Sangria is too sweet but that's my only complaint!
6/5/2018,20180605,4,4.24,"I was craving some good seafood on Friday afternoon in NYC and found this place. So glad I did because it was just the cutest get away from the city that's still in the city! The backyard patio was really fun. And it was happy hour in Harlem! It was $5 for a few listed items like the crab cake sandwich and some elotes. I got those alongside a carafe of Rum punch to split amongst me and my two friends. It was totally worth it! They serve the punch to you which includes 4 shots of coconut rum, and then give you your cups of ice which also have 2 shots of rum each. It made for a very nice time. My friend ordered the jerk chicken with rice which I had a taste of. It was sooo juicy and delicious. So if you're not a fan of seafood even the chicken here is good to order. I enjoyed my small plates. My boyfriend got the fried fish and really enjoyed it too. And he's picky so I was surprised!"
6/6/2018,20180606,4,4.24,"I was in Harlem on Monday evening and thought I should get a meal before leaving since I'm never in the area. Lolo's Seafood Shack was right around the corner from where I was, so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the coconut shrimp and fries basket ($10). The coconut shrimp came with about 6 pieces. They were nice and crispy and had the perfect amount of coconut flavor. Fries were delicious. The basket also came with a yellow aioli that was a little sweet but went well with the coconut shrimp and fries. The food took a little longer than expected to come out, but it wasn't a terrible wait or anything. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 3Service | 4OVERALL | 4"
6/7/2018,20180607,5,4.24,"I love this place! It's super cute and makes you feels like you're really on an island somewhere, the food is really good too, the drinks can use some work"
6/7/2018,20180607,5,4.24,"Their Avocado Toast with sweet potato cutlets is to die for! Also, the most unique shack experience I've ever had (but it's not for everyone)."
6/8/2018,20180608,5,4.25,"Great food in a cool atmosphere! Chef Raymond and his wife Skai are great hosts and and staff. Try the conch fritters, and any of the steamer pots!  Great seafood cook to perfection. Cool island feel that our group enjoyed."
6/8/2018,20180608,5,4.25,"Cool place to have lunch and get your hands dirty. The shrimp is delicious and the crab is fresh. They have different ways to cook seafood. I tried 3 different kinds, and they were all delicious. The price is very reasonable as well. The environment is definitely not up-scaled so not a place for formal dinner though ."
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.25,"I really enjoy Lolo's and funny enough I have only had take out there. I think it says something that I am giving it this good a review based solely off of take out. The food is always good, full of flavor, and has decent portions. I also love that they have happy hour food and drinks specials and I am a sucker for a food happy hour special. I took advantage of the happy hour while I waited for my to go order. First it was really nice of them to let me do that. Second. The rum punch is really good for $5. It's basically their homemade sorrel mixed with a coconut rum. Sweet but delicious. Like the food ever time I come here and am looking forward to sitting down and eating here one day soon"
6/14/2018,20180614,3,4.25,"I want to like this place so much. I became obsessed with it when I found out they had soft shell crab sandwiches. The first couple of times I went there and got the crab- it was ok- just ok.... and expensive for what it was. My most recent visit I was disappointed with the crab sandwich. The crab was meh. The bacon was overdone- fried into a ball in the middle of the sandwich. And even the Jonny cake wasn't too good- flimsy, falling apart and not holding any part of the sandwich.The only other thing I've gotten from there was the jerk chicken which was pretty solid, but not exceptional. I like the seating outside in the back- it creates a cool vibe. I will go back and perhaps order something completely different- maybe the ribs or shrimp just to vary it up a bit. But I can't shake my disappointment on the soft shell crab sandwich."
6/15/2018,20180615,5,4.25,OMG! The Crab Cake sandwich is DELICIOUS!And to serve the sandwiches on Homemade Johnny Cakes is INGENIOUS!!!This is sandwich is the perfect analogy of my family background (Caribbean & Washington D.C.) LOL I still can't believe how much actual crab meat is in this little taste of heaven!I cannot wait to return and try the other menu items!
6/15/2018,20180615,5,4.25,"Honestly for a backyard seafood shack this place is amazing! Good food, great vibes- seafood is on point! Peel and eat shrimp and crab legs reasonably priced and delicious sauces! Hit them up- worth it!!!"
6/16/2018,20180616,5,4.25,"Stayed right down the block from here while staying in ny and this is by far my favorite spot to go for some beers and crawfish! Everyone is so friendly, the food is amazing (have been twice so far, plan to be back before I leave), and the workers are attentive no matter how busy or slow the crowd is. My first time I had the spicy crawfish with shrimp pot, and the second time I had the 1 lb crawfish boil. I had one cocktail and it was strong and not disappointing. If you like seafood, you will like lolos!"

However you walk down the hall to the back and you'll find this adorable outside seating. It has a pergola to protect from rain, picnic tables for seating, Caribbean music plans and fans moving the air. The food was very tasty. I order the crab cake basket. There were two fresh authentic crab cakes over fries. They weren't over-seasoned and didn't have too much mayo. We also ordered street corn which was good but not the best I have had. For checking in with Yelp I was given an order of fried plantains. They were delicious! Overall I would recommend this place."

6/26/2018,20180626,1,4.24,"The service was decent considering that it is a ""self-serve"" kind of place. The food was not good, I order shrimp and fries, while my friend ordered wings. The wings were nearly burnt, and my shrimp were very salty. I would not go again."

The plantains were not good , they weren't fully cooked at all and they were a little to oily. I ordered a Blood Orange juice and that was perfect. I will visit or order again !!!"

But they were right on with the pork ribs. This hurts my pride slightly, as a big plant eater I had to turn my ego down a notch and just ride the wave I was riding at Lolo's tonight.Secondly, the corn. It's not necessarily my FAVORITE, but if there had to be a place for quick seasoned corn not on the cob, it would have to be here. It's a perfect whirlwind of crab broth, cayenne pepper, mayo, cilantro, and cotija cheese in your mouth. The corn is steamed with what appears to be the same water as the seafood, so you WILL be experiencing a little field trip in your mouth of under the sea. DON'T SAY that I did not warn you, fellow vegans and strict dietitians!!!!Okay, lastly, my absolute favorite part of this WHOLE hole in the wall of a restaurant? The complimentary chips are delivered to you with a complementary salsa (pun absolutely intended). It's a little bit sweet and a little bit spicy, and a lottle packs a punch in flavor!!!! That, and the array of colorful house made condiments that stood before me at the ""serve yourself your own sauce station"" was a food lover's dream come true.

Jai was SO nice, explaining what everything was to me, I'm a Midwest girl so he helped me figure out that I just fell in love with Jamaican food thank you for the experience! Next time I'm in town I will definitely visit the actual restaurant! 5 STAR service and 5 STAR food!!!"
6/29/2018,20180629,4,4.24,Pretty cool spot. I had the pleasure of having the smoked wings and soft shell crab sandwich. The wings were quite savory. The serving size was about 6 wings. I was slightly disappointed with the soft shell crab sandwich. It left much more to be desired. The portion size was off considering the price of the sandwich. The crab(1) was seasoned well however the rice and beans/peas were bland.

6/30/2018,20180630,1,4.23,"Food was ok, but the service was the worst I've experienced in quite some time. It took us 45 minutes to get one carafe of pre-made rum punch. They forgot about two entr√©es and we had to ask multiple times before we finally got them after an hour and a half. Might just have been our server, but I wouldn't give them a second chance."
7/6/2018,20180706,5,4.23,"This place is as good as it gets. Very reasonably priced seafood and friendly atmosphere. I got crawfish and shrimp with Lolo's special sauce, plantains and johnnycakes. I cleared all of it! The sauce is crazy - strangely addictive and there's not enough stuff to sop it up, so at some point I was just dipping my fingers in it. That good."
7/6/2018,20180706,5,4.24,"Just a great overall experience. Super friendly and authentic food. We had jerk everything, Johnny Cakes and shrimp with a side of rum drinks. An original gem everyone should experience."
7/8/2018,20180708,5,4.24,Great seafood great service feels like I'm on a island highly recommended the bake and shark and spicy crab legs are elite
7/9/2018,20180709,4,4.24,"What a great dive. Great food and always busy when I go. The service makes things a little complicated. With silverware, water, ect. Unless you've been here before it can be a little tricky understanding the flow. But the food and atmosphere is great!"
7/9/2018,20180709,5,4.24,"Yes! Very excited about this place and you will be too if seafood is also your first love. Crab legs. Conch fritters. And so much more. We had those plus the chilled broccoli salad and the jerk chicken platter. Lots of food for two but we ate it all and savored every bite. Casual, counter service, no frills, no fuss. Just damn good food. Will definitely be back."
7/14/2018,20180714,3,4.24,Food was great. Wish they had servers. It was nerve racking to get our order modifications right after the food was dropped off at our table. More of a self service experience and I love the grapefruit beer but totally needs busboys/waiters and support staff that are a little more experienced. Having support staff would help with upselling and higher tip averages. This was my second visit and every time I ordered and sat outside I almost always wanted a second or third beer.
7/17/2018,20180717,3,4.23,"Food is ok, a little overpriced for the quality. But in Harlem, it's hard for find anything equivalent or better. I'd go to the Boil if I can, unless I'm in the neighborhood and desperate for seafood."
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.24,"Great place Lovely lunch today. Ordered the coconut shrimp and was pleased by the quality, as well as the nicely toasted roll, thick slices of ripe avocado that i ordered on the side. A very good experience!Took my parents there and they also loved it"
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.24,Food was great!!!!!!. Nice chilled spot customer service was excellent I really have no complaints it was my first time there and I will definitely go back and recommend it to all my friends
7/20/2018,20180720,3,4.23,"It's hard to rate this place. The food is good, undoubtedly. Except for their fries, their fries are tough, and I'm not a big fan of their pom pom shrimp either.But my biggest gripe is the portion size and price. I feel like every time I eat there I'm hungry within a half hour, which sucks because I just spent a significant amount of money (the bill isn't usually less than $20) for a meal that won't sustain me for longer than an hour or so."
7/23/2018,20180723,5,4.24,"I see food clearly. At LoLo's, quality and price can't be found anywhere else in the city. My third time this week, their wok seared blue crab is heaven on Earth!!! Having spent over 3 years as a food curator, LoLo's Seafood Shack is a pearl of Harlem."
7/25/2018,20180725,4,4.24,"Casual and quaint little spot right next to the downtown B/C train at 116th. Workers were very friendly, the cashier helped me decide as I was super indecisive. Ended up with the crab cake sandwich and some crawfish with garlic butter sauce. The sandwich was yummy, love how it was sandwich between Johnny cakes, because that alone was yummy. They provide gloves for you with your crawfish which I wasn't expecting but was appreciated. The crawfish was good, I think I would have liked it more with a difference sauce, something with more depth & flavor. Not to discredit their garlic butter sauce, I was told it's their most popular, just a personal preference. Otherwise everything was good, their seafood is definitely fresh."
8/1/2018,20180801,5,4.24,Can't beat their $20 option for Snow Crab. It's more than enough for one person and so tasty!Indoor and outdoor seating options and the staff is very nice. One of my favorite little gems in Harlem. Perfect for a date night or night out with friends.
8/3/2018,20180803,5,4.24,"Eating here for the first time and am already so thrilled by how warm and friendly everyone is. Stellar food recommendations, friendly staff and the drinks are AMAZING. Couldn't wait to share this as good that is made with love ALWAYS is excellent. I know I won't be disappointed!"
8/4/2018,20180804,1,4.23,That food was nasty...sweet plantains was nasty took one bite and threw the food out crab cakes trash & the rum punch naw they can keep that too! Definitely wasted $40 dollars
8/5/2018,20180805,4,4.23,I enjoy my late lunch At Lolo's it give me a sense of being back home in the Caribbean having lunch at a local restaurant with a red stripe beer staff was hospitable my couch fritters was a little too burnt my boyfriend and I enjoy everything else was great thank you
8/7/2018,20180807,5,4.23,I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Lolo's. I appreciated the super relaxed atmosphere. How it works: you order your food and drinks in the front and are given a number to place on your table. Once food is ready it will be brought out to you. Ordering at the table is not offered. There is a small indoor seating area and a larger open backyard area. I felt like I was at a restaurant located at a beach town as I enjoyed my shark and bake in the backyard. The sweet plantains with the cheese on top was also amazing along with the rum punch. Do yourself a favor and have some of their homemade habanero sauce. The staff was super friendly and attentive and will make it a point to go again.
8/10/2018,20180810,5,4.23,"The rum punch was amazing! It was refreshing and not too strong on a hot humid day. Moreover, the crab cake sandwich was filled with flavor and delicious. Definitely recommend this place for anyone in the mood for some island flavor!"
8/11/2018,20180811,5,4.24,"Amazing gem! This is no-nonsense, no frills seafood and it is incredible. We fed ourselves and kids and thoroughly enjoyed crab, shrimp and the vibe of this spot. We will definitely come back. Don't forget the rum punch!"
8/12/2018,20180812,4,4.24,"Okay! To be totally fair, I seldom venture south of UES/UWS for food and drinks but I'm perfectly glad I had a taste of Lolo's Seafood on a weekend nightAmbience: Rustic, friendly, casual vibe with none of the frills of some stuffy midtown place. It's very laid back, almost like you're sitting in someone's backyard bbq patio. Noise level is moderateService: What service? Just kidding. But this is primarily, self service after ordering for yourself at the counter in front!Food!! The menu is diverse, salmon/chicken (basic!) to crab, crawfish. What's missing: oysters, clams, lobster. Prices are very moderate, skewing toward the affordable end. I will say however the menu options are more of the fried/crispy variety and less of the crab roll/mayo etc. You're supplied with your very own pair of blue gloves to peel or dive into whatever needs to be operated on!:)Overall, it's a fun spot for a totally casual night out. It's a bit removed from the rest of the city but you have to try this if you're also a total fan of seafood"
8/13/2018,20180813,5,4.24,The food was really good. The service was really fast and the price was great. I had Lolo's peppa shrimp boil and my husband had the Fish Fry basket. The shrimps were a good size and the sauce was amazing. The fried fish came with garlic fries and they were okay too. Overall it was a good time at Lolo's- very flavorful.
8/21/2018,20180821,4,4.24,"Great quick bite in Harlem. Food is a little pricey but it's fun splurging every now and then, especially on food lol. A go to spot for me and my friends during the summery months- nice outside area."
8/22/2018,20180822,2,4.23,The service could've been better. Most of my group was unhappy with their food. I had high hopes for this restaurant and I hope that it changes things around for the better.
8/23/2018,20180823,5,4.23,"Really good tasting food and friendly people. The place it self it's really cool. Had the jerk chicken, the plantains and came for the crab cakes a second time, the food is just delicious!"
8/26/2018,20180826,3,4.23,"I really wanted to like this place - its a very cool setup - you order when you walk in and then they bring you your food... we ordered the broccoli salad and dutty rice - both were fantastic - in fact i want to make the broccoli salad at home.. Unfortunately the boil - we had the snow crab and shrimp - did not taste fresh and was most likely frozen.... Maybe jm being a bit harsh however if your main platter is seafood that should be the best part of the meal... Anyway service was good, they had these really cool plastic shell crackers... and i would still go back to give it another try..."
8/28/2018,20180828,5,4.23,Great food ! I only regret ordering the jerk ribs but everything else on the entire menu is soooo tastyyyyy
9/3/2018,20180903,4,4.23,"Our original plans for Saturday fell through so we decided to check out Lolo's. The staff was very friendly. We had a reservation so they had a table reserved for us. I decided on the Crawfish and Belizean Conch Fritters, I did not like the fritters at all but my cousin thought they were okay. I order the Crabby Dip to replace the fritters which I did enjoy. The Corn on the Cob was just okay, wasn't a fan of the Cojita Cheese, I would not order it again. The other three all ordered the Shrimp and Crab Combo and well you can't really go wrong with that, it was good and they gave more then what was expected. They all had leftovers for a takeaway plate. There was also Garlic Fries that must have been good because there was not one left.I loved the fact that the young lady at the front pleasantly with a smile answered all my questions regarding the food and ingredients as I have food allergies so I'm a picky eater. She gets an A+ for customer service. I would recommend this restaurant."
9/3/2018,20180903,4,4.23,"Came here and got the pom pom shrimp platter, which was incredible, the plantains with the check in (also bomb), and the corn. I wasn't a huge fan of the corn. When I saw it, I thought it'd be full of flavor, but it definitely wasn't. Overall, enjoyed it and would come again."
9/7/2018,20180907,5,4.23,"From it's appearance on the outside, some might not walk into this place. From it's appearance on the inside, I feel as though I have just walked through a portal to Austin, Texas (which is strange enough because it's not a place known for seafood). Now that I'm a fan, I'm kind of glad some might find it's external appearance a barrier, I want to keep this place to myself.Lolo's is the kind of place I would have expected to find Tony Bourdain nursing a hangover. It's is disarmingly genuine, just people who love food pumping it out to people who love to eat. The menu is original, quirky, woke, and the entire vibe eschews easy comparison to other area dining establishments.There's a very charming deliberate lack of pretension in the service, procedures, decor, setting and layout. I love any place where one has to walk through the kitchen to get the seating in the back. I had a career earlier in my life in food service; I like to see who's making my food and what the kitchen looks like. This is probably what invites my comparison to Austin. All my favorite places in Austin are like Lolo's metaphysically.The food is good, really good, and it's clear that's what they really care about. Do yourself a favor. Take someone here when you want to impress as cognoscenti. We aren't going to run into Tony here, sadly, at least not physically, but if he does hang out in Harlem these days, Lolo's is likely one of his spots."
9/7/2018,20180907,4,4.23,Food was delicious! Conch fritters could've had less dough. Seafood platter was well seasoned.
9/13/2018,20180913,5,4.23,went to visit a couple of weeks ago while I was in New York and oh myyyyyyy it was delicious! I'm from Chicago and we loveee flavor! It was really good.. ordered crab and shrimp with their spicy sauce it was so good. I did get a side of their house sauce it had more of a curry taste to it not bad at all but bring on the spice. Overall the backyard vibe is so cute you literally feel like you're on a island chilling.. customer service was admirable too. I'll be back to visit on my next trip for sure!
9/18/2018,20180918,5,4.24,"Favorite place in Harlem...and dare I say in New York City? I've lived in Austin and New Orleans, and this is one of the rare places to capture the laid back vibe I miss about those cities. Delicious food and helpful staff. Also accommodating for gluten free people like me. J'adore, Lolo's!"
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.24,"Highly recommend for a night alone or with someone you know well... things will get messy. In a good way. I go for their boils, because I'm addicted. The best deal is the $19 Peppa Shrimp Boil, which includes a pound of peel-and-eat shrimp, tender corn, and a nice little hunk of sweet potato.LOVE LoLo's Special sauce - it is creamy and buttery and garlicky and savory and a lllllitle spicy. Perfect pairing with the al-dente, sweet shrimp, potato, and corn. The Old Bay and garlic is a wee too tangy for my taste. In-house is simple but really darling; the staff is helpful but not overbearing (because who wants to be bothered while they're elbow-deep in finger-licking sauce!?). This last time I ordered for delivery, after some confusion regarding their online menu with Eat24, I was gifted an order of plantain chips and dip! How sweet. And savory."
9/20/2018,20180920,4,4.24,"This is my spot! The rum punch is BANGIN! I always get the avocado toast and my friends and I share a few other things. The shark and bakes bangs, the shrimp bangs, the crab legs bang. The only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars is because the conch fritters are hit or miss. Last time, they were pretty flavorless and I think someone realized the mistake cuz they gave em a salt bath at the end. Thought my face was gonna pucker up and fall off when I bit it. Ah well, can't when em all, but I fixed it with a long swig of the rum punch. It is the TRUTH!"
9/22/2018,20180922,2,4.23,"I ordered 6 things off of the menu for delivery (uber eats) . Pom Pom shrimp and fries basket - pretty good, shrimp was well-seasoned and a good size (but I believe you only get six) Jerk chicken and rice basket -didn't receive it Plantains - didn't receive itCrabby dip and plantains - dip didn't have much flavor to me, needed some seasoning. Plantain chips were too thick for my liking Johnny cakes - a sweet bread of sorts -nice treat, I liked them Corn on the cob - Nothing too special but not bad either. I checked uber eats after my order was delivered to report my missing items and noticed these items were now marked as 'sold out'. I'm not sure if it was my order that lead them to discover they had run out of some things but it's bad business to not even try to contact me to let me know my order would be incomplete. Or maybe they just forgot to include all my items, either way this obviously wasn't a great experience. Luckily Uber Eats always gives refunds."
10/7/2018,20181007,1,4.23,Do not order delivery ONLY DINE IN. My Order was correct. But my food was mushy. I ordered Johnny cakes but I didn't receive any honey butter. Which is kind of like eating pancakes with no syrup. So I threw those out. I ordered jerk ribs but I threw those out because the dry rub was mushy which is probably because the humidity from the container they were in. I also ordered the shrimp basket which only came with six shrimp and a ton of fries. The french fries were 100% not edible. Because the container they were in was full of humidity so they were soggy fries. No one likes soggy fries. In the end the last thing I had to throw away was the fritters and I threw those away because they were full of oil they were cold and they came with no sauce.
10/11/2018,20181011,1,4.22,"Alright so... the photos look great and the idea of getting nice seafood in harlem sounded good BUT this place is not what it seems. The restaurant looks like it hasn't been cleaned or touched up in a while. Which is disappointing because it was such a nice vibe, good music, pleasant staff. Then there's the food, let's say it did not do it for me. The rice and beans side was soggy, soggy rice? Not ok. The drinks were basically water and juice. The person next to me had a basket of fried shrimp and they bit into breaded plastic... not shrimp. Awkward. Would not go back."
10/13/2018,20181013,4,4.22,"I came here on Saturday afternoon by myself. I chose to eat outside. It was a little breezy due to it be a cold fall. I love the decor. The decor gives me a vibe of being on a island and experiencing local food. I like that you stand and order and can see the chefs and also you pay before sitting. If i had to rate this place only on decor, location and service, I would give it 5 stars. My waiter was Eddy, very attentive. Ask for him.I can only imagine how the back yard gets because it looks like a fun spring and summer spot. I had the shrimp ready to eat for 9.99$ and the wings for 10$. My meal was 21$. The food wasn't bad. I got the Loki sauce and it tasted like butter. I wished it was more seasoned. The chicken was seasoned and I liked the taste. I would come back on another day to try the rum punch.I had to edit my review 5 minutes after I posted it. They have a gender neutral bathroom and mouthwash for customers. It is the simply things that increase ratings and they are officially a 4/5 seafood spot."
10/16/2018,20181016,3,4.22,"Ehhhh okay food. Waiter seemed pretty new so I'll let his confusion for almost everything slide. However the backyard is cute and the food is just basic fried foods, mostly seafood. Just a good easy local spot to grab a bite in a different setting."
10/22/2018,20181022,4,4.22,"I found out about this restaurant through an ad. I love seafood so this restaurant immediately appealed to me. I finally had a chance to try it on a rainy Sunday. I knew from the website that the decor wasn't what you would find in a typical restaurant but I was still a little taken back when I came to the restaurant. I didn't care for the old pieces of furniture. I was the only diner in the restaurant, and it felt kind of creepy. I told the worker to keep the door open. Despite the questionable space/decor, the food was AMAZING. I definitely want to go back. I had shrimp and crab legs, and I enjoyed ever bite. The food was a little on the pricey side, but it is good to treat yourself ever so often. I want to back, but I will take the food to go."
10/23/2018,20181023,5,4.22,We just had a glorious lunch at Lolo's! We grooved to the strains of Bob Marley while oohing and ahhing over the shrimp lightly fried with ghost pepper and the amazing jerk chicken basket washed down with the rum punch. The lady at the next table swapped us a crab leg for a shrimp. This is our new go to place!
10/23/2018,20181023,3,4.22,"Jerk ribs were a miss. Although juicy, the jerk seasoning rub looked like it was tossed on at the end and not marinated. Hoping it was an off day because I enjoyed the rum punch( the sorrel amount was perfect) and my wings were salty, but juicy. Maybe I will just stick to the seafood at this spot."
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.22,Great food! That's why you come here! Love the small shack feel to the place. I got the shrimp boil which was excellent. Their signature sauce is great and their service was fast.Would recommend Lolo's as a fun restaurant to get your hands dirty and experience your food.
10/27/2018,20181027,5,4.22,"The place is really small in the front but opens up once you go at the back. It feels like a community when you go sit at the back. The ambience is def laidback and relaxed. I ordered the crawfish, shrimp combo with special sauce. It was really good. We also ordered rum punch which was on the stronger side but good to go with our food. Would def recommend to get the combo. The prices are slightly expensive but then it's seafood so it is expected."
11/4/2018,20181104,4,4.22,"Walking through Harlem to find a fun fast and easy spot to have happy hour. All I wanted was Wifi , cheap beer, and good low priced good food. Lolo's had two out of three. No wifi - but I could let go of that because of the cute decor, great food and 5 dollar beers. The place was nestled into the corner and had a great ambience. I knew immediately walking in that the seafood would be seasoned to perfection. I could smell it, and I wasn't wrong. The 5 dollar shrimp and chips came with 3 pieces of shrimp, and a lot of fries. Their was some type of specialty sauce they created that went nicely top of both. I wasn't looking for much food. So this was perfect. Leaving I felt just full enough with a nice little buzz to handle the New York grind. Ill be going back to try the regular menu now. The crab I'm sure is pretty good."
11/22/2018,20181122,3,4.22,"Came here with a friend for dinner - it's a really fun restaurant that is quick and easy for dinner, but overall, I probably wouldn't go here again because it's not a convenient neighborhood for me and the food wasn't good enough for me to come back.There's a lot of seating in the back and in the front (think very casual, hole in the wall decor) but you order in the front by the counter and they bring you your food. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get free plantains covered in cheese! My friend and I split the pom pom shrimp + garlic fries basket (probably the best dish we had), jerk chicken and durty rice basket, and a pound of snow crab legs with their special sauce. I loved the pom pom shrimp and the garlic fries - they are definitely the best thing to get at this restaurant, which other Yelp reviews have also mentioend! The jerk chicken was fine - no complaints, but nothing to rave about. And the crab legs were very soft and tender, but the sauce didn't really add any flavor.Really great place to catch up with friends in a casual environment and decent food that will definitely fill you up, but not a place I'd recommend unless you're in the neighborhood and want some good pom pom shrimp and garlic fries."
12/2/2018,20181202,1,4.21,"I ordered hot wings for delivery. They were awful. Literally the worst I've had in memory. The wings were fatty and undercooked, soggy, unseasoned and barely had any sauce on them. In fact the underside of most of them were completely naked. Never again. Awful just awful."
12/4/2018,20181204,2,4.21,"Even though Lolo's fed me totally raw coconut deep fried shrimp twice in a row (the second time directly after I returned the first one for being raw), I'm giving them two stars instead of one because a) I didn't get sick, b) the dish was actually very tasty, especially the fries underneath, and c) they gave me my money back along with a free order of plantains. I wished I had felt safe to finish it! I mean, sushi-wise, raw shrimp is a thing, and it's delicious. I just assume Lolo's shrimp wasn't held to the same standard of food safety.Really, apart from serving raw shrimp, they did everything else right."
12/8/2018,20181208,5,4.21,"The food here is really amazing and reasonably priced. We ordered the sweet plantains, jerk ribs, crabby dip with plantain chips and the coconut shrimp. The Rum Punch is made with Coconut Rum, Sorrel and ginger, it is delicious! They play music and have seating in the back, somewhat of a small space. Behind the seating area, the lady informed us, is a backyard area that's open when it's not too cold out. The decor almost makes you feel like you're not in New York. Definitely will be going back"
12/9/2018,20181209,4,4.21,"Great Caribbean style seafood in Harlem! They have a small amount of seating in the back - I think they have more outdoor seating. It was a bit cold inside. I got the boiled shrimp with corn and potatoes. It was very good - large, fresh tasting shrimp with the special sauce - a mix of the ginger, garlic, and spicy sauces. Also got conch fritters - they were a bit breadier than I expected them to be. And we got the shark sandwich - fried fish, spicy green sauce and slaw on a tasty and crispy bun. We got free maduros for checking in - excellent! Would definitely like to come back here! They had a good selection of sauces/hot sauces in the back."
12/19/2018,20181219,5,4.21,"Ugh love this place. So old school, so good, amazing fish, great portions sizes, feels like I couldn't belong in Manhattan but thank god it does"
12/23/2018,20181223,5,4.21,Delicious food + drinks and excellent service. Jerk chicken and rum punch are wonderful. Lolo's is always a special treat! I'm so happy you are in the neighborhood.
1/2/2019,20190102,5,4.21,"Came here to eat from Raleigh, NC ! Loved the pom pom shrimp! And the garlic fries were so good! The shrimp were lightly breaded and the sauce was slightly sweet and salty, but not overwhelming! I forgot to take a picture but I recommend the place as the staff were also very pleasant!"
1/5/2019,20190105,1,4.21,Used to be a great place. Recently went with my girlfriend and both of us felt sick about two hours afterwards. :(
1/22/2019,20190122,3,4.21,"Food is delicious ! The crabby dip wasn't what I expected but everything else was good. It was really too cold in the back to really enjoy my meal with just a space heater to warm the entire space up. You must pay in the front once you place your order and find a seat in one of the 5 tables in the back. A guest actually opened the patio door thinking there was additional seating in the open patio this time of year, so that welcomed a frigid breeze. Perhaps keep it locked in the winter."
1/24/2019,20190124,5,4.21,I came here for lunch with my best friend for her birthday. They did NOT disappoint! The appearance will throw you off because it's so small that it kind of looks like a fast food place. But there's more seating in the back and outside although it was too cold at the time to be outside (November). The food and drinks are PRICEY (but what isn't in Harlem these days?) but the food is COMPLETELY worth it! We ordered the jerk ribs and the salmon. BEST FOOD EVER! Definitely plan to return. Delish!
1/27/2019,20190127,5,4.21,Ordered the fish and garlic fries. Just perfect: the fish was fresh and the fries were crispy. And I would order from there again. Good price and great staff
2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.21,Super friendly staff and great food! Had the coconut shrimp along with the plantains that came with the Yelp promo. Very delicious - the plantains were definitely some of the best plantains that I have had. They had a multitude of sauces as well which was an added plus!
2/4/2019,20190204,5,4.21,Lolo's Seafood Shack feels like taking a short vacation to Jamaica. Nuff said! Good stuff.
2/6/2019,20190206,4,4.21,"I have ranked here my Harlem must go list since I started exploring Harlem. And finally could come here for Saturday brunchLots of my friends Harlem neighbor recommended and 2 more girls joined me. All of us ( 3 girls) order fish , shrimp and garlic fries combo as today's special. ( check my photos) $17Actually, fish fries were bit salty for me but I took some of them to go home and ate with beer.. Yeah, it s totally matching with drinks Shrimp was big and meaty that I was expecting !I was wondering why we order same dish individually , I thought we must order more variety and share ... since I wanna try more dish there.*The portion was enough, so I recommend you to order various dish to share.Interior was sooo cute, I was expecting back yard, but bit cold and no one outside.But I found post that backyard has Heater afterward !!!I am sure I will get outside table and try sandwich !"
2/14/2019,20190214,3,4.21,"I was really excited to try this place mostly because of the chill vibe and the fact that they incorporated Caribbean flavor and style within the decor and the food. I went with a friend and we ordered the Pom Pom shrimp, rum punch and the steam pot with crab and shrimp with their special sauce and pepper sauce added. The food was ok the sauce did not have enough spicy flavor to it so I ask for a little on the side and that made it a little better even though it had a burnt taste to it. The Pom Pom shrimp were pretty good they did not over coat them with batter and it was fresh. I enjoyed the rum punch, but it need a little more kick to it. I would probably revisit this place in the summer, because the back was a little cold, but I would go back."
2/14/2019,20190214,5,4.21,"My fianc√© and I decided to try this place for dinner on Valentine's Day, let me tell you... the food was excellent, service was sweet, this is a hidden gem that we WILL BE COMING BACK TO! As we left we even were given roses from the staff.... they made our night special! Only downer... they need to cut up the HEAT!! It was cold in there! Other than that, SUPERB!"
2/17/2019,20190217,4,4.21,"Really enjoyed my lunch at Lolo's Seafood Shack. The table in front of the window at the entrance is a great spot if with a group. Staff was friendly, easy to order, food was fast, fresh, and delicious. I'm excited to come back and check out the back area. Fish Fry Basket 4/5 (Crispy white fish, garlic fries, Lolo's r√©moulade)Pretty great fish! Fries are great but heavy. I wish the basket came with more of Lolo's r√©moulade!"
3/1/2019,20190301,5,4.21,"The food is delicious! This tiny place with charm and limited seating serves amazing seafood. The shrimp are tasty and fresh! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the broccoli was delicious. The jerk ribs were meaty and good, they could have been more spicy for me, but the person I was with said they were just fine. To top off a delicious meal the person serving was super friendly and surprisingly attentive. Don't forget to tip her though since you pay before you sit down. This is going to be a must visit place when I am craving yummy seafood."
3/1/2019,20190301,5,4.21,The entire meal was amazing. From the delicious savory snd subtly sweet corn covered with cheese to the crispy cod fritters. The salmon was broiled to perfection and topped with the garlicky verde sauce. The rice and peas were fluffy and light. Zuleika and the team were friendly and made sure we were taken care of!
3/3/2019,20190303,5,4.21,"I can't rave enough about this place! I was randomly in Harlem and looked for food nearby and this came up with great reviews. Atmosphere and vibe is 5 stars! Food 5 stars! I had the Coconut shrimp and fries, friend had Shrimp Boil. There little sauce was delicious.. had alcohol and 80s d&b playing the whole time. Definitely a vibe :)MUST go!"
3/15/2019,20190315,3,4.21,The Lolo's punch was weak and had no kick to it AT ALL. I could make better sorrel punch at home. We sat in the backyard and we were eating in the dark for a while before we had to ask them to turn on the lights or at least light a candle. There was a couple outside waiting for their food who left and went inside because it was too ldark . We would have also but we already had our food. No music at all in the backyard although the waitress said they would turn it on. I had to ask for a fork and it took them too long to bring one. Crab cakes her yucky. My waitress and waiter were having loud personal conversations where they were dropping the f- bomb numerous times. Yes they were young but teach them etiquette at work. The wings were good and the garlic fries were ok but not good enough to for me to want to come again. I'll pass!
3/16/2019,20190316,4,4.21,"Nice little seafood spot. I had the jerk ribs, sweet potato fries and sorrell. It was ok. My friends had the seafood boil which looked on point. I'll have that next time. Overall nice spot, friendly staff."
3/21/2019,20190321,1,4.21,After a long 12 hour shift i was looking for a good meal and drink. My food was cold and my drink was weak. i had to go to Tavern for a meal and drink. A waste of $100. Should of stuck with what I knew. Can't try new things when you really looking for something in particular.
3/23/2019,20190323,3,4.2,"Nice little spot and seems like it's a great place to hand out and relax when the weather is nice. Loved the corn on the cob and the plantain. The two shrimp dishes were pretty basic not as flavorful or seasoned it tasted as if they just smothered both dishes in whatever sauce you choose, I would visit again but try another dish."
3/25/2019,20190325,4,4.2,I had the one pound snow crab legs and they were great although I could have eaten way more than that for $20 and also I'm having shrimp coconut with fries. The shrimp tasted a bit under cooked but very tasty. The bottle of Sprite is $5! Insane! But awesome food! Try it!
3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.21,"Came by here on a random Sunday evening and had the best time ever! Jordan was our server and did a spectacular job, being super talkative and entertaining and attentive. He was super good with our 3 year old too! We had the jerk chicken with dirty rice, the jerk wings the shrimp with the garlic fries, everything was super fresh and delish!!"
3/31/2019,20190331,5,4.21,"Love Lolo's! I've had delivery and eaten in the restaurant countless times, and the food is always hot and delicious. The soft shell crab sandwich is my go-to, but the salmon with shrimp and broccoli is also good. The staff is also friendly and more than willing to suggest dishes if you don't know what to order. Lolo's is a great little gem in Harlem, so stop thinking about it and just go!"
4/1/2019,20190401,5,4.21,"I've ordered delivery from Lolo's before and have always walked away pleased but visiting this little carribean gem in person was a great experience. Very cozy, fun spot with delicious food and really good music. Walked in with my family and had almost everything off the menu. Everyone was sharing portions of each others plate from how good everything was. Jordan was the man of the hour for us. He turned a simple dine in experience into a jam that left us wanting to come back for more. I recommend the pom pom shrimp, jerk chicken baskets, and dont sleep on the side of wings!"
4/4/2019,20190404,5,4.21,Great vibe. Great food. Great happy hour. Head out back and enjoy your evening. The staff is friendly and warm. The crab cake slider is mostly all crab and delicious. Make sure to try the corn too! Lolo's is consistently on point and I feel lucky to have it so close to home.
4/7/2019,20190407,5,4.21,"Gave this restaurant 5 starts because Omg !!! idk where to start ! I had a delivery made by Zuleyka she was really nice and brought my food to my door! Excellent service food was outstanding and so mouthwatering! I will definitely order again. I had the Salmon with duty rice & a curry sauce on the side. It was so juicy that it made me so joyous. Food that brings Joy to your taste buds. I would say this place is number 1 top notch for me. The taste, the smell and the texture of the food was astonishing. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for great comfort food and take your date to impress. Kudos to the chef excellent Job."
4/21/2019,20190421,4,4.21,"It's been over a year since visiting, but I felt this place warranted a review (I can't believe I forgot!). This is a nice rustic, picnic-like seafood joint in Harlem.You order at the front in what almost looks like a hole-in-the-wall take-away counter, but end up dining in the back. Follow down multi-colored, painted wooden stairs to almost a backyard patio. Cozy outdoor seating is really charming and unexpected given the location.All the food was flavorful, spicy, saucy. Very fried, not exactly good for you. But delicious.It's a bit sloppy, a bit of a mess, thin napkins barely doing the job, paper ""french fry style"" plates barely holding the food, patrons hunching over on wooden picnic tables, desperately trying to not make a mess. But that's half the fun. And help yourself to plenty of the fun, spicy sauces."
4/21/2019,20190421,5,4.21,"The only reason that this place isn't as great as it could be is because of the search/maze that it took to found it. Once our group found the place, it was amazing. We ordered the Roasted Cauliflower, Shark Sandwich, and the Crab Sandwich. The cauliflower was alright from my standpoint, but for the vegetarian of the group, it was a hit. The Shark Sandwich (not actually Shark meat) was great, as everything tasted really fresh. We used the mango chutney that came with the plantain chips you receive before the meal. Which made the sandwich even better. We didn't think that could be topped then we tried the Crab Sandwich, and it felt as though I had just grabbed a crab then cooked it. It was that fresh."
4/24/2019,20190424,5,4.21,Lolo's is my little spot to go! Soft shell crab sandwich is everything!Very comfy friendly neighborly shack :)
4/26/2019,20190426,5,4.21,"Absolutely in love with Lolo's! This place is a gem, can't beat it. My favorite is their Soft Shell Crab Sandwich that's available year round!!!! The only other time I've had one other than here is the Jersey Shore in August. Lolo's is a great place to bring a group of friends, drink some specialty beers and enjoy some very tasty unique seafood dishes. The owner and staff are lovely. Wish they were closer to me and I'd be there 3 or 4 times a week!"
4/27/2019,20190427,3,4.21,"Lolo's seafood shack is that type of hole in the wall restaurant that you expect to serve quality food at affordable prices. I came here with a group of 3 friends after a Yelp Elite event on a Thursday, at ~830pm. Restaurant wasn't too packed so we sat at the front of the house. I ordered the pom pom shrimp, while my friends ordered the Jerk chicken and the fish fry basket.For my entree - I definitely loved how the shrimp was fried, and had a good amount of Jamaican seasoning on it. The pink tartar sauce that came with it definitely complimented the shrimp. The bed of garlic fries were delicious - crispy on outside, and moist and fluffy in the inside.My biggest complaint though is I feel like the portion size for the shrimp was rather small. I think I only got ~6-7 shrimps, which is disappointingly little. There were a TON of fries in comparison, and it definitely would have made the meal more worth it for the price that I paid if they gave us more shrimp. As for the other dishes - my friends had mixed feelings with the items that they ordered. The jerk chicken was delicious and the bed of rice it sat on was buttery and was fantastic. The fish fry basket was a little more disappointing, as the fish tasted a little over cooked and dried. Overall, maybe we didn't order the best items off their menu. Would be down to give it another shot, but for now I think I have been to better seafood shacks in NYC."
4/27/2019,20190427,3,4.21,The best thing I had was the plantains. The signature sauce for the shrimp combo was too strong on the curry. I wanted it to be spicier. Portions are kind of small and I wonder if I actually got 1lb worth of shrimp. However the place is cute and it was great sitting outside. Ingredients are fresh.

The fried fish was just okay, as were the plantains (the plantains were free with check in so I guess I can't really complain). The portions were incredibly small; the coconut shrimp and fish special was $20 for 4 coconut shrimp and one piece of fish. I was expecting 6 shrimp and 2 pieces of fish, especially since the entree was nearly the price of two separate entrees, where I'm assuming I'd get more than 4 shrimp and one fish. Service was kind of slow; don't come too hungry."

5/4/2019,20190504,2,4.2,"I was really excited to come by and try the food . They have a really good happy hour special daily from 4-6 pm , we had the rum punch which was soooo good. We also had the conch fritters and the coconut shrimp basket. Food and sauces were great. My only complaint is the cleanliness and setting of the restaurant. I know they are going for that old shack look but it literally looked like someone got a bunch of old junk and threw it in a corner . The table next to us had not been cleaned , I had to ask a waitress who was serving us to please wipe it down ( 20 mins after we arrived) i probably won't be returning because eating out is not just the food but also the experience and I didn't feel comfortable in a establishment that doesn't pride themselves in running a clean business."

5/5/2019,20190505,4,4.2,"I fell in love with this place months ago and wanted to come back and luckily was able to last week. It still has a special place in my heart but as everything in the heart there is disappointment. The service is quite slow and they bring things out as ready so if they forget a sauce or side, it takes a good 10 min to come and you are almost done with most of the meal. I do like how friendly the staff is but speed it up a bit. The place is really small even with the backyard seating so a group of 6 students didn't seem to happy but pushed some tables together as they cleared. I was glad to come right before 6pm to enjoy the $5 shrimp dish on the happy hour menu. I liked the sorrel drink I had as well but I may stick to coconut soda. It brings back such good memories and I just love coconut. I can't wait to go back again."

5/11/2019,20190511,2,4.19,Most definitely not what I expected. First and foremost as soon as you walk into the place you have to place your order before being seated. Or you can sit view the menu and come back to the front and place your order but they will bring you your food. The place is tiny. I made my way toward the back of the establishment outside where there was a shed. There were about 4 separate tables in the shed and about 3 tables outside of the shed. When I ordered I didn't even realize until after I got my food that the guy didn't take the correct order. My friend and I waiting FOREVER for our appetizers. They brought out our meal about 20 minutes before the appetizers and then my friend was given her crabby dip it was burnt which they replaced for a new one that was better. The pineapple chutney sauce was literally just okay. And they only gave me 1 tiny sauce for many plantain chips I had to ask for more. The crab legs with the Lolo's sauce was mediocre. & the Lolo's lunch was okay. I wouldn't come back.
5/11/2019,20190511,5,4.19,It was super tiny but the food was really good. I got the fish and chips which came out to $21 which is pricey but what was still good. Also it's not for little kids.

5/18/2019,20190518,4,4.19,"Super funky place that will suddenly and instantly bring you to a Caribbean island. The layout is beyond cool... nothing you've experienced in New York City. They have several (small) sitting areas, but the best is the outside ""beach"" patio... you have to see it to yourself to understand the super-chill vibe. The moment I got there I soo much wanted the food to be good, so that I would have a reason to go back. What we ordered was a hit and miss, but some dishes were good enough to return and try more options (3.75 stars for food; 4.5 stars for ambiance).Lobster roll (a special $19): it's served on their ""bread"" with looks and tastes like a combination between a ciabatta and an arepa... yummy. The lobster could have been more, and they could have soaked it in sauce more... probably not worth the $19. Smelt fish + chips basket: the fish was ok, but ladies and gentlemen: the fries were absolutely perfect. I'm not a fries person, but I fished them all and asked for more. Very good. Pom Pom shrimp + garlic fries basket: highly recommended by our waitress, and rightfully so. The shrimp was very good (and the fries... well... you just read my comment). You get a free order of plantains with Yelp, which I recommend getting, because they're tasty. Also, you get $40 for $50 on Yelp, which doesn't hurt. $5 beer happy hour 4-6p daily. Overall, I can't wait to go back and try other dishes, hoping to find at least a couple more worth going. We were lucky to enjoy the place when it was almost empty (5:30p on a Thursday), but I guess if you show up later and on weekends it must be packed. Reservations accepted."

The lobster could have been more, and they could have soaked it in sauce more... probably not worth the $19. Smelt fish + chips basket: the fish was ok, but ladies and gentlemen: the fries were absolutely perfect. I'm not a fries person, but I fished them all and asked for more. Very good. Pom Pom shrimp + garlic fries basket: highly recommended by our waitress, and rightfully so. The shrimp was very good (and the fries... well... you just read my comment). You get a free order of plantains with Yelp, which I recommend getting, because they're tasty. Also, you get $40 for $50 on Yelp, which doesn't hurt. $5 beer happy hour 4-6p daily. Overall, I can't wait to go back and try other dishes, hoping to find at least a couple more worth going. We were lucky to enjoy the place when it was almost empty (5:30p on a Thursday), but I guess if you show up later and on weekends it must be packed. Reservations accepted."

The space is so cute and a little escape in Harlem. The food is very good. I tried their wings but it wasnt my favorite that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. The fries, corn, jerk was good. A little over priced as well."

5/22/2019,20190522,3,4.19,"This place has the cutest backdoor outside seating area! It literally feels like you're on an island somewhere that is not manhattan. They have great specials during the day for food and drinks. Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of the food or drinks. I got the crab cake sandwich, which was just ok. The shrimp and fries were greasier than I expected and the rum was too sweet to drink. But given the ambience, I would be tempted to come back again to try the other things on the menu."

5/22/2019,20190522,4,4.19,"Let me start by saying I've had many seafood boils in NY and CT, I go at least once a week. However, I've only had Asian style boils so I was super excited to find a restaurant that offers it but Caribbean style. When I saw they have coco curry sauce, I couldn't wait to try!! Walked in, very small place. Most tables inside are wobbly and the chairs are ones used in schools. I didn't go outside but I saw they have an outdoor patio so a bit more space outside I think. I didn't expect to order once we walked in as opposed to sitting and having a server but that was fine. I ordered the crab legs and shrimp steampot with coco curry sauce and my friend order the soft shell crab sandwich. I thought the sandwich was small however my friend said it was good. He also ordered a rum punch and mentioned it was more punch than rum. The crab legs and shrimp I got was delicious! The sauce was very watery, would've liked it to be a little thicker and I knew it wasn't going to be spicy obviously since it's coconut curry but next time I would add their hot sauce to it. I was excited to see sweet potatoes added to it since I've only ever had regular potatoes in my seafood boils. The sweet potatoes in there was good but could've been cooked more. Overall I enjoyed and will be coming back to try more. Thank you!"
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.19,"This is about as good as it gets when it comes to seafood in NYC. The decor is a rough approximation of a beach shack, but you're really here for the fish and lobster/crab."
5/30/2019,20190530,3,4.19,"I was super excited to check out Lolo's after seeing rave reviews and the line was packed to order food by the time I got there. Looking through their menu I felt like I was definitely back on the islands after seeing promises of conch fritters, Johnny Cakes and Carib beer to boot! Sadly their alcohol selection was lacking and no Carib was to be found, but my mom and I went with local brews and ordered some food. It was near close and the wait for food was definitely longer than anticipated, but the laid back back patio was relaxing to kick back, chill and talk while waiting.The food then started to come out slowly. I got the cauliflower and sweet potato sandwich which was sadly disappointing and lacked flavor. The sauce they had on it was delicious, but barely any was on there and the Johnny cakes were half-cold and falling apart. My mom got the crab cakes which were also lacking for the price you pay. Two tiny cakes on a bed of fries was a little surprising. The fries were good, but mostly had become mushy from the cakes. Major sad face. I will say the Lolo sauces they have are incredible, but the food experience overall was ""meh"" to me. The staff was incredible friendly and the space itself is fun to chill out in.I would give Lolo's a try and get something different next time, but not sure I'll realistically be back"
5/30/2019,20190530,3,4.19,"I'm a huge fan of small family owned businesses and I really want them to succeed, so if feel I should give honest feedback that can help them improve.The place is cute and the staff is very friendly. The food on the other hand is hit or miss, and unfortunately I've had more misses than hits the last couple of times I ordered. In fact it had been a couple of years since I last ate at/ordered from Lolo's. Then I went with some friends after church on Easter Sunday and every single thing we ordered was delicious!!! Which prompted me to add Lolo's back to my list of favorites. Then last night I ordered the Jerk chicken and received this burnt master piece. See picture. Accidents happen in the kitchen, I understand. But who in their right mind sends something like this out for delivery ?!? And not only was is burnt, the rice had too much water, the chicken was clearly not fresh and tasted as if it had been kept in slow cook mode all day (or longer?) and was super stringy. The Johnny cake didn't have honey as usual mostly butter, maybe they had run out of honey? It was 8:30/9PM so I understand that it's end of day, but still...So my feedback to the owner is, its best to mark items as sold out than to serve sub par meals. I might give Lolo's one last try this summer and decide based on that experience whether to keep it on my list of favorites or not. PS: The manager had sent me another order of Jerk chicken to replace the burnt one and that too was stringy and old tasting."

6/5/2019,20190605,4,4.19,After walking past this place for 9+ months I finally stopped in for happy hour and I am so glad I did because come this fall this is going to be our new hangout spot. Amazing little store with a small indoor seating section and a covered patio (perfect for game night). Ordered from their happy hour menu - mini crabcake slider and their small shrimp entree with some punch. Pro-tip order up front they give ya a number and deliver it to you in the back. Excellent service - seriously went above and beyond even when the kitchen did forget my slider - boxed it up no problem. Shrimp happy hour was a good deal $5 for a small tray of fries and 3-4 large shrimp. I was however not impressed with the punch or the slider. The bread to crabcake ratio was completely off - ended up just eating the two bites of crab. Skip the crab cake slider and try something else off the happy hour menu. Also skip the punch - tasted kind of like prepackaged sangria - skip it and get a beer which was more than reasonably priced.
6/6/2019,20190606,4,4.19,"(8/8)I forgot to check in so I didn't get to try their plantains, but check in for a free appetizer!They have a back area that's great when the weather is nice and plenty of seating indoors. The have a beach shack vibe with bright colors.It feels a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but once you're able to get over that feeling of being ripped off a little, it's a great spot. I'd recommend their soft shell crab sandwich and garlic fries.I'd ask them to be a little bit more generous with the sauce for the fries cause by the end of the meal, it was just regular fries without the garlic added.I also had their grilled cauliflower which was good with a good amount of char. I'd say go for it if you want to round out your order of fried food."
6/12/2019,20190612,2,4.18,It took them 46 minutes to bring me the wrong ($12 appetizers sized) sandwich. literally 4-5 tasty enough bites but so unsatisfying I cant even.... I'm still starving so going somewhere else now. Never again. I go to restaurants to experience new things that I don't/can't cook at home and this was absolutely nothing special though tasty.
6/16/2019,20190616,4,4.18,"My boyfriend was in the mood for crab legs and I never turn down seafood so we stumbled upon this gem while searching for a spot in the area. The pictures and reviews convinced us to try it. The setup gives you an island vibe which assured me the food would be good. It's on the smaller side space wise but had an area out back for dine in. We opted to stay inside because the outside area was a little crowded. It's great for small groups of 3 or 4 people at a time. Now for the food, we checked in for the free plantains and they were so yummy I would have paid double for them. I tried the Pom Pom shrimp and garlic fries...they were amazing. I wish the fries came separate because only the ones on the top had the seasoning/sauce but were great nonetheless. My boyfriend had the salmon basket. So tasty, flavorful and broiled to perfection. We shared the steam pot of shrimp and crab legs. It also included corn on the cob and sweet potato. We had it with the garlic butter and old bag seasoning. They were generous with the shrimp. The crab legs were pretty good as well. I would suggest adding more corn as our bag had one skimpy end piece of corn. We weren't able to share. So I ended up ordering another bag of crab legs. The rum punch tasted more like a ginger sorrel than rum punch. I tasted no alcohol whatsoever. Overall, we enjoyed everything."
6/16/2019,20190616,3,4.18,I'm shocked. I waited forty (40) minutes for my food. The restaurant was basically empty when I arrived.
6/21/2019,20190621,2,4.18,"My colleague and I came here to have some tasty boiled seafood. Boy did we get a surprise. The garlic fries and the sweet plantains (check-in to receive free offer) were good. However the seafood items were NOT. We ordered one entree of the steampot combo section - peppa shrimp boil which has a 1 lb of peeled + eat spiced shrimp + corn + sweet potatoes + choice of signature sauce. Another entree was from the seafood boil section - 1 lb of snow crab legs with Lolos special sauce. Let's just say that the sauce wasn't anything to rave about. It might as well have been called curry all the way. They said the sauce is supposed to be a mixture of all the sauces in one. I didn't taste anything, but the curry. They need some taste testers and to go check out the other competitors in the city. I won't be going back."
6/21/2019,20190621,2,4.18,Ordered the shrimp basket with fries. Shrimp was good but the French fries were cold as ice. Not sure if I will go again because it is definitely as the name implies a shack with little to no space to eat.
6/26/2019,20190626,2,4.17,"My first impression of this place was confusion. I went to meet my girls for a birthday brunch I thought I was in the wrong place. They greeted me when I got in informed me that we have to place our orders up front and wait for the food. It's a very colorful place . We order there signature punch which was just sorrel (hibiscus tea) they bring the pitcher over with a cup they had a shot of coconut rum the pitcher it's self had no alcohol. I order the ""shark"" burger when my food came it was just a piece of fried fish I asked the waiter about it and they said that quotation marked around shark meant it wasn't really shark that should of be told to me ass I made my order. Because it's a order then eat system I had to keep walking up n down the stairs my other friends didn't enjoy there food much either . They had the jerk chicken , soft shell crab sandwich and the fish sandwich food was bland don't think I'll go back to Harlem for this . The staff was nice"
6/29/2019,20190629,4,4.17,Finally made it to Lolo's- love the island ambience. Coconut shrimp and garlic fries were so tasty and soft shell crab sandwich is scrumptious . Looks very small from outside but has sitting space in back . Lolo's rum punch is a must. Will definitely be back for more!
7/2/2019,20190702,3,4.17,"In a great location right across the street from the B train! Food was okay. Definitely over hyped. I was disappointed. Will definitely say the ""rum punch"" which tasted more like sorrel is pretty good. I had the ""Pom Pom"" shrimp and garlic fries and the fries were soggy...shrimp wasn't anything spectacular. Best thing was the rum punch...gave me a little buzz Now I can say I checked it off my list, but unfortunately don't think I'll be back again"
7/5/2019,20190705,4,4.17,"I've lived in the neighborhood for a few years and finally made it around to visiting Lolo's for dinner. You order at the counter and then head back into the backyard to eat. I initially thought the prices seemed high, but the portions are huge! I had the jerk chicken basket and it was enough food for two meals at least. Flavor was amazing, served with a Johnny cake and dirty rice. The chicken is served on the bone which make it a little challenging to eat inside the tray it's served it, but overall I really liked it. My roommate and I shared the crabby dip which was exactly what I wanted it to be - savory, cheesy goodness! She had the Pom Pom Shrimp basket which was good, although she wished there was a side option other than fries since it was a lot of fried things. The staff was helpful, bringing the food out and providing me with a box when I wanted to take away my leftovers. It's not luxurious in the backyard, but perfect for a casual meal with a friend or two. Will be back!"
7/5/2019,20190705,5,4.17,"Today was my first visit. I ordered pom pom shrimp, coconut shrimp, crab dip... everything tasted fresh and delicious. The back patio was great and the staff super friendly. Can't wait to go back!"
7/6/2019,20190706,3,4.17,"I've had the fritters before , wanted to try the crabby dip...a little sad when I got home and my remoulade sauce wasn't in the bag"
7/6/2019,20190706,4,4.17,Food was really good. Had the Pom Pom shrimp which I would recommend. Small indoor space but they have outdoor space as well.
7/10/2019,20190710,4,4.17,The food was pretty good. The seafood tasted fresh. Everything was cooked properly. The people working there were nice. I wasn't loving any of the sauces they had though. Also everything seemed like it needed salt.
7/14/2019,20190714,3,4.17,"I will not be returning.I am a Trinidadian and a huge seafood buff. I've been so so excited to come here and my first time was a complete let down.Firstly, I paid 191.00 for five people.We got steampots and one crab boil.We had a reservation for 7:45. Didn't eat until 8:42pm.The atmosphere was not what I was expecting. This is a no frills type of place. I kind of get where the aesthetic was TRYING to go. Instead this place just was underwhelming. The ""backyard area"" was just bleh. I was expecting a Caribbean beats vibe outside. Instead we just got what appeared to be junk in the space, (kind of reminded me of my grandmas shed, and she is a hoarder) messy, pop music from a terrible half broken speaker. From the looks of the pictures from months ago there was some sort of downgrade. I would've loved to go when the backyard looked like that. The drinks: got a pitcher of rum punch. Wasn't tasty and was weak. Kind of tasted like medicine and cool-aid mixed together.For 25 dollars for a pitcher (3-4 drinks)on a semi empty stomach I was at least expecting a buzz. Should've got the wine.The food: appetizers Conch fritters: Dry and unappetizing.The plantains: GREAT!The sweet potatoes: nothing special. Just roasted or baked sweet potatoes Steampots arrived lukewarm/coldHowever the corn inside was DELICIOUSThe sauces: GREAT. Sweet potatoes in the steampots: not cooked fully and cold.I am so disappointed.Though this place is cheaper than most, you get what you pay for.The quality of the crab and shrimp was good. My family liked the sauces.I just wish it didn't take so long and wasn't cold when it got here. I also wish the appetizers were better. The staff was kind and did bring out free apps because it was taking so long, so that's lovely. I was expecting more from this place. Maybe this was just a bad day. People seem to love this place! And from the looks of the menu it seems SPECTACULAR. Such potential to be my favorite restaurant EVER. But sadly, it's a no for me. Upset that I spent $200 on an experience that was subpar. I would love some sort of voucher in return. And maybe I would come back and give this place another try. :)"
7/14/2019,20190714,4,4.17,"Overall I'd say we enjoyed our experience here. It was our first time visiting Lolo's. It's a very laid back place, kind of like a island food shack. Service was good. Greeted at the door you must order in the front and if you'd like to sit in the back they'll bring the food to you. We had the Pom Pom shrimp basket with garlic fries which was very yummy. The shrimp could've used more sauce and the garlic fries as well but both were very flavorful. The rum punch to me tastes like sorrel and coconut rum. It was ok. The crab cake sandwich was delicious and flavorful. And the chips and salsa were yummy. The plantain chips aren't salted so the more salsa you eat the better they taste. Only thing that might need improvement is the speaker in the backyard so we could hear more music. We forgot to check in and get our free appetizer but we'll defiantly be going back. Such a cute whole in the wall spot though."
7/14/2019,20190714,4,4.17,"Went here with my mom because she had a meal voucher for two. I have always heard of this place and passed by only because of how small it looks and not much seating area. We went around 5 this past Saturday and boy was it poppin in there. All the seating inside was pretty much taken ( at least right where the a/c was) and outside was pretty full too. We still got a table but for a short person like me the high benches were killing my back but eventually we moved once a spot opened up with a chair. Our seafood came super fast but if we had not said something i think we would have not gotten our starters it was really busy and only three waiters. Overall great food, but it was a 90 degree day and with the small backyard packed with people i wish i had just waited for an inside table. This is a great spot for seafood lovers and Caribbean food lovers. Crabs were sooo good i might go and get some again today lol!!!"
7/21/2019,20190721,4,4.17,"Absolutely love this place. The service is wonderful, everyone was friendly and had a smile. They were happy to explain things on the menu and did not once rush us. The food options are very diverse to the point where I could have gotten my seafood with butter or pepper sauce. They service was fast for the main entrees but took some time getting the appetizers out since they were all fried and had a a good amount of people in front of us. The one downside about this place as why it's not a 5 stars, is that the tables are kinda small and don't give you much space but honestly the flavors and spices used in the food made it all up. Don't expect to order multiple things and have somewhere to feast, but most definitely recommend."
7/24/2019,20190724,1,4.16,Pom Pom shrimp took over half an hour to come out. Garlic fries are plain fries that are covered in a liquid garlic sauce. I expected it to be more of a garlic salt I don't like wet fries. Fries soft shell crab took longer than the shrimp the bacon reminded me of a dog treat...super rubbery. The crab wasn't seasoned and smelled of ammonia how they usually do when they're dead prior to cooking (if you eat crab then you know what I'm talking about) steam put was a bag on a tray no where to put our shells and the sauce lacked salt. The snow crab clusters were not the freshest and the top was filled with all that gunk..gray in color ew. The corn was burned I wish I took pics but I just needed to get out of there.
7/31/2019,20190731,5,4.16,"The food here was amazing. I had never had a ""Johnny Cake"" prior, and it is now a favorite of mine. We placed a large order and got to try a wide variety of things. The crabcake and johnny cakes were my favorite! Super small and casual place, so don't expect anything too fancy. Unless you sit outside, don't expect to do more than grab-and-go. Great little gem in the area."
8/5/2019,20190805,4,4.16,"Very friendly staff everyone was so welcoming and nice, food was okay very fresh fish. Got the lunch special salmon warm bowl with garlic butter, it was much saltier than I anticipated I should've told them to use less garlic butter but service was great."
8/6/2019,20190806,4,4.16,"I'd been vegan for the past five years and craving seafood for quite some time. The craving came over me so strong that I decided to indulge and see if i really had been missing much! I ordered the 1lb of crab legs with the garlic and old bay sauce and left the crab legs obliterated! Incredibly satisfying and worth the price. I'm glad to have a place like Lolo's in harlem, where i saw so many beautiful PoC enjoying good food and quality time with loved ones. It was worth breaking my veganism for and I will be returning!"
8/14/2019,20190814,4,4.16,Lolo's seafood shack was really good. The food was excellent. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't expecting to have to sit down then get up and wait on a line to order my food. That was the only negative other than that everything was fine the workers were extremely nice.
8/15/2019,20190815,4,4.16,What i love the most about this place is the feeling of being somewhere in a Caribbean island instead of NYC. Their decor is very rusty & caribbean. Their service was excellent. Very friendly & attentive.  I had the pom shrimps and a crab cake both very delicious.
8/15/2019,20190815,5,4.16,"This place is phenomenal, so fresh and great rum punch. Awesome spot if looking for cool spots in upper manhattan with ample outdoor seating"
8/16/2019,20190816,5,4.16,"The food here is DELICIOUS. No nonsense service, but don't be afraid to ask for anything you need - the staff is very accommodating. And there are games on the back patio! Like jumbo jenga"
8/26/2019,20190826,1,4.16,"I was very surprised by all the good reviews that were given to this restaurant. Saturday, August 24,2019 we decided to give this place a try to have dinner. It was a horrible experience for the both of us. The tables were dirty, ants and other bugs were crawling on the table, when you looked around the atmospher, you can see the attempt to have a shack in Jamaica I get it, but it was really dirty. The staff was filled with kids, without customer service experience, who was trying yet not equipped to deal deal with customers. We ordered a Salmond basket & crabcake basket. It was pricey yet the food was skimpy. It was so creasy to the point I was sick afterwards. Honestly this place needs to be graded by the city, because people will eventually get sick from eating in this restaurant. My boyfried noticed the oil they were using to fry fish and strimp. It seems it has not been changed in months. I feel that when you are preparing food like this, the entire staff should have on a hair net. We asked for a soda while eating downstairs, the drama for him to get a soda, was amazing. It's not like we could leave the place without paying for a can of soda being we had to walk back up stairs on the way out. By the way they charged him almost $4.00 for a can of soda! I could not believe that. My advise is to stay away from this place until they clean. I was so sick afterwards and we will never ever go to this place again. I recommend that everyone stay clear of this place. They are in a good location to make money but they need to do a better with the staff and cleaning the establishment. I was such a horrible experience! Stay away please, my stomach was in bad shape afterwards...Again, I cannot believe the good reviews thay have. I cannot believe it! I am asking the owners to train your staff, & clean up this place. It really has potiental, if not this place will fail!"
8/30/2019,20190830,5,4.16,"Great food, nice servers, cool space. It feels like you've been transported to somewhere in the Caribbean."
9/11/2019,20190911,3,4.16,"I wanted to love this place as it's about 10 blocks from my home. I had the salmon, shrimp and broccoli. The broccoli was the best part. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good."
9/20/2019,20190920,1,4.15,I ordered from here yesterday through ubereats not only did i not enjoy the food but i've been vomiting ever since i ordered the crablegs and shrimp steam pot i'm so disappointed not only did i waste money but i wasted my time too
9/25/2019,20190925,3,4.15,"The food here was great and I loved the chill atmosphere of being able to sit outside on the casual patio that wasn't too packed at all on a Sunday evening. The waiter though that brought our food to our table was extremely rude and he really dimmed what would've normally been 5 stars based on the food and atmosphere to a 3. Not quite sure at all why he had an attitude, but it was not okay to take it out on the customers. Would love to go back here again based on the food, but not sure if I would due to the really rude waiter that brought our food to the table who's attitude left a bad taste in my mouth."
9/29/2019,20190929,2,4.15,"2 stars for the vibe. Love the decor and menu.Unfortunately, the quality of the seafood just wasn't there. I would try this place again and order a few things different. Pros:-Cajun garlic butter sauce is yummy.-shrimp is good and bigCons:-Crawfish is frozen, not fresh, obvious from taste (fresh crawfish is super yummy, but I get it, this is NYC)-Snow crab was either old or way overcooked as the meat stuck to the shell making it difficult to eat.-Fries weren't crispy, more soggy. I wished they didn't put the soft shell crab over it with sauce, maybe it would have been crispier?Next time I will just stick to the shrimp and maybe try the coconut shrimp. But food was bit of a disappointment."
9/29/2019,20190929,4,4.15,"An adorable hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great seafood. The small exterior and front room open up to larger back and outdoor seating areas. Get ready to chow down on crab legs at this Cape Cod-Caribbean fusion! Portion sizes decreased as deliveries and catering increased, but it proves the high demand."
10/5/2019,20191005,5,4.15,"Lolo's food was . The service from the staff, hospitality of the host, and conversation with the chef made my night. There is nothing left to be desired besides the fact that I will definitely be back!"
10/6/2019,20191006,4,4.15,Cool little spot. Seafood was good. I enjoyed my fish and chips. Staff was very attentive and friendly.
10/15/2019,20191015,4,4.15,"Seafood shack is the perfect name for this place. It's conveniently located by the train (across the street from the C) and the food is good. I came here on the recommendation of my mom who knows I love seafood and recently tried this place. I liked the vibe as soon as I walked in. It's a dive and the staff are super friendly. I liked the fridge full of a hodgepodge of sofas, beers, and sparkling water. I opted for the pineapple Fanta in a glass bottle because well because I usually only see that option when I'm on vacation. The tables are wooden, the chairs don't match - - the only thing missing from this cute shop with an island vibe was the ocean.I ordered the fried fish basket and the coconut shrimp basket. Both were good, like served hot, perfectly crunchy, good. The sauce on the popcorn shrimp was perfect. It was creamy with a sweet and sour balance and drizzled over the fries. I asked for ketchup but actually didn't need any because I really like the sauce that came with the food. I tried the street corn too. It was lukewarm and too much old bay for my taste, but I'm sure it rocks for others.If I was in the neighborhood, I'd certainly return. It's divey but I felt at home, like I literally put my feet up on the stoll and crushed the seafood felt at home."
10/29/2019,20191029,2,4.15,It's cute but it's not for a person who really wants to eat. The food is good but the serving size it's not enough. We ate and had to go somewhere else to eat. If you're going to go here you might as well travel to City Island and get more food for less the cost and better quality.
11/2/2019,20191102,3,4.14,Food was ok. The jerk chicken with rice and peas was excellent. The chicken was very tender. The bake and shark was very good.  The crab legs and shrimp was very good. However the conch fritters were over fried n a little to well done.
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.15,This place is a hidden (ish) gem. It's inside a shack that literally must have been a house at one time. The food is homey and delicious; it feels like a trip to a neighbor's house every time we are there! There's a porch out back that's a great spot to hang out with some beers and friends. You gotta check this place out!
11/20/2019,20191120,5,4.15,"I got the crab cakes and fried shrimp basket. Really great, fried perfectly. Also try the sangria it's unique and tastes amazing!"
1/10/2020,20200110,1,4.14,"Like, what the fuck yo?!!! I ordered these conch fritters and if you go to my pictures you will see that there is NO CONCH in there except for two pieces total because I'm so petty I counted and a bunch of breading, corn and peppers. I am so disappointed and to add insult to injury, I tried one because I paid for them and they had no seasoning whatsoever. I mean Salt Bae adds more flavor to his meats than this atrocity of an appetizer. I just threw it away and the Conch Fritters at the bottom were a big blob of nastiness. As I write this you guys are loosing stars. I'm done before you guys wind up in the negative teens. Goodnight"
1/17/2020,20200117,5,4.14,"Shark in NYC!?! Who would have thought?! Their shark lunch box is a must have and their crab cake sandwich is to die for. No need to travel to City Island or the like for crab cake anymore. The employees were extremely welcoming, friendly and the service has a homey feel. Definitely must come back."
1/21/2020,20200121,5,4.15,"Went to Lolo's with no expectations and loved it. I had the crabcake, a Johnny cake, and plantain chips, all of which were delicious. To my very pleasant surprise, I ran into the owner & chef, Chef Raymond, who was incredibly warm, down-to-earth and inspiring at the same time. He has a strong commitment to the Harlem community, to using the best ingredients and preparing quality food. I can't wait to come back and try the other things on the menu."
2/3/2020,20200203,4,4.15,This can get a 5 but the it took a little while for our food to come and they didn't come in order. We got our entree first then the appetizers. Also because they have outside heated seating whenever people will come in and out sometimes they forget to close the door all the way and someone will have to close it. The food was delicious. The ribs were dried rubbed  which was flavorful and tender. I loved the bbq sauce that came with it. The sauces for the plantain chips were good especially the chutney sauce. The shrimp was also good. The wings were nicely charred and juicy. I love love love the Johnny Cake which came with honey butter.I can eat that everyday. The rum punch was nice and refreshing. The staff here are very friendly and this quaint restaurant had a cute island vibe. can't to go back in the summer and eat outside and have a nice cold drink and tasty food.
2/9/2020,20200209,2,4.14,Food was tasteless place was small and staff wasn't friendly or helpful it was literally do it yourself
2/9/2020,20200209,1,4.14,"OKAY! First off I believe this place has tremendous POTENTIAL. The concept seems fitting especially given the location and it can really something great for the neighborhood. HOWEVER this restaurant just completely misses the mark on what a basic eatery should possess. I just recently ate here with some friends and we were not impressed at all. We ordered the 1/2 lb peeled shrimp, fried whiting fish,garlic fries and the ""famous rum punch"" . The star of the night was the garlic fries and praises sadly ends there. The rum punch tasted like cough syrup and coconut it was just awful. Not to mention we got the drinks after we received all of our food and one was dropped and sipped all over the table upon arrival (embarrassing). The peeled shrimp portion is entirely too small and should just be an appetizer 6 shrimps in a bag of butter is just not what you are expecting and it is just very disappointing. The fried whiting was overcooked and under seasoned. Lastly, the DECOR and dining experience was also a messsss! Like many other comments it's clear what the aesthetic was suppose to give off but it just gave raggedy and ill-fully presented. The heated cabana was hardly heated I didn't feel comfortable taking off my coat. The first thing u want to do when going out to eat is take off your coat get comfy and look at the menu! I found myself scop the place out because I didn't get the sense of comfort or coziness that I should have and that's unfortunate. The staff just seem really inexperienced and didn't have the support they needed to be able to handle a typical Saturday night dinner service. Especially with so many take out orders going out. The focus should be redirect to the dining room service for sure. All and all I would not return here and I do hope the subpar food and service continues to improve because this place can really be something great!"
2/23/2020,20200223,1,4.13,"It pains me to say this but this has to be some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. The food is good but whoever is running this establishment needs to reconsider their business model and staff because the customer service is beyond TERRIBLE!!! 2 hour wait times for 8 shrimp and fries. People with nasty attitudes. Not just on one occasion but several times. It sad because we try to support black owned business but this one is tough. I've ordered here on Uber eats before, waited an hour and a half and had to physically walk to the location to get the issue rectified. There's is also never a manager there to discuss these issues with. I will never be returning to them and it's a shame because they do have good food."
2/29/2020,20200229,5,4.13,"I have only been here once but I definitely plan on coming back. It's a little different because I thought it was a traditional sit down but you order your food and drink then take a seat with you order number and they bring you the food as it becomes ready.Number 1 for me was the service. Wish I grabbed everyone's name. The woman who took my order was not only patient with me but others who came in. I say that because someone came in with an expired coupon (maybe Groupon?) and they were kind of a dick but she was super accommodating. They have an outdoor space, even in the winter, but their outdoor heaters were broken so they were limited on seating but again, they handled the wait with amazingness. The food was top notch. Got the crab cake sandwich and I think it's the best I've had. There wasn't much filler, not dry, and lots of flavor. The plantain chips + chutney was delicious (and they'll refill your chutney at no extra charge). The plantain side was a good portion and delicious as well. Only drink I had was the house rum punch - again, lots of flavor. I usually drink my alcohol like water but I actually took my time with this because it had a lot going on. Though you preorder your food and drink they have a sort of waiter/tress check up and they were on top of it! Plan to go again and again, hopefully the heat lamps will work next time but will def visit again in the summer."
2/29/2020,20200229,4,4.13,"What a fun spot! Filled with carribean vibes this place makes me relieve my for warmer days. It's got every fried seafood you could think of. Got the shark basket with the jalape√±o sauce on the side, which I recommend if you're not great with hot/spicy. Also got the plantains with cojita cheese. My friends got the jerk chicken, cauliflower, and broccoli. Everyone seemed to like their dishes. The man at the counter was super nice and attentive. You order at the counter but they have a room for seating in back past the kitchen, small space though, it fits only about 3 parties of 4 people. Heard they have a good size deck out back for summertime, so I will be back when the weather warms up :)"
3/3/2020,20200303,5,4.14,"OMG THE FOOD ISOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. If you are looking for good food and great service, this is the place to go. Now it may not have the decor of the Four Seasons, but the food is AMAZING and the staff are FABULOUS. It only seats approximately 25 and a few more when the backyard opens in the summer but believe me it worth it. It was my first time going and I'm definitely going back. Take a stroll over and enjoy the best food on the West side of Harlem. P.S. Have the Johnny Cakes, it was my first time having them and I wanted to take the chef home with me LOL. (I am Editor in Chief of a Fashion Magazine in NYC)"
3/6/2020,20200306,5,4.14,Where on God's Green Earth have you been all my life? Just went in and ordered for the first time ever thanks to a colleagues recommendation. I am a Coconut Shrimp JUNKIE!!!! And those Garlic Fries! So amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Keep it up! I will definitely be back! YUMMMMM!!!!
3/7/2020,20200307,5,4.14,"Love the mom & pop Caribbean atmosphere, and the conch fritters reminds me of Miami and Staff is very friendly."
3/13/2020,20200313,1,4.13,Quality of the food was not what I expected. Should have followed my instinct and went to red lobster instead. Disappointed to say the least.
3/13/2020,20200313,5,4.13,I came here with my friend and we both loved the food. Everyone who works here were supper friendly. They went above and beyond with their service.
4/19/2020,20200419,4,4.13,"COVID-19 REVIEWI'm going to start with some facts before we move on to opinions:- unpeeled shrimp are weird looking- half a pound of shrimp is not a meal, it's like 7 shrimps, be awareOpinions!I went for pick up and it was perfectly on time, great start. I got the half pound of shrimp in Lolo's Signature Sauce (curry/coconut type game) and it's delicious. I peeled all of mine in one go to make it easier and more appetizing (see fact 1). I also recommend dipping your johnny cakes in the leftover sauce. Luckily (see fact 2), I also got the johnny cakes with honey butter (come on, corn pancakes with honey butter, how could it not be good) and the coconut shrimp basket. I was planning on this being two meals, it'll probably total to 1.5 meals.The coconut shrimp is delicious, coconut tastes fresh so it's really got that coconut punch. Plus, fried stuff. The garlic fries are what you'd expect (delicious, again, fried stuff).I also got the rum punch because we've earned it and it's pretty darned good too. Plus they wrapped up and down in saran wrap so it made its way home safely, very much appreciated.All to say, solid COVID meal. More expensive than I'd like (mainly looking at that half pound of shrimp) but it's a bunch of flavors I don't have at home and an opportunity not to cook. Thanks for still being open, Lolo's!"
4/19/2020,20200419,5,4.14,"Love me some Lolo's- the review is for both delivery and dine in. Recently I have ordered delivery from Lolo's due to the current times and everything was perfect! We had crab legs, shrimp, dirty rice and garlic fries. Everything was delicious was well packaged! The dine in experience is also a definite must-try, you'll definitely feel like you're on a shack on the beaches of Jamaica. Can't recommend them enough!"
4/30/2020,20200430,1,4.13,"This was the WORSE food that I have had along with the nasty rum punch. The fish was dry and overcooked. The shrimps weren't even cleaned. I purchased a dinner for 2 and it came with 2 soggy crab cakes, freench fries and 4 jerk wings. WHAT 2 PEOPLE IS THAT FEEDING??????? I will NEVER go back there again and I WANT ALL of my money back. I WISH I HAD THE OPTION TO GIVE THEM NO STARS"
5/9/2020,20200509,4,4.13,Tried for the first time yesterday and I was not disappointed. It was a small place but the food was delicious. I had the shrimp and was surprised that the half pound was so small. I tried the garlic sauce and it was okay. I'm sure the other sauces would have more flavor. My favorite were the wings and the garlic fries. Definitely recommend. I would definitely come back
5/17/2020,20200517,5,4.13,Nice atmosphere I enjoyed the crablegs and the chilled broccoli salad is great the out door seating is super cool nice place to go.
5/22/2020,20200522,1,4.13,"I just received my first order and I am extremely disappointed. I ordered crab legs and received 1.5 small clusters. There is no way that price point should be over $20 for the amount received. On top of that, the bag was open and sauce was everywhere and the crab legs were cold. I also ordered wings and fries. The wings were ok and the fries were a tin of soggy mess. What a waste of money. Never again."
6/1/2020,20200601,5,4.13,"The best seafood place in NYC, the snacks are a great lead in to the main event. Let's not forget to grab some chips & chutney salsa & the jerk ribs are delicious. Can't forget the johnny cakes with honey butter!Dish wise I usually go for either the salmon shrimp basket or grab one of their soft shell crab sandwiches."
6/2/2020,20200602,1,4.12,"I've eaten here many times and the food is good but I just had the worst experience picking up food. I placed an order online at around 1:30pm to pick up at 5:45pm. I got there to pick up my food at 5:45 and it wasn't ready until 6:20, so I was waiting outside for 35 minutes. The pickup window is high up so it isn't easy to communicate and no one was manning the window, so people had to call the restaurant while standing outside of it to figure out what was going on with their food. I called around when I first got there and they said ""it's ready, one moment,"" yet I waited for over half an hour. I eventually called again around 6:15 and they brought out my food a few minutes later. There were 14 other people standing outside waiting for their food with me. It was just absurd and unacceptable."
6/3/2020,20200603,5,4.13,"Great Black-owned neighborhood spot. Delicious, unique food you won't find anywhere else in Manhattan. Been visiting and grabbing takeout here for 4+ years and it never disappoints. Quick service, great menu, awesome drink selection. Support Harlem's independent businesses like Lolo's."
6/6/2020,20200606,4,4.13,Finally got to try Lolo's today it's been on my list for while. I ordered the sweet plantains and the fish fry basket. The fish is nicely thin so you get an even ratio of fish to batter in each bite. The sweet plantains are delishes but the real mvp is the dipping sauces both of which I wish I had much more than the tblsp serving of each.
6/13/2020,20200613,4,4.13,Today it was my first time eating here today and I ordered a lolo's punch and the coconut shrimp and French fries. I enjoyed my food very much! The drink was less of a punch and more like there version of the sorrel. Overall I enjoyed my food and the experience soaking up the culture.
6/13/2020,20200613,1,4.12,"This is my second time ordering from this place and I would NOT recommend it. The first time I ordered they forgot all my sauce for my seafood boil so they expected to have me eat a meal with NO flavor. Mind you, I know good seafood because of New Orleans so I added my own seasonings from home and I saved my meal. I ordered today and I called to speak to a manager (Jose) to let him know about the missing sauce on my food order last week and he said he would make sure I get my sauce on this order, so I was excited to finally try their ""special sauce"". My order finally arrived and when I opened my bag there was only half of the shrimp that is usually in the order which is supposed to be a 1/2 pound. Usually, they give you 2 small crab clusters but for some reason I only got 1. It was super disappointing because I've been waiting all week to have finally tried their food the right way and ugh... that ain't no special sauce, it's literally watered down curry. Not only was shorted on my food but over all, they literally left a bad taste in my mouth from customer service to food quality. There are plenty other seafood boils in the neighborhood that are 10x better but I wanted to give this a try.. my regret of the week. So no, don't take a chance here... THIS IS NOT THE SPOT."
6/20/2020,20200620,3,4.12,"FoodLo's Lo's food is very tasty. The guy who took my order was cool. Me & my friends ordered the shrimp & salmon basket. First off if wasn't a basket. The portions was very very small for the price. It was like we had a snack. They cut the fish in half & gave us hard broccoli. The mango slushy with Alcohol tasted like juice. Please give us bigger food portions. I was still hungry man . I love to support black businesses, but we gotta do better."
6/24/2020,20200624,5,4.12,"I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time and it always slips my mind and is out of the way since I am always heading to midtown and things in my area. I finally decided to try it as it was recommended as a small business owned by a person of color and I wanted to support them in any way that I can. I ordered for delivery and was so excited! The food is really good. Although the portion of their sandwich is small, I would highly recommend getting it with a side or an appetizer but man was it good! I got the soft shell crab sand which and their elote type corn and it was really good. I will try this place out again whenever I am hungry for some fried seafood!"
6/24/2020,20200624,3,4.12,"I wanted to like this place. So cute setup. My neighbor has given me a voucher. The restaurant at first didn't want to honor the voucher even though it was valid through August 2020. Then they said they would accept but severely limited options and even that would have been okay.. the staff is nice . but the food was terrible and parts of my order missing which was surprising considering when I paid upfront I tipped like 30 percent plus in cash to support small business... the first time i was handed wrong order, the second time without drinks finally the third time I said it is what it is and left but order didn't include pineapple salsathe crab dip was stale, and had a very fishy taste. The pompom shrimp are deep fried but half skin was coming off ,with two squirts of spicy mayo on top...The shrimp boil with garlic butter was a stick of butter thrown into a bag with boiled shrimps hardly any taste beyond butter.We threw most of this food out. I live and eat all around Harlem and seafood and can say this was subparI would only return here for a beer."
6/30/2020,20200630,4,4.12,"Let's start this off by saying 4.5 HANDS DOWN! Either I'm feening to be outside because I'm over quarantine or this food was freaking excellent!Okay, so me and my sis wanted seafood but a few of the other spots were closed. So I googled again and found this spot! We pulled up and it looked like a Colorful ad straight out of Cuba! And I love me a good instagramable spot!Me and my sister are kindred spirits so we damn near ordered the same thing!We both for the nachos with shrimp, I got avocado toast with plantain, she got coconut shrimp spring rolls, and we both got frozen margaritas with rum. Okay, the wait is Adeen long Lol, but they must get that a lot because written on the wall is ""Good things come to those who wait..."" or something like that lolIt made me realize how much I miss sitting down to eat because we woulda been downing drinks while we waited! Lol We got the food, and drove around the corner to eat... OMGGGGG!!! They didn't skimp on the shrimp, the damn avocado toast was made on BAKE!!! Like how dope is that?!?! The spring rolls were crisped to perfection! The only reason for the 4.5, instead of 5, was the margaritas coulda used a bit more rum and the nachos themself were stale...I called back and let them know, not even really caring much because we were so damn hungry and it was so damn tasty, they said to come back next time and ask for Jose and we'll get a complimentary nachos...So Jose I'm coming back for you!! And some of the rest of that menu!"
7/5/2020,20200705,1,4.11,"So today I wanted to support this establishment mainly because i heard it was owned by ppl of color. They have outdoor seating which is cool and today the weather is great. So as I'm about to place my order my friend asks if she can use the restroom and she was told she couldn't for whatever reason. With that being said we took our business across the street to BLVD , they're Black owned and they allowed us to use the restroom."
7/14/2020,20200714,4,4.11,"It's true to the shack. It's a cute little shack right around the corner from Harlem Tavern. It's a window walk up and they have a bench or two with umbrellas to shade from the sun while you wait for your order. I got a boil bag with about a 1/2 pound of shrimp, 1 cluster of crab legs, 1 corn and sweet potato with the Lolo sauce. The sweet potato was completely unexpected. The Lolo sauce is absolute fire. The boil bag filled me up, but I do wish that it came with a full piece of sweet potato instead of a little quarter piece as well as another piece of corn. I also had a frozen mango margarita which came in a cute little pouch, like an adult Capri sun. My homegirl had a soft shell crab sandwich which looked delicious and I tried one of her shrimp eggrolls. The eggrolls were sweet. I detected hints of coconut in them. All in all, I would definitely come here again. The food, service and drinks were good."
7/28/2020,20200728,2,4.11,"Good food but when they're getting good business you no longer matter. They'll stop answering the phone. Leave it on busy for HOURS. 3,4,5 hours at a time. Or a full day. It leaves a nasty empty feeling in the customer. And we're only trying to support. They honestly can do a lot better. Their prices aren't the best combined with this bipolar mentality on customers makes it almost not worth the trouble. Sadly I now have to find a new seafood place uptown. Don't believe me, call them Sunday."
7/28/2020,20200728,3,4.11,"FoodLolo's food is very tasty. The guy who took my order was cool. Me & my friends ordered the shrimp & salmon basket. First off if wasn't a basket. The portions was very very small for the price. It was like we had a snack. They cut the fish in half & gave us hard broccoli. The mango slushy with Alcohol tasted like juice. Please give us bigger food portions. I was still hungry mI love to support black businesses, but we gotta do better."
8/7/2020,20200807,4,4.11,"The Pom Pom Shrimp basket was delish! It's jumbo shrimp with perfect prepared fries! My partner order 2 lb of crab legs with broccoli & corn he was very pleased! On the other hand the margaritas are weak with heavy syrup, it taste like a quarter water lol. Very disappointed with the drinks"
8/9/2020,20200809,4,4.11,"We loved the food. The bake & ""shark"" was great. Glad they're open during covid. Only down side is the terrible pop music but I'll definitely be returning!"
8/21/2020,20200821,3,4.11,A place for hipsters to get their seafood-fix. Not gangsters.
8/23/2020,20200823,3,4.11,"Drinks were ok, No seasoning for n the Salmon and shrimp over cooked, Fritters not seasoned clam dip trash. Jerked ribs turned out to be a joke. Not true to the menu. I have had better food at Chucky Cheese. For this price I could've cooked a feast! Never again."
9/4/2020,20200904,1,4.1,"Tried it and didn't like it at all! For the prices, the portions are not worth it. Customer service was decent though."
9/7/2020,20200907,2,4.1,"A bit annoyingI placed an order for a few items through Grubhub. About 15 or so minutes after placing the order, I received a call from the restaurant saying that they did not have the conch fritters. Not a problem, because they offered to replace that appetizer with the jerk ribs. When the food arrived, the jerk ribs were not in the bag. I called the restaurant to let them know that they delivered the wrong item. The person on the phone told me I could have either store credit or they could send the correct item. I went with the latter option and was told that it was going to be about 45 min for someone to bring the correct item. Since I'm writing this review 3hrs after making the phone call, I guess it's safe to say that I will not receive the item. It is a bit convenient that they offered to deliver the substituted item after closing time, but not follow through with their offer. The food was decent, and I really enjoyed the crawfish and shrimp. While edible, I will say that I was not super impressed with the Crabby Dip and Lolo's Fries. I am a bit disappointed that my experience did not live up to other folks' experiences."
9/13/2020,20200913,1,4.09,"Seating is only in the front of the restaurant and its first come first serve. I'm not sure if it was the lack of staff, but the tables are not cleaned regularly. I had to ask someone to clean the table that I had been sitting for 10 minutes. I was not a huge fan of the food. I ordered fried fish with lolo's fries, and when my order came out to be more than I calculated, I was then told lolo's fries were $2 extra. Okay, but when you have me a choice of which fries I wanted, this should've been stated, no problem. These fries were no different than the plain fries my friend ordered. They are not authentic seasoned fries. They were soggy and had garlic and jalape√±o ""seasoning"" sprinkled on top. Will NEVER get these fries again. I'm not sure why people raved about them. The fish was nothing special.This place did not allow my friend to use their bathroom. How can you serve people with outdoor seating and NOT let them use the bathroom???. The staff told my friend they didn't have one!!!! I get the whole covid thing, but the facr that you don't allow anyone inside to use the bathroom is absurd.I will give this place one more try by ordered something different. But its not a place I'd happily recommend."
9/18/2020,20200918,1,4.09,This Place Is Horrible ‚Äº My Shrimp Was Not Done At All. The Seasoning Was Veryyyy Watery ‚Äº I Paid For Extra Food And It Was Handled Poorly ‚Äº I Hate It Here ‚Äº And To Top It Off They False Advertised There Is No Backyard And It's 3.75 For A Small Ass Figi Water ‚Äº The Menu Was Out Of Date ‚Äº My Recommendation Is Not To Eat Here They're Only Good For Drinks Respectfully ‚Äº            -
10/6/2020,20201006,5,4.09,Dinner was DELICIOUS!!!! We are addicted!Thank you - such a wonderful treat!!
10/15/2020,20201015,5,4.09,"This place is amazing! Definitely recommend it if you are in the area, looking for bold flavor, food that reheats well the next day (and actually tastes the same lol), great quality overall, staff and food. I always purchase tons of food but it never lasts long enough for photos lol Everything is great! Get you some sangria or a soft shell crab sandwich, throw in some ribs, you will be full! P.S. Chef Jos√® has the magic touch!!! #supportGreatbusinesses"
10/19/2020,20201019,5,4.09,I love the shark & bake. Memories of Guyana.& the service was amazing. Im going back soon.
10/22/2020,20201022,2,4.09,"I got to say I was unimpressed with this place it had such great reviews my meal was both expensive an unsatisfying. And I went all out trying different things from the menu because I didn't know what was good so I sampled. I'll try again maybe with someone who's been there before because I definitely don't get it. Sorry I'm not saying anything specific the whole meal was just unmemorable not seasoned in any special way and way to pricey, so there, there's specifics."
10/27/2020,20201027,5,4.09,"Are you kidding? When voting early yesterday on W. 102nd St for 3 1/2 hours standing in yucky weather, LoLo's had a table handing out a small chicken wrap sandwich & water FREE to anyone who wanted one! It was so generous to do that! Only thing was, there was a LoLo's guy who was walking up-and-down the lines with a box of sandwiches and never once said ""FREE SANDWICHES & water if you'd like one!"" Please tell him that saying Free is the key. I was feeling droopy after all that time, and enjoyed it very much. Thank you LoLo's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.09,"I have to stop myself from ordering Lolo's for lunch almost every day. One of my favorite places, both for takeout and dine-in. Get the soft-shelled crab!"
10/31/2020,20201031,4,4.09,"I've had a few items here, and overall it's really good:1. My go to is the shark sandwich- extra sauce. So yummy2. The smoked wings are also good- I wish they were a little crispier but I know that's a preference thing. But the sauce on it is literally finger licking good3. Jerk ribs are ok, but I wouldn't order them again."
11/7/2020,20201107,1,4.09,"Absolutely no. Couldn't eat the food it was so bad. The fries were soggy, everything was fried in what seems like old oil. Stale taste, food was too hard to even bite down into, the fish had a strong fishy smell like it's not fresh. Especially for the prices this was such a waste. I really should get my money back cause nothing was edible. And the sweet plantains were suppose to have cheese and herbs but it was just sprinkled with a bit of Parmesan looking cheese - cmon- zero herbs. Idk if this was an off night for the establishment cause I see strong reviews but they really shouldn't have served that food as a meal. Oh and icing on top- my sandwich has bones in it. I pulled out three bones out of my mouth but I spit out more. Was someone trying to kill me through my food? Ok an exaggeration but i couldn't eat the rest of this so I starved."

11/7/2020,20201107,2,4.08,The food was tasty but the prices are insanely overpriced for the portion sizes. My shrimp broil came with one super small piece of corn and 3 halves of tiny potatoes. I'm sorry but that's not ok for a supposed dinner portion.

Salmon ""grain bowl"" also a funny description but the dish was great, salmon done to perfection with dirty rice broccoli and super-rich coconut sauce. Overpriced bottled water is my only complaint -- can't wait to eat this food again."

You can taste the Coconut, but it is dry. The Nachos with Crab Dip is a waste. I didn't like the Crab Dip at all. Hopefully the other food on the menu is better."

12/5/2020,20201205,5,4.09,"Love the freshness of the salmon, shrimp and snow crab legs. That's a big thing for me and they passed the test. Tip: get a bunch of things to share, me friends and I got to try a little bit if everything. The coconut curry sauce is amazing for any of the boils, it's creamy and dairy free. I love the plantain chips and and pineapple salsa dips. Overall quality and speed is amazing for food this fresh."

1/25/2021,20210125,5,4.09,My husband and I love Lolo's! I'm addicted to the softshell crab sandwich and the drinks are YUM. I love all of the sauces. Heated seating too and friendly service too. Will definitely be back.
1/27/2021,20210127,5,4.09,"The absolute best place, a total gem. We used to come here quite a bit pre pandemic for a night out and I was so happy to see they were on uber eats as we are not nearby. Ordered for my birthday and asked in a note if I could have a rum slushee that I had seen on the menu but wasn't able to select when I was ordering. Not only did they give me one, they didn't even charge me for it! Such a sweet gesture from one of our favorite spots, it really made my night. Please support this amazing place. Crab legs in old bay and garlic sauce for life!!!!!!! May have to order again tonight which is crazy but writing this review is making me NEED LoLo's. Thank you for existing!"
2/4/2021,20210204,5,4.09,"- Via delivery-Their curry was banging, shite everything was banging ! Flavor boom boom"
2/12/2021,20210212,1,4.09,"This is the worst restaurant I have been to in all of manhattan at this price point Pom Pom shrimp and fries:Fries aren't even close to crispy. The ""garlic fries"" are repulsive they pour some type of garlic bechamel that makes the fries even more soggy. The shrimp aren't evenly breaded and aren't de-shelled well. Only a few shrimp for this meal and a ton of inedible fries. I wouldn't give this to my enemiesRibs: flavorless, overcooked. Tastes more like ash then smoked. No bbq sauce on this either although their menu says they do. Kind of like chewing soggy cardboard.Cauliflower: this is the worst thing I have ever eaten! I know that sounds crazy but the cauliflower here tastes like chemicals. That weird bitter aluminum taste and I guess like everything here they just cover it in some type of bechamel or cream. It was so disgusting I threw it out immediately.Avoid this spot at all costs. It's not only terrible food they are selling it at a price point that will make any customer depressed."
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.09,Make your way here and try their food. The jerk ribs are super tasty and just fall off the bone. The conch fritters are good but my ultimate fav was the Johny cakes. I could eat 10 of those with no problem.
3/13/2021,20210313,2,4.09,"Let me start by first saying that usually Lolo's is amazing. I have eaten here several times however when we arrived today we were told that there was no table for us although I made a reservation online. When I pulled up the reservation I was told that there people who were occupying the table at the moment had made reservations days ago and it seemed like I had made a late reservation and would have to wait 15 to 30 minutes. There was no empathy, no apology for the error no care or consideration so I took my hungry family, our little birthday celebration and more importantly our funds elsewhere. Hopefully they will fix their system and this will not happen to patrons in the future."
3/13/2021,20210313,5,4.09,I absolutely loved loved this place! Awesome food and service. Def recommend! I'll be back soon
3/17/2021,20210317,4,4.09,Food arrived warm but the garlic crema wings and the jerk ribs with the BBQ sauce was so delicious and delivery person was friendly. Will order again. Next time I will go for the seafood at a seafood shack lol
3/23/2021,20210323,1,4.08,"This place is still frankly disgusting especially considering the prices and portion sizes. Whatever you do avoid this place particularly their fried foods. Always soggy fries, soggy shrimp.... I want to restate that I think this place might be the worst restaurant I have been to in Manhattan at this price point."
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.08,Really great Caribbean seafood! Great spot to chill with friends at bar round the back in the evenings. The owners are super nice and hospitable! Definitely recommend!
3/27/2021,20210327,5,4.08,The best restaurant and has a great backyard!! The owner Raymond is amazing!! This is the place for good seafood and drinks. Amazing Vibes.
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.09,The ribs were fantastic. All the food was delicious ni complaints at all & the staff was great as well. Food comes quick & fast. Good service. Good drinks& it fills you up
4/9/2021,20210409,4,4.09,"This place was def in the heart of Harlem, a hidden little gem I took my husband too, will def come back the scenery is great and brought me back to being in Jamaica"
5/18/2021,20210518,5,4.09,Delicious food nice staff it's a cute little spot right up the street from where I grew up I love it
5/19/2021,20210519,1,4.08,"Lolo's has always remained a decent spot to me, not anywhere I'd actually recommend to folks. My girlfriend took me for a date over the weekend, the service was subpar but more striking was ther stale and rank seafood. Owner, you really should consider revisiting your menu, consistency of food presented to your patrons, efficiency of service, and definitely that the seafood you serve is FRESH! Quality needs to be a priority with such a pricey menu."
6/2/2021,20210602,4,4.08,I've been trying to come here pre-covid so I'm happy I finally made it. I ordered shrimp and chips and their mango slush Capri Sun with coconut rum. The alcohol was sitting at the top and I didn't realize until I got to the bottom and it tasted like a slurpee. I'd shake it moving forward to mix up the liquor. The food was good though and the fries were nice and crunchy. I will say I was a bit perturbed that the food was sitting out when I went to the restroom. Like literally walking past the bucket of cooked corn to get to the bathroom. I was standing next to the corn while waiting for the cook to come out. The guy came out with no mask.
6/8/2021,20210608,5,4.08,"What can I say?? This place is amazing. Skye is amazing. It's the most unassuming place in Harlem. You go inside and it is like being in the Caribbean, dining on delicious foods by the beach. They have Marie Sharp's hot sauce, which is a Caribbean staple and makes them even more genuinely Caribbean. Loved meeting the owners, loved the spring rolls, loved the atmosphere. Cannot wait for their taco place to open!!"
6/9/2021,20210609,5,4.09,"Lolos is so cute! We love going for happy hour especially when it's a nice day. Our go tos are the jerk ribs, the pom pom shrimp, the fries, corn and sweet plantains. Yummy! We also like the rum punch & red sangria."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.09,"Some friends came in town and I chose a new restaurant to try, Lolo's Seafood Shack in New Youth. Let me just say this, it's a small place but the food is packed with flavor and freshness. Pictured: Veggie nachos, salmon tacos, whiting tacos, crabby dip, glazed chicken wings. Cocktail: Rum punch. We enjoyed all the food options. I wasn't too happy with the drink, however I will be returning."
7/5/2021,20210705,5,4.09,"Lolo's was super tasty and there was no wait. We ordered the $35.00 pre fix deal which is a starter, entree and cocktail. I ordered the crabby dip, which appeared as if it has been sitting for awhile due to the consistency, the fried fish over garlic noodles and the mango slushee.We sat outside at small table, which of course meant, that the slushee spilled. They were kind enough to replace it, which I very much appreciated."
7/5/2021,20210705,2,4.08,"I love lolo's shack, however this last time was a disaster. We paid 90$ for horrible food and service. We ordered two Pom Pom shrimp baskets that came cold, the old bay garlic butter sauce was not cooked through, the jerk ribs came super later when it's on the appetizer menu (extremely good tho) and the mango Slush came virgin. Extremely disappointing dinner."
7/6/2021,20210706,3,4.08,"Everything here is great... EXCEPT for the crawfish. Wow. That crawfish was truly an abomination. It was completely flavorless with a very rubbery texture. Worst of all, they included penne pasta and Italian sausage in the bag. It was a complete waste of money. Please be sure to try the shrimp instead."

7/21/2021,20210721,2,4.08,"Lolo's Seafood ""Shack"" is genuine-looking to those shacks that exist in the Caribbean & Central American with great tasting, authentic food. The patio is also a positive, along with great service.The owner should greet the guests & not ignore diners that spend money at his restaurant. The food was not very good, unfortunately. We ordered COCONUT SHRIMP SPRING ROLLS that were bland, very sweet with very little filling; the BELIZEAN CONCH FRITTERS looked appetizing but were greasy, with an odd aftertaste; the CHIPS + CHUTNEY SALSA was underwhelming. We did appreciate the CRAB CAKES + FRIES BASKET! CRAB CAKES did not have any filling + the FRIES were good. The SALMON + BROCCOLI WARM BOWL was good but came with no broccoli and the salmon looked like a leftover piece. The SORREL was very refreshing & good on a hot summer day.We spent over $100 in the attempt to support a Black-owned business. I don't think we'll return due to the food but the workers were friendly and very helpful."

8/2/2021,20210802,4,4.07,Delicious food and drinks. Very cramped space for where we are which is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars. Will definitely be back for take out.

I was kinda bummed because they had ran out of all the sandwiches by the time my friend and I got there, but I got the jerk chicken and durty rice with broccoli, and it was really good! They gave huge portions; I couldn't finish all of it there. We also got the plantains and chutney salsa, and it was smaller than I thought, but still really good. I was kinda in a rush, so I didn't get to chill and just relax in the vibes as much as I would have liked, but I would love to come back and try more things off their menu and their drinks! The outdoor seating areas are so cute, and they play really good dancehall and reggae that puts you in a happy lil vibe."

There was more of a sweet than savory taste. The jerk ribs were good.

8/23/2021,20210823,4,4.07,"I was excited to try this place out for their seafood boil - it definitely wasn't the boil I expected!I'm used to getting Cajun seafood boils that have more or less the same kind of taste - this felt more like a curry (but was tasty nevertheless). There wasn't much spice to the dish, but it was definitely still a good eat - I even asked for a spoon later so I could sip a little bit of the curry.However, where the REAL treasure really lay was in a different food item on the menu - their jerk chicken! We got tender thigh pieces of chicken in some pretty TASTY sauce - on a bed of hella good dirty rice. It's rare for me to prefer a meat dish over a seafood dish, but I definitely wished I had ordered a second jerk chicken set instead! It was just the right amount of spice, and went so so well with the rice. This one is definitely a must-order!They mostly only have outdoor seating (the interior itself is pretty small), and there is a slight wait to be expected for the food. But i'm probably going to frequent this place a lot - and maybe just do a call in for pick up every now and then for a satisfying meal :)"

Y'all them ribs USE TO BE AMAZING! That jerk sauce USE TO BE on point and when I say that meat is fall off the bone. OMG!!! Well that's how it USE TO BE!!! I made the BIG MISTAKE of ordering 2 orders of jerk ribs yesterday and they were the WORST RIBS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!! Fall off the bone more like meat was tough as hell!!!! I don't know if they ran out of jerk sauce cause there was no jerk AT ALL!!!!! Just basic bland bbq sauce. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED????!!!!!!! CONSISTENCY CONSISTENCY CONSISTENCY Y'all been in business too long to have these kind of mistakes! It's unfortunate when a business pulls a bait and switch! I paid for one thing but got something WAYYYYYY BELOW THE VALUE OF WHAT I PAID!!!! Too many great restaurants in NYC to choose from that actually care about the quality / consistency of what they selling and NOT JUST THE PROFIT! I noticed you raised your prices, wish quality of food would have been raised to match!"
8/24/2021,20210824,2,4.06,"So DISAPPOINTED yesterday!!!!!! I been coming to this place for YEARS and yesterday was my last time! I normally get the same thing, crab legs and jerk ribs. Y'all them ribs USE TO BE AMAZING! That jerk sauce USE TO BE on point and when I say that meat is fall off the bone. OMG!!! Well that's how it USE TO BE!!! I made the BIG MISTAKE of ordering 2 orders of jerk ribs yesterday and they were the WORST RIBS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!! Fall off the bone more like meat was tough as hell!!!! I don't know if they ran out of jerk sauce cause there was no jerk AT ALL!!!!! Just basic bland bbq sauce. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED????!!!!!!! CONSISTENCY CONSISTENCY CONSISTENCY Y'all been in business too long to have these kind of mistakes! It's unfortunate when a business pulls a bait and switch! I paid for one thing but got something WAYYYYYY BELOW THE VALUE OF WHAT I PAID!!!! Too many great restaurants in NYC to choose from that actually care about the quality / consistency of what they selling and NOT JUST THE PROFIT! I noticed you raised your prices, wish quality of food would have been raised to match!"
8/27/2021,20210827,1,4.06,There needs to be a zero star option. My experience here was BEYOND disappointing. The tables are teeny tiny and the space is uninviting. Before placing our order no one asked if we did or did not have reservations so we mentioned it ourselves and that we had planned to eat outside in the back. After placing our order we were asked for vaccination cards. If we were eating outdoors we didn't know we needed to be vaccinated and they should have asked us this BEFORE we placed our order. We decided to take our order to go instead. The food was also disappointing. The potatoes in our boil were still raw and the flavor could of been better. Overall I do not recommend this place and take your money elsewhere. Anyone that says otherwise I would question.

9/23/2021,20210923,3,4.05,"Unfortunately I have to give them a poor review, however I must qualify this by saying I got fish and chips for takeout. Other people seem to insist that their crab options are great, which may be the case. However, to some extent, every restaurant is judged by their weakest link -- and the fish and chips was very weak.First of all, it was bizarrely smelly, suggesting either old fish or that they rarely change their oil. Second, although the fries were pretty good, the fish was tasteless, tough and altogether bad.So, although I try not to rain on people's parades, Lolo's overall gets a thumbs down. If you do go here, definitely stick to the well review crab options!"
10/14/2021,20211014,4,4.05,"A friend suggested this place so we tried it out for dinner. Upon walking in, the space is a little small and got crowded quickly. This is where ordering and payment happens. Once this is completed, we were able to sit in the lovely spacious outdoor backyard area, which had a nice, refreshing feel to it. There is also outdoor seating in front of restaurant.We ordered a variety of menu items to share: Crab Legs and Shrimp Steampot Combo, Coconut Shrimp with French Fries, Johnny Cakes with Honey Butter, and Plantain Chips. For the Steampot Combo, we selected it to be cooked in Lolo's Special Sauce, which was absolutely delicious! It was a perfect mixture of tangy, sweet, savory with plenty of mouthwatering seasonings. There were quite a bit of crab legs, and a decent amount of shrimp, but only one corn on the cob and a few pieces of potato. The crab meat were really tender and tasty, but they were tough to open. We weren't given anything to crack the shell with. There was a tool that was supposed to scoop the meat out, but it wasn't very helpful. The shrimp that was in the Steampot was just okay. I enjoyed everything else though. The Coconut Shrimp was delightfully crispy, light, juicy, and succulent. The fries were also good - Crunchy with great potato flavor. As for the Johnny Cakes, it was my first trying them and they were warm, buttery, moist, with wonderful honey taste inside. Service was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. My friend and I were happy with our meal. I'm glad I had a chance to try this spot."

11/8/2021,20211108,3,4.05,"Step inside this little fish fry stand and feel transported from Harlem to what feels like a little shack, as the name aptly suggests. Even more exciting was being led through the little restaurant to the back, down a set of outdoor stairs to a very adorable covered backyard patio with colored benches and hanging greenery. A very appropriately summer spot to enjoy your seafood spoils at. It hardly feels like you're in the middle of urban sprawl.The menu is a seafood lover's dream, covering all the seafood boil and fish fry items you can imagine, like crab cake baskets, soft shell crab sandwiches, steam pot combos, and conch fritters. Their menu is so long you can feel completely spoiled for choice, though fortunately I came with a friend to share with.We were beyond excited to dig into our fried fish + shrimp basket, and crab sandwich, but admittedly I found the batter to lack flavor and the seafood not entirely fresh. Ultimately I felt very heavy midway through the meal and not like there was a lot of care put into the seasoning of the food. It was nice to wash it all down with a delicious frose though.A very cute concept, but not the best execution."

11/15/2021,20211115,3,4.05,"I'm not a regular here so I didn't know what to expect. First, let me say they were decorating the outdoor seating area during dining hours. Can you imagine eating while someone is drilling & dust is floating around? Secondly, I didn't know they mainly serve alcoholic drinks. I ordered the lunch thinking it was a fruit punch, there's rum in it & it tastes like medicine. What if an unaware pregnant person thinks like me? Thirdly, the broccoli could've been cooked a little longer to minimize the toughness. Fourth, the piece of salmon was thin AF, we need more protein than a pan worth of starch. Lastly, the spring rolls are more dough than filling, I won't be ordering a warm bowl again."
11/18/2021,20211118,5,4.05,"Amazing Food and great atmosphere! Our go to place for casual dining. Husband and I went for our anniversary recently. Could have gone anywhere, but I wanted those Amazing Johnny cakes!!!"

11/24/2021,20211124,5,4.05,Hell yeah! We saw you guys on fluffy's food adventures and he was right! Conch fritters were my favorites my son says I am wrong the wings were best. And the soft shell crab sandwich was amazing. Get it on the Johnny cake.  Came here for the Macys parade and this was one of the highlights of our trip. All the way from So Cal!
11/26/2021,20211126,1,4.05,"either the lolo special sauce is made of CURRY, or i was given the coco curry sauce instead of the lolo special. either way, i for the life of me can not understand how one would eat cajun with curry. never again."
12/27/2021,20211227,4,4.05,"I've tried Lolos on two different occasions and both experiences were completely different. The first time I went there I ordered a warm bowl with dirty rice, shrimp and broccoli and I was not impressed. The dirty rice was overcooked and lacked seasoning in my opinion. The shrimp and the broccoli were decent at best but featured a ton of curry flavoring that really wasnt expected. The second time I had Lolos was at work when they donated meals to hospital staff in the ICU. We received a large piece of jerk chicken and fried rice and it was delicious! The jerk chicken was cooked to perfection! It was juicy, tender and paired perfectly with the rice. That meal renewed my hope in Lolo's. Definitely worth giving it a shot!"
2/4/2022,20220204,5,4.05,"Love this place. Service and staff are excellent. The food is delicious and I wish they delivered to the Bronx as I would order frequently, lol."
2/11/2022,20220211,3,4.05,"Came in mid afternoon (2pm) was told there was no indoor dining, that we had to sit outside in order to dine, in which was no problem, however, the customer service and the follow up was nonexistent. We had to plug in the lights and the heating lamps in order to accommodate our outdoor seating, absolutely no assistance from the staff, despite not being busy AT ALL.They did not prep the table, clean the table, or follow up. At the register there was a offputting attitude. He was not customer friendly, did not offer much information about services or the menu. Flavorful food, diverse menu but lack of drink options and customer service: 6/10 would recommend depending on the mood"
3/4/2022,20220304,2,4.05,"If you are looking for good food, this is the place. But don't expect good service. Manager ignored errors from staff member that should've been easily corrected as a courtesy. Not a place I will revisit."
4/1/2022,20220401,3,4.04,"I was super excited to come to this restaurant, and when my team suggested we have our end of the season dinner here, I was ecstatic! I love Caribbean and seafood, so win win. The outdoor shelter in front was locked, so naturally, with a fairly large group, we opted for the backyard.  The d√©cor makes you think of a Caribbean fisheribbon fish shack with its size and d√©cor. The cashier was friendly and all the other employees were busy preparing food in the open air kitchen. I found it pretty odd that I didn't smell food. Initially was going to try the fish-and-chips, in retrospect that my that might have been a pretty decent choice. But as it was a celebration of sorts I wanted something more exciting.Since everybody in my group ordered a similar dish (grain bowls) I went for something completely different than theirs, the crab & shrimp boil bag with Lolo Sauce, and a signature punch. I ended up having to come back inside to get my drink because apparently, you take your drinks upon ordering from a window in the hallway as you go to your table. From there, all hell broke loose. The sorrel based punch was a syrupy sweet mess. One sip and it was sitting there for the evening untouched. Food came out sporadically one at a time and no info with them. If you know you have a large group that paid separately, why would you not bring the expo tickets along with the food when delivering it to the table? Since the majority of my party had similar dishes almost everyone's food got mixed up. What annoyed me the most, I had the only dish that was completely different and the big guy who delivered it literally stood there for a few minutes, staring at everyone with the tray belonging to me, no saying a word. Sir. I am not invisible, I am kinda small, but I spoke up, raised my hand and the group pointed to me. Still hesitation. Like Really, guy?I inspected the tray and flipped the bag over, the dijon mustard colored sauce is on the bottom. Hot water cooked seafood tossed atop some sauce. The half a pound of shrimp was 8pc of regular sized peel and eats and about 4 small, snow crab claws. A small potato split in two and a small ear of corn. The sauce tasted NOTHING like the description. I swear it was galangal yellow Thai curry. Not a Caribbean flavor in the pot. I took the crab home and ate the shrimp. I'd lost my appetite. On a positive note, it was cooked properly. My friends eventually enjoyed their bowls and slushies. I will be re-seasoning these leftovers and adding the rest of the ingredients tonight. Maybe it was an off night. Ehhh. That was a long ride home."
4/29/2022,20220429,4,4.04,I stopped in just to grab something for lunch and I must say i enjoyed my the intimate vibe of the place. I like the outdoor seating in the back. If your looking for some peace to yourself and some good food this is the location. I will definitely come back to try some other options on the menu.
6/7/2022,20220607,3,4.04,"Came here with some friends and ordered the dirty rice and the plaintains which were good. The second time I ordered for a delivery and the food arrived hot and well. The only downside I noticed is that the plaintains don't seem to be freshly made everyday it seems based on the texture. I tried keeping some for leftovers the next day to heat up and it was solid as a rock and didn't even soften. This definitely tells you a lot about the food, whether it's frozen and heated up or who knows."
