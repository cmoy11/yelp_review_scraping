12/10/2014,20141210,5,5.0,"This place just opened up in the Hamilton Heights location and I couldn't be happier. I'd just left yoga class and stopped in for a coffee but since it was raining I figured why not sit and stay. The woman at the counter was very friendly and cheery, which on such a dreary day I appreciated. It was mid day so not crowded at all. I ordered an almond latte, which I swear might have been the best almond latte I've ever had and I wouldn't just be saying that, I drink a lot of them. But seriously it was really good! I also got the fruit, granola and yogurt bowl which was pretty standard but the fruit was fresh and the granola was good. Its a cute neighborhood spot and I'll definitely be back."
1/4/2015,20150104,5,5.0,Highly recommend the brunch! The space is warm inviting and the food is so tasty. Our party of four enjoyed all the options including the gluten-free baked goods. Next time we'll come back for the quiche. I loved my Avocado Smash sandwich on delicious grain bread. We heard the liquor license is en route so will come back for more as they continue to grow and fill the niche our neighborhood.
1/4/2015,20150104,5,5.0,"Beautifully decorated, quiet, with a friendly feel. Great New American food with Jamaican touches."
1/10/2015,20150110,2,4.25,"I was really excited for this place to open up in the neighborhood! I live around the corner and was looking forward to not walking to Manhattenville for a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, every time I go there I am disappointed. The coffee is overpriced and its really weak and gross coffee. It tastes like a watered down cup of foldgers., For a small cup of coffee that is about $2.45, the coffee should reflect the price. Unlike the cafe down the street, where the coffee is expensive but it is high quality coffee - this dosent even compare. I am also disappointed that the people who work there are not as friendly or welcoming. The people who seem like the owners are just sitting on sidelines and do not make the effort to make you feel welcomed. The place lacks ambiance and a good vibe... I wont give up on the place (YET) but it needs to improve or its not going to last. Many people in the community feel the same way and I hope they figure out how to make it work and compete with a great shop down the street"
1/13/2015,20150113,1,3.6,"The space is cozy and well-decorated, but the food falls far below expectations. I ordered the avocado, tomato, and egg sandwich, and not only was I surprised by the meager portion, but the price ($8) did not match the quality. Additionally, my girlfriend, whom I love very much, ordered the quiche, which was equally both underwhelming and overpriced ($12). We'd say that The Edge is using its prices to make the food seem like it tastes better and fresher than it actually does."
1/19/2015,20150119,5,3.83,We enjoyed this place a lot. The ambiance was soothing and relaxed and their food was delicious. We had a couple of the Jamaican dishes and they were amazing. The special of the day were Saltfish fritters which were made to perfection. The drinks were also very good and the kids got their hot chocolate kids temperature which they always appreciate. Highly recommended!
1/20/2015,20150120,4,3.86,"My wife and I along with a friend ate here the other day for the first time. This is a new establishment that's part of the initial wave of eateries popping up in the Hamilton Heights/Sugar Hill/Strivers Row area in response to the changing demographic. I say this because it requires, I imagine, some amount of bravery to do this. In any event, the caf√© sits on a quiet corner of Edgecombe Ave. The inside is great- the detailing is attractive and the owners make good use of the space by separating a dining area from a coffee bar area, which provides a sense of energy and community.The brunch menu has a mix of offerings, all of which err on the side of healthy. Our friend had an open-faced egg sandwich which looked pretty appetizing. My wife had a veggie burger and I had a curried chicken sandwich. These were tasty. We'll certainly come back again.  It is nice having a neighborhood restaurant, and therein lies the real charm. The people who came and ate all seemed like they were from the neighborhood. Can't get any better than that, really."
1/20/2015,20150120,5,4.0,"Great food. Excellent service. I had the Ackee and salt fish. Trust me, I am Jamaican and it was wonderfully seasoned! I will be a regular!"
1/21/2015,20150121,5,4.11,"I have stopped into The Edge a couple of times since the Fall for coffee and for lunch. The cappuccinos have been delicious -- strong and creamy -- the Jerk Caesar for lunch was very tasty...and the chocolate chip cookies for dessert were the perfect touch. The hook for this place, though, is the ambiance and decor: it is so warm and inviting. The owner is a natural hostess (as well as the chef) and her easy manner and warm welcome make you feel very much at home. What a great addition to the neighborhood! Looking forward to enjoying dinner here soon."
1/29/2015,20150129,5,4.2,The Edge is now open later (til 9-10pm) and serving beer & wine as well as small plates of an upcoming dinner service! Nice selections and Im sure it will continue to flourish as its brand new but has made a wonderful addition to our neighborhood. The owners are around to greet and make sure you're enjoying your experience. Head over and check out Harlem's newest restaurant.
1/30/2015,20150130,3,4.09,"We came here for brunch. The restaurant is rather small, so it fills quickly. Despite a full house we had prompt service and friendly service. The food was pretty good. I had the fish and chips. the fish was battered with what reminded me of a coconut shrimp batter. The fries were also good. I would like to return to see what the dinner menu is like."
2/6/2015,20150206,4,4.08,"Recently opened for dinner in addition to daytime. We had mini sliders, fries and the daily salmon special . All was pretty good as was the service. The interior is laidback. House wine at a reasonable price. I like that at this initial stage they are not trying to make so many menu options that they don't get anything right.i hope this flourishes and remains a well priced option you can head to on many a night."
2/9/2015,20150209,4,4.08,This is my third time to the edge and I tried the fried chicken and lemon rosemary waffles...the rum butter and apple syrup were a flavorful touch. I have never tried the coffee but have yet to leave this restaurant without a full glass of their homemade sorrel.
2/10/2015,20150210,5,4.14,"I LOVE this place, and I love the owners, and the beautiful French girl that manages the place. Did I mention that I love this place?It helps that it is a minority-owned business in a sea of newly gentrified establishments that care little about old inhabitants. Just saying. GREAT food and a cozy environment. If you live in the neighborhood, you need to run to this place. TODAY."
2/15/2015,20150215,5,4.2,Great addition to the neighborhood! Swell comfy decor and interesting Menu . Staff was very nice and accommodating. Went for dinner but can't wait to try out other meals there too!
3/5/2015,20150305,5,4.25,"This place is so good! Their beef sliders are THE BEST sliders I've ever had. They just melt in your mouth. I've also had their Jerk Chicken caesar salad. The chicken was so full of flavor. The portions are not huge but they make up for it in quality.The management is very friendly and so is the staff! And the atmosphere is great! My only complaint is that they don't open until 11am on the weekend. There have been so many times where I've been craving a cappuccino on Sunday morning but they aren't open yet. Other than that, perfect! I'm so happy to have this place just a short walk away!"
3/9/2015,20150309,5,4.29,"Stopped in here for a cup of coffee before a dance audition yesterday. The place is super cute, and though I can't speak for the food everything looked delicious. The staff were super friendly, and they gave me my coffee on the house as a good luck wish for my audition. I got into the company, so it worked! The decor and ambience are great, and they have an awesome happy hour so I will definitely be back soon!"
3/11/2015,20150311,3,4.22,"I want to like this place a lot, I really do. I just want them to work out the kinks a bit, so I may give them another month or two then come back and check it out. I've been there three times so far, though one time I had to leave because they weren't serving food that early yet. I ordered the same thing both times: eggs over easy with a side of kale and plantains. The first time the eggs came sunny side up and the kale was charred. It didn't taste bad, just kind of crispy and charred. Second time I went, the eggs were good, the kale was sauteed but completely different than before and over all it was a good dish. However, it took me about 35 minutes to get my food. Overall I think they are trying to get their bearings, but I am very happy they're in the neighborhood and I hope they get better so I can try them again."
3/14/2015,20150314,5,4.26,Hubby and I decided to try this place out for brunch. The vegi burger with curry mayo was juicy and yummy. The fish and chips was great. Definitely will be back.
3/17/2015,20150317,4,4.25,"Not too long ago, I got the veggie burger from The Edge and WOW! This was probably the best veggie burger I've ever had. It is a black bean burger which makes it more amazing and comes w a side of plantains and a salad. It is unfortunately only for lunch but still amazing. Super good. I'm super happy !"
3/23/2015,20150323,5,4.29,"I live near this new restaurant and the first time that I ate here, they did not have electricity, but I had a veggie quiche and I could not wait to have another. Unfortunately, it took me about two months to go back and it will not take me that long again, in fact, I am still craving my brunch from earlier today. I ordered the ackee and salt fish with festival and spinach; delicious!!! I was completely surprised how good the ackee and salt fish is, it wasn't oily like most are, and the festival, almost as good as the festival on Hellshire Beach in Jamaica- just much smaller. This will be my new spot and the good thing is, I can call up and run across the street to pick up my foot.I am so happy that they are there. If you are a foodie like me, you will love this place and if you love traditional Jamaican food, this place is a MUST!!!"
3/26/2015,20150326,5,4.32,"I love this place! What a great addition to the neighborhood! Good food, drinks and coffee. It has such a great atmosphere and the staff is awesome"
3/29/2015,20150329,5,4.35,"In all honesty, I didnt know where to begin raving about this place. But most importantly, I really dont want anyone else to know why this place is so great and make it more difficult to find an open table for myself & company.The food was a delicious assortment of flavors that danced on your tongue. Even th√© simplicity of a plain bagel was highlighted by that wonderful berry jam. A grilled cheese was a non-greasy, ooey-gooey cheesy delight as was th√© ultimate burger which was filling, yet, light. I promise you I merely sampled these dishes while enjoying th√© life out of th√© ackee and saltfish. I wont even steal your pleasure by describing it: just GO for it. This is not th√© place to park with your laptop. This is th√© place to enjoy great portions of amazing food and have a conversation. They do serve beer and wine but taste th√© food before muddying your palate with alcohol. You will not regret it. Service is attentive and pleasant. Quality is key and I hope it stays that way."
3/30/2015,20150330,4,4.33,This hidden gem down Edgecombe Avenue is some of the best food I have tasted in the Harlem neighborhood! The location however is not ideal because unless you were standing right out front there is no sign outside or bright lights to indicate there is even a restaurant out there. The first time I went during brunch hours. despite tables filled it still remained rather quiet which was nice. I had the Ackee & Saltfish and a side of plantains which was absolutely delicious! It came as a scramble with a side of sauteed kale. It was super flavorful and nothing like I have ever had before.  The corn bread fritters also delicious once I brought a side of coconut oil to dip them in. The chai latte I order was also awesome and I appreciated they offered the option of almond milk instead of dairy since besides fish I practice a vegan diet.  I returned back in the evening another night hoping to order something similar however turns out the dinner menu is quite small and the only non-meat/no dairy item on the menu was the fish and chips which although fried was tasty.  The side side could use an upgrade with a more flavorful dressing and vegetables however. I give this place four stars for two reasons: 1. The staff each time I have come in seemed absolutely miserable and not super attentive almost disappointed to have me as a customer it seemed.  Perhaps because I was dining alone and not drinking alcohol.  2.  I do wish the place allowed wifi throughout the day because I wanted to do some work while dining there in the late afternoon/early evening. 3. The menu although delicious - is still fairly limited and more so during dinner hours. It would be nice to see more veggie/dairy free/gluten free friendly options like salad with the fish and non deep fried options for the health savvy clientele. Also I think it would be worth mentioning to expand the daytime menu to include perhaps smoothies/shakes/veggie juices.
4/11/2015,20150411,4,4.32,Great local spot! The food is fresh and amazing coffee. Energy is good. I enjoy coming with friends or to sit and people watch. They could improve on the services. One person working on the weekends isn't a good idea.
4/12/2015,20150412,5,4.35,"I LOVE this place! It has quality coffee and the staff is super nice. I love all the coffee shops in this neighborhood now! By all the business they all get, more can come! The ambiance is nice, although I haven't tried their food, I hear it's really good. I'm so glad they are here!"
4/18/2015,20150418,5,4.37,"We just rocked out with brunch. OMG, I loved the Ackee and Saltfish....served with festival (aka Johnny Cakes) and sauteed kale. And do not skip a Hibiscus Mimosa, made presumably with the delicious house Sorrel, which was also perfect on it's own, it was luscious and refreshing. Also the coffee was smooth and rich, and helped me ease into the beautiful sunny day.Great service, great ambiance, and amazing food, all attracted a diverse and cheerful crowd. I'd say this is my new favorite neighborhood brunch. We'll be back, and if you have not been yet, you need to check it out!"
4/23/2015,20150423,1,4.25,"Arrived at 10:15pm for late snack after confirming they were open until 11. Live down the block and meaning to try this place. after standing around the host said ""kitchen closed""Really! Good luck growing your business."
4/24/2015,20150424,5,4.28,This is my 2nd time here and it won't be my last...wonderful place great for a date or chat. Music is not too loud... The ambiance is very nice relaxing. Lay back type of feel...great staff...Amazing chef
4/24/2015,20150424,5,4.3,My gratuitous gratitude to the chef for definitely making the best dish of fish and chips ever tasted by me. The freshly made tartar sauce was a treat since I don't typically like tartar sauce. The cucumber water was very refreshing to my surprise and not an overpowering taste. The ambiance is a great place for either a date or even a little get together of friends. The service was very on par. I could go on for hours but I will next visit. Please check this place out and support. Peace and Love
4/26/2015,20150426,5,4.32,"Impeccable service, great food, and a cozy environment are exactly what you'll find at The Edge. I had the curry chicken sandwich with salad & plantains ($13) and a latte ($4). The curry chicken is their take on the traditional chicken salad sandwich but instead is a blend of chicken, curry, raisins, and I believe celery. It was delicious and went really nicely with the plantains and vinaigrette on the salad.The staff was awesome! They constantly checked in and I think I waited all of 5 minutes to receive my food. I highly recommend giving this place a try, (for me) it is a welcome alternative to the bustling environment of other restaurants in the neighborhood."
5/6/2015,20150506,2,4.25,Two stars only because the server is a really nice young man. Food: YUCK. Sitting in the restaurant eating as I'm writing this. The food is not good. It's the second time I eat at this establishment and I didn't want to write them off from the first experience. Second time around and not good once again. Shrimps and grits with runny eggs. Not good. Curry chicken sandwich is actually served salad style. Not good. Mango mimosa is good. That's about the only item I would come back for.
5/10/2015,20150510,5,4.27,"Mother's Day brunch at the Edge was wonderful. Great food and great staff, we were late for our reservation, the staff made us comfortable until a table opened up. The Crab Cake were delicious, I also sampled the waffles which were equally as good. Visiting my son, daughter-in-law and grandson from Seattle. I had a memorable Mother's Day, thank you Edge."
5/14/2015,20150514,4,4.26,"Ackee and Salt fish as a tad bit salty but nothing horrible, it was still yummy. Festival bread was great, also really good mimosas. Going back for sure!"

5/20/2015,20150520,5,4.28,"So glad THE EDGE opened in our neighborhood, it has a really nice ambiance and I like their food (I have had the curry chicken sandwich, and the avocado mash on bread) and service. I love the house made Sorrel they have, fresh and spicy"

5/24/2015,20150524,4,4.29,"It is nice to discover restaurants that don't take themselves too seriously. The Edge is just that. Its ambiance and energy are welcoming, and the wait staff is nice and accommodating. I love that there isn't wifi so when you walk in, people are livelihood in conversation. For the energy of the place, I give this a 4.5. We had coffees at the bar, a flat white and a cortado, quality coffee without the entitled energy of gentrifying folks up at Manhattanville Coffee. Then,we had the salt fish and ackee, which I would give a 3.5 because I found the fish a bit dry and still think my mom's version is better. The festival was on point, and as a kale lover, I enjoyed the addition of the kale. I'd come back again. The burgers looked good!"

Coffee great, too."

6/16/2015,20150616,4,4.3,"Had dinner here last night with the fianc√©e because she was in the mood for Jamaican food. The windows were wide open so there was a nice breeze. I almost got the impression that it's more of a coffee bar during the day but they had a full dinner menu with a lot of daily specials. The salmon, coconut rice, and saut√©ed spinach were perfectly cooked, the Jerk Chicken Caesar salad was excellent and the fried cod fish fritters were fantastic. Someone at the neighboring table had the spicy mussels (they smelled amazing) and the fries looked great. While the menu may be somewhat Jamaican influenced, there menu is much more diverse meaning we'll go back soon. All I can say is that the food was very good, the ambiance very pleasant, and the service was impeccable. The waiter actually ran down the street to give me my credit card that I had accidentally left behind. Oh and it's a great place for a date - if only I were still dating."

6/21/2015,20150621,4,4.28,"We went back for dinner for the sliders, fish and chips, and the shrimp dish. They were all so good! The sliders had a wonderful house sauce and were so delicious, and the fish and chips were fried and seasoned to perfection. The hint of the coconut in the fish matter brought me back to the Caribbean. In fact, they were the best fish and chips I've had. It was a lovely marriage of Jamaica and England. The shrimp dish was great too. I just wish they were caramelized a bit more. For dessert, we had the brownie. It wasn't the best brownie I've had, and some parts tasted like flour. Overall, regardless of some areas of growth needed, the flavors are great; the ambiance is spot-on and welcoming. Yep, this is definitely my neighborhood spot."

We completed our meal with out any check up. I would have been on my 4th glass of whine if they actually had more than one server to come and assist us. When they did come they came with the check and never asked us about desert. The check was just brought. Actually as I write this review the server is cleaning up around me. The only positive was the decor. Unfortunately would not come back. Customer service needs work."

Came here on Saturday night had the sliders and Mac and cheese. sliders were decent, nothing to exciting. Mac and cheese was cheesy . Service: waiter was very attentive and helpful"
6/28/2015,20150628,4,4.18,Great little brunch spot hidden in Harlem. I opted to get the egg sandwich on toast with tomato and avocado and it was absolutely delicious. It was served with a side of mixed greens so it was the perfect combination. My friend has the jerk chicken with waffles and the chicken was seasoned just right. We're both definitely going back again.

The seafood pasta special was not worth the $21, until I peppered and salted it. The cauliflower was awesome though. Thumbs up. Happy hour until 8 pm. $4 wine."

We had three different dishes during brunch: shrimp & grits, ultimate edge burger, and fish & chips. All of the dishes were excellent, but they could have been a little hotter when they came out. Yet still, the taste of the dishes overpowered any issues with heat. I will definitely come back during dinner!"
7/8/2015,20150708,5,4.14,"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch last week and it was fantastic! There have been so many spots popping up in the neighborhood but so many of them are trying to hard if you know what I mean; The Edge hit the nail on the head with their compact and delicious brunch menu. We had the burger - it was cooked medium rare and done perfectly as was the fried egg on top and we had the curried chicken sandwich, which is something I would rarely order but it was DELICIOUS. So yummy and it comes with plantains and a salad. Great food, great atmosphere, great prices - we will definitely be coming back! Can't wait to try their dinner menu"
7/21/2015,20150721,2,4.11,"Did not enjoy at all... The d√©cor and vibe of the place is nice nestled on Edgecomb ave in Harlem. I was excited for this place but everything was just lacking. I had the jerk chicken and waffles the jerk chicken was dry and the waffles was cold. the waffles reminded me of leggo my eggos I sent the waffles back to be reheated then eventually said forget it because I was so hungry. My friend got the shrimp and grits this was actually good but the shrimp is small for the price. we also tried the sides which was festival, plantains and I don't recall the other thing but the festival and plantains was good. the happy hour is only 2 dollars off the regular price that's a coupon not happy hour.... They only sell wine and beer... I don't know what else to say my friend recommended this place for brunch and I heard the menu is different for weekend brunch so maybe I went on a off day... It was Thursday at 5:00"
7/22/2015,20150722,5,4.12,"We absolutely love The Edge, it's a much needed addition to the neighborhood. Not only do we pop in regularly for coffee since we are just around the corner, but we come back again and again for lunch and dinner because the food is great. The lunch menu suits all appetites with an amazing burger with fries, as well as a wonderful curry chicken salad sandwich with plantains, plus many brunch menu items. Dinner consists of small plates, like the beer battered fish and chips which are light and not at all greasy, sliders, a grilled cheese, plus daily specials of salads and entrees. Every meal we've had here has been exactly what we wanted and the price points are just right. When we come with our children, the servers make sure to have their food come out as quickly as possible,which we greatly appreciate. An added plus is the cozy environment when we are without the kids and the super friendly staff."
8/5/2015,20150805,3,4.1,"I'm happy to see another nice dining establishment open up in the neighborhood. During the day it has more of a cafe feel, and at night it feels like a restaurant. The interior is beautiful, and warm. The staff are friendly and I enjoy the concept. The food, however, was just ok. I tried a number of items off the menu, but nothing really left me impressed. I do enjoy it as a coffee shop though, and will often stop in during the week days for coffee and wifi."
8/8/2015,20150808,5,4.12,"I came here April 17,2015, the atmosphere is really edgy and comfy and it fits right into the NYC life. The waiter I had was extremely awesome, very helpful and spoke very clear. I had a homemade sorrel which was great, scrambled eggs with shrimp and grits, also very good and filling. I would definitely come back here!"
8/13/2015,20150813,1,4.07,"I was very excited to go to The Edge since I live very near--not even a block away. I thought it would be a nice place to have brunch and meet friends. A friend, who is a producer for a major cable network, and I decided to meet there for lunch one day and we were very disappointed. As I waited for my friend I was totally ignored. When my friend arrived we were directed to a table and the server--not friendly--brought us water. However, it appeared that to him we were invisible. We were not treated well. It didn't feel comfortable. I enjoy dining out and do it a lot, and I'm excited to see all the new restaurants popping up in the Harlem in which I have lived for 50 years however, I will not spend my money at a place where I am not treated well. We left! Instead we went up the street to another new restaurant on 139th and Seventh Ave. (Adam Clayton Powell Blvd.) We were treated courteously there and the food was good. Perhaps The Edge is catering to the New Harlemites. Pity!!!"
8/14/2015,20150814,4,4.06,"Fancy quiet quaint little Corner place we had brunch today. Low dim lighting, brick walls dark green floors.Ordered the smoked salmon on top of sesame bagel and he ordered the burger medium rare for lunch. The French fries were the crispiest I've ever had, I think it was dipped in batter prior to frying. Casual dress. Quiet and intimate ambiance."
8/14/2015,20150814,4,4.06,This place has a great ambiance. They play slow contemporary music similar to jazz while you dine. I had the edge burger which was cooked the way I liked (medium rare). The French fries were delicious! They had a good crunch and weren't over fried. The edge is a great hole in the wall (corner) restaurant for a good and delicious brunch.
8/16/2015,20150816,4,4.06,"Today was my second time at The Edge. The first time I went for lunch and both my dad and I got the Curry Chicken Sandwich which I was looking forward to. Unfortunately I was disappointed, it is truly a Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich and I hate chicken salad sandwiches, I thought it would be a curry chicken breast on a bun. My mom had the veggie burger and she was it was great, the festival is also really good. Today my husband and I went for brunch and my husband got the ackee and saltfish and he said it was good. I got the Jerk Chicken Ceasar salad and it was good as well. Today there was about a 10min wait and I loved that the waiter gave us menus in advanced and even took our food order while still waiting for a seat to expedite the process. One downfall is they don't have high-chairs, both times I came with my daughter who is 15 months and its a bit challenging holding her while trying to eat. The ambiance is great and service was good."
8/18/2015,20150818,5,4.08,"Stopped by with my son for lunch on a Tuesday at 1:30. Beautiful and cozy ambiance, not too loud, not too quiet. Got a table right away. Ordered the fish and chips which was cooked perfectly and generously portioned, not to mention absolutely delicious. Wasn't expecting it to be coconut-crusted but good thing I like coconut. Service wasn't fast but they don't seem to encourage rushing in this place which is fine by me. Only drawback is I was never offered a high chair for my son who is 8 months old. I'll be back."
8/24/2015,20150824,5,4.09,"Wow. Just wow. I longed for a restaurant like this uptown. A quiet spot where the breeze can casually meander through as I stare at sunshine and trees...a place where the music, the service, and THE FOOD all align to provide the most exquisite dining experience. It was so cozy, and the owner, Juliet, was such a gem too! If I wasn't pressed for time, I would write a solid 2500 words on why you need to go here...instead, I'll leave it at that. You must check this place out."
8/26/2015,20150826,5,4.1,"Tucked away on a quiet corner off of St. Nicholas...this is THE SPOT! Great, easy mixed British,Jamaican, French menu...edited down to crowd pleasing, comfort cuisine. Every visit has been met by the smiling, earnest faces of the owners, staff and random family members dropping by to help out. The crowd reflects the area, with a Pretty, healthy mix of young professionals, students and loving locals. ARTIST heavy!!! Love That.Take the C up to 135th and walk up for the Experience. If nothing else, do like I did on my first pass - get a Homemade SORREL and Pain o'Chocolate, while listening to FAT FREDDY's DROP and Waxing Philisophical a Francais with the staff!!! J'adore!!!PEACE"
8/29/2015,20150829,5,4.12,"As a person of Jamaican heritage (and as a foodie), it's a real comfort to have the Edge relatively nearby. The ambiance feels like a tribute to Jamaica, Eastern and Southern London, and to Harlem as well. It's run with love and nuff vibes--the subtle, comfortable-in-your-skin vibes, and not Sizzla-chanting-down-Babylon-at-the-top-of-his-vocal-register (though I do love that, too.) This place is all fish-tea-in-Trelawny, if you catch my drift...easy Jamaica, easy Hackney, remote City College Location...the vibe speaks for itself, rather immediately. It's perfect. It also helps that the Edge is currently offering the best brunch in Harlem, if not in the entire city. I LOVE brunch, and would not pass out such an endorsement lightly. However, after eating here this morning, after several other occasions (this time with my judgmental 4th grader son who adored his Edge burger and fries), I was able to confirm that the reason why I always look forward to coming back even before I've left is because the Edge is amazing. The fish and chips are heavy, but delicious. The ackee and saltfish appear to be disappointingly sized, at first, but the sauteed kale is hearty, crispy and delicious, the ackee and saltfish is correct, and the festival keeps you from being able to clean your plate. The chai latte is smooth and you don't need to add sugar. The sorrel is fresh and flavorful (if it were up to me, there would be more cloves and ginger inside, but this is a matter of my own personal preference). The burger is massive and drenched in melted cheese. The fries defy description...you have to try them for yourself.I should have written this review long ago, but I'm selfish and didn't want anyone to know about the Edge aside from myself and my husband and kid. But in the words of the kid, ""it's really busy in here, Mom!"" As it should be. Dear the Edge, may you never lose yours."
8/29/2015,20150829,4,4.12,"From the cozy atmosphere to the essence water served with meals, attention to detail brings me utter delight when I visit this lovely little restaurant. As a new establishment, the menus for brunch and dinner have captured the hearts and tummies of the area and hopefully will do so for many decades to come. From starters to specials, to mains, to dessert, this place has me coming back again and again - dishes are healthy versions of island classics, with something for everyone (including vegetarian/vegan options, quality wine and spirit selections, freshly made juices, and exciting, seasonal specials).My menu favorites include the jerk chicken sandwich (on whole grain toast, YUM) brunch, served with the best savory plantains I have ever had. The beef sliders are nothing short of small juicy visits to meat-lover heaven: these are the stars of the dinner menu. There is the pleasure of the side salad, another example of this restaurant's fine example of attention to detail...the field greens are always fresh and tossed with the lightest, tastiest dressing I've tasted away from my own home. The Edge is part of Harlem's new renaissance... I look forward to seeing you there!"
9/1/2015,20150901,5,4.13,Most relaxing place ever with great food tasty drinks and good music definitely a place everyone should go to.
9/15/2015,20150915,5,4.14,Excellent food excellent service I will def be returning! I had the codfish fritters and salmon burger. Both were great.
9/15/2015,20150915,1,4.1,"Not only is the food not very flavorful (I have had the hanger steak, the seafood pasta, the seared snapper, and the Fish and Chips), but one of the waiters (the one waiter?) is extremely rude. I have tolerated the Edge four times in the past because it is frankly across the street from where my best friend lives, but I will no longer be coming back. I echo the overall lackluster reputation by other reviewers."
9/27/2015,20150927,4,4.1,"This place is awesome! The staff is uber attentive and helpful. I love to get a bottle of wine. The menu change daily, so check the chalkboard. Appetizers such as sliders and fries are a staple."
9/30/2015,20150930,4,4.09,"Who: me, myself and IWhat: Black Velvet (drink) fritters (app) salmon burger, chocolate bread puddingWhen: dinnertime/ happy hour Where: 2 top/1/2 booth Why: Black Owned Restaurant Month How: public transportation (B/C Train to 135th, 5 minute walk from there)Bathroom: roomy (wheelchair accessible) clean & fresh smelling with chamomile & lavender hand soap to bootI enjoyed the drink, but wouldn't get it again (stout & champagne). Skip the fritters. The salmon burger was veeeeery tender & lightly, but well, seasoned, not a fan of bread pudding, something about the texture drives me nuts. But it wasn't the worst. I liked the whipped cream (it tastes fresh). Service: so-so the busboy was more attentive than the server. Appropriate wait time between courses, about 5 minutes.Bottom line: I would go again, but likely for brunch, not dinner."
10/10/2015,20151010,5,4.11,"Fabulous fresh food! An incredible find in a cozy, cafe with the feel of your most fashionable friend's living room. Had the eggs Benedict this morning with smoked salmon - divine!! Don't miss a chance to stop in."
10/18/2015,20151018,4,4.11,"Fun place, great location, interesting and varied menu, good happy hour, nice decor, great staff. I'll be back."
10/19/2015,20151019,5,4.12,"Loved this place! Went for Sunday brunch with my husband and another couple. We had the shrimp with grits and the ultimate edge burger. The grits were amazing and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The burger was great as well, but overcooked and not the medium rare we ordered. The decor was really nice and relaxing. I'm so excited to have this spot a short walk away in the neighborhood."
10/21/2015,20151021,5,4.13,"Everything about our experience at the Edge was great! The restaurant is cozy, the service was super friendly, and the food was delicious. The sangria was excellent - nice and strong! The dinner menu has lots of small plates, and all the (full sized) entrees are specials written on the chalk board. So perhaps the entrees change often? We had the spicy shrimp small plate, which was full of flavor, and paired quite well with the sangria. We got the hangar steak entree and the curry coconut chicken entree. The steak was SO tender! And with such a great flavor. The chicken was nice and coconutty and equally delicious.I would highly recommend this restaurant, and we will definitely be back again!"
10/25/2015,20151025,4,4.13,"I have been to The Edge twice and enjoyed the brunch selections. The food is solid. The service was great both times. I love the international choices and the coffee selection in addition to the brunch beverages. The only reason they are missing a star is because the eggs were over cooked and the jerk chicken was OK. I do appreciate the chicken breast cutlet with waffles because I am a white meat person. However, jerk chicken (or any stewed chicken) dish requires dark meat's flavor (and bones). This may be the best brunch spot in all of Harlem."
10/26/2015,20151026,3,4.11,"The food is above average and the ambiance is also. I have been recommending it to friends and have had some pretty big diva dinners there. I am such the cynical new yorker though because I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop and it did...finally.  imagine my surprise when I go there tonight for a working supper and am told that I can't use my tablet during supper. I received this real clear explenation from the owner that her vision for for her place wasn't designed for people who work through their meal. I get it, I really do which is why I write from a table at la nomade. Yummy and caters to working stiffs like me :)"
11/11/2015,20151111,5,4.12,"Went for brunch with two friends.We had the granola, jerk chicken, eggs Benedict and the shrimps & grits.The food was excellent and in the right quantities.The atmosphere is very chilled and pleasant, with nice music.The price was very reasonable given the quality of the meal.10/10 would do again."
11/14/2015,20151114,2,4.1,"Food is decent at reasonable prices, really cute interior. It's a place I've been to several times as it's really the only (non-chain) place to grab a bite or a drink right in my neighborhood, besides Manhattanville, which is more of a coffee shop that serves beer. But there are some problems. The Edge: WHY WON'T YOU LET ME LOVE YOU!?My qualm here is with the really inconsistent service. The three times I've eaten here, I felt like I was more on a quest for the holy grail (ie: a waiter/waitress) than in a restaurant. Each time, after we were seated, we were woefully abandoned. 10 minutes for water, 15 minutes for a menu, 20 minutes to have our order taken. The fourth time I went, I literally requested that both my drink and my receipt be delivered at the same time, so that we could drink leisurely and leave when we wanted, instead of having the frustration of waiting around for service. The service issue, which I will describe using the scientific term ""crazy pants,"" is so strange because it's not that large of a place, nor has it ever been particularly busy when I've been in there. Huh.I will say that a few weeks ago, I went to grab a beer with friends, and a guy who I might assume is the manager served us quickly, paid a lot of attention to us, and was generally super pleasant and kind. If only he had been my server the other four times. In short, an improvement of service would guarantee my business as a regular. And as the Edge serves alcohol, staying open past 11pm would be just groovy, too."
11/17/2015,20151117,5,4.11,"I've been meaning to come here for months. I came for brunch on Sunday and my food was great. The staff was excellent. Be sure to try the rum punch, it's super tasty and strong."
11/20/2015,20151120,2,4.08,"Shucks, really want to give a better review, BUT, I'm sitting here paying for my meal of which one was EXCELLENT (shrimp n cheesy grits with scrambled egg) The other (curry chicken ""special"" with coconut rice)After an incredible shrimp n grits, I take my first bite into the days special chicken curry and hold back from spitting it right outThe one bite left a sour, off chicken taste in my mouth that is leading me to write this review.Terrible!! Did the chef not taste before plating ??Damn!!! We were patient too, that chicken meal has us waiting for 32min during brunchThere was also like 5 people at the time or order in the restaurant Server didn't bother to ask for refill, nor pay attention to us as customer Greater service could've made that terrible meal just a tad better replacement Thanks to the bartender who made sure that meal was taken off our bill, or else all hell would break loose Bottom line, excellent shrimp and grits meal (my review could easily be a 4 star) (better service would have scored the 5But if there was a below-zero star, the curry chicken would claim it, fast#SuperBummed"
11/22/2015,20151122,5,4.09,"Great healthy food, fun and chill atmosphere. I will definitely go back."
11/28/2015,20151128,4,4.09,"Great place to go for brunch in HarlemFriendly service, good foodThe menu is sparse, which always disappoints me, but then I always leave satisfied, so I guess no complaints?Great coffee, legitimate espressoCool vibeA little pricey, honestlyWish they opened earlier on weekends!"
12/1/2015,20151201,2,4.07,"The food is good. Service not. My mother and I were recommended this restaurant by her best friend, who lives near by. I always get the veggie burger. For my birthday my mother and I were going to eat there-but we couldn't due to traffic. We called and did carry out. After my family drove me home so I can eat my dinner. To my surprise I was given a beef burger. I was upset. My family had left back to Harlem and here I am in Washington Heights. I was looking forward to my burger and I do not eat meat. I called and spoke to a CoCo. She was very dry and seemed to not of cared. That made me upset. I would of thought she would provide a solution and would of seemed happy to change THEIR error. That's a pretty huge mess up. On top of that the container said veggie but the party was beef . I came in the following day to return the burger and to purchase another burger for my brother to try. I am glad she comped me on my veggie burger. However, it would of been nice for her to of ""said sorry, here's what we can do.."" Sad to say I will not be going back. I love supporting The Pan African businesses emerging in Harlem. But I will not be accept customer service that seems brash. She did not even smile. That's tacky. Business etiquette is needed for their servers/waiters. A few months back I watched a customer tell who I believe is the manager that she was waiting and was not happy with her service. The manager was apologetic and polite. She even offered to comp her meal and gave a free mimosa. I assumed I would of received the same energy and sincereness. I did not. I do not believe the company would care if I come back or not and that's fine. But I know this review will speak in volumes to others."
12/2/2015,20151202,5,4.08,This place has become a go to for my partner and I. The food and atmosphere is warm and inviting. It's conveniently close for us. It's a sweet treat in Harlem.
12/5/2015,20151205,4,4.08,"I've been here a few times now for brunch and dinner. Their food is always consistent and their servers are always earnest. It's nice to go into a place and know what to expect. Some favorites: Shrimp and Grits, Ackee and Saltfish with Festival, Curry Shrimp and Rice, Steak.Portions may seem small when they come out, but the quality is there and as you get to the end of your meal you realize that it is the perfect amount of food. A nice laid back place for weekend brunch or easy date nights."
12/7/2015,20151207,5,4.09,"I come here quite often both for lunch and dinner and each time I have a great time ! The service is good, and the food is just delicious.The curry chicken with coconut rice is one of my favorite, as well as the veggie burger with French fries and the mini crab cakes."
12/11/2015,20151211,5,4.1,"This gem is a neighborhood retreat for a comfortable and relaxed dining experience where chances are you'll see familiar faces. It lends itself to the eager locals looking for friendly staff, delicious and inventive foods and the perfect ambiance. I've brought family and friends to The Edge; I'm a usual myself. Great as a cafe as well. I most commonly am on the go so a coffee and almond croissant is my go to. Highly recommended wait staff knows me by name. Always feel welcomed to spark up conversation and I've come to treat the Edge team as friends. A+"
12/15/2015,20151215,3,4.09,"The food was only okay for the price (brunch dishes came out a little cold, and were not seasoned particularly well), but the space is cool, and this type of spot is definitely welcome in the neighborhood. Service was friendly though!"
12/20/2015,20151220,5,4.1,They never disappoint! We eat here at least 4-5 times a month. The Ultimate Edge Burger is always fresh and the employees are always on point. Look forward to going there all the time.

Breading + bun + fries is carb-heavy, but glad to have the refreshing mixed greens & tomato._ VEGGIE BURGER ($12) black bean patty w/curry mayo, dressed mixed greens, tomato & onions, plantains, and caramelized onion spread on brioche bun. = tasty!_ COCONUT RICE ($5) w/sweet toasted coconut flakes = so tasty!Would return, especially to try their Curry Chicken (alone or in the Mezze starter), enjoy more Coconut Rice, and listen to some live music!"

I was so happy when I called the restaurant and someone answered and said they were open until 5! #Score I brought out the sled dogs and Canda Goose jacket and made the treacherous trek there. It was so well worth it! I got the Ackee and Saltfish with a side of jerk chicken. It was so yummy!!! The staff were super friendly and upbeat given they had to work during Winter Storm Jonas. It was an amazing experience and I will definitely return.

2/6/2016,20160206,4,4.1,Great place to visit. I love that it's low-key and the food is very good. The rum punch is amazing. Juliet the owner is very nice and professional. I wish she was their at The Edge all the time. The only thing I don't care for is the dude behind the bar. He isn't the nicest and always seems to be in a not so good mood when I visit. My best friend and I went yesterday at 3:30 and wanted something that wasn't on the brunch menu and he told the waiter that was serving us no they can't do that. The waiter was very apologetic and said he was sorry. I didn't think that was very nice especially if I'm willing to pay for what I want. Oh and not everyone eats brunch until 5pm on a Friday after work. Otherwise The Edge is a very cute place and great food just don't ask the guy behind the bar to much of anything.
2/6/2016,20160206,3,4.09,Went on a Saturday night. The food was good but not great. I had sauteed shrimp with rice and BF had fish special. I i really liked the ambiance and decor. Would go back for drinks and maybe try their weekend brunch one day.

Searching for another local favorite and my girlfriend having enjoyed a lunch there previously we've spent the last three weeks enjoying The Edge. What a sublime replacement! We don't know who their chef is but he puts out superb specials every Friday night. Over the past two we've enjoyed delicious tuna steaks, Bronzino, and a delightful surf and turf of sirloin and shrimp. All dishes are perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Their salads are delightfully fresh with wonderful flavor profiles. Manager Kosta and Massimo of Umbria (Italy) offer excellent service and The Edge easily became our new favorite restaurant! We recommend it to all!"

We go here as soon as they opened so we had no wait for a table but I could definitely see there being a wait later in the day because the dining room isn't too big but they do have some breakfast bar seating in the middle and in front of one of their windows. We started off with a couple coffees and I ordered a Hibiscus Mimosa which was good and tasted like sorrell in bellini form. Hubby had their ""Rum Punch"" and I use quotes because it didn't taste like the rum punch I grew up drinking. It was good but you expect it to be a certain way. I had the Ackee & Saltfish w/Festival and Saut√©ed Kale in lieu of the Loo (callaloo). It was all seasoned very well but the price doesn't reflect the portion size. Any West Indian who orders this entr√©e will be severely disappointed, considering you can get twice as much in a serving of that price ($17) in a neighborhood hole in the wall and it would be just as authentic and reminiscent of yahd food. Anyhoo, it tasted good,let and the kale was seasoned to taste like callaloo which it did and I finished every bit, mostly because there wasn't that much on the plate to begin with. Hubby had the Waffle with Fresh Fruit and Rum-infused Whipped Cream. I kept stealing his whipped cream for my festival. They tasted great together. All in all, everything was good. I like the vibe of the place and I would definitely go back but I'd probably get the Jerk Chicken and Waffles instead or the Avocado Mash on Toast w/Eggs and Salmon."

2/26/2016,20160226,4,4.12,"After being forced to wake up to attend brunch with some friends we ended up at this small eatery in harlem. At first glance you would say "" oh its small in there"" and once you enter your you will say ""wow it really is small in here"". The menu was rather basic. They broke all the foods down by country regions. I stuck to whst i know which was north america but i could not get that meal off the menu (damn you allergens) so i had to build my brunch menu from scratch. My company said the mimosas were good and also the rum punch was excellent, i stuck to good old fashioned orange juice. Overall it was tasty and i will go back to try some of the other regions they have."

2/27/2016,20160227,5,4.13,"Service was fast and friendly, menu was small and simple!! Absolutely loved this place and its ambiance. When you walk in the place has a limited number of seating and most tables are close in proximity but the closeness added onto the intimate/cozy ambiance. The menu didn't have many choices to choose for dinner as it only consisted of 'small plates' with about 7 ish different choices. There is a specials board that I assume changes on most nights and although I was skeptical because of the small amount of choices, everything our party chose was amazing. I personally went for the curry chicken with coconut rice and I was blown away. It was easily the best curry I've ever had- so if you're debating on what to order, pick that you won't be sorry. Will be back soon!!"
3/8/2016,20160308,4,4.13,I love this place for coffee and a bite to eat. Unlike most area places to grab a coffee this place welcomes conversation and doesn't feel like a library. My only hope is that they expand their menu to offer a bit more seasonal flavor.
3/8/2016,20160308,5,4.13,"A very chill environment with great, kind, friendly people working there & amazing food to boot! I'm so lucky it's near where I live so I can find an excuse not to cook at home & go there instead! I've never a bad meal, never had a bad encounter with someone working there, never had a bad time! Food is always presented beautifully & is incredibly tasty. Price is great too. Check it out! Just make sure to leave a table for me when you go. ;)"
3/10/2016,20160310,5,4.14,"The Edge has good coffee, good food, a great staff and a wonderful atmosphere.The jerk chicken particularly good.This is a special place."
3/11/2016,20160311,5,4.15,Best almond latte around. The Avocado toast is also good with bacon on top.
3/18/2016,20160318,4,4.15,"ah, Harlem! You never disappoint. Loved this little cozy, warm, homey spot. Good food and good service. My friend and I split equal parts of the Jerk Chicken & Waffles and the Shrimp & Parmesan Grits. I could've used a bit more flavor for my taste buds, but it was still good."
3/19/2016,20160319,5,4.15,So full that i can't..... The burger killed me and brought me back to life all in one bite... Its a good day in nyc to live life at the edge
3/23/2016,20160323,4,4.15,"I have been here for brunch and dinner.Ambiance: A little small but cute and simple. During brunch, the wait is usually 15-30 minutes. If you get there by 6:00PM for dinner, it is usually empty. After that, it starts to pick up. Crowd is diverse in age and race.Food and drinks: Brunch:I had their cappuccino and matcha lattes, both quite yummy. My friends had a mimosa and the hibiscus mimosa (which I tried and liked). The only negative thing is that they were each $10...come on, can we get a brunch discount?I have had the crab cakes and it was quite delish. A little spicy but not so much that you can't handle it. The fries here are delicious!Their bean burger is also pretty good as well and their edge burger so juicy.Dinner: For appetizers we had the Mezze plate and it was so fresh and yummy. For dinner, we had the special of the evening, a surf and turf dish. It took a while for the food to come; we thought they went out to the back to kill the cow. With that said, the steak tasted so fresh and the mashed potatoes were delicious. We finished with brownies and bread pudding for dessert, both good, but would have been perfect with a scoop of ice cream instead of whipped cream.They have a special menu every day which they post on their wall, so make sure to check it out.Service: Our hostess and waiter were all super friendly. No complaints here.This place is near my old neighborhood and I will miss it dearly.I highly recommend."
3/23/2016,20160323,5,4.16,Food was great! Jerk chicken salad was fantastic.Had the Porkchop and couscous also. Filling and well seasoned.I'll be back!
3/27/2016,20160327,4,4.16,"I've been to this restaurant twice, and ordered from their daily specials both times. There's not much on their regular menu so you are choosing from a menu that changes from day to day, which I like. The first time I came here we had a cheese board appetizer which was nothing but delicious, but the salmon burger I ordered tasted really, really fishy like it wasn't fresh. My boyfriend convinced me to try this restaurant again a few weeks later and I really liked the food the second time."
4/4/2016,20160404,5,4.17,Cute cozy spot that plays good music and serves Caribbean inspired dishes. I had cod fish fritters that was excellent and salmon with mash potatoes and string beans that was delicious. The owners were very nice and service was fabulous.
4/10/2016,20160410,4,4.16,"First off, id like to state that the manager and employees at this establishment are extremely courteous. I had the scrambled eggs with cheese and waffle, truly delicious. Mango mimosa is definitely worth it. Will be sure to revisit when I return to NY."
4/13/2016,20160413,3,4.16,"Came here before 12noon on a Sunday and the wait wasn't too bad; close to maybe half an hour and that was only because my friend was running late. Otherwise they had a table ready for me when I walked in at 11:30am. The place looks super cozy and chill and can't wait for them to open the windows or sit outdoors once the weather gets better. I had their Sorrel (hibiscus?) iced tea and I really loved it! I ordered their Jerk chicken and Waffles brunch special and I was surprised, okay fine - disappointed - that the jerk chicken was served as chicken cutlets/breasts. Never ever had have I had jerk chicken nor chicken & waffles with breast filets instead of bone-in drumsticks or wings (white meat/dark meat). The spices were significantly good but, I don't know, to me it didn't feel right. I definitely would never order it again unless if they change the way the chicken is served. My friend had the salt fish with ackee and that was pretty good; I might order that again when I go back. Overall the place is nice and has lots of potential, and I'll explore the menu more.I'll be back definitely as I have also been looking to move into the neighborhood."
4/14/2016,20160414,2,4.14,"2.5 stars. Food is decent, albeit; not in any way mind blowing. I had The Edge burger from their brunch menu, which was pretty standard. French fries were tasty and crispy, though. Service was on the slow side; they seemed to be understaffed at the time I visited. Overall meh. My friend works in the area, so he is a regular at this place and he suggested going here."
4/19/2016,20160419,5,4.15,"Great atmosphere, awesome little place right near the university.Sliders are awesome, and their food is always good. Creative specials, good sized apps, I make a point of stopping here when I am in the area. Service is great."
5/28/2016,20160528,3,4.14,"Just moved to the neighborhood and went to brunch with my cousin. The Edge is super cute on the outside so we were excited to try it. The waitress came to get our orders and then we didn't see her again until after we were finished with our food. Even then, we had to ask another server to get us the check because we couldn't flag her down. I would love to try this place again because the food was good, but the service can definitely use some work."
5/28/2016,20160528,5,4.14,"We were in dire need of some brunch grub after a long week, so we decided to head into the edge. We were promptly greeted by who I think was the owner. Decor is very industrial New York with a sweet homey charm to it. If you want to try some American food with a Caribbean twist the edge is the place to go. We ordered the jerk chicken+plantains+salad and the veggie burger w curry mayo. Both of our brunch items were very tasty. We will def be back for dinner."
6/1/2016,20160601,3,4.13,"The ambience is kool, the music is at a nice level and the decor is subtle, modern and pieceful. I must say the service is great, they seated us fairly quickly, the waiter was very attentive and the wait for the food was not extensive.I didn't give this cossi little restaurant / Caff√® a higher rating due to the following; menu is limited, they did not have appetizers or much of a diverse brunch/lunch selection. Their menu changes to dinner after 5pm so you are locked in to whatever they offer on a small laminated piece of paper.The edge bugger is meh, the veggie burger is awesome we loved it so much that my 8yr old daughter wanted much more than the half of my share that she had.I would come back again for dinner to see what else they offer and maybe then my review would go up a star or down another. Try it for yourself and share your experience with others. Peace!!"
6/5/2016,20160605,4,4.13,"I've been here for brunch two times now, and have been impressed by the food and atmosphere both times. My only complaint is that it is hard to hear your fellow diners."
6/16/2016,20160616,2,4.12,"Was so disappointed in this place. I seriously have never questioned Yelp reviews till I went here. First off there aren't that many exciting options on the menu so when I saw the daily special being jerk chicken and waffle my eyes just locked at that level. After I placed the order i turned to my left to see the most unappealing plate of jerk chicken and waffle at the table beside me and immediately regretted my decision. Tbh the jerk chicken was really well seasoned albeit a little dry, as, they used white meat. The waffles were the worst I've ever eaten like are they a serious restaurant for serving cold rubbery waffles? They were def not fresh or Belgian, granted, if it's ""store-bought-frozen"" at Least make sure it's hot and fresh. The food as a whole was very cold and pricey. I tried my friends side plantains and they were good . So I ended up eating jerk chicken and fried plantains."
6/18/2016,20160618,5,4.12,"Great food, service and atmosphere. I must try their brunch in the near future. I love their veggie burger and their veggie savory pies/quiche are yummy as well. I love the cozy feel of this place. Though it's tiny they make wonderful use of the small space. I'll definitely be back soon."
6/22/2016,20160622,5,4.13,The food is AMAZING. The veggie burger was so delicious and it came with a side of plantains and a salad which was a little different but so good! The service was fast as well. I've come back multiple times for breakfast where I had the waffles with rum syrup which was also absolutely mouth watering. I'm currently eating a kale salad with avocado and feta cheese and it's literally to die for. Great location and the cutest vibe!! Love love love this place!!!
6/24/2016,20160624,5,4.14,"the curry chicken with coconuts rice was so delicious! If you wanna a brunch, that will be a very good choice. Coconut fish burger was also amazing, the outside of the fish is crispy and inside still very tender and taste!"
7/2/2016,20160702,3,4.13,Great food. Burgers are the best in Harlem. Staff seems a bit disengaged or flat out unaware we are guests. Nevertheless the food is worth it and the prices are good.
7/5/2016,20160705,5,4.13,"Literally everything I've ever had here is the best version of that dish I've ever had, and everyone working here is helpful, patient and friendly. A cornerstone of the neighborhood!"
7/10/2016,20160710,4,4.13,"The edge was sweet enough to let us hog a table for about 4 hours. We were ordering drinks the entire time, but I realize it was a long stay. However, when old friends get together you can't rush things. The mimosas were exceptionally good. I don't know what they're using in the mimosas, but it was right up my ally. I had a chai latte that I felt was a little small, and could have been steeped a bit longer. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits. The meal was fantastic. The grits were cheesy and delicious. My friends ordered the white sangria, and they were a big hit. I really wish they had a bottomless option during brunch."
7/10/2016,20160710,5,4.14,"Came here to this cozy restaurant in Harlem this morning for brunch! I can't get over the location and the decor inside! Such a great neighborhood. Menu is small but I liked that they categorized the foods by country. I had the curry chicken sandwich, my other friends had the jerk chicken/waffles and shrimp/grits. The crowd is young and classy. The staff were friendly. It's a small place but on a Sunday you can still find seating quick. It does get a little loud here but not the obnoxious kind of loud, the fun loud haha! Will definitely be coming back!"
7/22/2016,20160722,3,4.13,"Solid week-long brunch. And brunch-plus at that: their main hits are the coconut curry chicken and the Cajun-spiced basa over salad. Nice level of heat, good mix of flavors. Also love the sorrel, very spicy ooh la la!"
7/28/2016,20160728,4,4.13,"The restaurant has an airy yet intimate feel to it in a cozy and laid back section of Harlem. I have been twice for both brunch and dinner. The service is good and the food is on par w/ the service. I believe in addition to the standard menu, there is always a special menu that constantly changes given on both visits I have been directed to the chalkboard that contains a variety of appetizing meals. The background music is well curated and the live music was a welcome addition. is My only criticism would be the jerk chicken preparation which is prepared as grilled chicken cutlet as opposed to a the more traditional ""on the bone"" prep."
7/30/2016,20160730,5,4.14,I just had my first experience at The Edge and I can't wait to return. The staff was welcoming and pleasant. The food was outstanding. The fish and chips was lightly battered and topped with toasted coconut. I've never had anything like it before. It was a delightful surprise. The ackee and salt fish with festival made for a handsome little plate that was easily and pleasantly cleared. A word of advice regarding the rum punch: pace yourself.
7/31/2016,20160731,5,4.14,"This place is perfection. They have REALLY stepped up their game since opening about 18-months ago. The owners, staff and vibe are all great. The food is fabulous and the menu is imaginative. They have cool drink specials that change seasonally. The place is small and intimate but they make the most of the space. We bring our friends and family here whenever someone comes to visit. I hope they are in our neighborhood for a very very long time!My only critique is that the coffee is still bad and overpriced, so save your tastebuds the trouble."
8/3/2016,20160803,4,4.14,"One of my favorite places in harlem! Off the beaten path, casual and imtimate. First time I had brunch with one of my girlfriends; jerk chicken and waffles were delicious! Since then, I find myself going alone, food is always fresh and nicely prepared."
8/17/2016,20160817,5,4.15,"Came in for breakfast on a weekday. They serve amazing breakfast. My fianc√© and I were looking for a place to do some wedding planning and loved the quoting vibe. Great food, great service."
8/21/2016,20160821,5,4.15,"This was a great 1st experience, we would recommend it and we would visit again. The food was delightful, seasoned well, right temperature and fresh ingredients. Everything made to order. The Food - Jerk chicken & Waffles (Special of the day) - chicken marinated and seasoned with wonderful Jamaican spices. Slightly spicy chicken and the sweetness from the syrup on the waffles was a nice balance of sweet meets salty meets spicy. - Salmon Burger w/ plantains & an arugula salad (special of the day) - The star of the show, the Salmon burger was made of real salmon and was lightly seasoned as to allow the salmon to be the highlight, little to almost no breading so that the (freshly made) patty was moist and flaky. Adorned with a tomato a little lettuce and some red onion. The arugula salad was lightly and simply dressed in a oil based dressing (don't think there was balsamic present) and a few sweet plantains to add just that little bit of sweet that I enjoyed. The only negatives to this burger were that the patty was a little small to me (at least mine was) and the bread it was served on (brioche bun, which I don't think is the right bun for the burger) was too big, proportionally for the burger. I actually went without the bun as I felt it detracted from the burger and enjoyed every bit of it. Atmosphere- Deƒáor is spot on for the type of spot they are, lovely decorating. - Cozy, very cozy, my husband and I sat at the bar (which was tight) because there were no tables available but when I walked by the dining room it seems like the tables were very close together so no secret meetings here :0) - staff were pleasant! - met one of the owners and saw the other, they are really involved in their establishment making sure needs are getting met, which was nice to see."
8/25/2016,20160825,3,4.15,They have a decent selection of wines but nothing spectacular. It is dimly lit and the food was nothing to rave about. I love that there are new places in the neighborhood to choose from and The Edge is a good addition but I don't think I'll be a regular here.
8/28/2016,20160828,5,4.15,"My favorite place in Harlem. The food is delicious , the owners are wonderful and the staff is incredible. My go to spot and they never disappoint and so willing to adjust anything to make their customers happy. TRY THE RUM PUNCH!"
9/2/2016,20160902,5,4.16,"Cute cozy place with good food, and 9:30 am mimosas :) . They have some pies (quiche)with vegetables such as spinach cauliflower broccoli etc. Ingredients may change by the day so just ask. The shrimp and grits were good nice and buttery just wish it was creamier but maybe getting cold had something to do with it. Lastly the jerk chicken and waffles (sigh) i wanted to like, even love this but the whole dish was dry & waffles had a stale texture.. waffles should be light & fluffy able to be torn apart with a fork but these oh no! the knife couldn't even cut it ..they give chicken breast which we know has to be cooked correctly or it gets dry as these did (also its not spicy). Still tasty but could not finish this dish. Lovely place"
9/3/2016,20160903,4,4.16,"First time here with my fianc√©e and future mother in law for brunch and we enjoyed the food. We came for brunch and had 3 different orders along with drinkS. I had the curry chicken sandwich and it was good. I wasn't sure how it was going to come out but it's essentially a chicken salad with curry powder placed between 2 whole grain slices of bread. I would definitely recommend this place if you're around. If they had bottomless they'd be a hit, but at the same time that keeps away the booz"
9/4/2016,20160904,5,4.16,"Since I moved to NYC, I never had a chance or a reason to go that far uptown until last week. We were picking my brother's dog from a friend and searching for a brunch spot. Right across where we parked the car, saw The Edge and checked reviews right away. We were going to be 5 at the beginning, they said the wait is 40 min., we accepted and started waiting at the benches outside. If your group is not complete, they do not let you sit due to their policy. Learning the 5th person was not joining we changed our request to 4. Got our table some time later.What I can say first is no clich√© brunch menu! They have really nice combinations. I ordered grilled cheese which comes with organic mix green salad, yummy! I was not a fan for their brewed coffee. What else we got on table was a tailor made omelet, $20, with avocados and tomatoes. A smoked salmon bagel and a Shrimp & Grits platter. We also ordered 3 sides for $10.50. Everyone was so happy with their dishes, we ate everything! :) But did not stop. Asked for a mango cheesecake and a chocolate mousse. 3 minutes later, the waiter said that there was no more cheesecake. We just wanted to have the mousse than. 5 minutes later, we got both the cake and mousse :) Apparently they only got frozen one but seeing my brother's sad face :) they served him a slice. Mangos on top were ice-like but cake was quite nice like an ice cream cheese cake :) Chocolate mousse is simple, try another dessert instead. Our overall experience was so good. Paid about $120 for all. Definitely would recommend and go again."
9/5/2016,20160905,5,4.17,Delicious food and great atmosphere. I just moved into the neighborhood and was thrilled to find such a gem down the street. I will definitely be returning in the near future.
9/17/2016,20160917,5,4.17,Yummy.  The food is delicious. Also friendly staff. I will recommend this place to chill out
9/17/2016,20160917,5,4.18,"This is my first Yelp review but I just can't help myself. By far my favorite restaurant in Harlem. I've come here for brunch, lunch, and dinner and every meal has been amazing. The staff are not only friendly, but attentive--one time my plate came out ten minutes after my friends' and the owner gave me a glass of wine on the house. Little touches like that, their incredible menu (grilled cheese/ shrimp and grits/ curry chicken salad/ saltfish/ everything), and the great ambience makes this spot incredible."
9/23/2016,20160923,4,4.18,"Great little find. Cute location and quaint vibe. Had the avocado smash toast with lox and my husband had curry chicken salad. Both dishes were delicious. He lox was mild and he perfect addition to the smash toast. The curry was not overpowering in the chicken salad and added a really unique flavor profile - and the bread was a perfect toast.Good music, good food, good coffee, and good vibes. Definitely check this place out."
9/29/2016,20160929,4,4.17,Great food! Intimate atmosphere. Waiting staff kind of snobby. I requested a table for two. The seating arrangement was less than ideal. It was a corner seat(I was on one wall and my friend was on another wall). The only way we could talk was to lean over the table(awkward). I then asked to be moved because there were other open tables available. She stated that we could sit at the bar vs the other three open tables. Not what I had in mind.
10/2/2016,20161002,4,4.17,"Went here for brunch and had the most amazing flavorful coffee (Forty Weight). Food was good I had the waffles and jerk chicken, but I'd like to try other options on the menu that looked better. I liked the vibe and the service was good."
10/7/2016,20161007,3,4.17,"Brunch menu is very limited while expensive. You get more for your money going to a southern brunch option. I ordered the avocado toast with salad for $9 and BF ordered omelette for $15. He LOVED the fries but besides that, nothing was worth paying that much money for. Quite frankly, I would not go anymore unless for coffee. VERY nice vibes there tho!"
10/10/2016,20161010,3,4.16,"Went for a late lunch during the week, the food was great but the service was definitely lacking. There were only two of us but they didn't allow us to sit comfortably at a 3 top since they weren't busy and we wouldn't be there a long time so we sat at the bar. I was there with a customer who I haven't taken out and was taken about by their non-hospitable service. Seems they were in the middle of switching shifts and the bartender and server that presently working were just trying to leave/not be bothered. The need some lessons on customer service and hospitality. Id try it again as it is a very cute place with awesome food, but would just hope different staff would be working"
10/11/2016,20161011,5,4.16,"Went here for Sunday Brunch. I must say the neighborhood has changed since my time at City College. The staff were pleasant and the atmosphere feels like going to an extended family get together. We ordered a carafe of mimosa, which I must admit was darn good. I ordered jerk chicken and waffles, loved the chicken but not the waffles. I always thought waffles should have a soft top but this was quite hard and crunchy. Overall, great experience and if you are tourist, is worth checking it's like a little piece of America tucked away in Harlem."
10/19/2016,20161019,5,4.17,Cute place with great food. Went there for dinner. It could get a bit loud if it gets crowded
10/28/2016,20161028,4,4.17,Great brunch. I would recommend for a party of 3 or less. Wish it was a little bigger. But because of the small space I believe that's why the atmosphere was so great. The Jamaican theme is definitely a plus. Great pictures of Jamaica. Glad something like this is in the neighborhood.
11/5/2016,20161105,5,4.17,Tucked away on 138th and convent This was the neighborhood joint when I lived in Harlem. Cozy and distinct. The food here is real soul food. On the weekends they offer a very nice brunch but get there early because it's small so sometimes the lines get long. There's a park right across from it to walk your rich meal off. This is one of those restaurants where I just wanted to try everything they had. My suggestions is go for the real soul food dishes like the shrimp and grits. Top favorite in NYC and that's saying a lot.
11/5/2016,20161105,4,4.17,Wonderful find! Great atmosphere with delicious food and cocktails. The portions ensured that we left full and happy. We'll definitely be back and highly recommend!
11/7/2016,20161107,4,4.17,"Came here for brunch yesterday afternoon. This was my second time at the establishment. My first time, there was a 20 minute wait. This time, it was four of us and we were seated almost immediately. My friend and I ordered the sliced jerk chicken and waffles. Food took about 20 minutes to come, which was something that previously happened when I initially came there and hoped that would've changed by now. When we received our plates, both of them were cold; no presence of heat AT ALL. How both of our plates of chicken and waffles was cold, I have no idea.The ambience of the restaurant was very cozy and seating was close the dining area wasn't too big. Also, keep in mind that they don't have wi-fi. Which I think is a good idea. It keeps the place from turning into a Starbucks location with people utilizing the wi-fi and not buying anything outside of a small coffee or danish. One of the things that turned me off was the fact that they don't have free refills on soft drinks. Also, you have to ask for them to replace that carafe of water after its done. And they have a habit or taking your plate before you have finally finished your food. They don't even ask; they just grab the plate. But all in all, it's a nice brunch spot and good for observing the ongoing gentrification of Harlem."
11/13/2016,20161113,3,4.16,The food was good but the tables are so close together. They tried to cram too many tables into such a small space. The people next to you have to move their table in order for you to get in & out & vice versa. If you're fine with basically sitting with other people then you'll like it.
11/17/2016,20161117,3,4.16,I ordered the omelette and it was super salty....like it literally tasted like an entire jug of salt was dumped on it. Drinks are a bit overpriced... especially the orange juice for what you're getting. Might as well go to a deli and buy an entire bottle of tropicana for the same price. But it's a nice place.. would go again but probably just for coffee.
11/23/2016,20161123,5,4.16,"I am Loving ""The Edge"". It's my favorite restaurant in Harlem. The food is delicious. Had the Jerk Chicken Alfredo which was so good. These two sisters bring love to Harlem. The food warms my soul and heart. There is so much love in the food. The ambience and the music is mellow. Happy hour everyday. Burger night on Mondays with a list so long of different burgers, salmon is my fav!! and if you are in for desserts? Bread pudding with chocolate and coconut and the mousse is the best I've ever had. Get into it, it's the best place in Harlem."
11/25/2016,20161125,4,4.16,Very nice. Rustic. Good energy. Simple menu but you can find healthy choices.People pleasant. Prices fair. Glad we found it on Yelp.
11/27/2016,20161127,5,4.17,"I had a delicious breakfast experience at The Edge. What a warm, but cool atmosphere to enjoy the experience of updated Jamaican cuisine. The healthy twist of the hibiscus mimosa and authentic jazz music with a lil jerk chicken on the side made me feel so at home. Can't wait to return and bring my friends and family.."
12/14/2016,20161214,5,4.17,"I'm a new regular. So far my fave dish is the shrimp and grits. I can't wait to explore other items on the menu. A quaint atmosphere, chill music, and a killer menu makes this a must try!"
12/14/2016,20161214,4,4.17,"Accidentally stumbled on this restaurant as I live about 13 blocks away and never venture on Edgecombe. When I saw it, I knew I wanted to try it. I quickly pulled up the reviews to see if it was even worth the time. The food is good. I had the salt fish cakes which was just ok and I had the beef sliders that were really, really good. Now, yelpers complained about the service in this establishment and I have to agree. Since I read the reviews before hand, I was looking to see if the owner read and paid any attention to the critics reviews. I sat down with my party of 4 and quickly counted the patrons. On a Saturday night, there was about 23 people sitting at the tables and at the bar and ONE (1) person serving. The person hosting seemed like she was in a rush to take your order. She was not too friendly. Service needs improvement as there is no way that one person should be responsible for serving 23 people. I noticed that the girl behind the bar came on the floor and helped out, but still I think the owners need to pay more attention to the service and make sure that they are providing top service. The waitress never once wrote anything down and as a result with serving 23 people, she didn't bring items (ie, Ketchup) asked for to the table. Overall, the food and establishment is nice, but the service needs improvement."
12/14/2016,20161214,2,4.16,"I live down the street and have been to The Edge a few times; all our neighbors recommended this place and many seem to know the owners. The food has typically been great and we've been thrilled this restaurant was so close to our home. However, we were in recently with a guest and had the rudest and most shockingly bad service! On a rainy weekday evening we were shuffled off to the communal table, despite most of the other tables being unoccupied. When the waitress appeared she asked what we'd be having--she assumed we were simply having drinks and seemed surprised when we explained we were there for dinner. We asked to hear the specials, and she said we were free to get up and go over and read them off the specials board. Heh? As two of us were seated in the corner with our backs to the board and a brick bump-out blocking our view of it, we asked her to read them to us (the second time we're asking the waitress to inform us as to the restaurant's specials). She said NO, she couldn't read them! She was standing 4 feet away and facing the specials board that we were supposed to read ... yet she refused to read or recite to us the evening's specials. It was the waitstaff version of ""F* you."" Her challenging attitude made it awkward for our group. While she went to place our bar order we all confirmed there was no misinterpretation to her stance and discussed leaving The Edge to find a more enjoyable experience. The bartender brought our drinks, and rain is the only thing that kept us from walking up the hill to The Grange. One member of our party left our table to go read and memorize the specials (thankfully there weren't any other customers at the table under the specials board to hover over) and we decided to stick it out, but the waitress's strange and defiant attitude made all other interactions awkward and insincere. Twice we ask the waitress to hear the specials and twice she finds excuses not to simply make it easier on everyone and just tell us. Weird..."
12/17/2016,20161217,5,4.16,"I stumbled upon this charming eatery while exploring Harlem on a brisk winter morning. It was my first full sit-down meal in New York and it did not disappoint. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with fruit (which were a special that day) with two eggs on the side. The pancakes were fluffy, hearty, and I had plenty leftover for the next day's breakfast. The service was quick and very accommodating. I had to charge my phone and they seated me at a table right next to the wall outlet by the window, so I could look outside as I ate. The atmosphere is very cozy and relaxing, and it seems like there are some regulars who are friendly with the staff. I think that this would be a great place to eat while reading a good book on a lazy weekend morning. I'll have to come back next time I'm in New York!"
12/27/2016,20161227,5,4.17,"There's so much I can say about this restaurant but I'll keep it short, everything taste fresh, everything was delicious , I know cause I tried everyone's entr√©e :-). (how did they manage that!!??) lol and the atmosphere is perfect for everything from a quick gathering with friends, family, or just you & your significant other. I absolutely love the small space that they managed to make feel larger. The staff is attentive & it doesn't feel like you are being rushed out the door no matter how busy it gets. Not to mention the prices are incredibly reasonable. Proving that a delicious meal and excellent service doesn't need to cost you an entire paycheck in NYC. I love supporting local businesses so this place will definitely be at the top of my brunch list."
12/29/2016,20161229,4,4.17,"Solid neighborhood brunch spot. Nice friendly atmosphere, good food, lower prices compared to downtown/midtown. Close to the subway and it's the perfect spot for Hamilton fans (like us) coming from the nearby Hamilton Grange Museum. Excellent coffee!"
12/31/2016,20161231,4,4.17,"Stopped by after touring Hamilton Grange and had a fantastic lunch. I had the curry chicken with coconut rice - the best meal I had during our trip to NYC. My husband had the BLT special which he thoroughly enjoyed. Our waiter was attentive, but we had to wait quite a while for our food to come out - the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. If the kitchen is going to take this long with the food, perhaps some pretzels or bread while we're waiting? The atmosphere was nice and cozy and I would definitely recommend this place."
1/4/2017,20170104,5,4.17,"I was in NYC for 10 days and I went to this place 6 out of those 10 mornings during my stay. The staff was so kind and inviting, and the food (brunch in particular) was so satisfying. After my first visit, the bartender called me by name. Definitely go here if you're anywhere near Harlem, you won't be disappointed."
1/14/2017,20170114,3,4.16,To say a hidden gem is Harlem is an understatement. The ambiance is cozy with an almost intimate atmosphere. It reminds me of my favorite restaurant in the Keys. We were seated right before their brunch was over. The Five of us were in a cozy corner. The menu looked amazing and I ordered the burger which comes with bacon but I asked to sub with turkey bacon instead. My son said i will have the same except I don't want the special sauce on mine. All was going great the sorrel is amazing and then the food came out... The orders looked amazing until I saw that my sons burger had pork bacon on it. We kindly pointed it out and our waitress Fatima instantly got an attitude saying you said turkey bacon he did not. In which we all said he said the same as hers except the sauce. She took the burger back to the kitchen and then returned 30 seconds later with the same burger with the bacon removed?? She said we will bring out your turkey bacon. Now I signal to who I believed was the manager to let her know that we don't eat pork and the pork that sat on this egg was just removed?? She apologized and took the plate. They made a new egg( because the bacon was on top of the egg) and five minutes later The burger comes back and we are waiting for the turkey bacon to arrive. Fatima brings the bacon and I won't say slams it on the table but I can say that that plate made a sound louder than any plate in the entire restaurant that was placed down. What confused us was the lack of attention and attitude we experienced after that. We needed mayonnaise and we had to eat without. We wanted more water we left thirsty my son had to get up and get napkins because she never returned to our table to ask if we needed anything. She came to clear the plates and 15 minutes after we had to ask for the bill from the same lady who I believe to be the manager. Our bill arrived with an already added 18% gratuity. I asked the manager about it and she apologized and took it off (a party of 5 doesn't get an automatic grautity) we then had to bring the bill to the front because this waitress has an attitude over bacon?? I for the first time in my life left leaving absolutely no tip!! There are so many things I want to try on the menu and really loved the feel of the place but before returning I will be asking if Fatima is working and if so( there is only one waitress serving) I won't be returning. One person can really ruin an experience and if she continues like that ruin a business!! I hope this makes her reflect and not ruin another customer's experience!! BTW the food was amazing but the experience stopped me from taking any pictures.
1/15/2017,20170115,5,4.17,"This place is an adorable hidden gem! The atmosphere is quaint, cozy, and inviting. The staff is very accommodating and pleasant to deal with as well. I ordered the veggie omelette that came with mixed greens and fries. It was delicious. My husband ordered the avocado toast with mixed greens, this was also extremely tasty. My one thing I would change is having more options on the menu. What was on the menu was all good looking, but for brunch I wanted a few more choices. It was a unique spot and I will for sure be back!"
1/15/2017,20170115,4,4.17,Great service and great food. Not particularly great on cocktails or beverage options however
1/17/2017,20170117,4,4.17,"I met a group of friends here for lunch and it was lovely! There is a sign that say ""no wifi connect with each other"" which I loved! The decor is charming and comfortable. I love that the menu is separated by geography (i.e Jamaican, British, and New York) because it tells you exactly the type of food you are looking for. We ordered a ton of food for the table so I was able try a variety of things. The cod fish fritters are delicious and light! The festival was sooooo good, I ate way too much of it. I even liked the curry mayo dipping sauce that accompanied it. I'm not a huge fan of too many sauces but it was a nice compliment. I had the shrimp and Parmesan grits and they were delicious! One friend had the buttermilk pancakes and they were very good as well. I also tried the jerk chicken and waffles which were quite tasty. The drinks were very good. I tried the spicy hibiscus and mango mimosas and really enjoyed them. The owners were lovely and the staff was very kind. I will definitely be back!"
2/1/2017,20170201,5,4.17,"Came here for a Sunday brunch. Food was delicious, we had shrimp and grits, fries, plantains, and grilled cheese with salad. The cheese grits is the best I've ever had. Salad was so fresh and dressing was perfect and light. Everything was great. Service was on point, and waitress was friendly. Even their water is cucumber water! They're busy for Sunday brunch so you might have to wait a bit but they have a cute little bench outside that you can sit on and chat with friends while waiting. Interior is beautiful and homey. It had a real community feel to it. What a gem - we'll definitely be returning. Highly recommend!"
2/10/2017,20170210,5,4.18,I've been to the Edge a couple times. It's my favorite neighborhood spot. I've had a couple menu items and loved them all. The veggie burger is my favorite.
2/11/2017,20170211,5,4.18,The service was great! The food was great! The atmosphere was great! Will definitely be back with friends.Meals eaten: - Jerk Chicken and Waffles Drink had: - Mango Mimosa
2/12/2017,20170212,5,4.18,"Cozy, intimate, good food and owned by two sistas! My partner and I came here for Sunday brunch, I ordered the Edge burger she had the jerk chicken with waffles. Both dishes were packed with flavor and very satisfying. We will definitely be back, it's good to see Harlem residence owning a piece of Harlem. Glow girls!"
2/14/2017,20170214,4,4.18,Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name. This is that place.Jamaican British fusion is a refreshing move.Can't wait to go back.
2/14/2017,20170214,4,4.18,Went here for the first time with my wife for brunch. Very nice little spot with good service. Light smooth music which was not overbearing. The food was fresh and tasty. My wife enjoyed her mimosa and I enjoyed the rum punch. The demographic of people varied but all welcoming with smile. We'll be back on a Wed. night to hear some live music. I would recommend this place.
2/18/2017,20170218,5,4.19,Loved this place. The food is amazing and the service is great. Didn't get the name of the waitress but she was so patient and so nice. Found my new brunch place. Will be back!
2/19/2017,20170219,4,4.19,"Food was great!! Small nice quaint place with great atmosphere! Crowd was very diverse..I got here around maybe 1:30 today (Sunday), so there was a bit of a wait. At the same time, the credit card machine was down so I had to go down the street to get cash. The only small complaint that I had was that the food seem like it took some time to come out, however, the lady sitting next to me said for the most part there always prompt, so hopefully it was just this one time. Great 1st experience!"
2/20/2017,20170220,5,4.19,"Consistently delicious food and service!!This is my first yelp review (in recent memory at least) and its for good reason.. Not many places compel the spirit to give feedback but the Edge is a hidden gem that just continues to deliver for me and everyone that I bring. I'll start with the positives: The seafood pasta, salmon with salad, and the ackee and salt fish w/ festival are my favs. As a Jamaican I have such an appreciation for good ackee and salt fish outside of Jamaica. It's one of those things that when you find it, you treasure it! And don't overlook the seafood pasta! Linguine pasta with shrimps, mussels and scallops with tomato sauce seasoned perfectly.. hard to describe how tasty this is! The ambiance is also really cool and cozy, i find it easy to feel at home here. I've been a handful of times so far and the servers and a young lady who I believe is one of the owners have always been welcoming and attentive to my needs. One of them even remembers my name (who doesn't like hearing their name?!). The other day I was even treated to a complimentary dessert. Super grateful for that customer appreciation..The one drawback is that at certain times there is a wait for seating but that can be expected for a quality restaurant in NYC. The times that I have had to wait it's been about 10-15 minutes from what I remember and they do a good job communicating wait times. I believe they are busiest on weekends for brunch. I suggest you call ahead of time if you're planning on coming with a big group as space is limited."
2/24/2017,20170224,4,4.19,The regular menu isn't that diverse but the specials seem to be way to go if you're looking for a real dinner. I went for the curry jumbo shrimp with rice and plantains which I really enjoyed along with the tasty rum punch. The only real downfall was the slow service. Our waitress seemed to be everybodys waitress. Though it's not a huge restaurant it still took a long time to get our food and a second round of drinks. Service was only really prompt when it came time to pay the check.I'll pass on this place for dinner but would want to come back to try brunch though.
2/25/2017,20170225,5,4.19,"I'm a little mad I didn't take a pic! OK ok ok. This place is AMAZING. Here is the rundown. We went for brunch:- he had the shrimp / grits / eggs- the let me sub the shrimp for the fried fish with grits / eggs- we both had the rum punchI saw someone from with the fish and knew I had to have it. Our server put me on. She was great and attentive. The owners were super attentive too and walked around greeting and talking to the patrons. Okay, back to the food:The food! The grits were super tasty. The FISH! It was coated in a light batter with shredded coconut. It was so delicious. I finally worked up the nerve to try scotch bonnet hot sauce. It was so good with the grits. The sauce from the shrimp was so good too. The rum punch was super sweet and rich. At first he didn't taste the alcohol but 3/4s the way down he was like ""ayyeeeeeeeeee."" lol. So, we are definitely going back. I want to try more items on the menu."
2/26/2017,20170226,5,4.2,Excellent place.I came in the first time and loved it. The waiter Moises was so nice and full of energy. Very friendly and homie environment and the food is delicious. Highly recommend it.
2/27/2017,20170227,4,4.2,This is a great small restaurant. I went with a friend and the food was amazing. This was my first time to this reataurant.The food was better than some of the restaurants that sell caribbean food. The crab cakes were amazing. I would definitely come back to this restaurant. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the wait was long. It took about 30 to 40 mins to get seated.
3/11/2017,20170311,5,4.2,Flawless. It's so amazing. So delicious and yummy. Kudos for the almond milk options and honestly there is something for everyone on the menu. You also can inform them of your dietary restrictions. I can't begin to describe the coconut fish- it's perfection. The overall experience was great too. Will be back and will bring people. Excellent music too!
3/24/2017,20170324,5,4.2,"My first review...There are few restaurants that capture the magic and culture of Harlem. Great food, cool staff, attentive managers, and cozy ambiance. You will not be disappointed, and it is always getting better."
3/24/2017,20170324,4,4.2,I'm so glad there's an eatery close by home that serves excellent food with titillating Jamaican flavor. Yes man.
4/1/2017,20170401,4,4.2,"Found a gem in the neighborhood! From customer service to happy faces, good food and music, I loved it all !!! Morning coffee is so important to me and I can vouch for this place that you will be really really good brewed coffee and latte. I finally tried chicken and waffles and so happy that I tried it here. Jerk chicken was super flavorful and cooked right and the waffles were also delicious. This place opens at 11 am on Saturdays. It was not crowded but by 1130 place was filled up. I will definitely be coming back to try out another dish."
4/7/2017,20170407,4,4.2,"This is a quaint little spot in Harlem. It's got a nice little bar area for espresso and drinks with surrounding tables for something a bit more intimate. The wait staff is accommodating, quick, and affable. Coffee is quite nice. The food is a notch above mediocre. It's a light, fresh, and fragrant breakfast, which doesn't leave you feeling heavy. Give The Edge a try!"
4/9/2017,20170409,5,4.2,"My friend and I stopped here for brunch on a whim and were extremely satisfied. Upon walking in we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated by the bar. The decor was lovely, slightly rustic and earthy. The food and coffee was fabulous. One of the best cappuccinos I've ever had! We ordered the pancakes with fresh fruit and the avocado toast with a side of plantains. The plantains were perfectly cooked, the pancakes delightfully fluffy with slightly crispy edges, and the avocado toast was flavorful and robust. Our waiter was great, he was full of suggestions and even gave me a sample of the housemade sorrel -- a traditional Jamaican beverage made with hibiscus and spices. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend this place for brunch, it is good for smaller groups or a date. The setting is slightly intimate and cozy."
4/14/2017,20170414,5,4.21,"been here one time, but can't believe I didn't know about this wonderful place in the neighborhood! It is cozy and stylish, service is great, and the cauliflower soup was phenomenal! can't wait to come for brunch."
4/15/2017,20170415,4,4.21,"Very nice, small restaurant. Food was excellent and service was good. The menu online doesn't show the 'daily specials' for dinner, but go and be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommend."
4/18/2017,20170418,5,4.21,Never disappointed when we come here. Food is amazing and ambiance is hip and trendy. The sangria's are the best around and the Jerk chicken and waffles and the fritters are the best I've had. My new favorite spot
4/23/2017,20170423,4,4.21,"I loved this spot. It feels family owned. We came around 2 on Sunday which is a very busy time but the 2 of us were seated right away. I had the Ultimate Edge Burger with fries and a side of kale and plantain. The burger had a fried egg and bacon on it. Although I don't eat bread it was very tasty and cooked to perfection. My friend had the jerk chicken and waffles from the special menu. He found the waffle to be generic, just a step above an Eggo and he would have liked the jerk chicken to be a little spicier. Overall the service was good, the restaurant is small but bright. Good energy, a little noisy but great to meet friends. Recommend."
4/25/2017,20170425,4,4.21,"I got the burger and shared a croissant with my kids. The place is busy, but kid friendly. Excellent brunch, great coffee. It is a little frustrating that they charge extra for milk for the coffee, hence 4*."
5/1/2017,20170501,4,4.21,"Great food, great service but one complaint which is why it isn't 5 stars---during certain hours, electronic devices (computers, phones etc) aren't allowed and this wasn't made explicitly clear enough imo considering it is common practice at coffee shops/bars. I checked both the website and yelp reviews before coming here to do some reading/work and while no wifi was mentioned, a total moratorium on e devices was not. I will definitely come back at a time where I don't need to use these things bc I think it is a fine enough practice but it needs to be made more clear which is why I am writing this review."
5/4/2017,20170504,5,4.21,"Great Harlem owned cafe/restaurant. Great place to grab a glass of wine during happy hour. They live music weekly. My favorite menu item is the jerk chicken caesar salad!! I have never had a salad like that before, and I honestly don't think any place else in the city makes it or can make it as good as the Edge does. I crave that salad all the time. Next time you're in Harlem stop by the Edge. You will have a great experience."
5/7/2017,20170507,3,4.21,"I went here for brunch recently. I got the fried egg sandwich with avocado. Pretty good, but honestly I would order something else next time I go. I kind of feel like I could've made something like that at home. But the thing that really gives this place 3 stars is the fact that the waiter asked what milk we wanted for our coffee and suggested almond milk. We agreed, and realized that there is an up charge for almond milk that he failed to mention. How lame! Atmosphere is good. A good place to have a date during the day."
5/9/2017,20170509,2,4.2,"I probably would not revisit this restaurant! I ordered the special coconut fish and grits; when the food came out the grits were cold and thick so I sent it back... When the fresh plate came out the consistency of the grits remain the same thick like lard but hot! However, still endible... In addition, the fish had way more batter than fish... needless to say I was unsatisfied and still hungry so I ended up ordering some fries to fill the space . I must say the fries were quite good but honestly I could have just been the fact that I was still hungry."
5/10/2017,20170510,5,4.2,"Great service, Great food, and Great environment. Coconut fish and grits special was amazing. Very cute little cozy space. My partner had the ginger Martini and she is still raving about it. We will be back"
5/12/2017,20170512,5,4.2,"I've been here about 4 or 5 times and I can honestly say there is a reason why it's always busy. I usually come with my boyfriend and no matter what we tend to order, we always find that The Edge has outdone themselves. We've ordered the shrimp and grits, pancakes, The Edge Burger, Waffles just to name a few dishes and they have always been superb. It's a cozy establishment, but the vibe is really what keeps me coming back. I really enjoy cozy spots, with good food, and trendy patrons and I would suggest this place to anyone else who enjoys the same."
5/14/2017,20170514,5,4.21,"Benedictine eggs with salmon outstanding Jamaican plate delicious Coffee strong, really goodAmbiance 5 stars"
5/23/2017,20170523,4,4.21,"Very cute, hipster diner. I ordered the shrimp and grits, but I suspect that the shrimp was frozen at some point. Overall it was a good meal. I really enjoyed the vibe and the open windows that let a nice breeze in. My friends enjoyed their jerk chicken and waffles, but they did comment that the jerk wasn't as spicy as it should be."
5/26/2017,20170526,3,4.2,"Really didn't like my food. Kinda disappointed. The shrimp were so small. There was too much hot sauce on my grits that it spilled next to all my scrambled eggs. Awww. I wanted to like this place.On the upside, the service is good and the atmosphere is very chill Harlem."
5/28/2017,20170528,5,4.2,"This is my favorite brunch spot and Harlem, hands down! They are top-of-the-line when it comes to quality of food, authenticity, and customer service. Expect a Jamaican -NYC Harlem Renaissance flair to your experience. Some of my favorite meals have been the coconut fish burger, their kale salad, and jerk chicken. There's history behind the building and is reflected through their wall art, catering to an ambience that is purposeful and full of soul. Everyone there has provided excellent customer service including my waitress Tursin and bartender, Alexis. The owners are the Master sisters who will make their way to your table to make sure you're satisfied. Can't tell highly enough about this place!"
5/30/2017,20170530,4,4.2,"I had have been wanting to come to this place for a good while after seeing some pics that made my mouth drool and very impressive reviews. I finally got a chance to come through for brunch after dragging my homie the lovely miss Alexis M. along for one of my foodie adventures lol. There are a ton of reviews for this place so I will make mines short and to the point in categories that matter. Here is my breakdown: Cost: Typical NY pricing entree for brunch were in the $12.00 to $18.00 range. The portions were very good for what you paid so no complaints in that regard. The drinks as well were typical NY pricing so no surprises. Seating: (3.5 out of 5 stars) Inside was very clean, cafe style very limited but kind of roomy at the same time. Yeah I know weird but hard to explain. LOL The hostess was very cool and allowed us to pick our seating when their were a couple available for us to be seated. If you are a party of two or less and want to avoid a wait during the busy stretch I would recommend sitting in the bar area which seemed to have people coming and leaving at a good pace. You will not have privacy for conversation as the seating is kind of compact but you still have elbow room. It wasn't bad for me everyone just engaging in conversations everywhere not even worried about the person next to them which was cool. They have this sign that says no WIFI so sit down and talk basically. When you look around that's basically what everyone is doing which is talking so mission accomplished lolCustomer Service: (3.75 out of 5 stars): Customer service was great as far as the hostess who was seating people. Very much on top her game and organized. Our waitress on the other hand was okay. She never introduced her name and disappeared for long periods of time and forgot to give us water when were were seated. Now I love food to be fresh so if it takes a little longer than usual I am all for it but we were literally waiting at least 25 to 30 minutes for waffles, and pancakes and turkey bacon. Come on Son !!! lol. That was my only real big negative about this establishment. Food: (4 out of 5 stars) I ordered the Jerk Chicken and waffles. The Jerk Chicken was AMAZING !!! and waffles were very good. My only complaint about the waffles were they were a little too firm and not fluffy and light how they should be. I had the some Sorrel to wash it down with which was also very good. Alexis had the blueberry pancakes which were HUGEEEEEE !!! and tasted great and the side of turkey bacon which was also pretty good. Her drink the ""580"" which had Rum punch, Champagne and Sorrel was off the charts. The perfect blend of sweetness with alcohol a MUST TRY !!! Parking: Looks like it could be an issue during rush hour times but listen it is NYC and like I always say take the train so you dont have to worry about that which I always do. Overall I love the place the ambiance was just right for me. If you are New Yorker you will know what I mean once you step in and sit down. The food was good and had other intriguing things on the menu that I must come back to try like the ""Nutella French Toast"" and ""Jamaican Jerk Chicken Caesar Wrap"". Now the wait was a little long for the food even though Alexis and I were entertained and chatting it up those specific orders should not take that long to make which really overall was my only main gripe. I will definitely be back though"
5/30/2017,20170530,3,4.2,"I wish I could add a half star to this because the 3x times I have come here before, the experience was good and the food as well. But I was recently disappointed. I went for brunch on memorial day around 12:15pm with my husband. We were sat quickly by who seems to be one of the owners. After we were sat at a table, as usual, we waited for water and a menu....but they never came. 3 other tables were sat after we came in and they received their menus and water, but we sat there patiently waiting. She passed by us several times and served people around us. As we waited, the table next to us had been waiting to receive their soup, and when they waved down the same lady who sat us, she asked them if they had asked for the soup to come out before their entree. I thought that was kind of rude of her. And she felt the need to tell them if they don't tell them to bring it out first, they won't. She could have just told them, ""hey no problem. will get that for you."" But it was almost like she wanted to prove them wrong, It was just weird and uncomfortable, and that wasn't even me! We waited for about 15 minutes and when we realized nothing was happening, we got up and went to another local spot for brunch. She actually saw us leave. And I also came back into get my umbrella and she was standing right by the table where we were and she didn't address me at all. You would think she would ask if everything was okay or why we were leaving. Nope. Just watched us leave. Oh well.I'm sure I will eventually come back here but it is frustrating to go somewhere and feel obligated to leave a tip when you already know from the start you are going to get bad service."
5/31/2017,20170531,4,4.2,"4.5 stars for a really pleasant and relaxing Harlem Sunday brunch experience. Friendly and attentive owners, cool and casual vibe, and good Jamaican food. Our group of 8 sat at the back corner table and enjoyed our ""580"" special drink, a rum punch with an extra kick. I had my first ackee and saltfish experience and it was yummy and well prepared, with dumplings on the side. The carrot and ginger soup, a daily special, also was tasty and well prepared as was the Nutella French toast. After a leisurely brunch, the owners needed us to move so that another reservation could use the table. They graciously offered us free mimosas at the bar, a classy move that will guarantee a return visit."
6/3/2017,20170603,1,4.18,I decided to go here with my mom and aunt the place even though the last time I went here I left dissatisfied I gave them the benefit of the doubt the place is nice and cozy as stated in the comments however this is my last the time the food is good but the service suck!!!!! Fatima I. wasnt personable and didnt know much about the menu the water was warm and she didnt check up on us at all its unfortunate that I won't be back cause the place is nice
6/4/2017,20170604,5,4.19,"I loved the food- coconut fish and grits was the truth, sorrel was on point. Coffee was really good too. Staff down to earth and kind. I'll be back."
6/4/2017,20170604,1,4.17,Uninspiring menu and even the basics are not done well. Also no Bloody Mary's???? NYC prices without the quality. Smh
6/6/2017,20170606,5,4.18,"This is was an all around AMAZING brunch experience for me as well as members from my Harlem Brunchaholics Meetup Group. SERVICEWe had a group of 10 total and there was a party inside before us. We waited a few minutes due to a scheduling conflict that I caused and they were really nice in allowing us a close window to our original start time. We arrived at the place and it was PACKED (Usually a good sign ). There was only one area in the back that could fit our party size and when we finally sat down our waiter was very thorough and articulate in explaining the brunch menu as well as the specials that they offered (which were posted on the wall also).SERVICE RATING = 5FOODSince we usually try different restaurants within the Harlem area we ordered various items on the menu. Some of the items ordered were:JERK CHICKEN & WAFFLES THE ULTIMATE EDGE BURGERCOCONUT FISH BURGER ACKEE & SALTFISH WITH FESTIVALFRIED CODFISH FRITTERSFRIED EGG SANDWICH Everyone enjoyed their food and other than one person receiving their food a tad later than others. We were too busy enjoying the fritters to notice initially. (We received free desserts in the end so that more than made up for that.) FOOD RATING = 5 There was a particular sauce that I want to point out that was served with the fritters that was excellent and was flavorful and bold enough that I put it on my Coconut Fish Burger. DRINKNot to be outdone by the excellent food was the new ""580 COCKTAIL"". It is an excellent blend of: RUM PUNCH CHAMPAGNE SPICED HIBISCUS SYRUP It was served in a quite large wine glass (which all who ordered enjoyed ) at $14. It held about 2 to 3 regular sized drinks per serving so I would say it is an excellent value for a casual drinker at Brunch. DRINK RATING = 5 This was an amazing experience and the whole group is excited to come back!"
6/8/2017,20170608,5,4.18,The Edge is my favorite brunch spot. The owners and staff are so personable and accomodating. The food is really tasty-well seasoned and presented. Service at The Edge is impeccable. I LOVE the ginger margarita...it's the first thing I order when I arrive and the last this is the bread pudding. This place is yum!
6/10/2017,20170610,1,4.17,"Today I invited my bestie for brunch at the Edge. Our dining experience was less than satisfying. We were seated and waited about 20 minutes before being checked on. We ordered the ginger margarita, which tasted like a sweet non alcoholic drink..We then asked for a extra shot of the tequila, which tasted like tequila and water (I bartend I know the good stuff). It was horrible! After the mediocre drink... we ordered the ultimate edge burger from our beautiful ill mannered waitress. After 30 minutes of waiting, we asked about our food. The food was accidentally dropped on the floor and their were no apologies just a smirk from the waitress like it's coming. I'm really embarrassed that I recommended the spot and will not be back. Again I bartend and work with the public... I treat my customers well and i expect to be treated well everywhere I go! We left unhappy and took dollars to Ponty Bistro!!"
6/24/2017,20170624,4,4.17,"We landed here as our first place in Harlem staying at a great airbnb spot after a 13 hour flight...and what a great choice. The food was superb! Small plates of shrimp and mango chutney, cod fritters, fish and chips, and the roasted tomato soup were all excellent! The Wednesday night live music was a real joy although the noise level made conversation difficult. The HH drinks were disappointing though, with the ginger margarita tasting like neither of the namesakes, and the light colored sangria being unlike any sangria I've ever tried(and not in a good way), but the food made up for the cheap drinks, and the music won us over. We were ready to go back."
6/25/2017,20170625,5,4.17,ALWAYS down for The Edge. Have never been disappointed. Highly recommend the shrimp and grits or coconut fish. And get the 580 if you want to add a lot of booze to your meal--so strong! One will get you significantly drunk; I've split one with a friend before heading out for the day.
7/10/2017,20170710,5,4.17,I loved the food. The ambience was very delightful. I found parking rarely quickly. The customer service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back.
7/19/2017,20170719,5,4.18,One of my new favorite restaurants. The food is so delicious. It also has a great atmosphere. Try their signature drink 508! Super good :)
7/21/2017,20170721,5,4.18,"Delicious food, great service. I had the jerk chicken wrap with fries and ginger margarita"
7/22/2017,20170722,4,4.18,"Lovely, cute place, perfect for brunch. Had the eggs Benedict with spinach; delicious. Comes with fries and salad (though salad was plain). Jamaican sorrel hibiscus drink is fantastic -- no matter why you come, get some."
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.18,"This is awesome brunch spot for those lazy Sunday afternoon's! My boyfriend and I dropped in on a whim and we were very happy that we did. The atmosphere is cozy and very NY-esque. The exposed brick gives it awesome vibe. The overall service was great as well. We ordered the waffle with fresh fruit, 2 sides of scrambled eggs, and bacon--all the yums. The waffle was flavorful and fluffy and the blueberries were quite delicious. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the bacon was a lovely treat.We will certainly be back :)"
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.19,"I've yet to have a meal here that I didn't enjoy.The Edge is a cute cafe with a great neighborhood vibe, made even more intimate by the fact that it's hidden down Edgecombe Avenue away from the main strip of stores and restaurants. I love going here in the morning or early afternoon before it gets busy. I recommend trying one of their daily specials because it's always something unique and delicious, but if you're ordering off the menu, the shrimp and grits is the way to go. I like to take friends here whenever they visit my side of town and they always become big fans!"
7/23/2017,20170723,3,4.18,"Bornday wknd brunch with The Woman responsible for bringing me into the world! It's A Very nice cleanly, well kept intimate compact spot with exposed bricks, wooden chairs and tables. My Moms ordered the shrimp & grits with a side of two eggs and gingerbeer as her choice of drink. I ordered the three stacks buttermilk pancakes with A side of bacon and A glass of good ole milk!!!!! The pancakes were fluffy and tasty warm syrup with extra butter to enhance. My Moms enjoyed her breakfast ans after we were done, I order the signature drinnk 580. Overall The service was decent, as it was pretty busy in there. Fairly priced and positive energy. It's definitely an enjoyable place to dine and I plan to return for lunch/dinner as I think it's better suited for."
7/29/2017,20170729,4,4.18,"Nice little spot out of the way but made me feel like I was going to a neighborhood secret. Good happy hour & my boyfriend is still talking about how delicious the lamb was. Jerk chicken was spicy, as it should be. Definitely will add to the rotation of regular eating spots!"
7/31/2017,20170731,5,4.18,This place is such a gem! A great mix of flavors and the food was wonderful! Stumbled across the place on accident and we were seated at the bar right away. There were a ton of people inside (it can be a little loud as it's a small space) but our server was friendly and prompt! The plantains were delicious. Great place for brunch!
8/11/2017,20170811,5,4.19,"Had lunch here the other day. I plopped myself right at the bar and made myself home. Man oh man. What a magical place. I was there maaaaaybe 45-50 minutes, but I walked out feeling like I've been on a weeklong vacation. This spot is super cute and super chill. I ordered the coconut curry chicken- very yummy taste, but the chicken was dry. *insertsadface. The glass of rose I had was crisp and delicious. Overall, 5 stars for being giving me energy and relaxation on a random weekday. 5 stars for finding that magic combo of truly good vibes. I will be back. :)"
8/11/2017,20170811,3,4.18,"Nice folks and cool idea of affordable neighborhood Caribbean/comfort food mix. Wanted to love it but food is meh. We had burger and a salmon dish: pre-formed, frozen, defrosted. Not tasty. This was a few months back so hopefully they've improved."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.19,"Firstly they didn't have enough room for us so we left. The hostess came and found us down the block as we were walking away to let us know space opened up at the bar!! Amazing customer service!!! Sat at bar started with 580 drink!! Amazing! Then had codfish fritters and edge blt which were both amazing. So much food and good prices. Great find!!! Can't wait to try dinner!Update: came here today for my bday brunch 10/7/17...as usual food was phenomenal but had two issues. 1) has reservation for 11 at 3pm, which they accommodated 3 Extra people last min, but had to wait over 30 min to get seated. Wasn't the best but it happens especially with big group.2) food for one person came out almost 20 later than everyone else because the order wasn't put in properly.Normally I can understand issues but I would've appreciated some sign of recognition from management for the wait on both counts (round of shots, comp drinks or comp apps) but it felt like it wasn't really acknowledged on that side unfortunately. The waitress & owner apologized but something more would've gone a long long way especially since we all arrived early and then basically waited for my birthday brunch."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.19,"Chill vibe, great food selection and beautiful graffiti art work on the overhead door. Came here with some friends for brunch on a sat. I had the avacado smash which was amazing and not overwhelming. My friend had the burger and fries. (Them fries were lit!) Staff was so helpful in food selection. Will be back again when I'm in the area! P.s. if you like ginger in your sorrell, get it!!!"
8/19/2017,20170819,5,4.19,"Saturday brunch for my daughter and I meant no reservation for us since we were a party less than 6.So we decided to arrive shortly after 2 banking on a lighter crowd and we were right. In fact, tables were generously available by 2:45.I had ackee salt fish and my daughter had the jerk chicken and waffles. The waffles were disgusting. Very pretty to look at but so unfortunately dry. Comparable to eggo except not as light. #SadFace Hopefully they'll heat up a few waffle irons in the future.The jerk chicken though, was pretty good. Not as spicy as their jerk wings but they were delicious with the semi-sweet dumplings that were served with my dish.Loved the service! Loved the '580' cocktail and really adored the atmosphere. Wonderful, wonderful brunch.Love,Nicoleprettyhardbody.comHarlem, 2018"
8/20/2017,20170820,5,4.2,"This place is cozy and warm. It has a lovely brunch menu, and everything is served fresh. I came here for a brunch date and left super satisfied! Everything was delicious, and the food did not feel too heavy afterwards. (I especially recommend their bread pudding!) The workers are kind and welcoming. I had a lovely brunch."
8/22/2017,20170822,3,4.19,"I've been here 3 times. I've had the shrimp and grits twice. The first time they were extremely underwhelming... small tight shrimp in a watery red, flavorless sauce over really thick flavorless grits. The second time was all that plus half my shrimp were a darker color and smaller size, and were hidden under the more normal looking half. It looked like they tried to salvage the prior day's leftover shrimp. I didn't notice the old looking ones until after I had eaten a few off the top. I told the server, who looked and agreed they looked weird, offering to have the give me a new plate of food even though I had already eaten some. The food is already not that great, so shady moves from the kitchen just seals the deal for me trying this place again."
8/26/2017,20170826,2,4.18,"First off --This place gave me the worst food poisoning I've had in a long time. I should've said something when the soup was half cold and half hot (clearly unevenly microwaved), or when my salad came and the chicken on it had the consistency of the fake Oscar Meyer chicken in the shrink wrap. Not sure which one did it but it was the only food I had that day. The food tasted awful. In general, the service was bad. And why do restaurants still not know that you are NEVER supposed to ask your customers to reuse silverware from the course before?!?!  Never ever should you put my salad fork back on the table and expect me to use it for an unrelated course. The ONLY reason I gave two stars instead of one is the physical vibe and room is very cozy. That's it. The owners should find a way to actually have the restaurant live up to the room. And not make people sick."

(*** 2nd UPDATE: even more egregious, Juliet M has deleted her reply). Your reply is inexcusable and completely condescending. No, I don't say anything about a ""vast"" experience with food poisoning... and your dismissal of my complaint of the safety of your food, without any sort of apology, just defending your preparation techniques, is pretty reprehensible.  Soups, especially as a daily special, should not be cold in one part of the bowl and hot in another part. Chicken should not be rubbery and lettuce should not be wilted. Your response is astonishingly bad from a customer relations standpoint.... you have a lot to learn. It would've been better had you not replied at all. I've received contact from the NYC Dept of Health that I was planning to ignore (I was unaware that they automatically contact Yelp reviewers who mention food poisoning). But now that I've been condescended in this retort by the restaurant, perhaps I will follow through with the Dept of Health after all."
9/6/2017,20170906,4,4.17,"Favorite new find. The food was great, the menu is very eclectic and it was hard to choose a dish. It's a all day brunch menu enough I did feel it lacked egg dishes. The mimosas were great and so was the coffee, I did feel like I had to wait forever to order a coffee since the waiter didn't stop by our table after our initial order. Will go back for the food and ambiance"
9/15/2017,20170915,3,4.16,"I like the food is it amazing, no but it's good. I go there because I like the space and I want to partronized local business owners and the ladies who own this are nice. The wait staff not so much, there's one young lady who can be rude if you don't use terminlogy she agrees with to order your eggs. Nonetheless, I like to get there for brunch weekdays and hold my business meetings there. Unless you live in the neighborhood you will no know it's there. Noise level can get loud where you cannot hear your conversation but you know that going in. The less people the more average the noise level. They have a nice happy hour but it does get crowded. If you are close by try it you'll like the experience and enjoy you good eats."
9/15/2017,20170915,4,4.16,"Really good place actually. Has a mello feel to it, the vibes are great, and the music puts you in a chilled out zone. I got a BLT sandwich with fires, and salad was a perfect balance and was not to full, but satisfied."
9/17/2017,20170917,4,4.16,Came here for Sunday brunch with one other friend. I had the open face fried egg sandwich with a mimosa and we got the festival bread. The food was great- the service was fine. It was a little expensive for what you actually got though. The atmosphere was good - not too loud. However I would not suggest bringing your children here. We will probably go back.
9/23/2017,20170923,1,4.15,Ordered the shrimp and grits for brunch. My cooked shrimp were grey. They served me rotten food. Told the waiter and he took my food. Asked if I wanted to order something else. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with fries and it was awful. The sandwich was soggy. The fries were a weird texture. I couldn't get through the meal. Left most of the food on the plate. They comped the meal but it was a complete waste of time. Never going back. And it's sad because you want to support local businesses.
9/30/2017,20170930,4,4.15,"The aviance is good, staff was attentive, polite and informative. We ordered coconut fish with grits and a side of plantains, a veggie burger, a smash avocado with boiled egg and smoked salmon. The food with good so we decided on desserts, my husband ordered the chocolate bread pudding unfortunately here is not one vegan/dairy free dessert on the menu, hence the four stars, since desserts is my favorite part of the meal. For drinks, we had sorrel and ginger beer not over done with sugar, the favors through. In the words of my hubby, food fusion was on point."
10/6/2017,20171006,5,4.15,"This place has it all! Great ambiance, great service and most importantly great food. We came at the tail end of happy hour and we're able to get two glasses of wine for $4 each. I ordered the jerk wings and coconut rice, which were amazing, and my friend ordered the salmon burger which she enjoyed. What's even better is that the owners are two AA women.. great to support small businesses.. Will definitely be back more often!!"

10/9/2017,20171009,4,4.16,"This is a great spot in Harlem! Fairly new and friendly! It's very cozy-- great for a date night. They always deliver. I really love the brunch menu, and their specials are delicious! Jamaican, English, and New York style menu items grace the options. I usually get the avocado smash toast with smoked salmon! The only thing is that I feel that they are not quite family friendly. We have a little one, and they don't have any booster seats or high chairs. I understand that some places can't provide that service because of space, but it would be nice if they just had one!"
10/11/2017,20171011,5,4.16,"This is one of my favorite local restaurants. I live down the street and it's one of my go to places for brunch, happy hour and dinner. It's quiet and intimate for dinner during the week. Weekends this place is bustling with energy and people so be prepared to wait or get in early. They only have wine and wine based liquor but all the drinks I be had are delicious. The food is yummy too. I love the lamb burger and jerk chicken salad. The staff is great. No complaints here."
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.16,Well priced brunch specials. I had the coconut fish and grits and it was amazing! A steal for only $13. Had tons leftover.
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.16,This place is amazing. I really wish i could give it 6 stars. The host and servers are very polite. Small noisy place but man the food is amazing. Fast service. Had the jerk chicken and waffles and also tried and the cod fish fritters. If you are in the area you won't regret eating here. Everyday brunch. Love this place. I had to edit this post to talk about the Cheese cake . Wow. Love this place
10/16/2017,20171016,4,4.16,"I've been here a few times for both brunch and lunch and the atmosphere is very cozy. They have big windows and lots of tables and booths to sit at, which is nice. The menu is a mix of Jamaican and British cuisine and I've never been disappointed by the food. The staff has always been very nice here, and if you are in the area, I highly recommend coming here to check it out!"
10/16/2017,20171016,5,4.17,"A perfect place to go and dine on some incredibly prepared food & drink, and be in the presence of wonderful staff and fellow patrons. Their live music on Wednesday nights is one of my favorite things to experience after a long work day. This place has been my ""go to"" spot for most of my dining-out occasions (even if it's just for a quick-fix iced coffee [it's VERY good]). The food is fresh, flavorful, and piping-hot out of the kitchen. Their 580 drink is worth having with any meal, and the crab cakes are amazing. Most importantly, The Edge Harlem captures the beautiful essence of the neighborhood, and brings additional value to its already beautiful, rich history. Highly recommend."
10/18/2017,20171018,4,4.17,"I love this spot! When I walked in, I immediately felt the island vibes. The atmosphere is very relaxed and intimate. It's the perfect spot for a cozy breakfast. The Caribbean-inspired dishes are also an added bonus. Try not to drool when you're reading the menu. I ordered the three side items for $12: two eggs any style, bacon, and saut√©ed kale. It was delicious. I can't wait to try their Belgian waffle and curry chicken on my next visit!"
10/18/2017,20171018,5,4.17,This is my new favorite brunch spot! I had one of the specials... The Chef's Omelette and it was perfection! The mimosa is a generous portion too. Love the music and the atmosphere. Am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in NYC.
10/20/2017,20171020,3,4.17,"I'm only giving 3 stars because of my personal meal, the spot is adorable and I'm all for supporting women and sisters at that ! There doing there thing. BUT! I had high expectations for the jerk chicken with waffles and unfortunately the jerk chicken was extremely dry and the waffle just wasn't anything special at all. My mom had a burger and she said it was good nothing crazy but the best part of the meal was definitely the cod fritters those were amazing. I guess maybe we would have been better off not getting rum punches because they were definitely not tasting like rum punches we are accustomed to in the islands. But hey I felt the buzz lol. Overall the customer service was very nice and environment was very nice but the food I wasn't crazy for. And being this is a restaurant three stars is for the food I'm pretty sure that's the most important part of restaurant. At least for me it is"
10/29/2017,20171029,5,4.17,"Excellent ambience and service.... Great Food! The french fries are the bomb... Very casual, nice and cozy... Perfect for a rainy Sunday Funday...."
10/30/2017,20171030,5,4.17,I am so glad I stumbled upon this spot. It's tucked away on a quiet street and it's the perfect vibe. I got the black bean veggie burger and it's just so good. The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is amazing.
11/10/2017,20171110,1,4.16,"Let me start by saying that I will honestly and humbly say that their food is delicious. I'll be fair. But that customer service is so atrocious. It truly is a hit or miss, no in-between. And I'm tired of taking a gamble on which day I'm going to be treated kindly and which day I'll be treated like s***.Let me also point out that I have had good customer service a couple of times. Like, really great, attentive, personable, worthy of 20% + tip, type service. ***But for those days when you don't get that one awesome waitress or waiter, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SO BAD it will make you lose your appetite.I went in last Saturday, sat down by the bar. Since I am not ever in the business of jeopardizing anyone's job, I will not get too descriptive or say the name of my bartender. However, I will say that he was of the non-ethnic type and on the taller side. I sat at the bar by myself. A wonderful bar-back and/or waiter brought me a water immediately. After that, I sat just a barstool away from a couple who was wrapping up, and even smiled at the bartender to signal I'm here, and ready whenever. I was about 2 feet away from my bartender, and just a stool apart from the couple. I was completely ignored for 9 minutes (I watched the time on my phone). I even did a small wave twice, no avail. I watched this bartender laugh and speak with this couple for the longest (they did not order more food or drink). No one else was by the bar but me, the couple and him. By the time the bartender buckled down to my long gazing, he finally looked over at me (remember, he doesn't have to move much at all, I'm right next to the couple) and said, ""Hey, didn't see you there. Can I get you a drink? Our kitchen won't reopen for another 10 minutes since we just closed for brunch and we're switching to the dinner menu."" Now, guys- this restaurant has a very specific (and delicious) weekend only, brunch menu and I came right before that brunch was ending. I am good for about a $50 spend since I enjoy their more pricier items (Ackee, Saltfish, festival and that yummy 580 drink). I also throw a waffle in there sometimes since I enjoy both a savory and sweet brunch! Not to mention, I'm a gracious tipper.Even if I wanted to believe that the brunch would've still been over since I came in just moments before the cut off (I came in around 4:30 and dinner starts at 5:00, I guess it cuts off and switches some time around then), the fact that the bartender had to tell me that is just closed, meant he knows it's a possibility that I, like any other patron entering the restaurant and teetering the brunch/dinner hours, would've expected brunch as an option. I would've loved to hear that news TEN minutes before I wasted my time. So I said, ""Does that include the ""Saltfish and Festival option?"" and he said, ""Yep!"" He did not go on to suggest ANYTHING else. He just looked at me with a blank stare and kept silent.I said thank you, walked outside and walked over to Manhattanville Coffee since I'm starving at this point. When I got there, they were so sweet and warm. When my coffee came out, the barista/server made conversation and I said, ""You know man, I'm so livid right now, you have no idea. I just came from a restaurant nearby and I'm so disgusted at this encounter I had, I could fight (laughs)"" I promise you the first thing this guy said was, ""I always hear about how terrible the service is at The Edge. I'm sorry to hear you went through that too.""I asked him how did he know I was talking about The Edge and how did he know I meant an employee - and not a fellow customer - had me disgruntled. He said, with no exaggeration folks, ""Well, you said the restaurant was nearby and I took a guess that it was an employee. We've had customers come in here before after they leave there, complaining about the same thing."" It was the final thing he said that really was the kicker though, which was:""It sucks because their food is really good."" I laughed and agreed like, ""I know! And I'm totally going to miss their festivals because they will never get a dime of my money again. Ugh!"" So, in conclusion, I'd hate to punish a small business but I'm sure my little bit of coins doesn't dent their pockets. However, ideally, I think it would be great if they had a training (or re-training) course on customer service because clearly their reputation is not the best.RIP to my seat at the The Edge. I'll miss that food but not that attitude."
11/13/2017,20171113,5,4.16,"I was looking for new location for brunch and I'm so glad i popped in here today. The food is amazing and Ale B our waitress was so sweet and attentive. The atmosphere was calm and cozy. My boyfriend and i started off with the avocado smash with smoked salmon, which was amazing !, then we shared the Belgian waffle and the English breakfast. Everything was great, will be coming here again !"
11/18/2017,20171118,3,4.16,Three stars.One star because it's a beautiful spotOne star for good staffOne star for desert.The meal was not good I wouldn't spend 26 dollars on shrimp and rice and plantain again.The rice was dry.The shrimp flavors didn't make sense.. Conflicting sweet with spice.The plantain wasn't even fried properly...So the food is a heck nah.The cod fish fritters was.. Okay. 5 out of 10.The desert.. Bread pudding was 10 out of 10.If I go again I'll get fish and chips... With that desert. That's it.Oh and the sorrel was excellent.
11/24/2017,20171124,5,4.16,Ammmmazzzing i would truly recommend and comeAgain truly outstanding service and menu choice no complaints
11/26/2017,20171126,5,4.16,Love this place. Food is excellent and vibe is very relaxed. Prices are reasonable as well. Best brunch and breakfast restaurant in the neighborhood.
11/27/2017,20171127,5,4.17,Great spot for breakfast. But we also enjoyed a light meal of blackened salmon with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. It was excellent.
12/3/2017,20171203,3,4.16,"I love that this spot is in the neighborhood - it has really livened up our otherwise fairly sleepy street (that only featured two churches within a couple blocks, and a neighborhood chess club to date). Sometimes on weekends, people are waiting outside the restaurant for a table (signs of gentrification! We've made it!). After gazing at the restaurant on every walk home, I finally stopped in for a quick lunch and had the fish and chips. The Edge's take on it involves using sweetened coconut flakes to coat the fried fish, making the overall fish a lot sweeter than you would expect. The fish itself was huge but otherwise bland - wish there was some salt to offset the coconut. The fries were fine. Haven't had a chance to come back to try anything else, and definitely not clamoring to do so, but wish the food was better to draw me back."
12/5/2017,20171205,2,4.16,"The Edge is overpriced American/West Indian food. Jerk Chicken Cesar Salad was a joke. I also had their burger which was nothing to brag about. The cod fish fritters was the biggest disappointment. Barely any codfish and mostly potato, to top it off it's small. I think the Edge is good for the atmosphere, it's a cozy little restaurant that is also a cafe. Go for coffee and a pasty but not West Indian food. To to East Flatbush, Brooklyn for that"
12/9/2017,20171209,4,4.16,"Went on a snowy Saturday morning and it was packed. As a native harlemite who has spent time in England, I felt at home while here. Ordered the Eggs Benedict with bacon and it was delicious. I will be coming back more often. I truly enjoyed this restaurant."
12/13/2017,20171213,4,4.15,"The Edge brunch menu is so delicious! I've had the pancakes, shrimp & grits, and the veggie burger. I am never disappointed when I go eat there. The place is quite small so the wait time is often very long but it is worth the wait. For my drinkers, the mimosas are so great! The hibiscus mimosa is my ultimate favorite. The reason I am not giving The Edge a 5 star is because the customer service is not always the best. I try to be understanding at the overwhelming amount of customers so it does not bother me too much but I don't really know what to expect when I go there. Overall, I certainly recommend taking a trip to this restaurant if you can!"
12/14/2017,20171214,5,4.16,"Nice chill vibes, good food, can't ask for more, great coffee.........................."
12/16/2017,20171216,5,4.16,So so so good. I'm from South Texas and the Edge burger was NOT a disappointment. Love the vibe of this place and my family loved it too. Really delicious.
12/17/2017,20171217,4,4.16,"Came here for brunch and enjoyed their veggie burger and fried plantains. We ordered mimosas which were good but were a bit on the bubbly side. Otherwise, good atmosphere with chill music. Good spot for brunch in Harlem."
12/20/2017,20171220,4,4.16,"I stumbled upon this hidden gem in Harlem a few Sundays ago. Very intimate setting. Although the place is tiny, it leads a huge impression on your taste buds. My food was very tasty. I had the shrimp and grits with a cheddar basil biscuit. I preferred a sangria, however, it was very strong and dry. The service was very fast and we were instantly seated upon arrival on a busy Sunday afternoon. Nice experience."
12/24/2017,20171224,3,4.16,The space is cute and the food is just okay. Always packed when I walk by. I would go here for drinks with friends but will skip out on the food.
12/29/2017,20171229,5,4.16,The food here is amazing. Really amazing. Our server Brooks was so friendly and made us feel at home. It's a great place to make memories with your friends. Definitely coming back here
1/2/2018,20180102,5,4.16,The food here is amazing! Our server Brooks was so friendly and made us feel at home. Its a great place to make memories with your friends. Definitely coming back here!
1/7/2018,20180107,2,4.15,"The owner complaint that he was busy lol. He literally said he had a line outside, why couldn't people cook at home. The place is small. A bit over price. Food is okay."
1/9/2018,20180109,5,4.16,The food was smashingly delicious! Lisette was a charmer and was so sweet! We hated to leave the chic neighborhood hang out for Great food and beautiful people watching!!!
1/10/2018,20180110,4,4.16,"I went to the Edge on Tuesday night with my daughter for a quick bite. I was surprised how busy it was for a Tuesday. The staff was extremely friendly from the second we walked in. The atmosphere was quite comforting and the sign when you enter ""No WiFi, No screens, just connect"", tells you everything you want to know. I had the pork chops, which were not quite what I expected, our waitress, Tee, who was very attentive and friendly, was quick to swap it out for some Cajun chicken without any hassle. The Cajun chicken was fabulous!I will definitely be returning and highly recommend The Edge to anyone looking for a good meal in a wonderfully warm atmosphere."
1/10/2018,20180110,5,4.16,"This place was the cutest cafe!! The atmosphere was great, the staff was awesome (especially when my bf didn't like the usual lemon water and got him regular tap water) and overall an enjoyable time! I got the waffle and the plantains and I couldn't seem to be able to put them down, not to mention they give you a decent size as well. 10/10"
1/16/2018,20180116,5,4.16,"My coworkers and I are obsessed with the Edge. It's like a drug to us. A lil pricey to get lunch on a regular day, like $16 for a chicken caesar salad, bummer. On Friday's we get free lunch so you know we are very excited about that! The food is great, the service is really good. Nice clean place. The owners are nice and very professional. They definitely know how to run this place. I've never had their brunch or dinner but I've pretty much tried about 7-8 items from the menu and everything is great! Can't wait for Friday!!"
1/18/2018,20180118,5,4.16,Food is amazing. Pancakes are delicious - don't even need syrup on them. Also had the coconut fish sandwich - highly recommend.
1/22/2018,20180122,4,4.16,"Nice, cozy venue with an occasional live band. Good food, average service. I will definitely come back. A good place to hang with a few friends."
1/28/2018,20180128,3,4.16,Great ambiance and atmosphere overall. What needs improvement is the service. I know the restaurant isn't huge but to only have 1 server during Sunday brunch is inconvenient. It was difficult to get the server's attention when we needed anything and they barely checked back in to see how our food was. One of our guests had found a hair in her food and to flag the server down for that was a long process. Now the good thing was that they replaced her meal immediately which was nice. This place usually never disappoints but this trip was far from pleasing
1/28/2018,20180128,5,4.16,"Cutest place, perfect for brunch! Very friendly staff, good vibes and music. Great food!"
1/29/2018,20180129,5,4.17,"Came here for Brunch and the food was amazing! I had the ackee and salt fish with festival and kale 10/10. Everything was seasoned well. I also had the 580 drink. Very delicious and also big so definitely worth the price. The only down fall of this place is it's size. It opened at 11 and we got there at 11:09 and all seats were taken. We had to sit at the bar. With that being said, I'd say get there early for brunch or make reservations. I'll definitely be returning here."
1/29/2018,20180129,4,4.17,"As soon I entered The Edge Harlem, I was immediately greeted by a hostess. Even though I had to wait for about 30 minutes before I could sit; I did arrive around their time for brunch so I couldn't complain too much. Once I was able to be seated, I didn't have to wait long for my order to arrive. I enjoyed it very much and this is definitely one of favorite places for lunch."
2/2/2018,20180202,5,4.17,Excellent attentive service and the meal was delicious. My partner got the coconut burger and it was amazing. And I got the pancakes which were very good the cream on top is to die for and the fresh berries were ripe and delicious. Also had the passion fruit and ginger misosas which were also great.
2/3/2018,20180203,4,4.17,Great place for brunch. I had the shrimp and grits and a homemade waffle. The shrimp and grits were delicious and also the reason I gave this place 4 stars. They have a selection of mimosas you have to try! I had a mango one and it was perfect. Definitely going to be one of my go to places to eat in Harlem!
2/10/2018,20180210,2,4.16,First off the waitress took about 30min to ask us if we wanted a drink. We wanted to ask her about drinks and told her we needed alil time to decide she didn't come back for 40min-_- . When she comes back we order are Food with the drink because we know it will be another decade before she comes back. I got the oxtails with wide rice and vegetables it cost 25$ which was way over priced and it tasted like regular beef stew and my drink cost 14$ !!!!!!! Way to much for a drink. the atmosphere is great but everything else is a no and I almost slipped on the wet floor
2/12/2018,20180212,4,4.16,"So, I finally checked out The Edge, after wanting to go for ages.The place was packed, which my buddy and I took for a good sign, so after having the hostess tell us that we'd probably have to wait 15-25 mins, we decided to take a walk to the new art gallery on ACP. By the time we got back, our table had already been given to someone else (twice) but there was room at the bar, so we sat there. The brunch menu offers three types of cuisines: Jamaican, English and American. We both went with Jamaican.My friend got the crab cakes. They came with a salad and plantains. I got the ackee and saltfish, kale and festival (fried fritters) the meal I always get, when I'm lucky enough to find it on the menu. We both ordered the ginger margarita for our cocktail.My favorite part of the meal, besides my companion's company was the cocktail. It was made with fresh ginger and had a nice bite.The meal portions were fairly large, definitely enough for a doggie bag. The saltfish was a little watery and there wasn't much ackee on the plate, but once I doused it with hot sauce, it got pretty tasty. The festival fritters were delicious, and the kale was well seasoned. The crab cake my friend ordered had an off putting smoky taste, so she couldn't eat them. She found the rest of her meal tasty, though.When one of the owners saw that she hadn't eaten her crab cakes, she asked if she wanted something else. She didn't so they removed her meal from the check. Which we both found pretty classy.I'll definitely return, maybe not for brunch, but definitely for that ginger margarita."

2/18/2018,20180218,4,4.16,"That 580 drank ALONE is the reason I'd return multiple times!! Codfish fritters were reallllly tasty. That jerk lime dip even better.The ackee and saltfish could have done with some more seasoning. I personally like my dish with more traditional strong flavors like thyme, pepper, garlic. The greens were nice and tender! The festival was perfect. Like wow LOL, haven't had perfect Festival like that since being in Jamaica. No but seriously...I'm coming back for endless 580's and codfish fritters!!!"

The food is delish. Been there for dinner and brunch. Th food is Caribbean, English and soul food fusion. Brunch I had jerk chicken and waffles, dinner I had the roast chicken meal- both tasted awesome. The owners are sisters probably in their 30s. They're super sweet and welcoming. I recommend this place for any day and any time. You would not regret it."

All were excellent, and there were many other items on the menu I wanted to try (like the eggs, shrimp, and grits). The people at the next table told us the chicken curry is to die for, but it was not on the menu that day."

The berry pancakes were amazing and clearly fresh off the griddle. The edges were perfectly crispy and they were fluffy inside. The open faced fried egg sandwich is basically just the avocado toast with a fried egg on top and a side salad. That one was alright, not as good as the pancakes. I came around noon on a Saturday for brunch and it was packed. We didn't have any trouble getting a table, but pretty soon after us a wait started to form, so keep that in mind if you have a larger group."

3/13/2018,20180313,1,4.18,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday around 4:30 PM. When we arrived, a waitress greeted and told us they were transitioning from brunch to dinner which would be served at 5 PM. I wasn't sure I wanted to wait so my bf and I stepped aside and discussed. 30 minutes? I was starving but 5 PM would be here in no time. We decided to wait. Another ridiculously rude and unprofessional woman looked to us and I told her we'd be staying. She tells us we can either sit at the bar or at a table. I ask for a table. She points at a table in the back and motions for us to sit. Hesitant, we found our way to the table and my bf and I both looked at each other as soon as we sat down. As many restaurants as we've been to, this was the first time a waitress did not grab 2 menus, ask us to follow her to our table before waiting for us to sit, handing us the menus and telling us either she or someone else would be with us shortly. Is this or this not standard practice?We waited for menus and water for 15-20 minutes. Not once were we acknowledged until a young man came and hastily placed the two on our table. Finally, we decided to leave and go elsewhere. On our way out the young man that served us the water and menus apologized nonchalantly.We've been to busier restaurants on a Sunday afternoon and have never experienced anything like this. We came here on a recommendation but I won't be recommending this place to a soul."

On our way out the young man that served us the water and menus apologized nonchalantly.We've been to busier restaurants on a Sunday afternoon and have never experienced anything like this. We came here on a recommendation but I won't be recommending this place to a soul."
3/19/2018,20180319,2,4.17,"I ordered the veggie burger with plantains and salad to take to go. The lady at the counter helped me right away, ordering by phone was easy. The plantains were nice and sweet, the salad (lettuce) with dressing was great. The veggie burger was not good. I reread the menu and no where was it listed to have cheese on this burger. The burger was over cooked, thin and crispy around the edges. The roll of the burger was good. I don't know if I will return."
3/20/2018,20180320,5,4.17,"Good breakfast spot. The pancakes are nice and fluffy and kind of huge. Their chicken sausage is really flavorful. I tasted the Parmesan grits, but didn't really taste Parmesan. Nevertheless, everything was delicious! The waitresses were extremely friendly, so I give the overall experience a 5/5"
3/25/2018,20180325,5,4.17,"Great food! Amazingly, small cozy spot. The food was so go good I was on a date so we decided to just eat buffet style because we couldn't choose. The curry chicken with coconut rice was too good. They have a great menu with many different selections based upon different countries (Jamaica, USA, France) I highly suggest as a low key brunch/breakfast place"
3/26/2018,20180326,5,4.18,"The food here is delicious and has a nice kick to it. My friend and I loved the codfish fritters and crab cakes. The rum punch is really good. For a step up, try their rum punch with a champagne twist. Can't wait to come back and try some other items on the menu!"
3/29/2018,20180329,2,4.17,"My waitress was sweet, but the atmosphere was on the hipster side and that really isn't my vibe, making my endless wait for everything kind of excruciating. Upon arrival my bacon wasn't fresh and my waffles had the texture of being over-beaten, the only thing that was up to par were my drinks. I don't think it's anything you need to go, but maybe you live in the neighborhood and want to day drink... if that's the case, do stop in, they have a bar you can sit at and you can skip the revolutionary-bs taking place at the tables."
4/1/2018,20180401,4,4.17,"This place is a very intimate and trendy setting. It fills up fairly quickly due to the size and popularity it's gotten so far. It's located on a quiet street where there isn't much noise. They don't have a television or WiFi so it encourages healthy physical communication with whomever you're eating with. I came here with family, 2 kids with 4 adults during brunch and The food was really good! I had the jerk salad with shrimp and I've never ordered a salad from anywhere before because I've always been afraid that it's not filling but it was pretty good. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food also. Would definitely come back to see how dinner is."
4/3/2018,20180403,5,4.17,"Came here for a late breakfast after the gym and it was such a nice experience the food was amazing. I had the shrimp & grits with turkey bacon and a sorrel, it was too damn good. Definitely coming back for dinner and brunch"
4/4/2018,20180404,3,4.17,This place was just okay. On the pricy side and not a lot of food. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.17,"I've been to The Edge Harlem soooo many times. I live in Brooklyn and anytime I'm in Harlem, I make sure to visit The Edge. The venue is super small and they don't take reservations. It's gotten popular so the waiting can go up to an hour and a half... but the experience is amazing! I love their food and drinks! Their sangria tastes soo good! I've had several different dishes. First I had the smoked salmon benedict. I always give this dish a 5/5 because I just love the combination of a plain bagel, smoked salmon, unions, and cream cheese. Yum, yum, yum! Second, I had the waffles with scrambled eggs and fresh fruits. I love waffles for brunch and they make sure not to let me down. Waffles and eggs are fluffy, just how I like them! Lastly, I had their shrimp and grits! It is OUTSTANDING! That's all I'm going to say about that. You're going to have to visit and taste for yourself! ;)"
4/5/2018,20180405,5,4.17,I came here for brunch. Food was filling yet healthy. Vibe was cool. Music soothing and staff was attentive. Drinks are yum!
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.17,This is a hidden gem with amazing food! Loved breakfast here and would definitely come again.
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.18,"Took My Mom here Today For her Bday Brunch.This Place is Everything.The Owners Accommodated us with seating And Continuously checked on us.The Staff is wonderful,The Food is Awesome,And the Atmosphere is Amazing.This is the place to be.They made moms day Wonderful."
4/14/2018,20180414,5,4.18,"This place was awesome from start to finish. It was worth the 30min wait to eat here. The service and food were exceptional. I love small neighborhood gems like this that offer great food and drinks at affordable prices. We all know brunch can cost an arm and a leg most times. My group of three ate and drank for a little over $100 with tip! Such a great deal. We left stuffed and happy. I had the best spiced pancakes topped with whipped cream and berries. The pancakes are stacked three high and are very filling. The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was delicious and a must have, I think. if you come for weekend brunch be sure to check the board for the specials. The Benedict was on special for $14 and it came fries and a side salad. I will be back here soon to try more things from the menu because it all looked so good. I think anyone willing to wait for a table will be happy they did! Tip: reservations not accepted for parties less than 5 people."
4/14/2018,20180414,5,4.18,"Awesome spot found on a whim. Great service, delicious food and the atmosphere is dope. If you are in the area, make it a must stop."
4/22/2018,20180422,5,4.18,"Love this neighborhood spot. The owners are also always involved in the operations of this place which makes it even more of a treasure. If you want to dine here on the weekend, arrive early because people are waiting outside before the restaurant opens. Some of my favorites are the cod fritters and avocado toast . Most recently I had the ackee salt fish, a Jamaican dish. This dish is not for everyone but if you want to try authentic a Jamaican, this is a good start. The services is also generally good. I don't think the staff comes to table often enough but my experience is that this behavior isn't off putting, it's just not the standard here. Lastly the ambiance is great, bricked and industrial with an artsy vibe. Love this place! Highly recommend!Just went back and had the curry chicken - the shit!!! Is All can say - I will be getting this every single time"
4/23/2018,20180423,5,4.19,Flawless. It's so amazing. So delicious and yummy. Kudos for the almond milk options and honestly there is something for everyone on the menu. You also can inform them of your dietary restrictions. I can't begin to describe the coconut fish- it's perfection. The overall experience was great too. Will be back and will bring people. Excellent music too!
4/28/2018,20180428,4,4.19,"I love this place! The staff are very friendly and whenever I am in the area, I make sure to go for dinner or a drink. The place is small and they don't take reservations. I gave it 4 stars because I've had slow service on several occasions, but otherwise, I love their food and drinks!"
5/2/2018,20180502,5,4.19,The food and service is amazing. The entire menu will have you undecided as there are so many great options.
5/3/2018,20180503,4,4.19,"Went for breakfast, very small but basics. I love that they infused the water with herbs, that was a plus. We had pancakes and tasteless eggs. My husband had grits and shrimps that wasn't bad at all. If you are looking for simple breakfast with a modern twist this the place but it get really crowded and the servers will forget about you."
5/5/2018,20180505,4,4.19,"I went to this restaurant, with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. I must say the food and atmosphere are‚Äã great. The took our order and we did not wait long for our food too‚Äãarrive. The food was well prepared and pretty. The crown is very sociable and it gets pack very quickly. Its a cute little cozy spot in Harlem. Cons: We go on Sunday morning‚Äã, and the female bartender is not friendly at all. She is not social and does not smile. She acted as if‚Äã she didn't want us to order food from here. If you want the job you have to play the part. Smile and be a bit friendlier, it goes a long way.I will go back, but I will not sit at the bar; I'll just wait for a table."
5/6/2018,20180506,4,4.19,"Today, I had a brunch outing with my folks. The wait time for the establishment is about 25 to 45 minutes due to the crowd (it was very busy). The hostess was very friendly. The establishment is small, and our waiter was okay. The food was delicious and would recommend everyone to come out and experience The Edge. Richard S.Satisfied Customer"
5/6/2018,20180506,4,4.19,"Came here to celebrate our friends birthdays and the upcoming birth of their baby boy. The place was smaller than I thought it would be but we manage to fit in there comfortably. The menu catered to alot of different tastes and the food was delicious. I ordered the Bagel with Smoke Salmon and requested that the be bagel be toasted. It wasn't toasted but because it was so busy, I didn't press it. All the others was very pleased with their orders. The Veggie Burger received a great review from a friend who normally eats meat. One other thing, we bought a cake to celebrate and was told there was a $25 additional charge to slice the cake, which I have never heard of a thing but we had no choice. I picked this place because of the reviews and was even more impressed by the amount of people who were waiting to be seated. I sent an email request for our party but it was few days before I heard a response. Justine finally called and apologized because she placed me on the calendar but forgot to send me an email back."
5/8/2018,20180508,4,4.19,"Classic edge cafe. Love this little gem in Harlem. Food can be described as West Indian/Caribbean. They have great specials which they seem to change often and the price is good. Pros: cozy. Versatile, good for studying, drinks, and food/brunch with friends. The food is SUPER tasty and consistent every time I come here. I always recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. Never been here for dinner but it's probably just as good. They have great coffee options as well with a barista making drinks at the coffee bar. They have non-dairy milk options too! (Coconut and almond if I'm not mistaken). Random pro, but they have really good tap water lol. I think they infuse it with mint or berries or something, but it's so refreshing! I had the jerk chicken and waffles and the chicken was marinated so well! Not too spicy but not too dried out. Cons: which aren't many. But the place is a little tight. And since it's always crowded, everyone's talking at a slightly loader volume, and because you're so close to the person sitting next to you, it's even louder. But if you don't mind cozy, come on down. Service was also kinda slow. But I attribute that to it being busy that day. No biggie. Nothing to call the manager about."
5/9/2018,20180509,4,4.19,The edge was cool. The jerk wings was a little to spicy for me. I get it they r suppose to be spicy but those wings cleared my sinuses lol. I really did not care for the codfish fritters. But I did like that 504 drink it hit the spot. I think I will try this spot for brunch next time I did enjoy the feel of the restaurant.
5/10/2018,20180510,4,4.18,This is my go to brunch spot (for right now). They have a brunch menu daily and a special weekend brunch. No matter what you order make sure you try their signature rum whipped cream that comes with the pancakes or waffles! I swear I could find a way to put it on anything if i had to. I love how the menu is broken up by location. Jamaica... England... America... there's something for everyone! The daily chef specials are always a hit (or so I've noticed as I stalk the food as it leaves the kitchen). And to top it off... my favorite brunch drink... the 580¬∞ Champagne with sorrel in a huge glass... De-li-cious!!!! The place is very small probably only seats about 40-50 people so the be prepared to wait at least an hour for brunch. No standing room inside... so be prepared to stand outside!! I guarantee you it will be worth the wait. I only gave 4 stars because I've been here at least 6 times to eat and once I order eggs scrambled with cheese and I got a plate of cheese with an egg. It was gross. Also the place was super crowded once and my pancakes were clearly sitting on the plate way too long before i got it. No way to make the butter melt but to send it back unfortunately! Other than these 2 snafu's I will definitely be back!!
5/13/2018,20180513,5,4.19,"Loved everything about this spot. Was on same block as my Airbnb and made waking up in the morning something to look forward to. It was as fun to people watch, the music was great and the food was awesome. Sorry but I forgot to take pics :-)"
5/18/2018,20180518,2,4.18,"I went here on mother's day and had breakfast. I tried to get there when they opened to get a seat but ended up at the bar. I had the shrimp and grits. They were not that great. The sauce that was used was meh..and the grits were bland. I had better elsewhere! There were at least 3 people rotating at the bar not one of them came to check on me, to see if I wanted more juice, water or condiments. I had to keep trying to get their attention. I know the place was packed because it was mother's day but the place is not that big. Maybe their lunch and dinner is better. But I don't think I will be going back to the Edge Harlem."
5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.18,There was no wait and there was seating for our party of 6.  The waitress was engaging and prompt. The drinks were very good.  The food was equally as good. Not one complaint about anything we ate. Key is getting hot food. It was
5/19/2018,20180519,4,4.18,"Flew in to NY last night and woke up at my vegetarian uncle's crib in Harlem dying for some eggs. He had none. So, in the midst of being inundated by news of Meghan and Harry's royal wedding, I did a quick yelp search and found The Edge. A bus ride later, courtesy of my unlimited metro card, here I am. Excellent spot! Very diverse crowd. Good energy. Ended up having the pancakes, which were superb. And the music is like I curated the playlist...a mix of jazz, soul, eclectic, muy bueno. Apparently, they also do live music on select nights. Will def return whenever I'm in town again. Bravo."
5/28/2018,20180528,5,4.19,"first time here ! had the jerk chicken & waffles with a side of eggs and grits. AMAZING !!!! the vibes were good and the service was great. will definitely come back, also added a 580 drink so sweet and tasty. make sure you come here when you are in new york!"
5/31/2018,20180531,5,4.19,"Omg I've found a little piece of Heaven. 4 words Rum infused whip cream. Bomb AF!! Idk where to start, since I went alone I sat at the bar and the bartender was very cool, really funny guy. Quickly brought water and a menu, both him and the young lady that brought out my food were very attentive. I ordered the Belgian waffle and fruit (the fresh blueberries and strawberries with the whip cream gave me life) scramble eggs and turkey bacon (not the normal rubbery turkey bacon but 3 thick pieces of Sweet and Juicy turkey bacon the Gods enjoy) and a glass of sorrel. I'm definitely coming back because I originally wanted to order the Ackee and Saltfish but they only serve that on the weekends."
6/4/2018,20180604,4,4.19,"Amazing Service! Kind people who actually care about you having a good meal. Great energetic vibe! Food way okay too, not the best every. Limited veggie options, but they do have them. Plaintains were delish! I would definetly return since the energy of where you eat is important to me!!"
6/9/2018,20180609,1,4.18,"As a patron who was excited to try this restaurant for the first time, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of decorum displayed by the waitresses at the edge. Several friends and I came for brunch and were seated quickly since we were a large party. Our waitress, a flippant woman with dreads and a poor attitude, took all orders except mine. When I flagged her down before she left the table she rushed to write my order down (with obvious disdain). 30min later she returned with eggs Benedict and when I clarified that I had ordered an EDGE BLT, she aggressively and rudely shove the pate into my face demanding I take it as she claimed ""this what you wanted!"" Again, I clarified that I did not and instead of placing a new order the plate was forced into face again as she argued with me. Not only was it insulting for her to insinuate I do not have the wherewithal to remember my own order, I was threatened and publicly belittled by her behavior. I'd you are looking for service with class, do not bother coming here. But if you'd like to experience good food and nice ambiance (excluding the waitresses) please stop by! But be warned: you will be insulted."
6/12/2018,20180612,4,4.18,"Just visited today with my buddy, I really enjoyed this nice spot, the service was prompt and seating was immediately, I went during lunchtime and had the island salad and my buddy had the watermelon, Aquila, feta, onions salad, we also had the gin-ga cocktails and we where pleasantly surprised everything was very good, will return."
6/13/2018,20180613,5,4.18,"Everything was SO good and the service was perfect. The jerk chicken Caesar wrap, shrimp and Parmesan grits and the pancakes are all great choices."
6/29/2018,20180629,5,4.18,"Wow, amazing place! The food is great, the service is great, the price is great! I can't find a better place for me. Please come here to eat!!!!!"
7/1/2018,20180701,1,4.17,My Best friend and i tried the Edges brunch on Saturday afternoon and it was less than memorable to say the least. We ordered shrimp and grits... and the food was bland ... the shrimp were so small and over cooked they were rolled into little balls. I am disappointed with the flavorless food and for that reason i will be sure to spend my money elsewhere. I'd suggest taking the dish off of the menu until you have developed a more appealing and flavor-packed recipe.
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.18,"#1 service is awesome & #2 the cuisine is exquisite and very creative, which I love. The restaurant is pretty small, and since everyone knows about their amazingness good luck getting a large table for brunch. This is a cool place for a first date, meet up with a friend, ""not too late night, night grub,"" or to just sit with a good drink (the 360 is YUM) or a cup of coffee. I definitely recommend and will go back. Staff is super friendly and helpful too!"
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.18,"Let me tell you about this place. I came on Wednesday morning and this place was jumping like it was a weekend brunch. The food was good, but the vibe and the drinks were everything. After one large rum punch i had to remind myself that it was too early to be getting tipsy lolTo make sure the Wednesday vibes wasnt a fluke, i went the following Monday and it felt like Day party Brunch. People were waiting in line to be seated. Those seated were laughing (either they were having a good convo or they too drank that rum lol)I have visted several spots and this is the first spot i went to on a Monday morning (no holiday) and was so live. I can only imagine how it is on the weekend!"
7/7/2018,20180707,5,4.18,"This place is en pointe as they say in French. We ordered the BLT w/a scrambled egg on top which was ginormous and delish. Also got the pancakes which actually tasted like buttermilk pancakes instead of watermilk pancakes. They also had the proper pancake slightly crispy edge. They were perfect. Lastly, the jerk chicken and waffles were juicy and fluffy. So yummy. I'm sad I just learned of this place but will def be back."
7/13/2018,20180713,5,4.18,This place is amazing! Service was a little slow bc just opening and only one server. I was so comfortable and felt so welcomed. The roasted tomato soup and festival were just tasty. Saw several people of color. Great place to spend ur hard earned coins.
7/17/2018,20180717,4,4.18,The bar was a little slow the food is awesome .... the wings are the bomb.i really didn't car for the Mendoza. If you have an allergy of seafood it's not the place for you.
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.18,"During a two-week stay in Harlem, I visited The Edge Harlem at least 4 times for brunch (kudos to brunch everyday) because the food is great, the spot is cozy and it's an awesome Black-owned eatery (can't be in Harlem and not support Black-owned businesses). I tried the Coconut Fish Burger (with the tamarind mimosas and a side of jerk chicken: see photo), Jerk Salmon (see photo), the Black Bean Burger and the Belgian waffle with turkey bacon. While I would recommend everything I tried, I would skip the waffle and go back for everything else because the first three dishes I mentioned came with mixed greens and sweet plantains. I would say go for any of those dishes because you get more bang for your buck (three delicious items for $20 or less...minus gratuity). I loved this spot for the hospitality, food and great brunch options."

We almost went somewhere else based on prior reviews mentioning how crowded they were on a random weekday morning, but pushed through, and were very glad we did!When we got there, the place was about 50% full, with a very relaxed and easy vibe. We picked a 2 top in a comfortable corner and settled in.Our waitress brought us a huge carafe of ice water right away, we also ordered two coffees to start.There is a regular menu and there was also a board of specials for the day. After a LOT of thinking, we went with:The avocado toast with fried egg and,The BLT and,a side of sweet plantainsGenerous portions and good quality. The BLT was HUGE and came with fries and a big salad. My toast came with a big salad as well.Wanting to really push it, we ordered the chocolate chip bread pudding.Very, very good. A generous portion, but not enough to leave you feeling over stuffed. Perfect!While I can't speak for crowds on the weekend, I would definitely recommend checking out The Edge if you are in the neighborhood looking for a nicer sit down breakfast.They also offer a 5% cash back on Yelp!"
7/26/2018,20180726,3,4.19,"I wanted to love this place.... I really really did but, it left much to be desired. Came on a Sunday around noon, 40 minute wait. No biggie. The host offers us seats at the bar...no thanks, more waiting until a table opens up. Finally inside and we are given menus and water quickly.I got the jerk chicken and waffles with a side of parmesan grits and my date got the pancakes with a side of bacon and eggs. My food comes out 10 minutes before hers... Why?? I didnt want to start eating without her but my waffles were getting cold so I dug in. The plate didn't look too appetizing as I received jerk chicken breast pieces instead of an actual chicken breast like shown on their website. I was disappointed.... Flavor wise it was spicy like jerk is supposed to be but way too salty and the waffles weren't anything special. No cinnamon or nutmeg, vanilla flavoring etc. They also were a bit hard (I took into the consideration that I waited 5 minutes before eating).My date gets her pancakes and they are huge and taste delicious (should have ordered those), but our side orders take another 10 minutes...when it finally arrives- the grits (nice flavor) eggs and bacon are on the same plate. *Head scratch* I don't know if they assumed we were sharing or they ran out of dishes but, it was sorta awkward scrapping things unto different plates. The woman bringing the food seemed to have an attitude when I inquired why our food was coming out in pieces..At this point I'm slightly annoyed so I say - screw it, l'll order a drink and hopefully it takes the edge off (no pink intended). Which brings me to the hugest let down of the meal- I ordered a 580- supposedly their grand slam drink and for $14 dollars I was hoping to feel something....anything. It came out and it looked like a sex on the beach mixed with a bit of tequila sunrise. I sip and I'm immediately underwhelmed. The drink has rum punch, champagne and sorrel... I tasted champagne and ice...LOTS of ice...like a watery champagne ice slushy. As if it was just a pretty drink with a splash of alcohol- seriously do you guys put alcohol in this?. Not worth the hype and damn sure not worth $14. As a Trini I was slightly insulted that this ""rum punch"" was being passed off as rum punch. Nope!Check comes $60+ for food plus tip-total of $75 bucks for average food (except the pancakes and grits) and a below average drink. Not planning on returning."

No cinnamon or nutmeg, vanilla flavoring etc. They also were a bit hard (I took into the consideration that I waited 5 minutes before eating).My date gets her pancakes and they are huge and taste delicious (should have ordered those), but our side orders take another 10 minutes...when it finally arrives- the grits (nice flavor) eggs and bacon are on the same plate. *Head scratch* I don't know if they assumed we were sharing or they ran out of dishes but, it was sorta awkward scrapping things unto different plates. The woman bringing the food seemed to have an attitude when I inquired why our food was coming out in pieces..At this point I'm slightly annoyed so I say - screw it, l'll order a drink and hopefully it takes the edge off (no pink intended). Which brings me to the hugest let down of the meal- I ordered a 580- supposedly their grand slam drink and for $14 dollars I was hoping to feel something....anything. It came out and it looked like a sex on the beach mixed with a bit of tequila sunrise. I sip and I'm immediately underwhelmed. The drink has rum punch, champagne and sorrel... I tasted champagne and ice...LOTS of ice...like a watery champagne ice slushy. As if it was just a pretty drink with a splash of alcohol- seriously do you guys put alcohol in this?. Not worth the hype and damn sure not worth $14. As a Trini I was slightly insulted that this ""rum punch"" was being passed off as rum punch. Nope!Check comes $60+ for food plus tip-total of $75 bucks for average food (except the pancakes and grits) and a below average drink. Not planning on returning."
7/26/2018,20180726,4,4.19,"Took a short walk with my daughter this morning to check out The Edge for breakfast. We almost went somewhere else based on prior reviews mentioning how crowded they were on a random weekday morning, but pushed through, and were very glad we did!When we got there, the place was about 50% full, with a very relaxed and easy vibe. We picked a 2 top in a comfortable corner and settled in.Our waitress brought us a huge carafe of ice water right away, we also ordered two coffees to start.There is a regular menu and there was also a board of specials for the day. After a LOT of thinking, we went with:The avocado toast with fried egg and,The BLT and,a side of sweet plantainsGenerous portions and good quality. The BLT was HUGE and came with fries and a big salad. My toast came with a big salad as well.Wanting to really push it, we ordered the chocolate chip bread pudding.Very, very good. A generous portion, but not enough to leave you feeling over stuffed. Perfect!While I can't speak for crowds on the weekend, I would definitely recommend checking out The Edge if you are in the neighborhood looking for a nicer sit down breakfast.They also offer a 5% cash back on Yelp!"
7/26/2018,20180726,3,4.18,"The food was great overall, but I recommend not going with a large party. I'd made reservations for 10, which we didn't know would be sat at a ""community table"" where a smaller party was finishing their meal/drinks. It was a little awkward at first because they weren't finished and unaware that a large group would joining the table. They were just as confused as us, but we were cordial with each other and we eventually had the table to ourselves. There were also some order mix-ups and the check had to be corrected because they added an extra meal. The kitchen closes at 4 for brunch, so desserts had to be ordered with our meals.I wouldn't recommend the sorrel; it wasn't sweet enough and it tasted like they added ginger beer to it.Food & Drinks: 4 out of 5Service: 3 out of 5"

7/27/2018,20180727,5,4.18,"This place was such a pleasant surprise. We went midweek at around lunchtime and were seated almost immediately. The waiters were really nice, it just took them a while to get back to us and get our orders in, then to bring them too. Once we got our food though.... WOW...we were soooOoo pleasantly surprised! We ordered their BLT with jerk chicken and it was amazing! The BLT was an explosion of flavors in my mouth! Such great taste!It was also nice because I have a gluten allergy and was expecting to only find salads as options, but they do offer gluten-free bread for their sandwiches.We also ordered mango mimosas. The mango mimosas were pretty good but it took them so long to bring it out that hey seemed pretty flat. Felt like they poured them and left them on the counter for a long time. They weren't as bubbly as expected . You could barely taste the mango too which was disappointing.We also ordered a side of plantains. These are MUST haves! Whatever you order... get a side of plantains. They are life!"

7/28/2018,20180728,2,4.18,"Talk about disappointment. We had to wait to be seated ~ 20 minutes after 1pm on Saturday. Ok no problem. The water was room temp on a hot 90 day. No ice. After we were seated the waitress completely forgot about us and after 15 minutes she said she thought we ordered. Why? do all black people look the same? Anyway, food was blah. The shrimp and grits were the worse that I've ever had. EVER. the Quaker instant are better than theirs.I know and love my grits. The pancake my daughter had were better but not great. This is no a kid friendly restaurant at all. Its too small and don't even offer a high chair. At no point did the waitress ask how we were doing, if we are enjoying the food, nothing. I honestly left $40 broker and hungry."

8/5/2018,20180805,2,4.18,"Went there for lunch on a weekday, we couldn't have picked a slower day, and yet they totally forgot / lost / didn't make our orders. It was messy! Since we had to go back to the office, we asked to just cancel the order, since they hadn't made it. They said it was being made right now and that I would be free of charge. Good for them to take ownership of it all but that kind of oversight in what had to be the slowest lunch hour ever... inspires little confidence no?"
8/9/2018,20180809,5,4.18,"This might be the cutest breakfast spot in Harlem! It's tucked away on the corner of 139th and Edgecomb. It's slightly quiet but there seemed to be a steady flow of customers. They serve brunch everyday! (The millennial's dream) The menu seems to feature a mix of Jamaican, English, and traditional New York/American breakfast and lunch dishes. I had the curry chicken and coconut rice special. It was ah-maze-zing!! So flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. You also get a very healthy portion (for about $16).My friend and I ordered three side dishes, but we probably didn't need to--we were full after eating the main dish. The service was great. They were super friendly. I highly recommend this place!"
8/9/2018,20180809,4,4.18,"The place is really cute and cozy. Pay attention to the special if you're looking for something in particular because the menu changes daily. The Jamaican food is not exactly authentic, but it's good. I'd call it more of an American brunch spot that occasionally offers a Jamaican breakfast."
8/12/2018,20180812,4,4.18,"Excellent first meal to start our trip. Loved the atmosphere, and everything we ordered was delicious. The server seemed a bit stand offish but overall a great time."
8/15/2018,20180815,4,4.18,"Smallllll is an understatement. We came for brunch, food is okay. We ordered the pancakes and the veggie burger; the pancakes are dense but good, the veggie burger had a lot going on but would have been great without the sauce. We sat at a large table with another party, which was weird to me but beat waiting for someone to decide to leave. Service was pretty attentive even though it took a while to start. The welcoming from the bar really sets the tone and is warm. I would give this spot another try and go for the edge burger or coconut fish burger. I really don't know how they survive on a busy day/night!"
8/16/2018,20180816,5,4.18,"My cousin and his girlfriend took me here for Sunday brunch and I absolutely loved it! It's located on a quiet corner on Edgecombe. It gets pretty packed on weekends and you will have to wait about 45 minutes to an hour for a table. Chill Caribbean vibes when you enter with Caribbean music. Pretty noisy inside. I love the concept of Jamaican, English, and New York foods.We ordered the rum punch and mango mimosa. Rum punch had the perfect touch of sweet and it was refreshing. Mango mimosa was strong on the champagne but that's how I like it.I ordered the jerk chicken and waffles. Large portions. I felt like I got half the chicken on my plate! Incredible jerk seasoning for the chicken and the waffles were fluffy and tasty with the fruit.This may be my new favorite neighborhood brunch spot! Can't wait to return to try more!"
8/16/2018,20180816,4,4.18,"Wait is long so prepare for that! However, cute spot. food, was pretty good, didn't really like their cappuccino but everything else was good. The place is small so small groups are best."
8/16/2018,20180816,2,4.17,"I do love the vibe of this restaurant, but I can't recommend it for gluten-free diners. Both wait staff and kitchen staff were very unknowledgeable about what items on the menu were safe, and it turned out that there were very few wheat-free options anyway. Even after letting my waiter know about my allergy when ordering, I still realized that the fries looked battered and asked him to double-check. Sure enough, not gluten-free. No one was really concerned about it, nor was any motion made to replace the item or discount my meal. ‚Äç I'm not a picky GF diner, but you gotta try to meet me halfway, folks. Especially this day in age. Very cute place though, so if you don't have dietary restrictions, you might enjoy it!"
8/16/2018,20180816,3,4.17,"As a former regular customer, I still enjoy the culinary choices of this establishment and acknowledge there are some employees here who have warm customer service habits. I would be remiss if I withheld my disdain for the lack of enthusiasm of the young lady behind the counter. When receiving my order and accepting payment, on several occasions her dryness created an atmosphere, which invoked feelings of displeasure. As a result, I frequent other restaurants with upbeat customer service  making the dining, and spending, experience enjoyably."
8/17/2018,20180817,5,4.17,This is my hood but I did not have the chance to check it out until now. I'm glad I did. I had the jerk salmon with plantains and salad. I was delicious. The service was great and it was pretty bustling for a Friday morning. The rum punch topped it all off. Will definitely be back.
8/19/2018,20180819,5,4.17,"The edge is one of my favorite restaurants to go eat. I have gone after work for an early dinner to catch up with friends and enjoyed brunch on the weekends. The portion size is just enough to fill you up without wanting to fall over and pass out. The food is just absolutely scrumptious!! I haven't had anything I in there I did not like. I love the ambiance and the vibe of this place. What is also refreshing is the bathroom always being clean. It speaks to the kind of clientele that frequents this place working professionals, entrepreneurs, neighborhood artist born and bred in Harlem. People clean up after themselves and this matters! - Clearly the clients care about this place as well. I just came for brunch yesterday and i'll be heading there for dinner this week."
8/26/2018,20180826,1,4.17,"I see that on here this place is severely overrated. There is nothing about this establishment that calls for a 5 star review, and, at this point, I now recognize that maybe my standards are higher than most. So for those looking for the recommendations of a real foodie, I caution you to stay away from this place. However, if you're looking for a cute drink, live music, and an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere, this is certainly the place for your little hipster heart. Let's get into my experience. I came here with my mother and her friend on a somewhat busy Wednesday evening. We waited about 7-10 minutes to be seated, which is nothing egregious. However, our party was seated at a community table with another party, which was kind of annoying, but again, not a major hit to the experience.Once seated, we were able to adequately review the menu, and I'd like to note that the restaurant prides itself on bringing together the flavors of Jamaica and England with an American twist. This is a red flag, as anyone in their right mind knows that there are no flavors of England. I mean, according to US History, England went on to ""conquer"" the new world in search of spices. So what exactly are the flavors of England that they speak of? SPOILER ALERT: it's blandness. This restaurant absolutely insults the rich culinary practices of Jamaica by muting all flavors and sprinkling the word ""jerk"" throughout the menu.For drinks, I ordered the tamarind mimosa. It was pleasant, but not mind blowing. My mother did a popular at home combo calling for a mix of ginger beer and sorrel. The sorrel lacked sugar - also an insult to Jamaican traditions.To start, my mother and I split the soup of the day, which was a ginger carrot soup served with festival. For those outside of Jamaican culture, festival is a fried cornmeal dumpling somewhat similar to a hush puppy and also one of my childhood favorite eats. The taste of the soup was nothing more than textured, hot ginger. The festival was entirely too doughy and likely the boxed edition calling for the cook to ""just add water"".For our entrees, I made the safest call with the fish and chips. The fish was supposed to be prepared with a coconut batter, but the product I received was actually just a regular piece of fried fish with fired coconut shreds on top. The fish itself was cooked perfectly. However, I was quite insulted when the server asked me if I would like to pair hot sauce with my fish. I mean who on earth would use hot sauce with coconut battered fish? Maybe a sweet chilli sauce, but certainly not hot sauce. Anyways, the fries were frozen, so thumbs down for that. My mother had the jerk chicken Alfredo. Aside from the name there was nothing jerked about the chicken. There was nothing but a single tingle of spice that indicated that maybe they tried to season the chicken. They may see better success with this dish if they followed the psuedo Jamaican recipe for Rasta pasta and threw in some bell peppers to give the dish some color and excitement. Her friend had the Salmon burger, which she said was dry and over priced.We did not order dessert, although I was tempted by the chocolate chip bread pudding. I love bread pudding, but I knew that they likely wouldn't be able to present anything worth digesting.In closing, I do not suggest eating here, but this would be a cute place to meet up for drinks."
8/26/2018,20180826,5,4.17,Definitely worth the wait! Delicious food at a reasonable price. Fast and friendly service. The atmosphere embodies the culture of the area. Don't cheat yourself by not eating here.
8/26/2018,20180826,4,4.17,"We went out as a family for my wife's birthday. We all enjoyed our experience from the ambiance to the service, meals and drinks. Nice English/Jamaican fusion cuisine. Never experienced anything like it before. Little pricey in my estimation but worth the experience. I've already recommended the Edge to friends. I'd definitely come back."
8/26/2018,20180826,5,4.17,I absolutely love this little place. Just moved to NY from ex and this is my brunch spot! Be prepared to wait a few minutes as they do fill up quickly! Want brunch and a delicious cocktail?! Come! The grits are the bomb and so is the 580 cocktail!
8/30/2018,20180830,5,4.17,Great placeLocated on ground level I ordered the avacado egg sandwich Loved it Good portionOur server is ale b she was great
9/1/2018,20180901,3,4.17,The food is GOOD. It's everyday brunch (NOT unlimited drinks) The service is less than average. My waitress seemed to be helping every table. I actually felt for her.
9/2/2018,20180902,5,4.17,"I had been told that brunch in Harlem is great, and found this place on Yelp as one of the highest rated places. Really cool and unique atmosphere created in this small but intuitively designed space. The staff was ultra friendly and super accommodating. The crab cakes were some of the best we've had. The jerk chicken and waffles was good, especially the chicken. I would have preferred a thinner waffle as the heaviness of the Belgian style waffle seemed to over power the jerk chicken, instead of compliment it. Overall, we give this place 5 stars because of the authenticity of the menu, attentive and accommodating staff, and unique atmosphere. The food was great too regardless of my preference of thin waffles to thick ones. Plus, it's easily accessible by the C train! Also close to the Apollo Theater! Wonderful experience."
9/3/2018,20180903,2,4.17,This is a nice spot; intimate with good music and vibes. Our meals came out 10 minutes apart. This is unacceptable. The crab cakes were not seasoned well; and the slaw with with the spice shrimp was bitter (needed citrus). Drinks are weak. Fruit flies.
9/3/2018,20180903,1,4.16,I came here for my 1st visit and walked in and a server kept walking back and forth never bother to say a word! Then finally a tall lady came from the other side of the room with no greeting and acted like it was no big deal what a way to welcome your customers act like they are not even there won't be back missed opportunity for a new customer !
9/3/2018,20180903,2,4.15,"The food was not good at all. Crab cakes needed seasoning and fish very tough.Thank God the French Fries were decent as well as the wine . First time here . Will not recommend this place at all . It sucks ,thought this place would have had better quality food . Bartender was nice and wait staff tried doing there best but food did not meet expectation."
9/8/2018,20180908,2,4.15,"I wanted to love this place but the waitstaff seemed way too busy to focus the day I visited. It took them over 20 minutes to take our order, then they brought me the wrong order, then they delivered my correct order to another table as I sat waiting for 20 more minutes to get my new dish. At that point I had been there for about an hour, all to receive coconut fish and parmesan cheese-less grits :(. After all that waiting, I didn't even get the delicious grits I smelled in the vicinity and wanted so badly. It tasted like grits out of the canister. The fish however, was tasty. I'm chalking this up to hopefully just a fluke but I'm pretty disappointed about this experience."
9/8/2018,20180908,5,4.15,"One of my colleagues was celebrating their birthday and this was the closest and had the best happy hour. We were a party of 10-12 and since it was during the week we didn't make reservations. The customer service was good; the waiter and bartender were very accommodating considering we didn't make reservations which I truly appreciated. The happy hour is from 4-7:Wine is $5Beer is $4Rum bunch is $6I ordered the fish and chips and it was so good. I liked that the fries were nice, plump, and crispy and the fish was more like a coconut crusted batter which was good and added texture; I loved it!Everyone said their food was good and I can believe it. If I ever get off of work early I would definitely come back."
9/11/2018,20180911,4,4.15,"My first remark upon entering was 'it smells good in here'. It was a good sign. I really like this spot. Small, intimate, beautiful artwork on the walls. The staff was super friendly and nice. I had the codfish fritters which were awesome, and the salmon burger, also great. My dinner partners ordered the trout, and the jerk Caesar salad. No complaints. Also the bread pudding dessert was nice. I am definitely going back sometime."
9/15/2018,20180915,3,4.15,"I came here last week and had the blt. The service was okay and so was the food. The place looks really nice but it's very small. Now to my favorite part of any meal, the drinks. Beer and the rum punch were sooo weak I asked to get a shot for my rum punch. Still didn't do anything. I was disappointed with the drinks. Overall this was a nice place but I didn't enjoy myself as I typically do on a brunch."
9/21/2018,20180921,4,4.15,I've lived in this area for five years now and it's cool to see new places popping up around my apartment as it isn't the most hopping spot in Manhattan. The Edge has been here the whole time I have and I love it. It's nestled in away from any of the more bustling spots of Harlem making it a true hidden gem. The inside provides a cozy comfy atmosphere for good conversation. I've only been for breakfast but was always pleased with my meal. The options are pretty limited when it comes to food but what they do provide is yummy :). Staff is friendly and welcoming. A great neighborhood local spot that I'm happy is still around.
9/22/2018,20180922,4,4.15,I went there for breakfast it was right near my college and perfect spot for a quick breakfast grab. Reasonable price but doesn't have much options for vegetarians or non meat eaters. I was craving for something sweet and my friend was craving for something fruity. We both did get what we wanted but it was a bit higher than our price range and the place also contains a bar and it wasn't pleasant for any of us as we are non alcoholic. But it's a great spot for hangout and to grab a little snack.
9/24/2018,20180924,4,4.14,"I absolutely loved the jerk Caesar chicken wrap I ordered! I'm pretty sure that will be my go to. It was surprisingly well made and pretty fulfilling as I only ate half of my wrap and had a bunch of fries left to take home. I wouldn't recommend ordering the jerk salmon though. My friend ordered it and was unfortunately not satisfied at all. Mainly because it was simply just salmon with jerk paste slapped on top of it. The salmon wasn't marinated in the jerk sauce or paste. It's also not a fulfilling meal. So if you do decide to give the jerk salmon a try, make sure you're not actually ""hungry hungry"" because you will be upset."
9/25/2018,20180925,4,4.14,"4.5 stars****Went here for dinner with a friend on a Monday night. We arrived in time for the happy hour (4-7pm M-F), which was great. I ordered a glass of wine and my friend tried one of the mimosas. We were both pleased for the price! This place has a homey Harlem feel; hip and cool without being too loud. The wait staff were also very nice and helpful with advising on the menu. Whenever our drinks ran low they were quick to offer another!As for the food, we split the codfish fritters and we both got the jumbo shrimp. The codfish fritters were really good!! You get 5 sizeable balls for only 8$ - great deal! I stuffed myself on them. The jumbo shrimp were also really great, they come with coconut rice and plaintains. The whole dish was really delicious. Overall, would definitely recommend for a chill place in Harlem with really good, reasonably priced caribbean food. I would love to come back for brunch."
9/25/2018,20180925,3,4.14,Nice an quiet for a late brunch before leaving the city. The food was good nothing memorable. I had the shrimp &grits ( it was ok grits could've been smoother and there could've been more to the dish). My mother had the waffles which were good they had a sweetness to them. My friend had the pancakes which she said had too much cinnamon. The portions were good and so was the hibiscus mimosa. Overall it was a cool atmosphere but I rated a 3 because it small and not organized. It was 11:30 an only one person waiting on the entire dining area an a guy behind the bar.
9/26/2018,20180926,2,4.14,The service here is that of a dumpster fire. The food is good if it ever actually comes to your table and if it's what you ordered. If you have an hour to wait for a medium cooked burger and fries or basic chicken and rice then be my guest. If you actually have a job and need to be somewhere I recommend going anywhere else.
9/26/2018,20180926,4,4.14,"My second time coming here but the experience was just as good with very nice customer service. I felt very happy and taken care of the whole time. We cane here around 9:40 and was told that we can order food starting from 10am and so we got coffee and waited to order. The Americano was on the spot, rich and deep in flavor. The drip coffee not as much. Just okay. The hot chocolate was okay too. Not that good. I got the coconut fish burger and it was heavenly. The fish was crispy on the outside but so moist on the inside. There was just enough tartar sauce that just coated the bread and fish when you ate it together in with the burger. The onions were a great addition that helped with the rich flavor of everything else. There could have been more greens in the burger. The fries were really good and the salad was well dressed and a really clean side to have. The waffle and fruits wasn't as good as I thought it would be but definitely the spiced rum syrup was so good and made the whole dish better. The parmesan grits was not that good and was too cold and not the consistency that I like my grits but the parmesan flavor was on spot, not too strong but definitely there. The BLT was good but not different than any other place. The bacon was the best part because it was thicker cut than other places have their bacon. I think this is a really cute brunch date place and try the dishes that are out of your comfort zone because for us, the coconut fish burger was the best out of three."
9/30/2018,20180930,1,4.13,"Walked all the way here just in time to be told the kitchen is closed for the next hour I found this place by searching ""brunch in Harlem"" so no I don't want drinks. The owner should list this online"
10/9/2018,20181009,4,4.13,Food is great! The side of fries on the wrap could be better. They aren't house cut.
10/11/2018,20181011,2,4.12,Went to the Edge back in March and it's a nice little place that gets crowded during brunch on the weekends. I was with my family and we waited for about 20 mins for a table. We finally sat down and ordered drinks. I ordered a vodka and cranberry juice and it took so long to get it that I was given to me for free and taken off the check... the scrambled eggs were powdered or processed because water was running off of them. The waitress was beautiful and she tried her best to accommodate 4 tables with terrible a kitchen prep. I'd go back once more to see if that experience was just a fluke. I support local restaurants but when it comes to service.. that's where I draw the line .

I ordered a vodka and cranberry juice and it took so long to get it that I was given to me for free and taken off the check... the scrambled eggs were powdered or processed because water was running off of them. The waitress was beautiful and she tried her best to accommodate 4 tables with terrible a kitchen prep. I'd go back once more to see if that experience was just a fluke. I support local restaurants but when it comes to service.. that's where I draw the line .
10/12/2018,20181012,5,4.12,The drinks and the food were really good. The brunch menu has great options. We tired four different meals and everyone said it was amazing! The place is tiny though and the day we went was packed. They placed our table/seat so close to the other table that my hair was almost in the other tables food! Lol would and will definitely go back and wait for a window seat!
10/16/2018,20181016,5,4.12,"I went to The Edge for a late night dinner and I must say the food was excellent. My friend and I ordered the jerk chicken salad which was awesome, a plate of festivals, codfish fritters, and fish n chips. I'll definitely be going back for more with my girlfriends."
10/16/2018,20181016,5,4.12,Enjoyed the cute quaint atmosphere.  Food good. My husband had a big burger.  He really enjoyed it. I had eggs and parmesan grits.
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.13,"Amazing service, they accommodated to a last minute reservation. All the food was delicious. Must try the Black Bean Veggie Burger."
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.13,"My girl and I walked through the doors happy and left even more happier! It opens at 11am, we got there at 11:11am and it was crowded, but lucky us, there was a table for two, which was (the last one) The ambiance was definitely a great vibe, from the owners all the way down to the little salt & pepper shakers! I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Waffles (Amazing)! My lady ordered the Shrimp and Parmesan Grits (Phenomenal) oh and sweet plantains! We had two rounds of Mango Mimosas, so you should know by me saying that, it was soooooo good! Can't wait to go back, try the food off the Dinner menu..."
11/5/2018,20181105,5,4.13,"The hostess was amazing. The tall, Afro-America woman. Such a delight. She ran the floor seamlessly, even under a little stress. Ordered the carafe of Rum punch. It was really good, not overly sweet like most places (get wrong). The restaurant was really small, but so much charm and personality. (Rewind) Our wait was about 20 minutes, which was great for a fall Saturday, the hostess kept us updated. I ordered the waffles and jerk chicken. The waffle was good and fluffy, but the jerk chicken (white meat) was dry, so that was the only slight let down.I will definitely come back. I love hidden gems like this."
11/9/2018,20181109,4,4.13,Came here for brunch and it was packed. But me and my bestie lucked up and got seated quickly. Only bc ppl left bc of the wait. We ordered a pitcher of the rum punch which was amazing and I had the jerk chicken and waffles. The chicken cutlet was seasoned great but pieces of was rubbery. The waffle was good. The service there was great and it was nice to see ppl actually engaging in conversation.
11/9/2018,20181109,5,4.13,I love this place!! Being from Harlem this is a gem! Parmesan grits are life! Waffle are yum and drink will get you nice!! I definitely recommend!
11/10/2018,20181110,5,4.13,A previous review drew us to the door. The wonder (and very tall) hostess took us from there. The wonderfully cozy space means a bit of wait time for a lovely table. We took two neighborhood walks and sat down in a little less than 30 mins. Well worth every minute. Jerk chicken was delicious. Salmon eggs Benedict thrilled my daughter. Great group of guests and very attentive staff. I look forward to a regular return.
11/11/2018,20181111,3,4.13,"I came here for the weekend brunch with a couple of friends. They do not take reservations for parties less than 5 so they seat on a ""first-come first-serve"" basis. We arrived at about 12:40 p.m. and were seated about an hour later. The restaurant itself is small with a large bar in the middle of the restaurant and limited seating around it. Upon arrival, I realized that most of the tables were suited for parties of 2 and thus any parties larger than 2 were subject to at least a 45-minute wait (unless you don't mind the bar, but we had a baby with us).Food: I ordered one of the specials (codfish fritters) along with the crab cakes and grits. The fritters were good and the grits were very flavorful. I also had a Belgian waffle with fruit. Although I wanted to love the crab cakes, they were my least favorite item. On the other hand, we ordered a carafe of rum punch which met our expectations!Ambiance: The restaurant has a nice ambiance with a good playlist of background music. There's no WIFI or screens as they encourage patrons to connect (a nice change of pace in the world of technology). I even forget to take pictures because I was so absorbed in the atmosphere!Service: The overall service was good. There was a long wait for the food, but the place was completely packed. The waiters/waitresses were attentive and helpful with recommendations. I wish there was a better system for seating people or clearing tables when the waits are so long. I would come back to try other items on the menu especially since they offer an interesting variety of brunch dishes. When I do return I will anticipate the waits and make sure I'm on the list before I feel the hunger pangs."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.13,"Best brunch in Harlem! Love their egg dishes and the service is phenomenal. Great prices, too!"
11/18/2018,20181118,2,4.13,"Normally one of my favorites. Unfortunately last night was a disaster. The conch fritters were tasteless, heavy and gummy. The side of vegetables, equally tasteless and oily. The service, totally mediocre. Interestingly, it also wasn't as crowded as it usually is. Anyway, headed over to Belle Harlem so that the night didn't end on a bad note and we weren't disappointed. I hope this experience was an exception!"
11/24/2018,20181124,5,4.13,"Okay ....Where do I start?? AMAZING!!The shrimp and grits are delicious... The jerk chicken with waffles ? Omg - LOVED If you are not big on anything too spicy - No worries , this is still a meal you will enjoy. They put the right amount of spices .. balanced greatly with the marinade of seasonings.. Boneless - tender - GET THIS WHEN YOU VISIT- TRUST ME - You will not be disappointed. The staff was very attentive, professional and friendly. We went today (Saturday after Black Friday) around 12pm and there was no wait. We were politely greeted at the door, seated .. and within a minute of seating, greeting again by the waitress offering drinks to start us off. The food came out quickly... hot and fresh! I will definitely return."
11/30/2018,20181130,5,4.13,"Food was delicious and the service even better! My friend and i visited the Edge Harlem for breakfast/brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the crowd that we found waiting for a table. The atmosphere is very urban and cute, the dinning room was also filled with locals and breakfast regulars. We struck up a conversation with the couple sitting next to us who come for breakfast every week and they told us a little bit about the owners of the establishment and the fun menu items that you should order. Highly recommend their mimosas!"
12/2/2018,20181202,4,4.13,"This is a lovely little gem in West Harlem. Very cozy and intimate. Delicious food. Cafe/moms pops kind of feel but worth it. Specials and great menu staples, I consider it a solid go to for brunch."
12/6/2018,20181206,5,4.13,"My friends and I had brunch here on a Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised! My first question upon walking in was if this was a black-owned establishment. Turns out the woman I was speaking with was one of the owners! She assured me they were minority AND woman-owned lol. This isn't a die-hard requirement for me but I do like to support when I can. Needless to say, after that I was very excited to sit down and enjoy my meal! The decor is trendy but yet down-to-earth and welcoming. Several small tables in the dining area with a small bar right when you come in. I will say this: NOT a good place for a large group. Maybe 8 tops. If your party is more than that...COME ANYWAY! So my party of 3 started off with a carafe of the mango mimosa which was AMAZING. Made with fruit puree as opposed to that syrup crap. We switched to the spiced hibiscus mimosa for our 2nd round. By the time we killed that, we were nice and tipsy!As for the food, we all shared each others entrees and everything was DELICIOUS! There was the jerk chicken and waffles which came with boneless chicken breasts. I was apprehensive about not having bone-in chicken but one bite in and all my worries melted away. There was the simple-ish dish of buttermilk pancakes and berries. It was like how can you add pizzazz to pancakes, but somehow they ended up being the best pancakes we had ever had in our lives. Lastly, we had the burger (added avocado to it). Yum! There are not many burgers that go above and beyond for me, most are passable decent attempts. BUT THIS! Again, one of the best burgers I've ever had. No one in our party complained about a single thing. Not even the side of sweet plantains that we ordered just because we were being fat lol. We definitely killed those too! I should mention that I live in New Jersey and since that Saturday, I've been trying to find every excuse to end up back here for brunch! Hasn't worked out yet, but it WILL happen!"
12/12/2018,20181212,5,4.14,So happy my hubby urged me to give this place a 2nd chance. It was really bustling on a saturday around noon. We were told the wait would be about 20 min which was accurate. The squash soup with festival is a good value and really hits the spot on a cold day. I enjoyed the chicken with waffles and tje hubs enjoyed his cococunt battered fish with grits. The giner margarita is a go. Overall this place is really cute and cozy with a nice ambiance. The sisters/owners work really hard. Would def reccommend this place for brunch.

12/15/2018,20181215,5,4.14,"Came for brunch at around 1pm on a Sunday - waited for 30-45 minutes which gave us enough time to just walk around the park nearby. The food was incredible! I've never had Jamaican food before but what a great intro. Collectively we ordered the ackee/saltfish, the jerk chicken sandwich, and the shrimp and grits. Things just had such a flavorful kick and everything was cooked perfectly. The music and decor are also very fun and it feels like a intimate/trendy establishment as well. I hear they are minority/women-owned so that makes it even better!"

12/22/2018,20181222,2,4.14,Came here for brunch but my friend was late and the kitchen was closing so i decided to have hot chocolate at the bar. The hostess and servers were rude and had poor customer service skills. The hostess was incredibly condescesing. The place seems like a good weekend brunch vibe for families but I was over it quickly due to the rudeness.

12/23/2018,20181223,4,4.13,We enjoy and food and drinks here! That's saying a lot seeing as how we haven't loved many places we've been to eat in Harlem unfortunately. It's now a good place for us when we want to be sure to have a well prepared flavorful meal and I love the music as well. We've been twice this month for brunch and dinner. They always have different specials which is nice and everything I've had has great flavors. Had spinach and mushroom soup with festival. I loooove festival and theirs is pretty good. Crab cakes were enjoyable as well.

12/29/2018,20181229,5,4.14,"On the recommendation of someone in the area, we decided to go for Saturday brunch and so glad we did. We got there a little before they open at 11:00 am which is recommended since folks line up for this small restaurant. I decided to get the jerk chicken with waffles which seemed to get raves and I understand why. The chicken is the breast which I never get anywhere because it tends to get dried out and not as tasty as dark meat. It was different here. It was served paillard style and was not dried out at all, with a slightly spicy taste. This was certainly healthier than the ubiquitous fried chicken and waffles served at almost every place in our neighborhood. My bf got the shrimp and grits and avocado toast. The grits has a parmesan undertone but not overwhelming or too cheesy. I love grits but have an aversion to over cheesed grits. Theirs was balanced and a perfect base to the shrimp which were small but not overcooked or overly spiced. The toast came with the creamy avocado and piece of nori, yes, nori and a side of mixed greens. The coffee is strong and you are asked if you want half & half, whole cold milk or steamed milk with it. The servers are cool and adept. All in all, it's now my favorite place in the neighborhood. Will definitely try it again for dinner, maybe on an evening when they have live music."

12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.15,"Amazinggg ! I love The Edge, it's one of my favorite places to go in Harlem. The food is amazing and the customer service is spectacular. Try the codfish fritters they never disappoint."
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.15,I absolutely love the edge!! I work close by and so whenever I have time during break I go with my sister. It is our favorite place to eat and converse. The food is amazing! I recommend their burger or even the black bean burger. Their fries are to die for and let me not tell you about their salmon haha! I love the atmosphere it is very calm and the service is always great. Love to see a diverse staff and the painting of Langston Hughes always warms my heart.

1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.16,"My first review has to go to this gem in Harlem! I may be a bit bias since my parent are Caribbean but this has got to be one of the best restaurants uptown. I highly recommend you coming early, ordering the jerk chicken or ackee & salt fish, and the sorrel mimosa."
1/10/2019,20190110,5,4.16,I've been here a few times because it's a a very comfortable distance from my place. They have a steady crowd and people seem to really like it here. The stars don't really reflect different aspects of my experience but I'll do my best to explain. What they do well... I've come for dinner just about 3 times and have ordered the specials. Those for me are worth 5 stars. Super flavorful and plenty enough. I remember getting the oxtail once and some wine marinated filet that were to die for. They also have a short and basic beer and wine list that works for me. Lastly always compliment a place that pays attention to details and they do with the flower arrangements which I love. What doesn't work for me... the basic plates such as burgers are not my favorite. Super greasy and doesn't justify not getting it at a Fonda. Also the rum punch which by the way everyone seems to love is to me really not worth it. I guess that's like what happens with sangria in NYC. People drink it not knowing what a real sangria should taste like. So I wouldn't have the punch but they sell a lot... you be the judge. But hey! People still make a line outside and I have been coming back.
1/11/2019,20190111,5,4.16,I absolutely LOVE this place. It has such great vibes!! Not only is it cute and cozy inside but the food is AMAZING!!! I've had quite a few things off the menu but they have this jerk chicken sandwich special that is so freaking good!!! And you have to get the 580 off the drink menu!! It's honestly one of my favorite places in the city!! And if you couldn't make this place any more perfect it's not overpriced so you can go there and eat and drink in a really cool space without breaking the bank. Highly recommend!!
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.16,"The wait is usually 20-30 mins long, but once you're seated you wont regret it. Overall it's one of my favorite brunch spots. From the music, to the service, the crowd and oh let's not forget their grits!"
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.16,"Very cozy spot. I went for Sunday Brunch, party of two. We arrived around 1pm it was about a 20 minute wait. All of the employees were very friendly. The food was delicious. I will definitely return."
1/14/2019,20190114,2,4.16,I went to do the edge on Sunday and can only rate them with 2 stars. I order the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were the precooked shrimp. For $16 they could have least used fresh shrimp. The cheddar and chive biscuit was dry and untasteful. Same your money the food was mediocre and the shrimp was the cheapest one they could fine
1/15/2019,20190115,3,4.16,Came here Friday night with my Aunt and Granny on a whim. The restaurant is cozy( samll) and was dimly lit and had music playing in the back ground. Was greeted as soon as we walked in and the wait time was about 10 minutes. My aunt ordered the fish and chips which she said she really liked and it looked really good. Granny ordered one if the specials which was the half a chicken with veggies she said she kiked it. Iordered the salmon burger and 2 rum punches. The rum punched were sooo good and i was def feeling nice off if them. The salmon burger was ok but i only ordered that by default because what i wanted they had ran out of. I would come back again to try them out u just feel like it needs a little more selection in the menu. None if our food choices we thought were awesome but u heard that brunch was the best time to go.

The venue is small but cute and hip. Service is attentive, will certain go back but we sure to make reservations as early as possible to avoid the wait."
1/27/2019,20190127,4,4.16,Greatest burger I've had in the neighborhood in a long time!! Everyone enjoyed their food very much. Nice brunch& dinner venue. If coming for brunch on the weekend arrive early or expect a wait of 15-20 mins the food is worth it!! Affordable and quaint.
1/27/2019,20190127,5,4.16,They were able to accommodate my reservation of 6 guests (and last minute a 7th guest) on the same day. Each plate was delicious and satisfying. The service was wonderful. Highly recommend for a casual dinner or even date night. I spent my graduation dinner here. I would love to come back for brunch.

2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.16,"Love this cozy restaurant. It was my 2nd time having Sunday brunch here. I went back because I had the taste for their Jerk Caesar Salad, which I wound up taking to go to have for dinner because I decided to try the cheesy parmesan grits with shrimp and eggs, which was also delicious!And let's not forget the 580(?) drink...which was a combination of rum punch, champagne, and sorrel syrup-although sweet, I barely tasted the rum punch. The owners who are two sisters, are very hands on managing, seating patrons & assisting with serving at times. Was happy that I had the opportunity to share with one of them how much I loved eating at their restaurant, which she appreciated hearing. Traveling from Queens to the Edge Harlem is definitely worth the trip!!"
2/2/2019,20190202,5,4.16,"This write up like many of my others are way over due, but today I got time. Who doesn't like to enjoy there food with a ""girlfriends"" meets ""insecure"" (the shows) vibe. A great music selection in the background while beautiful people of all kinds smile and clean plates. Tho it's a small spot the wait isn't long and the host was pleasant and attentive. Well portions of food given hot and ready, and the drink selections are great. I took a chance on getting the ackee and sawfish and tho it wasn't like mamma luv's I was pleased. My lady had the coconut fish and grits, side of eggs and gluten free apple cheddar biscuit (fancy). Also served hot ready and tasty, which kept me digging in her plate. Being from Harlem I really appreciate this place for its food, vibe and cultural influence. I'm a father of twin daughters as well so to see sisters working together wins me over. I recommend this place for all beautiful people inside and out."
2/13/2019,20190213,4,4.16,"What here with my friend for a Saturday morning brunch! The vibe was great and it was very busy. I would recommend getting there earlier in the day to get one of their nicer seats.They have a cute little bar and nice mimosas... Pictured is the mango mimosa! I got their waffle! It wasn't really anything to talk about but the whipped cream was Rum infused and to die for. This is definitely a cute spot if you are looking for a nice Caribbean style breakfast with many options like grits, waffles, burgers, and salads."

3/10/2019,20190310,5,4.16,"My wonderful Sister-Friends and I get together once a month for dinner and drinks just to catch up on our lives. One of them suggested 'The Edge Harlem' for our monthly meet-up. I had never been to to this establishment, nor had I heard of it before, but i'm so glad she suggested it. Unfortunately, I was late and missed happy hour so I can't comment on that nor can I comment on the wait time to be seated as my friends were already seated when I arrived. The Edge Harlem is a small space with a full-service bar. For a group of 4, we were a bit cramped. Not sure if it's because I came late, but overall, its seems to be a small establishment. The decor reminds me of a small Caribbean shop, but then there are some things that remind me of a British tavern; altogether its delightful and unique. The menu features a mixture of Caribbean, American, and some British inspired dishes, very eclectic. I loved that they also had a few vegetarian options as well as small and full sized meals. At the time of our dining experience, I was on a modified fast, only consuming fish products. Luckily, The Edge Harlem had a tasty gem on tap - the salmon burger. The salmon burger was pretty good. The meal featured a well-seasoned salmon cake (I doubt it was fresh salmon), topped with chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. I also received a side of fried plantains and arugula. It was tasty and filling. My only qualm was that it fell apart very easily and was a little dry, otherwise I enjoyed it and would order again. For drinks, I started with a mimosa which tasted alright but then I learned that they served sangrias! In fact, we were able to order a carafe. I love me some sangria, the fact that we were able to purchase a carafe made it all the more better. Menu pricing as well as portion sizes were on-point. Most expensive entree was about $25, very reasonable overall.Finally, service was wonderful! We were served by O'Neil (I hope that's his name, if I remember correctly). He was very courteous, kind, and patient. Lord knows, we could barely agree on food and drinks but O'Neil was so good and offered suggestions. We ended up dining up until closing, thats how much of a great time we had. O'Neil was gracious enough to take some photos of us by the bar as well lol.Overall, I'd definitely return. Its a great spot to visit for a date night or drinks with some friends. I'd check with management before coming with a large group though. Parking was easy to come by on a Friday night. Also, be sure to check out their Instagram page as well. They have live music on some nights. Highly recommended!"
3/10/2019,20190310,4,4.16,"Came back for brunch again and had to update my review because my experience wasn't nearly as good as my first time here. The drinks were still delicious and strong; the mango mimosa is always a good call and the sangria was great as well. The jerk chicken and waffles was okay. The chicken was nicely seasoned with a little kick, but it was tough and didn't go that well with the waffles. The plantain-crusted crabcakes were delicious, but came with a super small portion of crabcakes considering the dish is probably their most expensive brunch entree. The plate was almost entirely salad. The codfish fritters were good, but the shining star was definitely that jerk lime dip instead of the fritters themselves. The pancakes I got last time were probably the best dish I had here. They forgot the bacon on the BLT sandwich and forgot to make one of our entrees entirely. They were really busy since this place so popular for weekend brunch, so we understood, but there were only 2 servers and they were overwhelmed. Someone who looked like a shift leader or manager was standing in the back the entire time we were eating and didn't help the servers at all, and they definitely looked like they could have used a hand at least giving out the checks or something. Overall, delicious drinks and pretty tasty food, but the service could use some help."
3/17/2019,20190317,2,4.16,"This was my 2nd visit to the edge. And was left just as thoroughly unimpressed as the 1st time1st time for brunch some time ago was nothing special.This time, for dinner - I had hope but....-Service can definitely use some work.- Wings are soggy. Maybe baked, but not in a good way. -Rice was hard. And tasteless- Plantains... might've been fried twice as they didn't taste fresh and were full of oil.The only good thing was the shrimp. Lacks the ambience and liveliness that a full restaurant should have. Wouldn't recommend; unless you're in the mood for a mediocre (overpriced) meal."
3/17/2019,20190317,5,4.16,Tried the Jerk Chicken and waffles this time. The chicken was delish. Atmosphere is real cool. The owners are really nice. The coconut fish and grits was delish too.
3/17/2019,20190317,5,4.16,"Awesome Caribbean/American brunch! I had the ackee with salt fish ( with avocado and grits as a special of the day). Perfectly spicy and delicious, with cool mashed avocado with lime that surprisingly complemented the ackee and salt fish well. grits were rich and creamy, My brother had the coconut fish and grits which were crunchy, moist and flavorful. Sis in law had jerk chicken and waffles. Waffles were a little hard but the chicken was excellent. Small space but good turnover and friendly staff. I highly recommend The Edge!"
3/24/2019,20190324,4,4.16,"Ambiance is great. Loved this place the moment I stepped in. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. If you love sorrel, they have some of the best in town. The food is presented beautifully, but isn't authentic Jamaican. Has more English/American influence. Doesn't taste like the food back home. Americans and brits will like it though. Gave it 4 stars because the service was great, but food was subpar for my pallet."
3/26/2019,20190326,5,4.16,"Literally never had better pancakes! I felt as though i was eating apple cider donuts but in pancake form! they were so good fluffy yet a crunchy buttery outside. just thinking about them is making my mouth water. i came here with my husband for brunch, first time coming and definitely wont be our last. my husband had the waffle which looked great and we shared an order of 3 sides. portions worked well for us both. They serve their house made whip cream which is great not to sweet and it compliments the pancakes and the waffle perfectly. we had 2 drinks as well and they were good. We sat at the bar and service was great as well. it gets pretty packed so if you are in a rush advise that you call and see if you can make a reservation or not. either way its worth the wait!"
4/1/2019,20190401,4,4.16,"Stopped by this past weekend for a quick brunch. When we arrived we were told it'd be a 30 minute wait, seeing as how it was nice and sunny outside we decided to wait it out. The wait ended up being 10 minutes only and we were seated in a nice little corner. The staff were all super nice and attentive. OKAY, the food. I came here specifically for the jerk chicken and waffles but was then roped into getting the jerk chicken burger which was AMAZING (hence not having photo proof of it) We also purchased a carafe of mango mimosas which was super yum and more than enough for 2 people. I'd definitely recommend this place to others, such cozy & good vibes."
4/3/2019,20190403,4,4.16,"We landed here as our first place in Harlem staying at a great airbnb spot after a 13 hour flight...and what a great choice. The food was superb! Small plates of shrimp and mango chutney, cod fritters, fish and chips, and the roasted tomato soup were all excellent! The Wednesday night live music was a real joy although the noise level made conversation difficult. The HH drinks were disappointing though, with the ginger margarita tasting like neither of the namesakes, and the light colored sangria being unlike any sangria I've ever tried(and not in a good way), but the food made up for the cheap drinks, and the music won us over. We were ready to go back."
4/5/2019,20190405,4,4.16,"First time coming here at 3pm. Decided to sit at the bar loved the atmosphere and also appreciated the bartender (dude with ponytail and glasses) he was attentive and very informative. Great service man , thanks. Unfortunately I just was not happy with the taste of food. Ordered the edge burger with bacon avocado and fried egg ...Very bland but thankfully cooked to the T. Would come again for a cup of tea and a quick study."
4/6/2019,20190406,4,4.16,"S- Service was a 5, the waitress gave honest opinions between choices. She also checked on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. T- Timing was a 4 the food took a while but is expected when its being cooked fresh to order.A- Appearance of the venue was a 4. The fengshui of the restaurant gave us an underground tavern feel. Although the style of food didn't match the place, the dynamic and overall appearance to the space was pleasing to eat in.  F- Food was a 4 they definitely have a unique assortment of options to pick from. Excellent for a brunch spot, but I couldn't tell what they specialized in.F- Frequency ranked at a 3, we would definitely return here but not considered a regular. Our STAFF score for this place is 4."
4/13/2019,20190413,5,4.16,Coxy little spot in Harlem with great tasting cocktails and delicious Carribean Fusion dishes.
4/27/2019,20190427,4,4.16,"This is a wonderful place. I love the food and the hibiscus mimosas. The only thing I don't like is the wait time. That's crazy! But other than that, they are pretty dope."
4/30/2019,20190430,4,4.16,"Loooooove this place!Came in Saturday around 1ishhh (I got lost) to meet my godfather for brunch. This place gets busy but they do seat you quickly. Unfortunately on this day, their server was down, which meant they were only accepting cash. Which wasn't a problem, the really nice and tall woman in the front (who I assume was the manager) was very kind in redirecting us to the nearest ATM machine. We were seated quickly, and I didn't get the server's name but she was very nice and attentive. My phone was dying that day so I'm really upset I couldn't take any pictures, but this place is a very nice restaurant. It's like a secret hideaway in Harlem, i love how everyone in the community just brings life in this restaurant literally. Good vibes all around. We ordered the Belgian waffles with fruit and the rum infused whipped cream. It was delicious! If it was socially acceptable, I'd probably lick my plate. We sat a table or two away from the door and was a little too close to the table besides us, but this is not the biggest restaurant, so if you're claustrophobic, try sitting at the bar. I will definitely be back here for brunch and try everything else this place has to offer. Side note, this place does not accept reservations for parties under 5! It has a great ambiance definitely great for a first date. I will for sure be back here another time."
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.17,We went for breakfast and the food was AWESOME!!!!! I had FRESH ginger & turmeric tea that was amazing. The service was wonderful and I'll be returning on my next trip to NYC.
5/11/2019,20190511,3,4.16,"The best part of the meal was the codfish fritters and the ackee and salt fish. The waffles were chewy and tasted very processed. I also was not expecting their take on chicken and waffles. I won't order that again. I won't count this restaurant out, but they do need to change the waffles they use. Particularly they need to make them from scratch. And if they do make the waffles from scratch, I would suggest changing the recipe or cooking process because it tastes quite artificial."
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.17,I was in Harlem with my daughter and her friend. I searched yelp for restaurants that offered cash back. When The Edge popped up in the search I was pleased since I had heard wonderful things from my friends. This place is so cute and cozy. The food and drinks were delicious. We went on a Sunday but arrived a few minutes before the kitchen open for dinner. I'll be sure to check out their brunch another day. It was my first time having a Sorrel mimosa and it didn't disappoint me. I'd also like to come back on a Wednesday to experience the live music. I didn't try the coffee but it's really nice to know that they make americanos and serve espresso.
5/13/2019,20190513,5,4.17,I enjoyed the atmosphere. The brunch was good. The drinks were good. A bit small but very comfy. The service was excellent. I highly recommend.
5/17/2019,20190517,5,4.17,Love that I now can finally review this spot! The dynamic sister duo opened this restaurant together and they are a staple in the neighborhood. Super busy for brunch!! the food is some of the best Caribbean food in the city for sure. Could eat here three times a day everyday
5/18/2019,20190518,5,4.17,Loved the food and the vibe ! My friend has the fish and chips and it was upper tasty. The portions were good. I had the black bean veggie burger it was delicious. I Would def come back !
5/24/2019,20190524,5,4.17,One of my favorite places in Harlem. The vibe is dope. The food is dope. It's def a hidden gem. The pancakes and eggs were delicious. Also tried the waffles and grits...they were okay. Hibiscus drink is a MUST. Can't wait to come back.
5/28/2019,20190528,5,4.17,"I love going to The Edge. The owners and staff (in the front and in the kitchen) are super hardworking and it shows in the quality of the food and service! Great place to meet for after-work drinks. Also love their brunch menu. The ginger mimosas, coconut fish and grits, and veggie burger are all delicious. The ambience is also great. Definitely worth a 45-minute wait!"
5/30/2019,20190530,5,4.18,"Tried this place today, and we loved it. The fish burger, pancakes, and the pie of the day were all amazing!"
6/7/2019,20190607,5,4.18,"Had an amazing meal here with a friend. The place was surprisingly full for a Monday morning, but we were seated immediately. I had the curry chicken special with coconut rice and my friend had the black bean burger. We had a really hard time deciding what to get because there were so many enticing options, but we both loved what we ordered. Service was kind and efficient. I can't wait to go back!"
6/10/2019,20190610,4,4.18,"The Edge is a quality restaurant - we ordered a couple dishes, the codfish fritters, the cheesy shrimp and grits, and the BLT with jerk chicken. The shrimp and frites tasted good but the shrimp was over cooked in my opinion and very soft. The BLT was good - I would recommend you get the bread toasted. The codfish fritters were excellent and it came with a lime jerk dipping sauce that added tons of flavor to the dish. The drinks at the restaurant were excellent ~ I highly recommend getting the ginger margarita!"
6/12/2019,20190612,5,4.18,Wow can't believe I'm only discovering this JemNow??? What a Beautiful & warm space. Amazing eats & cocktails. Our server Costa was so awesome. Owned by 2 fabulous Sisters definitely returning!!! Live music on Wednesdays?? #Iharlem #theedge
6/12/2019,20190612,3,4.18,"Good food and a great spot for a meal. Not a great place to work or hang out. I have been three or four times and even though people try to work, it's really more of a sit down meal spot. I think they need to do a better job of making clear what's ok and what's not - rather than just side-eyeing."
6/13/2019,20190613,4,4.18,"The Edge HarlemOverall rating: 7 The Edge- Harlem was a good experience. The ambiance is fairly calm (around 1:30 PM). The space is very tight though but if you're coming for a bar experience I'm sure this is just fine as they have bar seating. The menu was well versed in the Jamaican/English/American cross over cuisine but make sure you pay attention to the specials sign on the wall because it wasn't mentioned but the specials that were listed and available were not on the regular menu (of course). Our waitress was very nice but she had a lot to do, she had so many tables but she made sure to take care of us. I ordered the Jerk Salmon Fillet served with Mixed Greens and Amarillos (sweet platanos). I thoroughly enjoyed it actually. The salmon was perfectly sauced and cooked tender. Don't be offput but the black color(for people not used to jerk food) that's standard to jerk lol. The salmon was true to serving size, no excess at all lol. The greens were tossed in a flavorful vinaigrette, I was pleasantly surprised.  (Alcohol) The rum punch was really fruity and flavorful, definitely pleasant.Pricing was fair, the portion to pricing was equal I believe. I know a lot of people want MORE food but I like that they serve appropriate serving sizes."
6/16/2019,20190616,4,4.18,"I think these were the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. Coffee refills are $1 each, which isn't great, but the food is well worth the price. The place is very small and I had a 45-minute wait Sunday afternoon, which was reasonable for the size of the restaurant. We got seated at a counter with tall chairs I didn't love, but the wait and chairs were worth it for the food. I also tried the curry chicken salad and it was fantastic. The French fries and plantains are both good sides. I highly recommend the pancakes even if you're not a person who usually loves pancakes. They are buttery and thin and have delicious crispy edges. The rum whipped cream and berries are great with them."
6/20/2019,20190620,4,4.17,"This place is a little gem in Harlem. The only reason they don't get a full five stars is because I didn't like their mimosas but as far as their food (I had the fried egg sandwich) it is delicious! My boyfriend got the jerk chicken and waffles and he really liked the chicken, wasn't too fond of the waffles. And the rum punch is delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more stuff!! The best part? We did a yelp reservation and got there just in time for seating skipping the line of people waiting. Loved it!"
6/23/2019,20190623,1,4.17,"This place is awful. The hostess told us it would take 30-40 minutes to wait, it took around 50 minutes. Then we sat down ordered a drink and food at the same time along with an appetizer. This took around 45 minutes to come out. Everyone around us who was rated maybe five minutes prior got food before us. All we ordered were plantains a bowl of fruit and a single waffle with fruit. Not to mention the kitchen closed 30 minutes after we got our food. No idea why it took that long. Then when it came my friends bowl of FRUIT was literally blueberries and raspberries for 6$. My waffle was sub par, and didn't even come with real maple syrup. It was thick fructose syrup, and the also cake with sour blueberries. The waitress did not check on us once about our food. Didn't even bring the food over, another individual did. Will never come here again, wish we didn't have to actually pay for it. We finally had to ask a busser for our check. I left hungry and so annoyed. Not mention I saw a bunch of people eating in the back while I didn't have food."
6/25/2019,20190625,4,4.17,"I love the eclectic vibe from the menu, decor, and patrons. It's a Jamaican, English, and NYC fusion menu. My teenagers ordered the jerk chicken Cesar wrap and open faced fried egg sandwich. Both were good. I ordered the pancakes and they were a little dense, but tasted fine. We finished with the bread pudding and it was served warm. I thought the price was very reasonable for NYC. We arrived at 11:30 am on a Monday and there were plenty of seats available, but it was completely packed by the time we left at 12:30. We took the B line up from mid town and it was just a few blocks from the station."
6/25/2019,20190625,4,4.17,Tight nur cosy with Jazz Lounge Music and Jamaican food. The also habe New York Style and English on the Menu. Good for lunch or late lunch. Can be To packed and loud in the evening.
6/29/2019,20190629,2,4.16,"As a Caribbean person, I was truly disappointed by the Jamaican dishes on the menu. I was really rooting for this restaurant!"
7/1/2019,20190701,3,4.16,"This quaint and cute place has great vibes and rum punch. I have to give it another try for brunch or lunch as I was not very pleased with the dinner I had there. I went for dinner and they were sold out of the jerk wings which is a good sign that those were going to be a hit. I opted for the seafood pasta and a hibiscus mimosa... The seafood pasta was too greasyyyyyy, the mimosa was not cold enough so they were kind enough to switch my drink. I was surprised they did not have oxtail on the menu The cheesecake was good."
7/1/2019,20190701,5,4.16,"A spontaneous need for food may have landed me at my new fav go-to! The Edge is a Harlem gem with its authentic Jamaican cuisine. Good portions, great prices & really cool vibes. You'll probably find me here quite often. I had Jerk chicken wings, Fish & Chips, Jumbo shrimp w/ coconut rice & Crabcakes w/ plantain. Everything - yes, everything - was so so good. Well cooked, flavorful, delicious. The wait staff was attentive & nice. I really enjoyed myself."
7/1/2019,20190701,4,4.16,"Love this place for being able to get the sides as a meal. 3 for $12. Amazing deal and great, simple, clean food."
7/4/2019,20190704,5,4.16,I love this place! The food and atmosphere is amazing. The drinks especially the 580 are great! And strong! Prefect brunch spot. I have to come back to try dinner
7/5/2019,20190705,5,4.17,"Great food! Cute space. Good service. It's a little small, but overall a good experience"
7/7/2019,20190707,3,4.16,"The food is a 3 but the alcoholic drinks are a 5! The rum punch and ginger margaritas are a must. Keep the carafes coming! The house made sorrel wasn't sweet enough and a bit bitter. The ginger beer is also house made. It was weak and didn't have enough of that ginger ""kick"".I ordered codfish fritters, plantain-crusted crab cakes, and a salmon burger. The crab cakes and salmon burger tasted similar which was disappointing. The seasoning gave both items a ""smokey"" flavor that I didn't like, and the salmon burger had too many other ingredients making it somewhat of a mushy mess. The fritters are good and you get about 5 or 6, but they are spicy. I've never had spicy fritters and after the 3rd one, I'd had enough because the spice/heat was too dominate.I really wanted to like this place but the food was disappointing. I do plan on giving them a second try for their ackee and saltfish. It's a great place to stop in for drinks, and I will continue to do so."
7/12/2019,20190712,4,4.16,The jerk chicken and waffle is a good meal. Went here for brunch and it was fast with fantastic customer service.
7/13/2019,20190713,5,4.17,"This is a very nice restaurant from the food, drinks and ambiance. I would certainly suggest people pay a visit to The Edge. My family and I enjoyed ourselves and we will most certainly be returning again."
7/15/2019,20190715,5,4.17,Came here R around 11:30am on a Monday and had a very good experience. Good food and fast service. Very calm atmosphere. I had the waffles which were delicious and my partner had the cheddar and bacon omelette which we shared. I also ordered an almond and chocolate croissant to go and it was to die for ! Will def be coming back for more
7/16/2019,20190716,5,4.17,Yum... excellent neighborhood haunt!Food is great.Great curry chickenPro tip- get the festivals...
7/19/2019,20190719,5,4.17,"Just visited Wednesday, the 17th. My son and I waited to be seated for about (15) minutes, but no complaints; it's worth the wait! There's live music, the ambiance is so welcoming and relaxing. As soon as we're seated, My son ordered the Spicy Seafood Pasta & I ordered (which is only made on Wednesday's) Jerk Chicken Pasta. My son enjoyed it so much, he finished his plate! I couldn't stop saying; after every bite: ""omg, this is so good""! The rum punch is definitely my favorite! This is my third visit, The Edge is my sanctuary now."
7/20/2019,20190720,4,4.17,Friendly staff. Owner graciously explained Jamaican Traditional breakfast one of our party ordered. Codfish fritters with jerk lime dip -great appetizer. Coffee was wonderful and flavorful. Jerk chicken and waffles thumbs up. Reputation must be awesome as crew member working on West Side Story shoot nearby ordered food when crews are given free food. A little noisy as restaurant was packed for brunch. Neighborhood gem
7/21/2019,20190721,4,4.17,"Spending time with my sister and brother was pleasantly increased by communing over delicious meal which consisted of plantains, cod fritters and sauteed spinach paired with delicious hibiscus mimosa and battered coconut fish and chips paired with refreshing ginger beer all expertly and well prepared served by attentive and professional staff. The owners/hostesses are friendly and aren't afraid to actively support staff while maintaining their poise and welcoming attitudes.  I've been here a few times before and have not been disappointed and will return again."
7/26/2019,20190726,4,4.17,"A lot of options, place is small. The food was amazing, and very good. Very nice staff"
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.17,Loved my early morning brunch here. I went in a Friday morning and ate at the bar. It was pretty full but not busy. The bartender took great care of me. I had the rum punch which was delicious and the coconut crusted cod with grits and I substituted the eggs for plantain. It was a good sized portion and everything tasted AMAZING! I'll definitely go back. They have live music on Wednesday evenings and I'd love to check that out.
8/2/2019,20190802,4,4.17,I love this place. It's a small neighborhood restaurant in Harlem. It's walking distance for me which is a plus. I've been there for dinner and returned a couple of times for brunch. I usually have the omelette and of course their delicious brunch cocktail. I can't remember the name of the drink (580?) but it's delish. Also get there early on the weekends or else you'll be sitting outside waiting to get in but it'll be worth the wait. Highly recommend!
8/3/2019,20190803,3,4.17,How you not going to have the Ackee and Saltfish at 3p on a Saturday? #brunch #primetime
8/4/2019,20190804,3,4.17,"There was a bit of a wait because they don't take reservations (which is kind of annoying honestly) especially because it's very small. But once we got seated the service was good and the food was amazing. I'd love to try brunch here but it would be disappointing to make the trip and have to stand around for a table. There's no real space to wait inside. They should definitely consider reservations. If they ever move to a larger location it would be amazing, they seem to be outgrowing their current location pretty quickly. I'd try going back for dinner on a weeknight."
8/4/2019,20190804,2,4.16,"Drinks were very weak, a carafe later and no buzz. Food was average. Was not worth the 45 min wait at all. I will not be back."
8/4/2019,20190804,4,4.16,They have amazing food. But I've been coming here for a few years now and their brunch hours change depending on who you ask and how ready the staff is to call it a day. It's truly a shame you don't want to take my money!!
8/8/2019,20190808,5,4.16,Really good food! We got there when it first opened and people started to flood in really quickly. I think there's usually a wait time. We didn't wait long for our food and it was delicious.
8/14/2019,20190814,3,4.16,"My family and I patiently and hungrily waited one hour and twenty minutes to dine at "" The Edge"". The place was a lot smaller than anticipated but it does have a small, cozy, and intimate feel to it. Great ambiance and great vibes.The food .... I'm a foodie and I'll pretty much eat anything that taste good. I ordered the rum punch and the ackee and salt fish. The Rum punch was alright, it tasted fresh but it was your average. The food was not good. My dish wasn't appetizing and the food wasn't hot - I wouldn't order it again. There was a slight acidity which I expected from the dish but this one was overpowering, cold, and the texture of the fresh kale salad appeared AND tasted wilted. My Father stuck to the simple bacon and eggs ( I should have followed his lead here). My sister ordered the shrimp and grits ( fair) and my mom ordered the cod fish burger ( I think that was the name of it) she ate the fried cod fish. Location: Small & IntimateDrinks: YummyFood: Fair. I would say stick to what you're familiar with on the menu - I would not recommend exploring a new food here Wait Time: Not worth 1 hour and 20 minutes Great spot for locals!Honestly, this isn't the spot I'd choose for a tasty meal; I came with an appetite and I left with one. I'd go here for happy hour ."
8/17/2019,20190817,5,4.16,"I'm so grateful that I found this place! I went last week at the end of the lunchtime shift. The food is excellent, the staff professional and attentive and the restaurant itself is small and inviting. You'd be cheating yourself if you didn't stop by and give it a try. I found this place by accident via another person's review. I was in the mood for breakfast, so I ordered the Shrimp with Parmesan cheesy Grits and scrambled eggs (I substituted the shrimp for coconut breaded fish) The fish was delicious and possibly the best I've ever eaten. The mixture of spices in the breading is probably a recipe that's been passed down through generations. I had no idea that I'd be so impressed with the food so I neglected to take photos the first time, however keep returning for the fish. (Basa fish). I've been searching for a local place to support our community and that's close to home. I miss the days when Harlem had several choices for real ""Soul Food"" and have watched my favorites disappear with no similar options popping up to replace them. I'm perpetually on a mission to satisfy my desire for authentic choices without having to spend hours in the kitchen preparing my own. I'm pleased to say that ""The Edge"" is just the place I'm looking for. I'm frugal by nature and if I had any objections, it would be the price, however I can't really argue against them, given the high cost of Real Estate that has taken over our Community and the unstable economy."
8/21/2019,20190821,5,4.16,"Brunch brunch brunch, absolutely ideal for brunch. Went in this weekend with my girlfriends and we really enjoyed it. The drinks were on point I had the 580 it's their signature drink perfect for 11am on a Sunday. Food was good, staff were attentive and can't wait to go back and do it again."
8/24/2019,20190824,1,4.16,"I went to The Edge following a lovely afternoon of Jazz at Marcus Garvey Park. The food was not great -- the wettest jerk chicken I've ever had. But the real reason for the 1 star is the HUGE COCKROACH that decided to share my meal. If I wasn't so stunned, I would have taken a picture. I yelled and jumped up from my seat. The bartender came over to my seat and scooped up the cockroach in a napkin, dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. The server came over and told me they would not charged me for the cocktails. Huh? You should not have charged me for the entire meal. I told him that this was the nastiest thing I have ever experienced in my life! I was mortified to have experienced that - a cockroach eating the food on the side of my plate. Not a small roach -- a huge cockroach/water bug with wings eating my food! Yuck! As the server walked away with the check, the bartender then said, ""welcome to New York."" Are you kidding me? i am a 48 year old New Yorker - born and raised and I have never, ever experienced eating with cockroaches at home or in a public restaurant. It was disgraceful, it was disgusting and I could not believe that not only did the patrons not react to the situation, but the bartender and server acted as if it was business as usual. I will never frequent this restaurant again. And I would caution you to reconsider having a meal there. Unbelievable."
8/25/2019,20190825,1,4.15,"After eating a meal. My friend noticed a cockroach eating the food that had drop from her plate to the table. The response from the bartender was ""welcome to New York."" If the cockroaches are that bold. Could you imagine what's going on in the kitchen! Eat at your own risk."
8/29/2019,20190829,5,4.15,"Stopped in for breakfast, but ended up getting more brunch. The coconut fish sandwich came with a lot of food and priced reasonably."
8/31/2019,20190831,3,4.15,This place is okay. I don't understand the hype. The food is decent but the wait to get in is usually very long. It is one of the only brunch spots in the area though...
9/1/2019,20190901,3,4.15,"Helen Keller would probably enjoy this place.Allow me to explain. The food at The Edge is not life changing, but it's definitely good. The jerk chicken was mouth water, and the mashed potatoes were spectacular. The drinks were nothing to write home about (even though I am writing about them here), but they were fairly priced at $4 for the house wine and $7 for cocktails during happy hour. All in all, the food left us with a smile on our faces.Sadly, this is where the accolades end. The staff at The Edge are alike to this country's current leadership in that they are unqualified, inept, and a bit rude. The service at the Edge was lackluster. Not only did it take about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, but the manager/bartender (who had previously tried to make us move to the bar because a party with one additional person arrived and was waiting on a table, (even though no one had come to take our food order yet (also TRIPLE PARENTHESIS))) refused to do anything about it, telling us this wait time was normal. The final nail in the coffin was that no one refilled our water, asked us if we wanted more drinks, or offered to hand feed me.I'm sorry the Edge. Maybe if it was 1845, and chicken did not come from the Super Foodtown, and had to be hunted with bows and arrows from Staten Island, maybe then a wait time of 40 minutes would be acceptable. Maybe if you had a Michelin star, and your food was doing a single thing to push the culinary bar, a wait time of 40 minutes would be acceptable. But it's neither of those things, so the wait time is in fact, not acceptable.Hellen Keller would enjoy this place because you have to shut off all your senses except for taste and smell to enjoy The Edge. Maybe in 2080, when Elon Musk has eliminated the working class with butler robots and ordering at The Edge can be done with touchscreens, maybe then this place will be worth a visit. Until then, stick to takeout, or walk a few more blocks to Fumo, the greatest gift the [deity of your choice] has blessed upon Harlem."
9/4/2019,20190904,4,4.15,"Great little lively spot for brunch. It was packed with at least a 20 minute wait. I appreciate their digital waitlist via yelp, it made everything easier. Really good Caribbean menu. I thought the cod fritters were excellent. I also had the shrimp and grits. They need to change the seasoning on the shrimp and it would be perfect. Drinks were also too watery. Minus 1 star as my friend didn't even finish her sangria. My mango mimosa was nice though."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.15,"This place deserves 1 Michelin Star, if the criteria is ""worth traveling to"". Many folks looking for a great experience miss this gem, with proper cocktails and punches. It is very European in it's location, use of space, and lighting, and has an inviting vibe that would appeal to any global traveller.The small jerk chicken caesar salad, especially at $10, is a great start. Add to that a six-piece jerk chicken wing dish for $10. For a real jerk lover, this is one of the best combos in NYC. (The jerk chicken is fall.off.the.bone. It is presented with a fully opaque layer of black jerk seasoning that is neither too sweet nor too hot. I have eaten prob thousands of wings in my life. This is one of the five best chicken experiences I've had in my almost 50 years. The wings came out so hot to the touch the bones burned my fingertips. Jerk Wing Magic.Their 580 cocktail ($14) is delicious (a little too sweet, but huge). The half and full carafes are great fruity Jamaican options. Any of the capable bartenders will dial down the syrup if you ask nicely.The crowd is unpretentiously cool and very diverse on many levels. Great music, skewing toward dancehall, roots reggae, and many other styles popular in Jamaican spots in London.(Please note: I only included the bone in the jerk shot to show how cleanly the meat fell off the bone.)"
9/6/2019,20190906,2,4.15,"The only reason this review is getting a 2 is due to the fact that the food was good. However, (since I rarely, if ever do this) I feel obligated to call out the terrible customer service at this establishment. The power trip of the front hostess/ her stank vibe, and the off putting waiter at the bar (I guess that's what you call it, since we were on bar stools) was the craziest customer service I've had in years. I could get better service at McDonald's. Long story short, I come in with my close friends who recommended the place. I'm in a great mood, say hello, etc. We made reservations for 2, but an extra friend of ours came along. We asked if we could add one person, the hostess got all flustered and said ""you made it for 2. We don't have room."" (Mind you, there was only one to two people behind us. We could have waited). My friend (who's pregnant) made a sarcastic joke saying she could stand, and the woman then gave me a random dirty look stating, ""I'm not going to let a pregnant woman stand while your friends sit"". (Yeah, like I'm gonna let my pregnant friend stand, gtfoh!). I volunteer to stand, and my friends are seated while I stand. For well over 30-40 minutes, I'm standing and the crowd is now gone. No one in line, etc. I look over at her, and she doesn't offer me a seat or anything. Just lets me stand there. So, I go to grab a bar stool to sit. Immediately, she comes rushing over with her stank, condescending attitude and says, ""Those are going to be used for someone on the list!"" As she got all lectur-ey, I admit...I turned my full body to my friend Swan and blocked her out. I had enough of her condescending attitude. This is when my friend steps in, calling out the stank vibe and how she's done nothing to get me seated. Finally, in a hissy fit, she angrily cleans up the stool next to me and says condescendingly, ""There you go. You can sit there."" The moment I sit down, my friend Swan scooches her chair over to be closer to our friends. Immediately, the power trip hostess AGAIN comes over and moves her arms to part literally the Red Sea, and says, ""I need a walkway right here to the cash register!"" (Mind you, there was no such walk way prior when we sat down). Then, the service from the waiter felt cold and only the food was good. Let me be clear -- I got my start and big break in life from being the front desk/ host person, and I took pride in my job knowing I'm the face of the brand I'm working for...even when I was only making 13.50 an hour. Her whole bad vibe and power trip has made me NEVER want to go there again, and I will turn everyone away from there. Sucks, because the food was good. Bad employees create bad business. Change your attitude. Don't bring that ish to work with you. I've never had an experience like that. To get me this mad, you have to be a terrible employee. For real. This is the whole truth and nothing but. Get a more compassionate, caring, and happy hostess. The stank vibes aren't fun on a Labor Day brunch with close friends."
9/8/2019,20190908,3,4.14,Came here years ago for a brunch. I have been here three times. The food is good but its not memorable for me to keep coming back its like if I'm in neighborhood i'll go. The first time he had jerk chicken sandwich...excellent . The chicken was so good i wish i had more the waffles wasnt bad either but i always remember the chicken. Drinks nothing too spectacular
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.15,"One of my favorite brunch and dinner spots. It's super cute inside and the owners are wonderful. Food, drinks and atmosphere are great. I could prob eat here once a week! The codfish fritters are delicious!!"
9/10/2019,20190910,5,4.15,"I'm so grateful that I found this place! I went last week at the end of the lunchtime shift. I don't have time to complete this review but the food is excellent, the staff is attentive and you'd be cheating yourself if you didn't stop by and give it a try."
9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.15,The first place we ate on our NYC trip and it did not disappoint! All of our food was great but try the coconut fish sandwich (my friends all wanted some cuz it was so good!) everyone treated us great and the vibe was so happy. Loved it
9/23/2019,20190923,5,4.15,"Lovely spot for groups of 2-4. Juliet and Justine Masters are geniuses for this Harlem spot, with scrumptious British-Jamaican-New York eats. Whether you prefer jerk chicken, fish and chips, or veggie burgers, the menu always delights. Definitely recommend ""The 580"" rum punch!"
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.15,"Our favorite place to eat! Favorite things on the menu are the crispy fries and burger, ginger margarita, shrimp and grits, the BLT, the cod fritters, and fish and chips. The burger and fries are the best I've had in the city!I've been coming here for over a year and I've never had a meal I didn't like."
10/6/2019,20191006,5,4.15,"I highly recommend trying this place out. The food was delicious and for the price the portion was even better. I came for brunch on a Saturday i believe, I'm not sure if they take reservations but we just walked in. It's not very spacious inside but I'll definitely go again !"
10/14/2019,20191014,3,4.15,"This place is crowded on brunch days. We waited for 30 minutes then was wedged between two tables. Im small so squeezing into my seat was ok. If your a adult size that may be a issue. My date orded the jerk chicken burger, which he loved. I had the pancakes that were a bit dense and dry. The whipped cream was good along with the berries, just wasnt much of either to help the pancakes. The bacon was greasy but cooked well. I may return and order something else."
10/19/2019,20191019,5,4.15,"Drinks are tasty and great for the value. Every time we have dinner here we order two 580 punch per person and we all leave feeling very nice lol. Jerk Wings are a must on the appetizer list, and the Burgers are melt in your mouth good. Also if they ever have the Curry Chicken with Coconut rice on special please get it you will not be disappointed. The wait staff are super attentive and get you w.e you need at the drop of a dime!!!!"
10/20/2019,20191020,4,4.15,"Great food and atmosphere, recommended the cod fritters and festival, they were amazing. The rum punch was amazing as well, truly amazing place to go and unwind with friends and families."
11/16/2019,20191116,5,4.15,"One of our favorite spots to brunch uptown. If you haven't brunched here you need to add it to your list. Theirs isn't a ""turn up"" brunch like they have at some other uptown spots, but the food is always amazing. Very cozy atmosphere and great service every time. Looking forward to coming back to experience the dinner menu."
11/23/2019,20191123,3,4.15,"This place is a hidden gem. The food is good the drinks are good, very lively crowd. Unfortunately with their success they have forgotten about personal customer service. We asked to be seated at an available table for two, we were refused and told the table was for four. The table remained vacant until we left. We were seated adjacent to the bar which greatly diminished our experience. A bit disappointing."
11/25/2019,20191125,4,4.15,My Friend and me had a wonderful Brunch at the Edge Harlem. I will encourage anyone going to this location to try out the Waffle and Jerk Chicken! The location is very intimate and a great place for a date. NB: I still believe that the customer service can be better!
12/11/2019,20191211,4,4.15,"I can't believe I have reviews The Edge yet. It's literally one of my favorite neighborhood spots. Whether you're looking for a vibey place to grab a drink, a perfect date spot or a great latte, this place is perfect.My go to is the burger, it's so good and fills you up. I'm not big on fries but theirs accompany the burger well and are pretty crispy. Last time I visited I tried the fritters, sliders and jerk chicken caesar. Tbh, I was not a fan of the fritters at all. They weren't flavorful enough to me. The salad on the other hand, was great. And it was JERK so I'd you can't handle spice, it might not be your thing. The sliders were yummy as well. As far as warm drinks, they make a meannnnnnnnn almond chai latte. Also - try the rum punch. You're welcome"
12/14/2019,20191214,3,4.15,"This place is so adorable, but the food just wasn't all that in my opinion . We ordered the lamb burger special ( super dry and thick), the Parmesan grits ( nothing too special), and the jerk chicken wrap which was plastered with mayo. The best thing about the brunch was their signature 580 drink and their fries . The staff was friendly and the environment was very calm and chill . I'll come by to give the other menu options a try and definitely for another 580 drink"
12/18/2019,20191218,5,4.15,"Nothing special about the atmosphere but the food did the job as well as the drinks. As long as I'm drunk and my meal taste good, it's all thumbs up for me. I must repeat tho, the food was a 11 on a scale to 10. Not vouching for them b/c I've only been here once but the food was def good."
12/22/2019,20191222,4,4.15,Me and my daughter were trying all summer long to revisit but it was always crowded and the wait was always an hour. We've been here about three times and always enjoyed their food. I ordered the Cod Fish Fritters and my daughter ordered the Crab Cakes. I had the Mimosas with Hibiscus. We waited for sometime before our orders arrived. My fritters were cold and I sent them back. The waiter came back with a fresh hot order. They were well seasoned but a bit oily and the jerk dipping sauce was great. My daughter's crab cakes were cooked and seasoned very well. Overall it was a good brunch.
12/26/2019,20191226,5,4.15,"This is my favorite brunch spot of all time. Every time I come back to New York for the holidays or breaks, this is my go-to spot for meet ups with friends and family. The service is great. It's affordable fresh and delicious food. The drinks?! 10/10. I 100% recommend. And it's black owned."
12/31/2019,20191231,2,4.15,"The Edge......hmmmm where should I begin? Let's start with the positives (because honestly there aren't too many positive things for me to say). Sorry not sorry!! The Atmosphere is great! The restaurant is well decorated, cute, and very charming. The Rum Punch is full of bold flavors and very very juicy! Annnnnd that's a wrap on the pleasantries......Because the environment is so adorable and the Rum Punch was so great I was super excited about the restaurant selection.....Oh how quickly was I let down.... Let's start with the waitress. She was obviously not having the best day..... she was not friendly, didn't crack one smile and had no desire to even pretend as though she was interested to expound on the menu. Well, to be fair she was probably just swamped with the huge crowd that came in bc she appeared to be the only waitress taking orders. Later on throughout the service a much friendlier young man came out to assist her and put her out of her misery. After I did research on this establishment I thought we were in for a fabulous treat with a mixture of authentic Caribbean food and American food. Boy was I ever wrong! The Caribbean selection was very limited... The Jerk Chicken tasted like regular old baked chicken and the plantains were the worst I have ever had. I also had a cheddar and bacon omelette that was regular schmegular. The waffles were dry and blah. Overall, there was nothing ""Cutting Edge"" going on at ""The Edge"". The entire experience was very mediocre and there was NOTHING....I mean NOTHING authentic about the Caribbean food. Do NOT believe the hype!!"
1/2/2020,20200102,1,4.14,"I didn't actually get to eat here. Yelp said they open at 9am. Having flown in on a redeye that landed around 5am, we were hungry and showed up right at 9. The restaurant wasn't open though we could see workers inside. We peered in the window and the employees saw us, but did not immediately acknowledge our presence. At around 9:07 and employee came out and said they were going to open for coffee but that the kitchen doesn't open until 10am. I politely told him that Yelp says they open at 9 so they might want to clarify that with them. He proceeded to argue with me about how they can't control what Yelp says. I'm not sure how true that is... I was just trying to help because they will lose customers (lost me) if it's incorrect."
1/18/2020,20200118,5,4.14,My fav go to local spot. I have been here more than 10c and the food quality is always consistent as is the service and the vibe. I take everyone here when they are visiting me from other borough's or out of state and they fall in love with this place. Love that its locally owned.
1/20/2020,20200120,5,4.15,My sisters and i went for the brunch and the customer service and food was excellent. We plan on going back and inviting more family and friends.
1/24/2020,20200124,4,4.15,"On the edge of St. Nicholas Park & Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem is The Edge, an establishment on the edge of brunch and booze, England & Jamaica, and fine dining & comfort food.The Edge features images of artists Harlem made famous like Langston Hughes who asked ""What happens to a dream deferred?"" Fortunately, you don't have to find out here as part of your dining experience. We were welcomed pleasantly by a server behind the bar who offered us an option of seating for our party of three. As we viewed the menu, we were greeted with offerings with an interesting African Diasporic theme. First stop is Jamaica. Jerk and curry spices find a new edge infusing salads, soups and sandwiches. You also find yourself on the edge of England with options of hot savory pies, fish and chips and other goodies from across the Pond. The last stop is New York where you can stay home with classic brunch options like waffles, eggs and bagels. The fries were the kind that are so hot, crispy and lightly seasoned so that no ketchup is needed.The avocado smash required a little additional salt, but was also a healthy delight with mixed greens. The person who ordered the curry chicken sandwich also enjoyed it. The plantains were sweet but also crispy. I had the piping hot split pea soup and festival (a fried Caribbean sweet bread reminiscent of an old fashioned donut). One of my dining partners, a coffee snob, enjoyed their house blend which is an impressive feat. These attentions to detail is what makes this place stand out.The Edge provides comfort to take the edge off. And it places you in proximity to a global story told right here- on the edge of Harlem."
1/24/2020,20200124,4,4.15,"It's very nice and cozy in here and food was amazingly delish ,the cheesecake was delicious as well,the service was ok,the waiter kept on forgetting to bring us what we ordered but I'll give it another chance"
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.15,"This might be the cutest breakfast spot in Harlem! It's tucked away on the corner of 139th and Edgecomb. It's slightly quiet but there seemed to be a steady flow of customers. They serve brunch everyday! (The millennial's dream) The menu seems to feature a mix of Jamaican, English, and traditional New York/American breakfast and lunch dishes. I had the curry chicken and coconut rice special. It was ah-maze-zing!! So flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. You also get a very healthy portion (for about $16).My friend and I ordered three side dishes, but we probably didn't need to--we were full after eating the main dish. The service was great. They were super friendly. I highly recommend this place!"
2/1/2020,20200201,5,4.15,"I love The Edge. This place is a gem - great food, great drinks, great service and a great atmosphere. My wife and I try to come here at least once a month and we are always impressed with the food. I highly recommend the Jerk Chicken Burger, shrimp and grits, The Edge Burger, or the pancakes. Oh and don't forget to order a 580 (rum punch + champs)."
2/6/2020,20200206,3,4.15,"I had the shrimp and grits, it was a little pricey. The atmosphere was great. The staff were super friendly and super efficient. The food came out hot and very fast. The taste of the parmesan grits were good. I wasn't a hige fan of the shrimp, but the grits and eggs were really tasty. I cant wait to come back and try a different dish."

2/21/2020,20200221,4,4.15,"Okay, so The Edge is a staple restaurant in the neighborhood. I love the Caribbean flare on the menu - food is above average. I've visited a few times throughout the years since it's opened, and have even ordered take out, and overall I'd say not much has changed when it comes to quality of food. Never really had a major complaint or issue - I think it's best to say you get exactly what you expect from here. But I do believe the operations of the space needs improvement. For instance, it can be a bit disorganized upon arrival when trying to get seated. The space is tight, so check in needs to be streamlined! Also, when trying to order takeout the phones have been disconnected or unanswered on multiple occasions - and it's super annoying. I'm surprised at how the restaurant continues to thrive in such a low foot traffic, quiet area, but I'm here for it. And I'm definitely here for all the festivals (fried dumpling) - life changing."

My Bf ordered the Edge BLT and it was the most requested plate. Everything was so delicious. I also has the saut√©ed kale . That was also a nice addition to my plate but not necessary. I would and will definitely will come back sooner than later. A magical mix of English, Jamaican, and New York style."

It was a bit pricey, but it's worth it for the taste. I had the grits and shrimp. For an appetizer I had the cod fritters. Sooo yum. We had a corner table near the window which had great lighting. I had a mango mimosa to drink which I basically devoured. Would def recommend. If you do plan on going on a Sunday, you should book a reservation. Wait times can get pretty wild. My wait time for a table of 3 was an hour and a half. We didn't end up waiting that long but that's the time that was given to us. We were let in some time under that but I didn't keep track."

3/13/2020,20200313,5,4.16,When I say I loveeeee this place that's an understatement lol. This place have been my go to brunch for the longest. The food is amazing and the drinks are strong. I usually sit at the bar and Alexis is wonderful. I stumble across this place with my boyfriend one day and we been coming here ever since. Today I brought my best friend with me and needless to say she is definitely hooked lol. She had coconut chicken with jasmine rice I had the jerk shrimp Caesar salad and we Also had the 3 side sweet plantain kale and mixed green as our side. We paired it with the carafe of rum punch anddddddf then Alexis introduce us to the ginger margarita OMG I don't think I will be ordering the rum punch next time I come lol
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.16,"Loved the tacos from this place! I ordered two jerk chicken tacos and two cod tacos. The jerk chicken was seasoned perfectly and so moist and juicy. They had citrusy jackfruit and crispy red cabbage. The cod tacos were also delicious, and the cod was breaded with coconut which added a great crunch and texture. It was topped with avocado and red cabbage. Both of these dishes are great! I had some fries, also seasoned and crisp. I also ordered the mushroom and cheddar grilled cheese on eight grain bread. The flavors were good and the cheese was well melted, but the bread was toasted a little darker than my preference. I don't think much could have been done about that because of the type of bread.This place has a great looking menu with some innovative dishes as well as vegetarian offerings. Can't wait to try again."
6/23/2020,20200623,5,4.16,"How is the to-go food JUST AS GOOD as being in the restaurant? I ordered the burger 3 seperate times, and every time, I swear it seemed to get better and better. The most crispy fries ever, you'd swear there was no way possible they could have ever been in a plastic to-go container-not even for even 5 minutes!!! The Burger?!!!, BY FAR, the BEST burger in Harlem (I've tried so far). AND FOR TO-GO!!!??? How is it always, PERFECTLY medium rare? THAT IS RARE RARE!!!! I have loved dining at The Edge, loving ordering to-go from The Edge, and looking forward to coming back upon re-open!!! OH! and I LOVE to recommend people to The Edge!!! I LOVE THE EDGE!!! Might just order Medium Rare Burger tonight!!!"
7/9/2020,20200709,5,4.16,The food here is so good! Fresh food with a island vibe! I loved this place for Brunch since the pandemic I order my food to go and nothing has changed! The Salmon burger is a must try and the ginger mimosas are my favorite.
7/13/2020,20200713,4,4.16,"This is a very good Caribbean restaurant in Harlem. I had takeout-since it was raining-but apparently they are open for outdoor dining. Not a huge number of tables, but definitely worth checking out in nicer weather. I had some jerk chicken and fries, which were great. The staff was a bit reactionary, re: enforcing ""social distancing"" guidelines, but considering the way the City has been harassing restaurants-which are treading water in normal times-I can't really blame them. Overall, a pleasant experience and good food."
8/19/2020,20200819,1,4.16,"Worst manager ever! Kosta when asked about the bees that were harassing us at brunch told to basically ""suck it up"" because it's nature...after swatting and killing three were told that we should have known better to order another karafe bc the bugs are attracted to sweet things...unacceptable and forced to leave our drinks behind and pay to the bill to avoid such disgusting treatment...btw another bee appeared as we asked for the check... so sad bc we sought this place bc of the black ownership and then the Not black manager was rude and disrespectful"
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.16,"The food here is always spectacular. The coconut fish is unbelievably good and the fries are super crispy and tasty. You should definitely try their Jamaican dishes too. The curry chicken is tender and flavorful. Pair that with the coconut rice and plantains and you will have a meal experience you won't forget. The only downside can be the long wait times if you go at peak brunch time on the weekends. Other than that, time it just right and you'll be seated and served quickly!"
9/17/2020,20200917,3,4.16,I was really excited about going to this restaurant. Unfortunately the food wasn't the best. I ordered the jerk chicken and waffles and both the chicken and waffles were extremely dry. I did like the shrimp and grits but it was simply just ok. The drinks (which I can't remember what I had) was okay as well. The service was great! I ask to return the jerk chicken and waffles to replace it with the shrimp and grits and they did which was nice.
9/18/2020,20200918,1,4.15,"When a friend that I've not seen in awhile asked to have lunch today, I was excited to recommend this place as I've been wanting to give it a try. He had suggested another place, but I said no let's go here. I ordered the coconut fish tacos, which I have to say was pretty tasty and said to myself I would totally come back for these. However, there are other issues at hand that will deter me from returning. 1. Coffee---really terrible coffee. It was waay too bitter. Server was nice enough to take it back and not charge me for it. 2. Sanitation practices: I observed tables being cleaned with a rag, but didn't see any sanitation solution anywhere. I asked for hot sauce, they brought over bottles (which was probably touched by others). Again, didn't notice any sanitation wipes of any kind either. Condiments should always be put into separate containers for each use. 3. Gloves and masks: Servers wore masks, didn't see anyone with gloves on, especially when they are setting and cleaning table after table. You should have only one person do all the bussing if gloves aren't going to be used.  After finishing my meal, I went inside to use the restroom. I noticed the cooks, to my surprise NO ONE was wearing gloves and masks. One person had a mask, but it was pulled down below his chin. Had I seen this from the get go, I would have never sat down to dine. 4. GRATUITY INCLUDED!! Don't mind if it is, but the server should have verbally mentioned that upon delivering the check. That's very shady practice. Overall service was good, our server was pretty attentive, which is why gratuity included wouldn't have been an issue as he deserved the tip, but again a little heads up would be professional.I am sad to say that I will probably not return and would not recommend to my friends."

10/3/2020,20201003,4,4.15,Went Friday evening for dinner with my boyfriend. It was our first time and they had outdoor seating. Its first come first serve so make sure you and your friends are all together. We were seated and for drinks I got a Ginger Margarita and my boyfriend got a Rum Punch both drink were really good. I order an appetizer with our drinks but we never got it. We order our entrees and it was a bit of a wait but well worth it once we got our food. I had jerk chicken once before but never like this. The flavor and spice smacked my taste buds. My spices tolerance is not that high but I couldn't stop eating the jerk chicken pasta. I had a piece of the hanger steak as well and it was flavorful too. Except my boyfriend said the potatoes/yams were hard and tastes a bit old. Other then that everything was good.

10/4/2020,20201004,4,4.15,Been trying to go here for ages and it didn't disappoint. High end Caribbean food and potent drinks! The staff was very friendly and gave some great recommendations. A few the sides we wanted were not being offered unfortunately. I went with the Curry Chicken and it was spectacular. Hit the spot! Will definitely be back to see the other parts of the menu.

It is a perfectly lite meal with a balance of sweet, healthy and balanced. I haven't tried anything else, but I've had the fish 4 times."

10/25/2020,20201025,2,4.15,"I eat here pretty often but my last two experiences has been awful. A friend and I ordered a salad and curry chicken. The food took so long they gave us our drinks on the house, the salad was so salty it wasn't edible and the server didn't care he just wanted his shift to be over. The curry chicken was a plate of mush like no care in the world what they were serving that night. I ordered for from Grubhub lox's and bagel which was fine. Jerk salmon linguine. The smallest piece of salmon with over over done spaghetti noodles that was cold as ever. I also ordered a jerk chicken Caesar which didn't have any dressing on it after waiting so long for my food. I called and ask for dressing which I then waited 40 mins to receive. People expect good service for money they are spending especially at a time like this we have to do better"

The food is always amazing and authentic (I took my Jamaican friend here a little while back, and she said the ackee and salt cod reminded her of her mother's!). Living in Harlem, I have always supported Black and brown owned businesses and particularly during this time, the attention to detail and kind service were particularly appreciated. We will be back!"

The jerk lime dip took the fritters to the next level. The BLT had just the right amount of garlic mayo. And the sorrel had a nice kick of ginger. The staff was also super kind and the bartender made a great recommendation. Would I go back? Absolutely. No question about it."

12/5/2020,20201205,5,4.15,This is a small gem in the upper north side of harlem. There was no wait time really at 7pm (that was awesome) Temperature check is required. The food was amazing. The fish tacos are to die for! The rum punch and other drinks were fine. Im personally not a fan of The ginger in the margarita but its okay. Def will be going back soon!!
1/29/2021,20210129,5,4.15,One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. I order here at least 1-2 times a week. Their salmon burger is my absolute favorite. The codfish fritters are yummy too!! I recommend it!
2/9/2021,20210209,2,4.15,"If you don't mind waiting a long time for your food, by all means go to this restaurant. This is my second bad experience with the customer service and wait times. I can't do it anymore."
2/10/2021,20210210,5,4.15,"When I first discovered this place I went almost every weekend for brunch for 2 months straight. Always brought new people who loved the cozy vibe, personal touches, and many brunch options and combinations. For brunch the chicken and waffles (ask for the waffles slightly crunchier if you're into that), jerk chicken burger and veggie burger are my faves but everything is good. Also love having the option of 3 sides to share. For dinner I've loved the curry chicken, jerk wings, coco rice. Plantains for all the meals have been perfect. Also the DRINKS are *chef's kiss*. Ginger marg and rum punch are IT!"
3/17/2021,20210317,5,4.15,"Ate my brunch of shrimp n grits along with Belgian waffles and jerk chicken outside in the sun, in full bliss. The people are so lovely, service is amazing, food obviously next level. Everyone go."
4/4/2021,20210404,4,4.15,Ordered takeout.... The fish and grits were delicious!!! Extremely flavorful and filling. It reminded me of a warm breakfast from my southern grandma.
4/16/2021,20210416,5,4.15,Amazing soup options and Delicious saladsI opt-out of the cheese and protein options in the salads and everything left more than suffices. These are the options I choose as on my plant-based diet.
4/17/2021,20210417,5,4.15,"I've been to this spot a few times but I'll speak on my most recent experience. I went here for Brunch when they were doing outside seating. It took about 30 minutes to be seated, as it was first come, first serve, but the experience was well worth it. You can get carafes of mostly any drink. We had the ginger margarita and the rum punch, but I believe you could get carafes of mimosas, bellinis, etc. For food, I went with their jerk chicken and waffles. The jerk chicken is a little spicy, but, for me, it was manageable. For people that do not like spice, I would not recommend. Also, I had the codfish fritters appetizer. These are my absolute favorite. I've ordered these every time, I've gone here. Overall, I've thoroughly enjoyed the food here. I'd highly recommend trying this place out."
5/1/2021,20210501,1,4.15,"Idk where to start HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE We waited over an hour for brunch , could've went to McDonald's for breakfast instead and enjoyed it .Customer service : #BadSam our waitress was rude and very matter factly, when we asked about the menu "" no cannot do that , no""Okay we ordered a pitcher of mimosas ... our food came everything came at the end of the meal they brought the drinks . ( we sent it back because it didn't make any sense we were already done ) Food : Was okay , chicken ( waffles & chicken ) was OVER seasoned ( salty & spicy ) when using chicken breast you don't have to over seasoned because it soaks up flavor well . It wasn't a thick cut of meat .Fritters were cold, dry and mediocre Best part was the PANCAKE CREAMNN lol only"
5/17/2021,20210517,5,4.15,Amazing! Finally tried this place for takeout post-pandemic and was so blown away.Savory veggie pie of the day: huge half pie (it took up half of the takeout container) + side salad with dressing on the side that I couldn't stop eating.Salmon burger: better than I ever thought a salmon burger could be?? The toasted bun also survived the 15-20 minute trip home really well. This came with a side salad too. I can't wait to try more things here!
5/19/2021,20210519,2,4.15,"I've heard good things about this place from my aunt so I decided to try it out for brunch today. Unfortunately, I was left a little disappointed. After my friend and I were seated it took a while for the waitress to take our order. We finally get to order and while my food came out okay(it was on the verge of lukewarm) my friend's burger wasn't cooked to the requested temperature.Also, when I unwrapped my silverware to eat my food, there was still food stuck to that fork.When we alerted the waitstaff they did apologize and fix each situation, but it just seemed like issues were happening back to back y'know?I really do try to give others grace as I've had multiple jobs in the service industry, but this wasn't the best experience as a first time guest."
5/27/2021,20210527,3,4.14,"Came here for Sunday brunch. The food was an 8/10 but the service was bad. It took a long time to get the attention of our waiter that another waiter had to assist us. Some things we ordered didn't come out on time, so three people were waiting for their food. Our table wasn't fully set so we had to ask for utensils. Overall i would give it 7 and i probably wouldn't go there again."
5/27/2021,20210527,5,4.15,"Wow, The Edge Harlem was really wonderful. Little touches are nice. The most flavorful menu item for me was Jerk Chicken Caesar Salad. The crew was very courteous and service is perfect. Definitely recommending this place to my friends!"
6/1/2021,20210601,5,4.15,"Carrot and Ginger Soup w/ Festival - The most refreshing soup ever. It was cold and rainy my first day in NYC and I was wet and freezing. This soup saved my lil anemic soul. It was flavorful but not too much of any one thing it was PERFECT. The festival we assumed was a NYC way of saying hush puppy Lol. It's not. It's softer and sweeter than that and it made the soup just sing. Ughhhhh I could eat another bowl just writing about it. Spicy Shrimp w/ Mango Slaw - As you can see in the photo it's definitely not served with a ""slaw"" it's just raw cabbage. I asked for more of the mango mixture that was on the shrimp and that made it better. The shrimp were cooked perfectly. Cod Fish Fritters w/ Jerky Lime Dip - These were yummy but a bit dense and greasy for my liking. The dipping sauce I could've showered in. It was everything. Curry Chicken w/ Coconut Rice & Plantains - Tender chicken in a very delicious curry sauce. The rice was a great accompaniment of course and the plantains were divine especially dipped in the curry. Omg what a tasty bite. I also had the best glass of Riesling known to man. Went to three different wine stores and no one carries it. (Insert devastated face)"
6/14/2021,20210614,4,4.15,Great place to visit. I love that it's low-key and the food is very good. The rum punch is amazing. Juliet the owner is very nice and professional. I wish she was their at The Edge all the time. The only thing I don't care for is the dude behind the bar. He isn't the nicest and always seems to be in a not so good mood when I visit. My best friend and I went yesterday at 3:30 and wanted something that wasn't on the brunch menu and he told the waiter that was serving us no they can't do that. The waiter was very apologetic and sad he was sorry. I didn't think that was very nice especially if I'm welling to pay for what I want. Oh and not everyone eats brunch until 5pm on a Friday after work. Otherwise The Edge is a very cute place and great food just don't ask the guy behind the bar to much of anything.
6/17/2021,20210617,5,4.15,I love the energy of this place. The Host (David) has amazing high-vibe energy and offers great recommendations. Try thr 508 Rum Punch! Great location and intimate as well.
6/20/2021,20210620,2,4.15,"It's hard to write a poor review when the food is so good but as a foodie this needs to be said. You go to restaurants for the experience and while the food is important the service is as well. The wait staff rushed the meal, clearly wanted to leave, even though we had a 8pm reservation. And they were just rude. I have said this every single times I've come here and this is visit 4. Unfortunately it gets old, they will likely not get a visit 5 from me or the fam. So unfortunate!"
6/20/2021,20210620,5,4.15,"Went for brunch on June 5th. Overall, a great dining experience. We had the Jamaican breakfast, Jerk chicken & waffles and shrimp & grits, all excellent. Service was also excellent. Definitely will go back."
6/29/2021,20210629,1,4.14,The service was very rude and not accommodating. I was asked to sit at bar when I arrived which I did because they were closing until 5pm . At 5pm I asked for a table for two and was refused claiming reservations were made. The website shpuld state you need a reservation before arriving . Ispent $40 at bar and was willing to buy dinner and was asked to sit at bar - I refused and left with take out. BYE - to the Harlem Edge - waiter staff is the worse.
7/6/2021,20210706,5,4.14,"Today my husband and I ventured out to Harlem to dine at The Edge Harlem. We are originally from Texas, we have a food blog and wanted to try something different. The food and drinks are fantastic. Pictured: Coconut fish burger served with greens & plantains. Also the jerk chicken pasta. Drinks: passion fruit margarita & Housemade ginger beer. If you haven't tried this place yet, you should. We will definitely be back. Make sure you ask for the amazing host, David. Thank you for your wonderful hospitality."
7/7/2021,20210707,2,4.14,"Their food is good, but just not good enough or big enough for the prices. They are very busy for brunch most weekends."
7/9/2021,20210709,4,4.14,"This was my first time here, and I had a pretty good time. We got there at a perfect time, because we only had a 20 minute wait. The waitress was pretty nice. We ordered 2 of the spicy hibiscus mimosas. They tasted kinda like a cranberry mimosa. They were okay. They were priced fairly, but the alcohol in the food gave me and my friend both massive headaches. Then we ordered the cajun chicken and waffles and the plantain crabcakes. While the plantain crabcakes were good, the chicken and waffles were the star of the meal! They were so delicious and well seasoned. I would definitely go back just for that! Overall we had a good meal, and didn't feel rushed at all. Would recommend"
7/10/2021,20210710,5,4.14,The place was nice and cozy. I had the Jumbo shrimps and it was absolutely delicious. The waiter was very pleasant. Let just say I will be back.
7/15/2021,20210715,5,4.14,Great food and atmosphere. Love the ginger beer. The roasted vegetables and sweet plantains were amazing. The location of this cozy little restaurant makes it a neighborhood gem.
7/24/2021,20210724,4,4.14,I went to The Edge in June for brunch. There was about a 15 minute-ish wait even though we had reservations. The food was really good but the rum punch was just okay. The wait staff seemed overwhelmed but they tried and overall did a good job with service.
7/26/2021,20210726,2,4.14,"So sad about my last experience at The Edge. I was super excited to take my family here for the first time (for dinner) because I've had great experiences every single time - granted I've only had brunch here. I'm not sure what happened this time around, but it was not up to par. First, I'm okay with slow service. I know it can be overwhelming, especially for one person catering to a bunch of tables, but in the service industry, service is the most important. It can make or break someone's experience, and we did not receive good service. Our waiter was rude and distant... The lack of care we were given was really disappointing. We ordered appetizers and weren't given plates, and basically ate over our hands, until I got uncomfortable and asked for appetizer plates, which is usually brought out once we put in an appetizer order. Secondly, ALL of our entrees were cold... COLD... and that in itself says something. We sent food back, for it to come back just the same... Would I go back for dinner or at all, I really don't know. This left a bad taste."
8/1/2021,20210801,2,4.14,"I would love to rate this place higher but I've been here a few times, and I'm unfortunately just not feeling it. I think The Edge is probably a place that does some dishes great and does some... not so great, and maybe I've been getting the not so great items. The few times I've been here the service has been decent. I actually appreciate it sometimes when the server is not constantly checking in, so to be greeted, place an order, get your food and then get a check in again is fine with me. If you like more check in's than that, then this place would probably leave more to be desired. On my most recent visit, I had to ask for new utensils because mine were slightly dirty. They replaced them quickly, so I wasn't really bothered. What did bother me was the food as it was definitely lackluster. My friend got the shrimp and grits, and you'll see from the pictures it just looked sad. The tiniest of shrimp swimming in a sea of sauce with the palest of grits. The taste wasn't great either. I opted for a grilled cheese with bacon and chutney with a side of scrambled eggs and cheese. The scrambled eggs and cheese was the best thing on the entire table, which isn't saying much. If you do not like sweet items, do not add the chutney to your grilled cheese. It was entirely too sweet and overpowered the entire sandwich, which was a shame, really. We both also got the spiced hibiscus mimosa for a brunch drink. It was a little too syrupy for our tastes so we opted not to get another one. We ended up going up the street to the Row to redeem our lackluster brunch, which was disappointing to have to do because I really, really want to like this place but it just does not do it for me."
8/8/2021,20210808,5,4.14,"I visited the Edge with my adult daughters during a recent trip to NY and loved it so much that we returned two additional times during our 11 days in Harlem. The food is fantastic, the service was impeccable, the staff friendly, and the outdoor seating is well thought out and comfortable.  Such a gem!"
8/10/2021,20210810,4,4.14,"Cute spot in Harlem, I discovered this place through a friend. The vibe is cozy and warm. They do have outdoor seating on the sidewalk and in the street.We came on a Sunday and we're seated approx 20 minutes after our reservations. Our waiter (don't remember his name) wasn't friendly and not attentive to our order. It seemed like he was having a bad day or just didn't feel like being ""bothered"". The other staff members were a lot more friendlier though. Hands down my favorite items were the codfish fritters (not featured) and the coconut battered fish. It was so good, so flavorful, and did not disappoint at all!Unfortunately the jerk chicken was just okay. The chicken breast were a bit dry and the jerk flavor wasn't authentic."
8/19/2021,20210819,4,4.14,"Unique place! I was interested in the fusion they advertised. I had never seen a Jamaican and English fusion spot! I went with my wife, my sister, and her boyfriend. We were all impressed! We got various flavors of mimosas for brunch, and were all happy with our food. It was a busy Saturday morning/afternoon, but the food took a while to come out. Once it did it was amazing! The jerk chicken and waffles is a great combination of sweet, savory, and a little spice! Great spot, next time we go back we will be trying more of the delicious menu!!"
8/24/2021,20210824,1,4.13,"I usually love The Edge's jerk wings. I waited for A MONTH for them to reopen and honestly in those few weeks I don't know what happened. I ordered the jerk wings and they immediately looked different (extremely large and undercooked) I kept eating because I was starving and was literally craving them. I waited all day for them to open. The wings were disgustingly huge and undercooked. The meat was pink. I am thoroughly disappointed and saddened because I will not be returning here. One of my favorites is now unfortunately a flop. Please make sure y'all are thoroughly cooking your meat. This is a bad look. I couldn't even finish my meal, I feel nauseated."
8/27/2021,20210827,5,4.13,"It's a very small, ambient space. We chose it because of the great Yelp ratings and reviews for both the food and drinks. We had the shrimp slaw item, carrot ginger soup and a plantain chicken dish. Everything was absolutely amazing! We especially loved the soup and the festival (looks a lot like a hush puppy but is SO MUCH MORE). The festival has meat and vegetables and the perfect moistness. A must try! It came with the soup. The place is minority owned, which I I highly recommend this spot if you're in the area."
9/4/2021,20210904,5,4.13,"My wife and I went in the afternoon, we had a lamb burger and a salmon coconut patty both were great, good music and could still talk,checked our vacation cards to go in :)"
9/11/2021,20210911,5,4.14,"When we moved from Harlem two years ago pre-pandemic, we wanted to have our last meal at the Edge. It's family, community and culturally oriented. It's one of the few restaurants where people wait outside in all types of weather, way before they open (grates down), for brunch. Since returning to nyc, I've dreamt of their jerk wings & large carafe of rum punch. Yesterday it was all on point, as my wife at the Kale salad and cheesecake. This place is a secret gem in nyc that I wish remained a secret just for me, but visit yourself and remember I told u so."
9/14/2021,20210914,5,4.14,"Love this place!! Great place, great people, great food! Pasta Alfredo is delicious, shout out to Tyrell for recommending that pasta!"
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.14,"Came here twice and ordered the same thing. I think i like it lol. Usually come for brunch. If you are planning to arrive late brunch or for dinner on the weekends, i would highly recommend making a reservation. During the week, it seems pretty chill. In order to sit inside you need proof of vaccination. The inside is dim and intimate but good if you are with a group of people still. Reminds me of a speakeasy. The music is mainly on the inside. There is also outdoor seating. The place has a Caribbean vibe with American influence. The area doesnt have many West Indian influenced restaurants so this is appreciated. The plates are what you would sort of ask for if you were at a west Indian restaurant but different portion sizes (smaller but just enough), more greens and possibly waffles. I had the jerk salmon with plantain and mixed greens. Im a weirdly obsessed with the festival here. The drinks are cool. Ive only had the mimosas."
10/13/2021,20211013,5,4.14,"Such a great place to have in the neighborhood. The owners are great and the vibe is always cool and easy going. Love The 580 drink and the bread pudding dessert, that are a must try!"
10/20/2021,20211020,4,4.14,"Exploring the restaurant scene in Harlem has quickly become on of our favorite things to do. We ventured over to the Edge on weeknight and were pleasantly surprised at how busy it was. The indoor space is relatively tight but they offer a fare amount of covered outdoor seating as well. We ordered the jerk shrimp Alfredo and the grilled chicken with coconut rice and fries. The pasta was great, the sauce was smooth and wasnt too cheesy. I do wish the portion size was a bit bigger though. As for the chicken, I was not a fan, I found it dry and underwhelming. We also got the passionfruit margaritas as our drinks and they were amazing, boozed up and sweet, just how I like it. Overall it was a pretty good experience overall"
10/29/2021,20211029,5,4.14,God I miss this place so much they were close temporarily and if you get the opportunity to try their chicken Alfredo jerk chicken it is absolutely to die for the most importantly their jerk chicken wings I seriously next level!!! I would honestly marry the shed that's how good this place is it's always consistently amazing!!! Their fries are double fried and they are seriously jaw-dropping
11/4/2021,20211104,5,4.14,"This was such a cute and welcoming place to eat in Harlem. The outside seating gave a cozy sun porch feel with the plants and wood siding. The menu used a scan code to your phone and they had deals of the day that you can find on their IG stories. The drinks specials were so good and strong!!I got the fish and chips, but this was not your normal fish and chips...The Edge Harlem had a coconut crusted fish that had a sweet and peppery flavor. I didn't even us the tartare sauce for this crispy cracker crunch batted fish. The fries were basic fries but they were very crispy and lightly salted so I can't complain about that. If you're in the areas checkout The Edge Harlem for some good food."
11/8/2021,20211108,5,4.14,"Amazing food and service on a beautifully lined Harlem street. Hibiscus mimosa can get it and cod fish fritters are a must. Love it here and enjoyed my time substantially, can't wait to go back."
11/10/2021,20211110,1,4.14,"I came by on my lunch break about 12pm. I am a registered nurse and was vaccinating our youth at a nearby public school. When I walked in I asked for a menu and was approached by a waiter (I believe) that stated I would have to take a look at the takeout menu on the website. I was was then told that they were only serving brunch. Then he handed me a menu with more less breakfast/not too hungry options. I happened to be famished from the long morning I had. A very nice lady at the bar pointed me to the specials on the wall which were ""off the menu"". The options were jerk chicken with coconut rice, chicken Rasta pasta, shrimp Rasta pasta and salmon I believe. I was so happy!! I ordered chicken and shrimp Rasta pasta. I decided to stay and eat to make the most out of my lunch break. When I told the gentleman who greeted me that I wanted to stay, he seemed taken back with lots of hesitation. He decided it would be a good idea to say"" well you need to show proof of vaccination"" , I said ok yes that's fine. He didn't realize that as I was sitting there waiting for my food, I watched him greet a lovely Caucasian couple that walked in moments after me. He took a strong liking to them, making small talk. He never asked them for proof of vaccination. I just want to remind you, I am a registered nurse in uniform, ID, with colorful vaccination pins all over my top for the kids. I didn't mind him asking me for a vaccination card, as he should. However is he insinuating that Caucasian people are automatically immune to COVID-19?! I was sooooo confused. I was sitting at the bar waiting for my food, I then decided to sit at a table because people started walking up to the bar for takeout and I wanted a little more space. I told him I would like to be seated he told me ""hold on"" then looked at me as if I was going to carry my own food to the table ( I literally have never experienced this level of poor service in my life). He eventually took my food to the table. Then an additional guy comes out from the back I'm not sure who he was, appeared to be a manager or owner. He then starts looking at me weird as I'm eating my lunch. All of the other other tables were checked on and greeted except mines. I sat there and waited and waited and waited for someone to ask me if I was OK, if the food was OK? Or if I wanted anything else. None the above happened and I was there for a good 40 minutes! This is nothing more than a ""carribean""? restaurant catering to a gentrified Caucasian community. Save your money and go to Gunhill road in the Bronx for a real authentic carribean at home experience."
11/13/2021,20211113,5,4.14,"Always good food - typically come for the jerk chicken, staff is friendly, highly recommend."
11/13/2021,20211113,5,4.14,Wow! Wow! Wow! That tamarind mimosa was absolutely the best mimosa I've ever had. The shrimp and grits were amazing. The cod fish fritters were great. The pancakes weren't the greatest but the overall meal was really good. I have to go back to try other items on the menu.
11/18/2021,20211118,1,4.14,"I came here for lunch with a friend on a Thursday afternoon. The staff was very friendly. As I was finishing my glass of water, I notice something in my glass - two dead flies. Yes, flies. I was very disgusted and pointed this out to the waiter and asked for a new glass. I didn't make a big stink about it, but I lost my appetite. I had already ordered the edge BLT with jerk chicken. I didn't really taste any jerk seasoning on the chicken, it tasted more like plain chicken. The sandwich was pretty basic overall, and the fries were ok. The side of mixed greens didn't look very fresh. My friend ordered the edge burger which wasn't cooked the way he asked, but he was pleased with it.This place is very cute and welcoming, but the cleanliness and food are lacking. I won't be returning."
11/19/2021,20211119,5,4.14,"Short version: DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST GO!Long Version: My brother and I weren't even supposed to come to this restaurant -- we ended up here on accident. The next time we visit however, will be on purpose. First off, they actually checked out our vaccination cards and I'm grateful for that attention to detail. We were sat at the bar and a lovely bartender named Peta-Gaye started us off with a full pitcher of Hibiscus mimosa. Again, don't think about it just get it if you're a party of more than one person. Our appetizers were Coconut Battered Fish and Chips which tasted like they came fresh out the fryer. Even the fries were salted to perfection! Also had Jerk wings (with jerk lime dip that was out of control!) As for main courses, Branzino w/ Couscous & Ratatouille for my brother and a Salmon Burger w/ Fried Sweet Plantain for me. The whole fish game with a glaze that elevated the entire dish. The salmon was tender with a great crisp on the patty. The plantains tasted like our mother used to make, not too ripe and fried just enough. We even met the owner at the bar and she was wonderful! Would absolutely recommend and will ABSOLUTELY be back!"
11/21/2021,20211121,3,4.14,"I celebrated my birthday at the Edge recently. The customer service here is excellent. Communicating with the management and making a reservation online was a smooth process. When we arrived the staff were friendly and patient with our group as we decided what we wanted to offer.I'm giving 3 stars because multiple people including myself were disappointed with the food. I ordered the jerk pasta with shrimp. While it was tasty, the proportion of pasta to shrimp was way off. There was so much pasta with very little protein. The oxtails were also not the traditional Jamaican style. I'm used to eating oxtail that has more browning. The color of this oxtail didn't look appetizing to say the least. They also only put 3 pieces of oxtail. For $25 we expected a bit more. Also the festival wasn't the traditional Jamaican style either. It was over fried borderline burnt. The appetizers were our favorites to eat. I highly recommend the codfish fritters and the jerk wings."
11/24/2021,20211124,5,4.14,I love love love this place every time I come. It's so cozy. The food hits a very specific place in my heart.
11/29/2021,20211129,1,4.13,"Don't trust any reservations that you make. I made reservations for a Thursday morning at 11:45 through their own website. Received an email confirmation the day I made the reservations and a text asking me to confirm the reservation on the morning of at 10am. Arrived at 11:40am and the place was completely closed--gate down, doors locked, no one answering the phone. No sign on the door to indicate that they were closed, nothing noted on their website. No idea what happened, but don't plan on being able to eat here."
12/11/2021,20211211,5,4.13,Amazing food . Pure vibes. Helpful device. Welcoming staff. Jerk Quesadillas so good. Shrimp and grits are great as well
1/1/2022,20220101,4,4.13,Just had a great meal at this restaurant for brunch & everything on my plate was simply delicious. Their Waffle is delicious and so is the homemade coffee whip cream they topped it with & the straw/blue berries which were so tasty they had to be organic to taste so good. Their omelette is hearty & goat cheese gives it a fluffy light taste complimented by the parmesan french fries & baby spinach or arugula salad.On a rainy Harlem afternoon the Edge staff delivered great service all around for a fair price. The cappucino to close out my meal was terrific.
1/8/2022,20220108,4,4.13,"The interior of this place is really nice. The menu has a decent amount of options. The codfish fritters are a must, as the lime-anchored sauce that comes with it was an unexpected twist. My open-faced egg sandwich was pretty much a piece of avocado toast and it wasn't much of an experience. The waffle machine was broken, so pancakes were offered instead. Not very good. And the cheesy grits were plated in this odd formation that resembled a pur√©ed banana. I'm giving the place 4 stars because our server Jasmine was excellent."
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.13,"I just finished a cold 12 mile run and my run partner and I were starving. We called the Edge to see if we could come right in. The host was accommodating and gracious. We sat at the bar. Although we were cold, we ordered a 58 (mixed drink) highly suggested by the bartender. He said the drink would warm us up. It looked pretty. My run friend ordered a second drink. I was driving and had a one drink limit. The bartender suggested sorrel and gave me a sample. It was AMAZING! The sorrel was freshly made and each ingredient in the sorrel didn't over power the other. Perfect blend! Overall this restaurant is great! The food was filling the drinks were great. I would definitely come back again."
1/20/2022,20220120,1,4.13,"Yikes,   My point proven. Hence my experience with the unprofessional staff. I'm astounded that owners would talk to a customer thats just speaking their opinion in this manner. Instead of addressing the way I was treated for the 45min that I sat in your restaurant and how invisible I felt!! Its more important to teach me an angry lesson in the difference between Rasta Pasta and ""Fancy Alfredo topped with jerk chicken""! FYI, same thing! Save me with the superficial fakery. You look absolutely ridiculous going word for word debating with a customer that chose your restaurant out of the variety of places in the neighborhood to eat. Further more. I am an educated woman who, A. does not need to use a race card or the pandemic when I'm backed into a corner and it benefits me and B. I absolutely know how it feels to be invisible in the presence of Caucasian people which is exactly how I felt sitting in your resturant. This couple was not asked if they were staying with attitude, they did not have to carry their own plates to the table, and they certainly 100% did not show vaccination cards. I am speaking about my personal experience as I have every right, and you decide that debating with me is good for business? Make sure you create a sign for your customers that reads, don't have an opinion or we will debate with you! Lol!! And Likewise, be well ladies."
1/24/2022,20220124,4,4.13,"We decided to go here to celebrate my mom and sisters birthday. When I went to the website to make a reservation for 8 people, a note on the website directed me to send an email. The email process went pretty smooth, and my reservation was confirmed. I like the fact that they sat my guests as we arrived. They didn't make us wait for the complete party. The inside of the venue is small. We were seated at a table by the wall in the back. When I sat down, I kept hearing a banging noise from the wall. The noise was coming from the kitchen. If you sat by the wall, you heard the noise. The staff should've mentioned that. The restaurant posts specials on a daily basis on IG, its also posted on the wall of the venue. Three of my guests ordered from the daily special. There was a curry chicken special and an omelet special. My guests didn't like the curry special. Everyone else enjoyed their food The rum punch was okay. It tasted better on my previous visit.Helpful hint-If you want to bring in your own birthday cake, its a $20 charge."
2/2/2022,20220202,5,4.13,"Would give this delightful establishment 10 stars if I could. Essential if you enjoy good drinks, good company, and music that soothes the soul."
2/4/2022,20220204,5,4.13,"One more good review, out of hundreds. There's nothing wrong with this place; the menu is inventive, the staff is friendly, and the location is very comfortable. Never been to Jamaica, so I can't say if their ackee and saltfish is authentic, but I know I liked, it, especially with one of the hot sauces they have available on request. Ditto the fish and chips."
2/5/2022,20220205,3,4.13,It is really just okay. They had a good happy hour a couple years back. Not sure how they are faring since the pandemic.
3/6/2022,20220306,5,4.13,"Awesome place to get brunch. The service was great. I really liked the mimosa selection. The fish and chips, and Belgium waffles were delicious."
3/22/2022,20220322,5,4.13,"This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Central Harlem. I've gone there about 20 times, and each time the food has been really tasty and I've been seated right away. You NEED to make a reservation though, because they fill up fast. But if you make a reservation one day in advance, you'll usually find a table. The brunch menu is GREAT (the Parmesan cheese grits are a personal fav) and the ginger margarita is incredible. Sometimes they have live music (I think Wednesdays?) and I've always enjoyed the artists, and I'm not usually a live music kinda guy."
4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.13,"Great atmosphere, food, and coffee. Consistently delivering quality. A gem in the neighborhood."
4/6/2022,20220406,2,4.13,Not much in drink offerings. Codfish cakes were hard as golf balls. The burger was good. Don't think we will be back.
4/9/2022,20220409,3,4.13,We really wanted to love this place because it's really a nice place inside and the food was pretty good. It's just the service wasn't the best. We didn't have a server and had to keep waving people down to get their attention.
4/12/2022,20220412,5,4.13,I've been to the edge a few times but this is the first time I've been in at least 4 years. I came specifically because it was Harlem restaurant week. So I came through and they had a coconut fish sandwich on the menu and it was absolutely delicious and came with a cocktail or a nonalcoholic beverage. I chose the sorrel and it was divine. A friend got the fish and chips and loved it as well. I always enjoyed the food here. I need to come more often. I'll definitely be back. I like the cozy vibe of the place.
4/12/2022,20220412,4,4.13,Decided to come here for Harlem Restaurant week. Had the fried fish sandwich with the ginger margarita. Both very good. Decided to share the chocolate bread pudding for dessert (ice cream would've put this over the top). Didn't taste like bread pudding but was still enjoyable. Despite this spot being close to home I hadn't been there in years. I don't think I was too keen on the food previously. However I was pleasantly surprised with my meal and would likely get that again. Everyone loved their drinks too. Think I'll have to make my way back one of these days.
4/20/2022,20220420,5,4.13,"This place was phenomenal. As soon as my friend walked it, everyone said hi. The decor and the food was on point. Our server Jasmine was amazing and suggested I get the oxtail and the bread pudding. I was licking my fingers! Definitely check this place out Wednesday night for live music."
5/5/2022,20220505,5,4.13,Best hidden gem around Harlem! The coffee is amazing. Literally grab a cup every morning. Staff is always so polite. And the management/owners are very attentive and clearly are there to provide great service. Food is fantastic and they have daily specials to spice things up every week. Hard five stars. Highly recommend. Dan at the bar makes the most beautiful lattes. Clearly experienced.
5/16/2022,20220516,5,4.13,Honestly... this place lacks nothing in flavor. The drinks were amazing but the food may be what completely won my heart. It was absolutely delicious. I am hooked now. Right on a simple quiet block in Harlem but the flavors scream loud!!! Definitely recommending
5/17/2022,20220517,5,4.14,By far a dope spot to grab brunch and a drink. The staff was amazing was seated in record time. The menu has a Jamaican and English vibe which is different never seen that before but heck I am from Michigan we dont see alot lol. The food was grade A there wasnt anything on the menu I wouldnt eat again.
6/5/2022,20220605,5,4.14,Love love this restaurant! The staff are amazing! They treat you respectfully and equally. The food is AMAZING! Can't recommend more!
6/7/2022,20220607,4,4.14,"The edge is a nice restaurant in Harlem it is hip and cool. The food here is amazing! Jerk chicken wings, chicken and waffles, fish and chips all amazing!! It's also a good place coffee. They can get quite busy on the weekend. The staff is very friendly and nice. I'd definitely would come back to this place in the future."
6/8/2022,20220608,3,4.13,"I live in the neighborhood & have been here maybe 3x. The food & drinks are good, not great & prices are pretty reasonable. My last visit though...I sat in the bar area for brunch & eventhough it was pretty busy the server did a good job. The reason for 3 stars is I guess they were closing (maybe 4pm/5pm) but noone said anything. They just started cleaning, I did get misted by a spray bottle, & next thing I know they were putting chairs up on the bar. I wasn't rushed out but I got the message that my time was up. Finally before I finished my drink I saw a huge COCKROACH scurrying along where they had removed the chairs. That was enough for me. I've never had a bad experience here before but not a great one either."
6/12/2022,20220612,3,4.13,"The Edge is a Caribbean spot that I ended up checking out after work earlier this week. I ended coming here for small bites and drinks. This is a cute corner restaurant that has indoor and outdoor seating. They do offer live entertainment on select nights throughout the week. The atmosphere inside has dark, ambient lighting with portraits depicting different aspects of Caribbean life. There is a bar area and I can tell that this is a great spot to come to for a couple rounds of drinks after work. I ended up dining indoors. I ordered The 580 and the Rum Punch. The Rum Punch was missing some more juice and more body. There really was not much to the drink. The 580 is basically a Rum Punch with sorrel syrup and a splash of champagne. I was super excited to try this drink out, but my expectations were perhaps a bit too high. Just like the rum punch, it was missing the tropical juice flavors that I am accustomed to. Instead, the champagne's fizziness overpowered the drink. The drink has a lot of potential if they can add more tropical juices to their drinks. The codfish fritters were pretty decent. The outer portions were well-fried and there was a good amount of flavor to them. The only thing that held this dish from being great was that it was just a tad salty, but otherwise, it's a great appetizer. The name of the sweet plantains on the menu was a bit misleading. The plantains that were served were still a bit unripe and not sweet. I'm used to having sweet plantains that are ripe and sweet, so again, Iight have had my expectations a bit high. I did look at the plates that were served at the other tables and the food did look pretty good. I will have to give this restaurant another try in the future for either brunch, dinner, or just after-work drinks. The vibes here are definitely great. I think I may just have high expectations for the drinks and appetizers."
