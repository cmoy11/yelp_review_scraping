The staff is friendly and talkative, the atmosphere is welcoming and quiet. The 16 seat dining room ensures you're going to get top notch service. I would post pictures, but you're not allowed to take them!The food is a culinary journey, from the uni puff starter to the ""California scotch egg"", to the absolute best uni dish I've ever eaten, to a fresh and vibrant seafood broth and a perfect piece of french poultry. Russell has outdone himself and I'm glad I took advantage."
8/25/2019,20190825,5,5.0,Chef Russel has created a special place. From the moment you sit down you feel like the entire staff was waiting for your arrival. They are very attentive but not at all smothering. Each course was a delight. From the sourcing to the preparation to the plating. Chef Russel and his staff did an amazing job showcasing the best that California inspired cuisine has to offer. I must say that the fish and chicken dishes were superlative. And the non-alcohol flight was unlike anything we'd had before. You MUST try it. I can totally see him bottling some of those drinks for sale in the future. Make a reservation soon as possible!
9/1/2019,20190901,2,4.0,"The food was okay. I was certainly not blown away. Friendly team, but not on time. For instance, the food would drop before the wine pairing. The $89 wine pairing was not worth it. They don't offer wine bottles or wine by the glass. The main dish was basically a rotisserie chicken salad. The wine pairings didn't really pair well. I'm hoping there will be improvements over time. No food photos to share - phones / cameras not allowed. For the $100 + $89 wine pairing I could go to many fabulous restaurants in NY that would blow you away."
9/1/2019,20190901,5,4.25,Chef Russell Jackson's new culinary adventure in Harlem is not to be missed. 5 courses of beautifully executed food with layer upon layer of flavor. An expert staff to make the experience even better without being stuffy. It's a meal I will remember for a long time and I will go back for more. It is reservation only and well worth it!
9/7/2019,20190907,5,4.4,"Such an incredibly unique and wonderful experience! Loved everything -- the ambiance, being able to see the cooking happen, the service, the music, and most importantly the food(!) and wine pairings. Set in a beautiful room with floor-to-ceiling windows on a corner of Strivers' Row in Harlem, 20 seats in the restaurant surround the kitchen so you can see the dishes being prepared and interact with the staff. Reservations are paid in advance with an optional choice of beverage pairings, which I appreciate as it makes the end of the night so much more pleasant -- no fumbling with credit cards, figuring out the tip, etc. There is a 5-course set menu that is not revealed beforehand aside from a choice of protein-based: seafood and poultry, or non-protein: vegetable-centric and dairy. I really love this as each course is a surprise and an adventure! The dishes are creative and bright with super fresh ingredients, and are inspired by Chef Russell Jackson's California background. The wine pairings were spot-on and enhanced the dishes (there is a non-alcoholic pairing available as well).The service is also unique in that you are served by the people preparing the meal, which makes for a warm, intimate, and personalized experience. The music is perfectly curated by Chef Russell and definitely enhanced the experience -- from the Buzzcocks to Peter Frampton to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and back again.It's also worth noting that this is a technology-free restaurant, so they ask that you not take photos or use you phone. I actually really liked this since it allows you to concentrate and really appreciate the experience. There were so many highlights among the dishes I had, but I'll just say this: I've had Marc Forgione's chicken under a brick. I've had Jonathan Waxman's roasted chicken. But Chef Russell's roasted chicken breast was honestly the juiciest and best chicken dish I've ever had!"
9/22/2019,20190922,3,4.17,"The food doesn't match the hype. Some nice dishes and fresh ingredients, but the overall experience was average. The wine pairing was probably the biggest disappointment. None matched particularly well and small pours of average quality wine. We wanted to like it and the staff were really great but I just can't recommend it"
10/3/2019,20191003,5,4.29,"Fabulous new restaurant with flavorful and inventive cuisine. Great food, low key but attentive staff and lovely chic ambiance makes this a must go food sanctuary. Russell Jackson has a great hit on his hand. Delicious but unpretentious. My favorite place this year."
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.38,"Cozy seating with servers you get to know intimately over the course of the meal. Each course was exciting, interesting, and brought me to a place I never expected. The alcohol pairing with the tasting was amazingly paired and very healthy pours. Can't wait to come back!"
11/7/2019,20191107,5,4.44,"An amazing dining experience on 11/2/2019. Reverence was highly recommended by a colleague and I was very pleased I was able to get a seat during a recent trip to NYC - and the resulting experience! The entire night was exceptionally impressive from the amazing & informed staff, incredible dishes and superb wine pairings. I spent two hours there and absolutely loved the evening. I don't travel to NYC often but I will undoubtedly make Reverence part of my itinerary. Russell Jackson has a hit on his hands -- well done, Chef!"
11/9/2019,20191109,1,4.1,"Really Really Bad experience at this place. Food lacked flavor, but the wait staff was charismatic. I've never been locked in a restaurant in NYC, and they use an electric stove? Very odd . They served dry pieces of rotisserie chicken, and the Chef didn't bother introducing himself while standing 8ft away (we were 1 of 2 patrons in the restaurant). It was so bad it seemed like we were in a Seinfeld episode."
12/6/2019,20191206,5,4.18,"Nothing to compare it to! Total unique Reverence to Food and Dining Experience. There isn't a tasting and pairing that reaches such heights in NYC. The attention to detail to each food preparation is incredible. You will sit there and say ""what did I just taste? I have never had such an explosion of palate. Chef Russell Jackson has achieved a full sensory immersion to the food world. You must go once but you will be back soon to repeat the unexplainable. With Reverence we stand in Gratitude!"
12/17/2019,20191217,1,3.92,"My friend and I came to your restaurant and made the mistake of being two minutes early. We were excited to experience culinary expertise and like any notable restaurant, exceptional service. I'm a native New Yorker and resident of Harlem with a knowledge of our food scene. It was VERY cold outside and we thought maybe you'd let us in a minute early. We thought this might be the case since we pre-payed well above the average cost of restaurants in the neighborhood. Hell, we even had to pre-pay gratuity.We made a mistake by coming early. Because of that mistake the hostess treated us like children and when we asked where we could sit she spoke to us condescendingly, flailing her fingers. We asked because we didn't want to make another mistake by sitting in the wrong place. It was uncomfortable and I'm not sure how you expected for us to stay. This is just part of the bad experience that we had.Is your restaurant so great that your staff could not attempt to treat us with decency? I have no problem with enforcement of your pre-disclosed policies (as unreasonable as they might be). My issue is with the inability to acknowledge those policies while also acknowledging the money that was already paid and the eagerness your clientele might have by showing up early. This recognition doesn't have to come in the form of relenting on your rules but can be shown through a hospitable and welcoming environment. That's what we are used to in this neighborhood.Perhaps the issue here was a clash of entitlement. We felt entitled because of the faith we put in your business and you felt entitled because of your culinary accomplishments. I'm thankful that our night ended with a great meal at a local restaurant. I sincerely wish it was this one."
12/27/2019,20191227,2,3.77,"The reviews by previous diners are right on FOOD WAS GENERALLY TASTELESS IT LACKED. FLAVOR PERIODThe sous chef descriptions and attention was really weak  The wine steward and hostess tried to make up for lack of cadence and just not good foodThey were great The California food idea is good but it doesn't deliver Needs lots of help on TASTE CADENCE. SERVICE. AND WINE LISTTHE CONDITIONS IMPOSED TO. EAT THERE  ARE CUTEDONT ARRIVE EARLYDINT USE ELECTRONICSSIT FOR TWO AND A HALF JOURS AT MY MERCYHowever even if they said in their websiteYou should expect dinner to last around 1 hour 30 mins. If you have any food allergies, please let us know ahead of time and we'll try to accommodate to the best of our ability. If there's something you truly hate and dare tell us, expect that it will be incorporated into an evenings service, we play roughThe first food arrived one hour after we got there and we left two hours and fifteen minutes after .....before desertThe issue the hostess said is that they were understaffed because of the holidaysThe reason is that the sous chef instead of playing and preparing the food that the chef made was singing and chatting away  Result.?.?Most of the food was coldPotato's were undercooked. They served a masa based deep fried thing that was rawRaw masa is not tastyNEED TO CORRESPOND WITH BETTER GOOD FOOD. LESS SHOW AND ACURACYWe caught the sous chef in inaccurate descriptions of what the food was and where it came from The ultimate was when she said  That the dish was inspired by Patricia Quintana  And that the chef  Had cooked with her at her restaurant in New Mexico recentlyPatricia died in 2008 and her restaurant ixote. Was in Mexico City and it closed 12 years ago. Before her death She Insisted that the restaurant was open Still in New MEXICONot coolOverall really disappointingMaybe since they are so religious about their rules and philosophy they should add one moreMinimum satisfaction or your money back"
12/30/2019,20191230,1,3.57,"We want this chef to succeed and the area needs more thriving businesses and vibrant restaurants but... the menu was an absolute train wreck and most of the courses were just bad. One or two good dishes (the trout main was lovely) couldn't make up for some of the heaviest, thickest, most painfully over-flavored courses I've ever had. And there's a lot of arrogance in that kitchen. I'm a serious foodie and amateur chef and was unimpressed by the lecture that came with each dish. Over and over we heard crazy long lists of absurdly esoteric, totally irrelevant ingredients and we were lectured about how each dish was an ode to a California restaurant and/or place. No one cares if a sauce thick as lukewarm ketchup is somehow a tribute to San Diego. I actually got upset when one course turned out to be caviar topped with foie gras (together, really? like pb & j ?) on some kind of chewy toast that had the consistency of plastic. Who are they trying to kid...  If the food were better the $98/pp price tag would have been reasonable. The $89 per person beverage pairing, however, is a joke. Couple pours of decent wine and somehow a can of artisanal beer (this ain't Eleven Madison, buddy...). Corkage fee of $85 bbtl ?!  Bottom line, dinner plus tax and tip (I actually loved prepaying) for two ends up being $475-ish i.e. painful given so many alternatives in NYC.  The good news is this can't last. Chef Russell will either dramatically change the menu, the approach to food and the attitude or he should be gone in 9 months. If he does change - I'm rooting for him - I'll become his biggest fan."
1/19/2020,20200119,4,3.6,"Reverence is more than a nice dinner, it is a unique culinary experience. From the decor, to the engaging staff, it was worth every penny. The ambience is like dining in the kitchen of one of your ritzy and cultured friends that always regales you with stories. The food was delectable. The combination of flavors were spot on. It was also great to see the chef in his element and to listen to him share the origins of the dishes. Each dish is linked to an element of his childhood. While the no technology rule is off-putting at first, it becomes evident why this rule is in place. It allows you to truly savor the food and the company you are with. I recommend you try this experience at least once."
8/19/2020,20200819,5,3.69,"There's only 1 issue with Reverence...It's in NYC and I live in LA.It's one thing to appreciate a restaurant, and a whole different ball game when they are so dialed in, that you have to gift your NYC family with Reverence goodness when a holiday rolls around. That's made particularly easy with their Covid-era Bento Box meals. As soon as they reopen for in-restaurant dining- get there and get there fast. Don't question anything and eat (and drink) everything. You'll thank me later."

7/6/2021,20210706,5,3.83,"Amazing Chef's Table experience. It is expensive, but you are paying for a fantastic meal and an intimate experience with the Chef and staff.Every dish was well thought out and inspirational. The wine pairing was fine, but the non-alcoholic drink pairing was fantastic. I would highly recommend the non-alcoholic pairing.No pictures because it is a ""technology-free"" dining experience, so don't expect to get any good photos for the social media."
9/16/2021,20210916,5,3.89,"Attended a private event here. Staff was amazing. Small bites, Sangria and wine. Can't wait to go back for the real dining experience."
11/11/2021,20211111,5,3.95,"An orgasmic experience...Chef owned and he prepares daily...all this right in front of you. Each multi-course explodes flavor and feels all your senses...close your eyes and be ready to be transported! You become a part of the experience as the staff interacts with you and draws you in for the time of your life. Dedicated to dining not eating!!! Chef Jackson at the top of his game. This guy cares about his food, you, and life itself."
