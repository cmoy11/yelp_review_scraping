The bouquet she put together was absolutely beautiful; my girlfriend loved it, and told me she even got compliments from strangers on the street when she took it home from my place.It's a beautiful, cozy shop, and where I'll be getting flowers from here on out. What a great addition to the neighborhood!"

I have ordered for delivery several times, different budgets, and it is always perfect. The quality, service and attention to detail is top notch. Jenny will always be my go-to flower girl in Brooklyn! Highly recommend."

Like many families the pandemic had kept us apart and we plan to reunite in August. Last week was a tough for us both. I found Field Day Flowers on the internet and the tough cookie bundle feast: dried bouquet, hard to kill cactus and locally baked chocolate chunk cookies. The online order had space for occasion and mood you are going for. Here I put I want my daughter to know she is loved and to stay strong. I added her favorite color is red and favorite flower roses. With this Jenny created the most beautiful bouquet tailored to my request. A hand written card with my message (we love you beyond the moon and back) was added. Jenny helped me by providing a delivery window so I could ensure my daughter would be home. Upon receipt my daughter sent a text sharing her love. It felt like a hug. I thanked Jenny for the joy she brought us. If you have a message, Jenny will say it in flowers for you."

Jenny just always one ups anything else I've gotten elsewhere, and the online ordering process is smooth as gravy, 10/10 would stop searching and just smash the buttons! Price points are phenomenal for this fresh/dried/seasonal flex."

Found Field Trip Flowers on google and took a shot and can say it was a good decision. They provided intimate service by sending a personal note after the order was purchased letting me know when they'd be sending out the flowers along with a follow up email with a photo of the flowers confirming the drop off. The flowers were so pretty and my friend said they smelled SO good! :) xo"

But after doing a little Instagram research to get a sense of their aesthetic decided that I'd take a chance on Fieldtrip, and it paid off! My friend got a lovely dried flower bouquet delivered to her job in the Bronx on her birthday. And I got to support a local business here in BK! Jenny and team were quick to answer my questions and super-friendly throughout the process. Note: In the past I've had a hard time getting Brooklyn-based businesses to deliver to the Bronx (I completely understand, it is FAR). So was pleasantly surprised that for an additional fee, Fieldtrip was able to make the Bronx delivery happen."
