4/26/2022,5 star rating,"I never leave reviews and this is probably my first one. This place was great. Stopped in for something new only to find out they have been there for 8 years or so. Me, My boyfriend and his dad had brunch and it was excellent! Our waitress was sweet and attentive. The Chef, Donna, makes the best biscuits and the frittatas were amazing as well!  Would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a solid breakfast/ brunch. We will definitely be back to try their other menus!"
5/28/2022,5 star rating,"This place is a block from our apartments and one of those ""we should stop in one day"" type places. It was my birthday weekend and we decided to finally stop in for brunch. Everything was perfect. I got the shrimp and grits and my partner got the pancakes. The shrimp and grits were a huge plate with sausage, biscuit and eggs. The pancakes came with eggs and turkey bacon and we each had tea and a juice. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. The pancakes especially were amazing so fluffy and light but tasty. I dont usually like pancakes but will prob order them next time, a few bites of my partners was not enough. The staff was very friendly without being in your face and the orange juice was fresh and delicious. All in all we both wanted to take our moms here the next time they come by, high praise indeed. :) we will def be back"
12/25/2021,1 star rating,"It kills me to give this spot a beyond low rating because I really wanted to love it but OMG, stay away until they get it together. I first walked in and there were zero customers which I thought would be cause for either a great service experience or just an overall poor experience, and it was the latter for me. The 'cook' was chilling at one of the tables until our order was taken by the hostess. She was very sweet but was beyond unorganized when other customers began to come in. The cook obviously didn't want to be there since it was Christmas Eve but hey, you chose to be employed, so do your job with a smile. I even overheard him complaining when other customers came in. I ordered the fish and grits, French toast and shrimp and grits. The fish was flavorless and soggy, the shrimp were undercooked and the French toast was hard as rocks. I have no problem with paying for what my food is worth but I feel like the food is extremely overpriced to be this crappy. Maybe if the 'cook' had a better attitude, my food would've tasted halfway decent. I use the word cook in quotations because he looked like some random man who threw on an apron and expected to deliver but failed. Please don't waste your money coming to this establishment."
6/20/2021,5 star rating,"Iight so boom. I was looking for a real homely restaurant to celebrate Fathers Day. My father and my grandmothers like authentic, homemade cooking. Nothing overly processed, just some good ol cooking from a chef in the back that you know you can trust. And let me tell you something, Home Sweet Harlem is just that.I had a reservation for a party of 5, which accommodated myself, my mother, father and two grandmothers (80 and 88 years old). Upon arrival a staff member asked if outdoor seating would be okay for us as it was currently all they had available. I normally don't mind outdoor seating especially when the weather was as beautiful as it was. But my grandmothers prefer A/C and comfortable indoor seating. However, as all the tables were full we would've had to wait 30-40 minutes for an indoor table to be full. Well guess what, not no more! As soon as I expressed my grandmothers wishes they quickly worked together to arrange for seating inside the restaurant. A restaurant and staff members that truly care about the comfort and safety of their patrons is an establishment I can respect.Now onto the food. When I tell you this food is made FRESH. Like, when we sat down our server Jen asked for patience as they just made a fresh batch of pancake mix and biscuit dough. Like hello?!! FRESH PEOPLE! The sangria? Made freshhhhh! The Bellini...FRESH PEACH PURÉE! Honestly it's so scarce to find restaurants in the city with good old southern, authentic, comfort food. Man oh man. We ordered some biscuits for the table and they were flaky, buttery, cheddary, and just delicious. We opted for the full brunch which is $24 per person and includes your entree (which is already stacked) and your selection of: Turkey Bacon, Turkey Sausage, or fresh Salmon Cake AND choose a Mimosa, Bellini, Michelada or Fresh Squeezed Orange or Mango Juice, too!! Like my goodness! The menu is everything you can imagine. Shrimp or fish and grits, pancakes, challah French toast, eggs, potatoes liiiikkkeee. Again. Fresh.And let me tell you about the fresh. Not only is it made to order but it is SEASONED!!! FLAVOR!!! Hot and ready and just my goodness. Let me tell you something. I recommend this place 10/10. Family oriented, girls meet up, date day. The vibes are here, the music is classic and the staff is lovely."
3/18/2022,4 star rating,I've been meaning to go to Home Sweet Harlem for a while now and it did not disappoint. It's very spacious & comfortable.  The service was great and the chef was super sweet.  I felt like I was eating at my aunty's.  I'll be back.
4/24/2022,5 star rating,The decor inside gave a true New York feeling! The food was amazinggggggg!!! I had the fish and grits and the texture of the fish was cooked perfectly ! The grits were not lumpy and the eggs were amazing!!! The chef was a joy and very delightful to interact with! The staff are so friendly and attentive I couldn't help but fall in love !!! I will definitely be back to this restaurant when I visit Harlem again and if I do say so myself those who are in Harlem visiting or even a resident should definitely try this place!!!!!!
5/7/2022,5 star rating,I went here with my three teenage kids and we have a great meal and great service. The menu for brunch was very tasty. And the coffee was incredible. I will definitely come back.
1/30/2021,3 star rating,"Gotta say I was expecting better from here based on reviews! Used to live near here in Harlem and thought it was very convenient so had to check it out!Had high hopes but this place is a bit pricey, service is really slow(but nice staff), and the food isn't much to rave about. I think I'd feel differently if the food was WOW but it wasn't one of those worth the wait spots. Really wanted to like this place but don't know if I really would recommend it to others and may stick to other spots in central harlem instead."
5/20/2022,1 star rating,I would advise to stay away from this place at all costs until they get it together unless you want to waste an hour of your morning. We sat for 40 minutes after waiting 15 minutes for water. There were three servers and about 5 tables sat. To me that math says that staff either doesn't know or doesn't care. I also walked up and politely asked to order about a half hour in and they assured me someone was coming over. Another 15 minutes later of being ignored we walked to dear mama manhattanville. Save yourself some time and start there instead.
2/24/2022,3 star rating,"We went for brunch.The menu was not up to date... it didn't have chicken and waffles on there but according to the server, they offered it. Also the menu had mimosaa and bellinis and sangrias as options but according to the server they didn't have their liquor license so no alcohol was allowed. So confusing. Overall, The server was friendly and jovial but he messed up our order a few times. Also it took over an hour for our food to come out and the appetizers didnt even come out before the main food.... Everything came out all at once. The food was good Though. The chicken was well seasoned and the French toast was decent. The fresh squeezed orange juice was good though could have been colder. The cook did come out from the back to apologize to us for the delay and for the waiter getting the orders wrong. That was a nice gesture."
4/14/2021,2 star rating,"I had the Fish and Grits Lunch and it was substandard! The service was nice but very, very slow. My fish is dry and over cooked, my eggs are burnt and the grits are lumpy as hell.I'm not sure why this place has so many stars,"
11/7/2021,5 star rating,"Spotted restaurant while driving by. Pulled car over to check Yelp reviews and felt compelled to check out the grits. I'm not accustomed to the availability of grits in a restaurant outside of the South (U.S.). For starters, the young man at the front counter/bar was welcoming, friendly, helpful & attentive. The culinarilly gifted lady from behind the scenes showed similar attributes as I got situated in the restaurant."
1/25/2022,3 star rating,This place doesn't seem to be what it used to be but perhaps the pandemic changed it. The waitstaff were nice and all but I still don't understand why took so long to place our order when there were just 3 of us in the place. I was a bit disappointed in my own meal  but at 10 dollars I couldn't be that mad. The salmon croquettes were delicious.
6/23/2021,5 star rating,Love this place!! Got the shrimp and grits which were delicious. The biscuit is one of the best I've had! Thanks to our amazing server K for your excellent service!
3/8/2020,2 star rating,"Went for brunch when playing soccer nearby.Honestly can't understand why this place has 4 stars overall.Pros - it's light and airy when you walk in, and the server was nice and friendly.The food was really pretty average. All brunch items were $16,  and we tried 4 different things.I had pancakes and was expecting an impressive plate- I was very underwhelmed for the price.The other dishes came with turkey sausage / eggs etc but the sides all appeared to have been made a day or 2 earlier and partially reheated.2 dishes had a few bits of side salad which also seemed to have been prepped the day before and refrigerated by the look of them.Overall I guess if you are in the area it's nicer than many other spots. But don't go out of your way..."
6/3/2021,5 star rating,"I had a great time! The food was flavorful, healthy, it was hot and fresh. The chef suggested the blackened fish, roasted potatoes, and sautéed greens medley. The perfect choice. I will visit again! owner and stuffs were the most hospitable, and I really appreciate their service!"
6/3/2021,5 star rating,"We had shrimp and grits, delicious. Sweet potatoes were naturally caramelized without added sugar. Coffee was nice and strong too. The owner took time to check in with us several times and staff was friendly and attentive as well. If you find yourself in Harlem, don't miss this place!"
4/18/2021,5 star rating,"Today my husband, and our three children had brunch at HOME SWEET HARLEM. I felt so welcomed. My seven year old daughter asked if we could come back EVERY SUNDAY.  Ms. Donna was so friendly. The staff was very attentive and the food was delicious. Delicious. I had pancakes with salmon cakes and eggs. My husband had French toast with salmon cakes and eggs. My children had cheese grits. I also had a side of sautéed shrimp with a biscuit.  I am hoping we can go EVERY SUNDAY."
10/26/2019,4 star rating,3.5 starsFood: The food is pretty average to me. It is good but not out of this world.Drink: unlimited mimosa/bellini option available. Pretty average as well.Service: the service was pretty slow but we LOVED our waiter. He had the best personality and made our brunch a lot of fun. We weren't in a rush so the fact that the service was a bit slow didn't phase us.Atmosphere: very comfy. It wasn't too crowded when we went. Don't expect luxury but you can count on comfort.

6/20/2021,1 star rating,"Came for breakfast, got stuck with bad service and mediocre food. Hostess was very passive aggressive. Server came two times, once to take order, once to deliver. No water refills. They were out of so many things that the alternative they offered was the only option you were forced to choose. Would never come here again, and to be honest, would be surprised if this place survived the post pandemic opening. Would not recommend to anyone else."
6/10/2021,5 star rating,"Workers are lovely. Food is banging. This was my first time here and everything was great. They didn't need to plaster on a fake front of being overly ""customer service forward"" to the point of no longer feeling like Nyc. I hate it when people aren't just them. Love it here and would totally be back. New York vibes are chill and I love that this place matches that. Keep up being amazing, even during a pandemic."

5/31/2021,5 star rating,"We love Home Sweet Harlem! The food is exceptional, (you could really taste the quality behind the ingredients), and the service is great. We were particularly impressed with the values of the place. We were so satisfied with our experience, we hope to be back soon and bring our family members to come and try the very delightful and pleasant Home Sweet Harlem."
5/30/2021,1 star rating,Do not order delivery from here! They use ghost kitchens and end up hours behind with too many orders. It's not worth the stress.
5/27/2021,5 star rating,"I was in the neighborhood, so stopped by to test Home Sweet Harlem out. The vibe is great. After going through the reviews I got Sweet Potato Pie, and it was so great, it is now my favorite dish. The employees here are helpful, too. My family will certainly become the regular customers at Home Sweet Harlem."
2/23/2019,5 star rating,"When I walked in it smelled like my grandmothers kitchen. And the chef came out and greeted me with a smile and a shimmy. She had on that grandma auntie head wrap too... I ain't even try the food yet but by the looks of that head wrap, it's gon be FIRE! The bartender was joyful and welcoming. The sangria HAS BLUEBERRIES IN IT !!! Praise him... sorry caught the Holy Ghost real quick. Can't wait to eat ya'll!--------So boom: I had the fish and grits with a salmon cake. Mad delicious, but def not my grandmothers grits. They were good tho. The fish was perfect. But that salmon cake.... praise the lordt. Amazing. The biscuit was terrible. It was cold and did not taste good at all. Service was great. Bae had an omelette with spinach and cheese, he really enjoyed it. He loved the coffee! He also hated his biscuit though. He loved his potatoes too. Overall: I still give it 5 stars- it was clean, smelled great, the music was amazing cuz I'm a 50 year old living in a 26 year old body ... I will be back!"
12/20/2021,5 star rating,"Absolutely fantastic- great service, so friendly, top notch food. I had the challah French toast, which was perfection, with fresh whipped cream, that I could tell was made from scratch, and they steamed the milk for my coffee. Also had eggs and turkey sausage with it, which sometimes can be a weird flavor, but here it was great, couldn't tell it was turkey sausage. It's a little pricey but completely worth it in my opinion. Also, lovely atmosphere, very cozy, cool artwork on the walls. I'll definitely be back for sure!"

9/8/2020,1 star rating,I hate leaving a review like this. But I usually love this place. The owner was very sweet in person. The food was spot-on in person. But this weekend I ordered delivery of shrimp and grits. It was more like shrimp and tomato watery soup with sage. I had to throw it out. It was not appetizing at all.
9/13/2019,2 star rating,"There is no way that anyone who ate here is giving this place 4 stars. The food is basic and the overall restaurant operation is on the struggle bus.For example, at brunch, my table ordered ice tea. We're drinking the ice tea and it tastes weird. I turn to my cousin ""Does this ice tea taste like garlic?"" Ladies and gentlemen, they were storing garlic in the ice tea machine and it tastes awful. We had to wait for 20 minutes for new ice tea. The breakfast burrito was all brown and looked weird. We had to remind the wait staff at least 15 times to bring condiments to our table. The food took forever to come out. I wanted to support a local place but this is not it."
11/15/2021,5 star rating,"My favorite brunch spot of all time, have been going here for yearssss. Haven't been in over a year due to Covid and moving but will definitely be returning this week and I cannot wait!! Shrimp and grits are the best I ever had. Biscuits are to die for and the salmon cakes? Mouth watering goodness!!!!!"
12/15/2018,2 star rating,"Pretty disappointed in this place. Came here for some brunch, the reviews looked amazing! Ended up let down. First off, the service. There was only two other people sitting in the restaurant. For a restaurant that adds automatic service charge, we expected more service wise. Things that were good: fresh squeeze OJ was amazing, love that they had that on the menu. Sweet potato homfries/yams were delicious and cooked perfectly. Things that were not so good: service, shrimp and grits were ATROCIOUS. Please do not order them especially if you're on from the south. I really should have sent them back but the food takes so long here when it's was very slow... I can't imagine how it is when the restaurant is busy. But yes shrimp and grits had no flavor at all. The grits were very watery and chunky not creamy and buttery like they should be. Turkey bacon.. well it was turkey bacon how goo could that be  lastly... the biscuit was so damn small I was offended. The restaurant vibe is really cute it just needs lots of work service/food wise."
7/12/2020,1 star rating,"If I could give zero stars, I would. I try to support black businesses. I really do. But it's people like this that give black businesses an unfair reputation of being unprofessional. I even gave them two chances in hopes that the first time was just a fluke. In my first order, I ordered the ""Home skillet"" that is supposed to be shrimp and grits. Well, they didn't include the grits in the bag. ???? How does that even work leaving out the grits in shrimp and grits? When I called them to complain, I spoke with someone named ""Donna,"" who sounded like she didn't even know where she was or what year it is. I asked her if she was okay, because she sounded like someone stole her brain cells. Grubhub was kind enough to refund this order. Then I ordered a second time. This time, I ordered griddle cakes that are supposed to come with syrup (obviously) and cream. The griddle cakes arrive without syrup and cream. When I called them to ask what happened, I get ""Donna"" again, who sounds as spaced out as she did the first time. So, I asked to speak to the owner or manager. The owner gets on the phone after Donna just put the phone down without even telling me she was getting the owner. The owner then proceeds to tell me that I was a liar and that there is no way she can tell if I didn't get the syrup. Really? I have spent numerous hundreds of dollars on take out since the pandemic started in NYC, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had missing items from my orders and was issued a refund - and I wouldn't use all of my fingers on that one hand either! There is no reason for me to lie. I have the money to spend on take out. And I see it as a way to help the restaurants and small businesses in the area who have suffered as a result of the pandemic. But noooooooo, these unprofessional idiots proceed to act ignorant and call me a liar. They need customer service 101 ASAP. Sadly, people who conduct business this way will be the first ones to say people don't support black businesses. NO ONE should be supported who behave like this toward their customers. So deuces, Sweet Home Harlem. You will never get another dime of my money. I tried to support you, and you failed MISERABLY."
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"Located right by CUNY and the 135 subway stop we were thrilled to discover this little oasis in the neighborhood. So charming, airy and friendly. The brunch was well priced and my french toast with fresh berries was one of the best I've ever had. The owner even swung by the table (she's obviously hard at work in the kitchen as well) to say hi and seemed genuinely happy how much we enjoyed our meal. I'll definitely be back."
7/5/2020,1 star rating,This place is disgusting unclean and dishonest!!! I ordered from Grubhub and they are illegally using a different name of ThickChick which I will be filing a complaint about. However I placed an order for chicken sandwiches which were absolutely disgustingly dry burned and tasteless. I asked for all of of my sandwich dressings to be put on the side and it arrived with a whole bunch of ingredients I did not ask for!Stay away from this place the food is nasty inedible!They are using a different name on Grubhub!Location is filthy! Yes 1528 Amsterdam Ave!If I had know the place was actually Home Sweet Harlem I would have never ordered!

8/6/2019,5 star rating,"This place is so wonderfully underrated! I 100% recommend swinging by this place for brunch if you're in the Harlem area. It's family owned from what I can tell and the servers and managers are so sweet. They were also open on 4th of July which I appreciated since my friends and I were hungry and lurking. I will say, I was a little shocked at how pricey this place was. Everything on the menu had a range of $15-20, which isn't crazy for New York, but the bottomless mimosas were $24 which was a little steep. I ordered the breakfast burrito and I'm not exaggerating when I say I think it was the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life. I'm not completely positive on what exactly was in it, and which ingredient gave me this ethereal experience, but if you come here you have to order it. The burrito was also the perfect size and the home fries were delicious."
6/2/2018,4 star rating,"Right between my daughter's two graduations and a 2 hour gap... we were just downright hungry. She suggested coming here for a bite to eat since it's right across from City College.We didn't make reservations as we were caught in the middle of excitement, but once in, the Manager? Owner? told us right from the get-go, that we needed to wait a bit and clear a table for us. Excellent. Home Sweet drips with down home food with a little flair. Fast and pleasant service, an interesting Southern but eclectic Menu and a really nice looking design- all made the afternoon stand out. Large wooden counter with chairs and a couple of café tables to your right. Exposed brick wall and lots more seating- on the left with this round, fabric covered seating sofa booth in the back. Brunch Menu was substantial with a good price. My Mom and my husband enjoyed their Croissant Sandwiches with turkey sausages, my daughter managed with a side of Roasted Potatoes as her only vegan option. And my Feta & Spinach Frittata, was very good with a side of Roasted Yams. Before I forget- love how Home Sweet uses fresh Yams and not canned! Our server really kept us in the loop and mentioned- that because there was a larger party before us, Home Sweet needed to service them first. Excellent. I rather hear that- than nothing at all! This is another return for me......if I'm in the area. Lots of pluses here and also liked how Home Sweet explicitly details on their menu and receipt- there's no tipping but a service charge is added! Excellent again. Oh and by the way- Home Sweet doesn't serve Beef or Pork. And just for that and so many other reasons...this place is Rocking!"
5/24/2018,4 star rating,"Solid four stars! This place is a haven for home cooked meals that warm your heart.  The dishes are served very much like the portions your favorite grandma/auntie would give you. Large, piping hot dishes of love that you really shouldn't finish but you do because you don't want to disappoint (millions of gluttons were born this way). The owner can often be found cooking in the back. A warm slice of sweet potato pie is almost always offered as dessert because it's house made and a true delight. If you've lived in Harlem long enough you'd remember that there was an incarnation of this resto on 135th between 7th & 8th Avenues. This pie and this owner cling to ones memory like the food will cling to your heart, in a good way of course.By the way, this is a non-tipping establishment. This didn't stop me from leaving a tip because the hospitality is like nowhere else. Be warned, this is not a place to hop in and out of for a quick meal. If you come here, you're welcome to linger and get comfortable whether at a booth or at the counter. There is a sign that will subtly let you know that fresh pressed/squeezed juice is also made here. Oh the juiciest of oranges and strawberries and sweet bananas and crisp-green kale (!!) can be assuredly found here. Settle in and feed your body. You will surely enjoy all that is to be found here. The decor is rustic, homey and somewhat kitsch-y, but it works.Don't be fooled by the humble, simple decor and feel at home in Home Sweet Harlem."

We ordered the full brunch meal and omg, it was DELICIOUS !!!The French toast was to die for !!!!I got it with all the works; fresh fruit, Nutella, scrambled eggs with cheese, Turkey bacon, and a side of grits.Our drinks were just as refreshing as the food was tasty !! You could tell every thing was made with love and I can't wait to come back !!!!Thank you all for a wonderful birthday dinner"

11/19/2020,1 star rating,"I would love to give a review on the food but unfortunately this place cannot seem to open on time. Not once but twice!! I made a reservation for 9am so I can have breakfast after a long 12 hour night shift and was told they were ""opening"". When I asked what time that was they said about another hour but wasn't certain. This same exact thing happened in the summer and I was given a similar excuse. Sad to say this will be my last attempt at this place. Like the saying says - fool me twice shame on me."
12/6/2020,1 star rating,"I was excited to eat here until we walked in. Really sad service. The hostess acted as if she didn't want us to enter or sit down, the waitress attitude was nasty, they served us drinks that were dirty (as in there were food remanentes alllll on the glass) the table wasn't clean. Couldn't even stay. We paid for the beverages we didn't drink and quickly left without even eating. Shouldn't have even paid for that. Don't even bother coming to this establishment. Such an embarrassment to Harlem."
12/9/2019,1 star rating,"My cousins and I stumbled upon this place via Yelp for a cute brunch while they were in town for the holidays (Thanksgiving weekend). All the other places were booked up for that Saturday so we decided to come here. -We arrive and the place is empty. Like EMPTY empty. No other customers. So as a person who has worked in several cafés and restaurants, your brunch place shouldn't be empty on a Saturday. (Red flag #1). -It smelled like fresh paint. (Red flag #2)-The coffee was lukewarm and the sugar was hard. As a former barista, I know that only stale sugar is hard. (Red flag #3)The menu is sort of lack luster. We did not stay long enough to order food. My cousins ordered sangria and got one refill each. We found a better place to eat. And asked for the check. The initial check came out to $25. While gathering the money and using the bathroom before we headed out, a different employee came and dropped off ""the correct check""- $55?!! (She then crumpled up the $25 receipt and proceeded to walk away)We asked where this extra $30 charge came from and she replied ""I don't know- thats what it is?""EXCUSE ME!?We asked to speak to the manager, who came and clarified everything. Somehow the total was $45 for 2 coffees and 3 sangrias. Which is still too damn high. But whatever. ALSO- this place is CASH ONLY. It was not indicated on Yelp nor Google. In conclusion, we won't ever dine here again..."
10/13/2020,1 star rating,"The food is not what you expect it to be, the worst. I had a table of 5. No one never came to seat us, wasn't waited until 30-45 minutes after sitting there. Now back to the food, only 1 dish was made completely fine, sad right? There were two orders of Callah French Toast, bread was hard like a rock, bacon was not turkey bacon (i eat turkey bacon all the time at home i know the difference) . There was bees all over the table my guests and I were sitting. Won't see my guests and I again."
9/3/2017,5 star rating,"I can't believe we ignored this Harlem gem for a couple of years now. This will  be our new brunch place to go to! The home frittata was delicious 10/10 and the challah french toast = legit 100%!I would give this business 10 stars if I can! If you are reading this, you just need to go and try the greatness! Remember cash only policy, support your local businesses!"
1/19/2019,5 star rating,From the moment we walked into the door until we left we felt at home. Great food. Loved loved that the owner/chef personally came out and welcomed this Texas native. We will be back. I had the shrimps and grits with unlimited mimosas.

6/2/2021,5 star rating,What a great restaurant with down home food! Brunch was delightful!! Excellent service coupled with supreme recipes and exceptional presentation.
5/30/2021,1 star rating,Do not order delivery from here! They use ghost kitchens and end up hours behind with too many orders. It's not worth the stress.
8/28/2018,1 star rating,"18% Service charge is INCLUDED for every table no matter the number of people that are seated! You are not verbally informed that there's a service charge. There was no service !I should have left when I saw another table leaving without ordering. Service - I was unsure if I was at a school ground for friends to congregate or a place of business. They all seemed to go outside chatting it up and forgetting to place your order or even inform their own waitress that she/he has a table. There's lemonade on the written menu - but no lemonade. We only had 3 orders in total and still I got potatoes instead of grits. There was no spring water.... I can go on!Food & Drinks - Health hazard - the cup with the coffee was chipped. You could use the biscuit as a weapon it was so hard. The salmon cakes were burnt and they offered KETCHUP of all things with the salmon cakes. Needless to say I had to eat it dry. The portions are small. Two dime size biscuits and the salmon cakes are okay in size. The farmer omelette was just ok. Facilities - so I'm not sure what men go to the bathroom for, but for females it primarily to check their make up or to do a quick selfie. Forget that the bathroom ain't clean, the bathroom is dark. The star was only for accommodating moving tables, twice."

8/24/2019,1 star rating,"Haven't had such awful service for a while.Went on a Saturday morning for brunch. The food was decent, $15 for a brunch entry. Service was extremely slow, only one waiter running around. Food finally arrived, waiter forgot to bring cream to my coffee. Asked for a coffee refill, waiter took my coffee cup and never returned. Check arrived with 18% service charge added. I wonder if they have a clue how unsatisfied customers are.Also, there are two bathrooms on premise, however the lady in the kitchen poured waste water in one bathroom sink. How gross.Will not return."
3/7/2020,1 star rating,Wow I feel very violated. I ordered a Cob salad and my chicken was raw. All of it. There was no cheese. NO CHEESE. The bacon was scarce. No  dressing not even some oil. No utensils. No straw for my ice coffee. The potatoes were fine. They charged $32 for all this. I'm appalled
10/23/2019,4 star rating,"The food was great! I loved the fish and grits. I was hoping for slightly more creamy grits, but what came out was great. The fish was lightly breaded and crispy and the turkey bacon was just right as well. Didn't care for the biscuit. It was super hard and dry. Also, a chef made it a point that we could order sangria when we first walked in, which was nice. It was delicious! Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
12/6/2020,4 star rating,"There was a pretty extensive Thanksgiving dinner special here and, being socially distanced for this holiday, I opted in. I reserved my food and got turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing with a choice of appetizer, sides and dessert. There side portions were great and the turkey was moist. My immediate favorites were the beans and stuffing (neither of which made it to leftover status). The stuffing was made with cornbread and veggies which is a treat for me as I don't have this often. I opted for the lightly candied yams (I appreciated that they weren't drowned in syrup but still had a good crust). I also thoroughly enjoyed my appetizer of corn pudding. The sweet potato pie was just ok and greens were alright, I added a bit of apple cider vinegar to dress them up. I wasn't crazy about the mac but I understand that tends to be preferential. All in all, I loved being able to have a slice of the holiday all in one packaged meal. I even went back the next day for an extra side of stuffing, which they happily provided. Fingers crossed this is available around Christmas as well!!"

7/22/2018,1 star rating,"Awww... its hurts to write this cause I wanted this place to be good. Maybe it was just my experience or the menu item, or bad timing but I'm kinda one and done, in & out with this place. My friend and I ordered the Chicken & Waffles along with unlimited mimosas/bellinis after an enthusiastic suggestion was made by a manager only to be super disappointed by the outcome. The crazy thing is I had no intentions of getting Chicken & Waffles cause the menu along with other people's food looked pretty descent ... So this place must take the concept of Chicken & Waffles literally cuz I was in fact served only One Piece of Chicken with my waffle... (YES only 1 piece!!) I ain't never been to a spot where I've only gotten ONE Piece of Chicken wit my waffle!?! ... insult to injury, it was some indecipherable part of the chicken; the back maybe? ... and it wasn't even good or flavorful... super greasy and all crisp... Super Super disappointing to say the least. I asked the waiter bout the one piece of chicken after being served, he told me it would be $4 for an extra piece! I'll pass. The waffle? Blah at best. The mimosas & bellinis? Descent at best. The Check? Ridiculous. Not enough heart to give Home Sweet Harlem a second chance...  And ain't it might not be such a bad idea if nevaaaa, never went home again (Gil Scott-Heron voice)"
7/8/2016,3 star rating,"Had a decent brunch here, though our waitress was terrible. I had a frittata (forget the exact name) with grits, and my friend had the Farmer's Skillet with potatoes and an orange juice. I liked hers a little better - the eggs had a better flavor and the potatoes trumped the grits. Overall, the food was tasty and filling. My favorite part was the biscuit!It's too bad about our waiter, who was super inattentive though it wasn't busy. She also didn't tell us it was cash only (that day) until it was time to pay. Ouch."
9/1/2014,4 star rating,"Great egg and cheese on croissant! The place is classy but comfortable. I would love to hang out here for a couple hours with a good book. They've got a full brunch menu plus juices and some alcohol. The owner is very nice, too."
6/10/2018,5 star rating,"I've had shrimp and grits all over the south. It's a rather wonderful mix of creamy, briny, and succulent. Some places over do it with one part or another. It's a difficult balance to maintain. But not Home Sweet Harlem. It's the perfect plate of shrimp and grits. The balance is only second to that of the most highly trained ninjas. You'd be better off punching your self in the junk than pass up this, of what really can only be described as, sex on a plate."
5/5/2019,1 star rating,"On Saturday I was a part of a group of mentors that brought about 16 middle-schoolers down to the city from Syracuse to teach them about the Harlem Renaissance. So, it seemed only fair that we'd catch brunch in the area. Based on majority of the reviews, we chose this place. Short version: Many of the menu items were missing. ""Fresh-squeezed"" orange juice is Tropicana which they make no effort to hide. Syrup is like water. Pancakes have no flavor. French toast is lackluster. Somehow on their planet, a bowl of oatmeal is the same $15 price as a Home Skillet meal. Service is terrible. Tables are rickety and the music is barely audible. Long version: I know that servers typically abhor large parties but the service here was next-level rude. After being told that it was cash only, one of the mentors went to the atm next door to get cash while everyone else got seated. We were given one pitcher of water to serve over 20 people. I already peeped how this was going to go. We then waited for about 20 minutes before our waiter came. He started off by telling us that we're a big crowd so we needed to give him a break. He took our orders in a clockwise fashion. Halfway through the orders, another waiter offered to take the first sheet of orders so the cook could begin and but he refused. Among the options we were told they didn't have: $15 oatmeal, Ginger Mint water and though the menu advertised waffles, they didn't have a waffle maker so any orders for waffles were turned into bland, burnt-edge pancakes. While we waited for our food for about half an hour, our waiter never came over to the table. We had to flag him down multiple times to request some more water and he behaved like he was doing us some kind of favor and told us we had to wait because he was doing something as he went back over to the bar to talk with a coworker. When our food finally came, our waiter slammed down two pitchers of water on the table. One pitcher had what looked like carrot shavings in it. He came back and gave us one cup of whipped cream and a vessel of syrup and told us we had to share, though most people had either French toast or pancakes. Looking at it, we knew that it wasn't enough to serve everyone and right away asked for more. He just laughed and walked away. One of my children's orders was never placed by the waiter and there was no apology. We were simply told that the chef would start cooking it now. Her French toast took about another 15 minutes. The waiter himself never came to assist with distributing food so whoever was in the kitchen coming out had no idea who ordered what. I eventually saw him leaving the restaurant. I guess his shift was over and he couldn't be bothered to let us know. Thankfully, we had already requested the bill. For those who had the Home Skillet, grits and potatoes, they were pretty alright. Everything else was bland or cold. One mentor didn't eat any of the shrimp that came with his meal. There was only one other waitress who came to check on us during our meal and brought me some hot sauce to put with my eggs. This single star is for her. The only thing my mentors seemed to like were the mimosas because either the restaurant running out of Tropicana or the goal was to get people tipsy, but it was basically cheap champagne with about a tablespoon of OJ for color. Throughout our time there, about three other groups of people came to eat and left without placing their meals. I envied them. I will never again visit this restaurant and if you're reading this, save yourself the trouble."
8/25/2019,5 star rating,My friends and I were looking for a vegetarian/vegan friendly restaurant in HarlemFor brunch. We took a chance on Home Sweet Harlem. As soon as we walked in the staff were friendly and accommodating. They answered all of our many questions and the chef and owner was happy to accommodate one of party's dietary needs. The food itself was delicious! It was perfectly seasoned and visually appealing. The cocktails were also perfect. The owner even chatted with us for awhile on our way out. I highly recommend this place and we'll definitely be back!

5/27/2019,3 star rating,"A cozy atmosphere ideal for small groups or dates looking to do an early brunch. But, considering the prices, a little on the underwhelming side.  I ordered the French toast with a side of turkey sausage and 2 fried eggs. The French toast was definitely fluffy as advertised, and quite hearty, but the lack of sweet flavor begged to be accompanied by syrup as it was still on the ""plain"" side. Sausages were hot and juicy, although they only gave 2 small links. The eggs however were served to me dry and cold. Mind you, these sides were a $10 addition from just getting the French toast by itself.  Can't complain about the drinks though. Highly recommend the sangria especially. The service was good and our waiter kept everything going nicely with a friendly attitude. However, they say they already charge a service charge as stated on the menu that's supposed to cover the tip. Once we got our checks, we had to inquire on whether or not tips were included due to how they wrote our bills. Everything was decent but just seemed a little too unorganized and lackluster for what they expect you to pay."
8/5/2018,3 star rating,"On my second day in NY, I stopped here because it had some good reviews and it seemed like a cool place! Hahaha I've never been to Harlem before so I wanted to try something here.Right away from entering, I got this hip, 20-something crowd vibe, so this is probably a popular spot for them. The server sat us down but she had to clean the table because it was dirty... she did a few huge swipes with this wet towel and then it dried up. I kind of.... didn't want to see that. I have them the better judgment that someone just left and they didn't have time to clean it up- not a big deal to me!I ordered the home skillet with a salmon cake and a side of sweet potatoes. The food look 40 minutes to get to our table, probably a little longer ban that! Server told us that she never put the order in with the cook so she just ended up taking our orders again. Super unprofessional, I was so disappointed. She brought us out biscuits while we waited again and one of them HAD A HAIR baked into it... I should have just walked out at that point but I was hungry! Food was delicious though, was very hot and tasty. Probably the only reason why I gave them 3 stars and not one.Server insisted she would discount order and only took 2 dollars off. I was fed up, I definitely won't be back."
3/24/2019,5 star rating,"I'm from Jersey and I found this place on Yelp and Google. So, I decided to take the trip out to Harlem. We came here for Sunday brunch on a beautiful Sunday. William was our server and superceded out expectations with his customer service. He made sure that our mimosas were never empty. I ordered the griddle cakes, eggs, salmon cake and roasted potatoes and definitely need a nap now. My friends ordered the fish & grits and the home skillet with shrimps. The other two looked too good, but we started eating b4 we took the picture. The food (very seasoned) and the drinks were good. I'd definitely come back and recommend!"

Waitress and host were super attentive from the start. Then things started getting a little rough. We ordered food took 45 minutes to come then their POS went down, so only cash...luckily I had cash on me and this didn't effect me--but dang that table of 10 across from us. Food was pretty good, salmon croquettes came cold."

I was so pleased when I ordered the home skillet, because it was filling & super delicious. My sister in a law kept saying ""who's mom is cooking in the back?"". The food is homemade everything down to the pancakes. When I tell you, the biscuits are amazing, I mean amazing. My only critic if I had to give one is I wished my biscuit was a little bigger. Overall definitely a place I would take my family again too! Even down to my little niece (7 yrs old) enjoyed her food experience. Good job Harlem!!!!!  Happy Sunday!"

The chef was very nice and attentive to what we did and didn't like. The mimosa was a bit strong for me personally, and they offered to remake it and take it off the bill!! 10/10 experience and would definitely recommend! Bonus is you get a 10% discount if you're a City College student and it's great little spot to get some cute pictures."

Those were my choices they had other options available such as: turkey bacon, sausage and etc for poultry & for drinks: tea, mimosa and others. Great place, I will be back. Thanks Home Sweet Harlem for making my morning lol"
7/13/2020,2 star rating,"Small portions, probably because they forgot a main part of the dish. Did the shrimp, eggs, and grits omelette and they forgot the grits.

4/22/2019,2 star rating,I wanted to give this 2 stars but the cook was extremely polite and came out to greet us. Let's get to the food. What we ordered:Elote: not real elote. It was grilled corn but didn't taste fresh. The chipotle mayo was off and so was the cheese. It didn't taste authentic. Turkey sandwich: very simple and basic. It was good for what it was.Creole: tasty-ish it had good flavor but wasn't too hotMac n cheese: stale and a little burntWe ordered a few other entrees but none stood out as memorable or anything I'd re-order
1/25/2019,5 star rating,"As a Yelper, I am not a food critic but rather an experience critic. The experience I had a Sweet Home Harlem was definitely on-point. I think I really enjoyed this place also due to the hospitality of our server, William. When we walked in, our server made us feel right at home. He gave us the low-down on what was good on the menu and was just a ball of good vibes. He made sure our mimosa glasses never went dry and recommended some dope places to visit while in Harlem. The food was about 4-stars to be quite honest. It was good but not mind-blowing. It all tasted very fresh and came out hot. I liked my farm skillet and my guest really enjoyed their shrimp/fish and grits. Everything was seasoned well. The cook/owner even came out to say hello to our table. I think the prices were fair. I didn't like that they only took cash (I think the machine was down) but they took off the fee to use the ATM next door which was nice.The restaurant itself was a real cozy spot as well. It feels like it once was a coffee shop or something. I'd come here to get some work done or for a family brunch. They also played R&B music while we ate which definitely set a good vibe as well. Like I stated before, the experience was just great especially with our server William. I definitely recommend."

11/25/2018,2 star rating,"I was looking for brunch recommendations about 3 weeks ago and Home Sweet Harlem was suggested by a friend. After looking at the menu and website I decided I didn't want to go that day but would put a pin in it to return later. The same week, the restaurant came up in conversation (with others) on several occasions, so I thought, ""I have to give this place a try."" ...I should have stuck with my first mind. I went for brunch today and it was awful. Upon walking in I was not greeted by anyone at all. I walked over to an extremely cluttered bar (unsure if it was available for seating) in search of direction, seat assignment, service...SOMETHING. I ask if I had to sit at a table of if I could sit at the bar. I was told the bar was ok, things were moved to create some kind of space for me, and I was given a menu. The menu wasn't easy to follow but I figured it out after speaking with the bartender. I ordered the Home Skillet with yams + Unlimited Drinks for one hour (which is a little overpriced considering the quality) and waited. 5 minutes later the lights at the bar turn off because water is leaking from the light bulbs. None of the staff seem to really care... 5 minutes after that a gentleman walks up to the bar to tell the bartender/server that he's leaving because he has yet to receive his food. The server seems marginally surprised but not very apologetic. 5 more minutes later a young lady walks in and sits next to me, orders her food and ends up receiving her entree before I receive mine. I don't say anything but the server immediately realizes this is an issue as I have been waiting a while at this point. Another man, who I assume is the manager, walks up to apologize about the wait time and explains that tickets are being lost in the kitchen but my food will be out shortly. I calmly ask if there will be any accommodation for my inconvenience. He hesitates then tells me that ""the took the gratuity off my bill,"" as if that's some kind of favor for the terrible service I'm receiving. Eventually my meal comes. It's fine. There were a lot of shrimp in the Home Skillet, which I appreciated. The yams were a little burnt but I liked the flavor. Overall the meal was decent. I have no desire to go back to Home Sweet Harlem. The laissez-faire attitude of the entire staff about the terrible service they provided was more off putting than my average entree. Clean it up, guys. Seriously. I don't know if I just got a bad day or if this is consistent service but I would have loved to experience the place that was recommended to me in the onset. #outtoeatwithJB"
5/22/2017,2 star rating,"Review is based on a Sunday brunch and reg breakfast menu. Nice spacious locations and art work on the wall. Waitress was very nice, and mildly attentive, not so much her fault, as she was the only one aside from the owner. I ordered the farmers skillet and was not impressed...with all of the combined ingredients, it still lacked flavor. The turkey bacon was good. My grits were delicious and creamy. I also had a Bellini, had to remind the waitress twice, the drink  was just ok. I also had peppermint tea which was good.My husband ordered the shrimp n grits and didn't care for it.  He also ordered two sunny-side eggs and they somehow came with their shells crumbled in smh.  He didn't like that his grits were layered with a sauce, tomato and onions. He did not complete his meal. He thought the mimosa was ok, and did enjoy the fresh OJ. My dad has griddle cakes and strangely did not enjoy them. He left most of them on his plate. I believe he stated they were very dry. He wasn't a fan of the house coffee but he drank it.This is a spot that you can try at least once, hopefully they will make improvements to their food."

This is now one of my favorite places to eat in a beautiful part of Harlem."
9/27/2020,1 star rating,"This was absolutely DISGUSTING. My sister wanted to come here for a while. I had a bad gut feeling about this place just from passing it a few times. I decided to just go with it and we went for breakfast this Saturday. I am pregnant and was absolutely ravished ready to eat. As I was looking at the menu, nothing seemed appetizing at all and I had serious doubts about the food. I thought maybe I was just being negative. I was still skeptical but decided to play it safe and order the ""grilled cheese"" which was described as being made on toasted sourdough bread with 3 kinds of cheeses. I asked if the grilled cheese cake with anything and the waitress seemed unsure she said she thought it came with a plain garden salad. I also asked for some home fries but was told they just have regular potatoes. Okay. My sister ordered one of the large breakfast plates with frittata and asked for a cappuccino. The waitress asked what a cappuccino was and said they didn't have that, then quickly switched and said they do have it. It took about 40 minutes for the food to come. When it arrived, I was very confused as to what I was looking at. The grilled cheese was on a very lightly toasted sandwich bread resembling wonder bread that was NOT sourdough. Strangely enough, it contained NO cheese. Imagine a grilled cheese with no cheese. The barely toasted bread was then filled with a slew of unidentified ingredients. There was some sweet potato, greens, and something sour. There was no salad to be seen. The potatoes were hard, undercooked, and not seasoned at all. My sister opened the cup of her ""cappuccino"" and it has about one ounce of liquid in a huge cup. She didn't know what it was supposed to be. Also, no utensils or napkins were brought and i had to ask for them. We politely tried to start eating the food. Neither of us could mask our disgust. She then asked for a regular coffee with cream and sugar instead. It was even worse and she could not drink more than one sip. We did not finish our food. I had a strange taste in my mouth that caused my throat to feel itchy and gross. My sister said her stomach was hurting. We did not finish the food. I would have complained, but I could tell they were a lost cause. I didn't want anything else from them. Should have complained and got my money back because I was furious paying for this absolutely disgusting meal. Paying for a grilled cheese that was neither grilled nor contained a shred of cheese or cake with anything on the side!! I saw two different parties come and leave without ordering whole I was there. That should have been me. We paid, and left to another spot as we were still starving and needed to wash down the taste of that crime against humanity. The rest of the day, my sister had ""bubble guts"" and was complaining of pain in her stomach just from a few bites of their dog grub. Don't ever subject yourself to this nastiness!!! And it is extremely overpriced. You could eat an expired yogurt out of your fridge at home and be more satisfied. Would give no stars if i could. Sickening!!"

The home skillet was delicious and the roasted  were yams excellent.  I have several go to breakfast places in Harlem and this is definitely one of the best. I will continue to return
2/24/2019,4 star rating,"I've only been here for brunch and for good reason - my boyfriend and I go a lot and bring friends here too. The selling point for us is the 1-hour of unlimited mimosas for $20. And they do an EXCELLENT job of making sure your glass is never low or empty. Even when the restaurant is packed, we still got excellent service.My favorite thing to order is anything with the grits. Overall, this is a fun, neighborhood place to get good brunch and mimosas!"
12/1/2014,2 star rating,"If time is indeed money than this place owes us money.Waiting 10 mins for the waiter and another 15 mins to get our breakfast/brunch is totally not acceptable. And hearing a bunch of waiter keep apologizing to every customer for the long wait doesn't make it better... even worse, because instead of going back to work they are standing there and apologizing which makes us wait even longer. I'm not saying it was bad, because the service was still friendly.The brunch is $12 for simply eggs and bread and that kind of things. And if you add a little you can get the $20 menu including a drink. I think both is not cheap and will still make you leaving this place with an empty stomach.Overall it's a nice, cozy place with friendly service and decent food. But the long wait and high price won't get me back."
11/25/2018,3 star rating,"I give this a place 3 stars for the food. The restaurant serves great food. I had a frittata made with shrimp and onions. I also had their bottomless mimosas. The oj pulp was too big which didn't make the drink enjoyable. The price was too high for what you get. However, I would be willing to try the place out again because of the food so long as the brunch prices were reduced."

12/9/2018,5 star rating,"Let me say that I felt like I was at a family reunion and the waiter was my cousin and the chef was my aunt lol. That's how great the service was! Very homely feeling just very inviting. I had the pleasure of having William as my waiter. He was hilarious lol. We vibed so well the entire time there was nothing but jokes and great conversations. He was very fast and accurate with service and let us substitute drinks we wished to have. He's such a gem to the establishment. I even was able to meet the cook and she was just as sweet. She provided information for other days to come and new items she's going to add to the menu. I truly thank you Guys. Now how could I forget the food. It was soooo good. Some good healthy but soul food at the same time. Seasoned perfectly! Each dish includes turkey bacon, turkey sausage, or salmon cake. Along with one drink and coffee now who includes all that together AMAZING!! There's a bottomless option as well. I honestly can't wait to come back!!"
8/22/2018,2 star rating,"I finally got there! Sad to report I didn't have a good time. My drink, my main focus, pineapple ginger, mint was just so-so. It just wasn't properly blended all the ginger and mint pieces stayed on top of the ice cubes, in the drink was just pineapple juice. Only a breakfast menu was available even though it was already 12 noon. There's more but I need not go on. We got our two drinks, paid our bill and left. Pout, I really wanted to love the place. 2 stars for Service. He was very apologetic that they were not ready to serve lunch."
8/7/2016,5 star rating,"Sunday morning our group of eleven was looking for an early start before heading to a Yankee game. This place fit the bill and was very comfortable. The staff was accommodating and patient with our large group. Facts: bottomless mimosas go for one hour but since this is a mom and pop shop we drank through all 6 of their bottles... Would be a perfect spot for a couple of ppl looking for a casual, low key, no pressure and local spot."
7/19/2018,1 star rating,"Went here based on yelp. Place was empty when I got there. Was given water with no ice. Waitress seemed annoyed to be at work. When inquiring about specials of the day as it specifies to do on their menu the waitress simply said ""no"". When I inquired about whether the sandwiches came with anything again simply ""no"". I wasn't told they had no lemonade until I inquired about it was after ordered and waiting for food to arrive. The sandwich wasn't bad but it was nothing special and didn't even have all the ingredients listed. I didn't inquire as I assumed all I'd get was were out of it since I wasn't informed I wouldn't get what I ordered when I ordered it. Maybe brunch is better but doubt I'll give them another shot after today's poor showing. For the record the guy waiting on everyone else seemed pleasant with those guests and the lady at the register before my shitty waitress came scowling over was pleasant. They also have a tipping included policy which I assume accounts for the waitresses poor attitude"
11/7/2020,1 star rating,"Anything but Home Sweet Home. I wish I could give this place zero stars. I went there on a Saturday afternoon with my husband.  First at the door no one was there to greet us, we had to call out for someone who kept walking back and forth and not acknowledging us. Once inside we were told to sit where ever, so we did. It took several minutes to receive a glass of water. There were several employees just walking around and not assisting. Then a group of 4 came in after us and were immediately tended to. Their orders were taken and we still waited another 3 mins before walking out. Over 20 mins and no service is unacceptable and I would never return there or recommend this place to anyone."
2/18/2017,4 star rating,"Nice relaxed placed by CCNY. Fresh food made to order. I had the shrimp and grits with scrambled eggs and toast. Delicious... Took home half my food ate it hours later and it was still delicious... I love breakfast and they serve breakfast all day in addition to lunch and dinner. My co-worker had the the shrimp creole and cleaned her plate. Another co-worker had the salmon cakes, she didn't even share because they were so good. Healthy soulful cooking. Music in the bathroom is a plus  We will definitely return."
9/13/2014,4 star rating,Came here for brunch and had a great meal.  #simple done well.Everyone pretty much got the farmer's skillet.  The frittata is made pretty well.  Grits were very rich and buttery.  Biscuits however were dry :( My favorite was the side of chicken cutlet which was a super juicy and crispy chicken breast--def supplement your dish with this.Overall: 3 bumped to 4 for the chicken cutlet and the friendly service and owner which I almost failed to mention.
11/2/2019,4 star rating,"Small but cozy. Our food was really good! Everything came out piping hot. They definitely are a small mom and pop shop so if you're not into the kind of spot where you order and someone in the back cooks it from scratch then don't bother. The attention to detail could be better - we had to ask for the fruit that was supposed to come with our meals, and we had to keep reminding the waitstaff to bring syrup, coffee, etc. Overall, we had a really good experience and plan to return."
6/20/2018,2 star rating,"As we entered Home Sweet Harlem we noticed (via a sign) that they were a cash only establishment for the time being due to technological issues, which was not a problem and I went to the corner store at the end of block to retrieve money. Upon returning our experience went downhill from there. My husband was interested in looking at the brunch menu, as many of the reviews have raved about their options and we were wondering if we could get a couple of the items. As soon as he picked up the menu to look at it, Jennifer, our waitress immediately says ""You can't just pick stuff up without asking"" muttered under her breath, but loud enough for me to hear her. It is a common practice for patrons to take a look at a menu while they are waiting to be seated, and mind you it was not busy and were not running out of menus. He returned the menu to its stand.As we were being seated I noticed that Jennifer was wearing a sheer skin tight black dress in which her areolas were completely visible. I do not have a problem with waitresses not wearing a bra or being able to see their nipples through the material, but being able to see your complete areolas through your dress is not appropriate for a ""family friendly"" restaurant. On top of her distracting apparel her attitude left much to be desired. She was rude, and could not or did not want to answer our simple question about the ingredients in one of the dishes. Aside being related to the owner I have no idea how she managed to get a job with her horrid attitude.Our food was decent, but both dishes ordered were missing turkey bacon, we ate it anyways because we did not want to  offend the hostile waitress once more. At the end of the meal we asked if they were out of turkey bacon (a logical conclusion) and she swore up and down it was in deed sprinkled on top of both our dishes. This was not true. My potatoes were either a day old and had been reheated, or had been sitting under the heat lamp for entirely too long as some pieces were really tough. From the time we ordered our food to the time it was delivered to our table it was  about 30-35 min and it took 15 min to get our check. Even then we still had to walk the check up to the bar instead of being taken care of at our table. It was clear that they only had one cook in the back and only two waitresses working that day, an inappropriate amount of servers and cooks for a day. As we walked the check up, the lady (different from our waitress) who was behind the bar making coffee and other assorted drinks was apparently on her break and taking a personal phone call in front of customers rather than going to the back or outside. She refused to acknowledge our presence and we had to wait for our rude waitress to come and close out the bill. A little bit of decency and politeness would have gone a long way to ensure that we would come back again. I understand that waitressing can be hard especially when you are one of two on the floor, but your attitude is what ensures customers have a good experience regardless of what else may be going on. FYI gratuity is included on the bill, and this may be why the service is so piss poor at this establishment.I really wanted to like this place and I am so disappointed."
8/22/2019,5 star rating,"Fantastic meal, terrific service.I had the Home skillet and my partner had the Farmer's Skillet. I can't wait to try everything. The frittatas were delicious as were the grits!I just moved to the neighborhood and will be back often.It's corny but the Donna (the chef) and William (the server) made me feel right at Home!"
2/21/2016,3 star rating,"We decided to have brunch at HSH. We initially wanted to get some French toast but we're swayed by Yelp to get the shrimp and grits. We also opted for the unlimited bellini/mimosa/mechilada for one hour. It seemed like a good deal (additional $10 with a main entree). The bellini and mechilada were good. The mechilada wasn't quite like what I know it to be (nothing on the rim, less limey) but it wasn't bad. Service for us was a little spotty at first and then Daisy took over. She was amazing. Due to a snafu of some sort (us? waitress?) fish and grits came out instead of shrimp. We were ok with it but Daisy insisted that they at least correct one. Not never but appreciated. The food was good. Eggs were nicely seasoned, the grits came with plenty of butter, and the fish was good. The salmon cakes were good too (although my companion didn't like them as much)..  More for me! We will be back."
2/21/2020,1 star rating,I came here in 2018 when I first moved to Harlem. The hostess/staff sat us down but never returned. We waited 15mins and just finally put our coats on and left. It's now Feb 2020 so I decided to give them another try. It was such a waste of time and money. When we arrived there was only one other couple in the restaurant but somehow the service was super slow.Cons:1. The restaurant didn't have any champagne so we weren't able to order mimosas2. Our sangria's came out 15 mins after we received our food although we ordered the drinks way before we gave her our food order.3. I asked the waitress for additional napkins 3 times as I had spilled syrup and she still never brought it over.4. Service was extremely slow although the restaurant was empty.Pros:1. The restaurant itself was cozy and cute although it needs a deep clean.2. Only a short 10min walk from my house.To sum everything up unfortunately I will not return.
6/7/2016,5 star rating,"I had brunch here on my birthday (a Tuesday at 12pm) with a total of 4 people and overall it was a great experience. I chose this place because I go to school nearby and I had class later that day lol. I did not make a reservation because it was a weekday and i figured it would be a quick brunch. When I arrived, I was told there was no brunch option (with champagne), so my party was about to leave and go to a nearby restaurant that offers champagne brunch on weekdays. As we were walking out, the owner actually stopped us and told us that we can do the champagne brunch. It turns out that Mother's Day was a huge business day for them (of course) and they pretty much had very limited options as far as the menu goes. They went above and beyond to please us given the limited menu and that deserves 5 stars. I had the farmer's omelet with catfish, grits, and toast. It was delicious! It sounds like a weird combination but the waitress recommended it and it was great. My friends loved their food as well. We had unlimited mimosas for 1 hour (kind of a bummer but better than nothing). The service was great and the food is all organic btw.  I would definitely go back."
8/29/2018,4 star rating,"I rallied up my coworkers for a birthday brunch based on the great reviews of this place. We were a party of 12 and I made reservations with William; he was super helpful. The day of, we were seated pretty quickly and William made sure that we were all very well accommodated. There were a few off moments like since we were a big party it took a while to get our drinks and we were told that there's one chef in the kitchen. However, our food case out pretty quickly and everyone enjoyed it. I truly liked they start the hour of bottomless mimosas when the last person gets their drink. If I'm in area I'll come back."
7/8/2018,5 star rating,"Went here with a friend for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was pretty empty, but it had a great vibe: a lot of natural light, excellent decor (old pictures of all over Harlem and NYC), friendly and attentive waitstaff.They have two tiers of brunch items: $15 gets you a basic meal, $23 dollars gets you the meal, a choice between turkey bacon/turkey sausage/salmon cake, a choice of alcoholic beverage (the mimosas are excellent), and a coffee/tea. Certainly worth the extra $8, especially considering they ask you not to tip.I had the fish and grits. The grits were incredible - I would put them up against any grits I've had in the south. The fish (fried cod, I believe) was very good as well. The dish also came with 2 eggs and a mini salad, both of which were perfectly fine. My friend had the frittata with spinach, peppers, onions, and Swiss cheese with a side of yams and salad. She got the salmon cake and raved about it as well.Overall, this place is a gem. Great price for brunch, and a great way to start a perfect New York City day."

There was a table of four already there. No one else. I sat myself and she brings water and says ""Just to let you know it's cash only"". I give her a look and she says there's an atm at the bodega next door. Then she goes over to the table of four and tells them it's cash only. They all look at each other like "" oh no! I have no cash"". I left. This was a one star experience."

2/1/2018,4 star rating,"This is a cozy, sunny spot for brunch! I had the Farmer's Skillet, which was so full and flavorful of sausage, potatoes, peppers, and onions. The roasted potatoes on the side were delicious. Also had the Fish and Grits, which was the best on the menu! The grits are real, so they were creamy and had the perfect bite. The fish was flaky, moist, and well-seasoned. The Salmon Cakes didn't stand out too much. Definitely would like to come back for the griddle cakes next time!"
12/25/2017,4 star rating,"This place was a great choice! My friend Melissa and I stopped by for brunch before looking at apartments to buy. It was rainy and cold out so it was pretty empty. The menu was pretty straightforward they had a $14 option and $20 platter option which included fresh orange juice or mimosas. We chose the latter. I ordered a turkey and cheddar omelette with turkey sausage and grits, it came with a biscuit and a small side salad. It was very tasty. My friend ordered the spinach, onion and garlic frittata with potatoes and turkey bacon. Our server was cool and we spoke to the manager/owner on the way out. It was a nice spot to go to in Harlem with good food. I recommend."
8/9/2019,5 star rating,"My friends and I went to Harlem to see Hamilton's house and I found this place on Yelp. It's in walking distance so it was perfect. They were serving brunch. I ordered the cremini mushroom omelette with grits. So delicious!! We all enjoyed the food. The atmosphere was amazing and we ended up taking to the owner, Donna, for awhile after. We had an amazing experience. Highly recommend for the food and the atmosphere (plus Mimosas!). What more do you need?? Five stars!"
1/9/2018,5 star rating,"This place has easily become one of my favorite brunch spots. When my friends visit from outside the city, I always try to bring them here. I came in last Sunday and had another great experience. The place wasn't overcrowded and the music playlist was perfect for a Sunday morning in Harlem. My friend and I chose the unlimited drinks option and our waitress kept the peach bellinis flowing. I wish I remembered her name but her nails were super cute lol.  I ordered the shrimp and grits (which, I'm serious, will make you say AMEN). After trying a few other items on the menu during previous visits, my girlfriends and I agree that the savory items are more flavorful and are a better deal than the sweet breakfast foods. Overall, the service and food was amazing! I'll definitely be back soon!"
2/24/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time at Home Sweet Harlem. On a Sunday morning, I joined my cousin and her friends who were in from out of town. I actually recommended this place to my cousin based on the reviews from Yelp. It is located off of 135th and Amsterdam in West Harlem. Upon entering to the left, there is a nice sized dining room full of two-tops and four tops, both square and round. There is also a bar area to your right when you enter. William, with family from Marietta, was our server who was an absolute delight. He definitely added to our experience. Based off of William's recommendations, I ended up ordering the $23 option of the home skillet dish with shrimp which came with a coffee and a drink - I optioned for the mango bellini.  The coffee was really good too. Every establishment does not have a nice blend but I appreciated this particular cup. And they have Truvia to sweeten. Honestly everything was good. I asked that my frittata be on the softer side after I ordered and William relayed the message and made it happen. Everything was excellent. I needed no salt or pepper. Everything was flavored and seasoned to perfection. I don't like heavy food  or heavily seasoned food and my entire plate was well balanced. Like I said, I had the skillet which comes frittata style with shrimp and I elected for a salmon cake for my breakfast meat and it came with cheese grits and a biscuit. Again, everything was excellent. I cleaned my plate with pleasure. Service was prompt and polite. The food came in a timely manner.  We didn't have to wait for a table and it was always at a comfortable level in terms of noise and crowd size. I would highly recommend it. The quality was there and so was the value.I will be back!"
1/19/2020,1 star rating,"I really wanted to give this place 2 out of 5 stars but there were many outstanding issues.Coffee was terrible.Our food came an hour and a half after we ordered, and cold.The food was near inedible nowhere near the photos posted here, every item lacked the quality and standard you would expect from any restaurant in New York City. Moreover, if this was amateur hour I still wouldn't eat the food then. Grits were raw, shrimp had shells, turkey sausage was weird I doubt it was turkey, the biscuit was still flour, the croquets blended and seasoned poorly, and the home fries were whole ass potatoes. orders were missing items, even after an hour and thirty wait.In their defense they said they were short staffed, but then they were rude when we asked to fix things and get better pricing so I lost sympathy. As a black person myself, I really love to support black businesses and I'm even biased towards them but I had to throw the baby out with the bath water.  Don't come here until they improve, we told the people beside us to go before they ordered too.Update: since I have the attention of the owner, short staffed does not excuse a lowering of quality. If you are unable to meet the bar you set for yourself, set by your peers, you communicate that before people order. You remove items from the menu, you communicate wait times, you don't open for the day, you accept any decisions customers may make considering all of this and you accommodate them as they will accommodate you. You don't communicate this after an 1:30 wait and food is poor quality. You hire good chefs and waiters beforehand to prevent this from happening. I wish you a wonderful year too, I had a terrible experience but I will believe it's an off day for your sake. I write this because we need to keep Harlem black and prosperous and to do so, we all have to do better."
2/9/2018,5 star rating,"The food here is amazing. One Saturday morning we ordered via Seamless bc the Yelp reviews were great. He got the turkey burger with the roasted potatoes and I wanted the fish and grits BUT they MADE you buy an ""optional"" salad with the order for $4. I knew it would go to waste and I didn't want to buy an ""optional"" salad that I was not going to eat that morning so I opted for chicken wings. We get a call from the owner to inform us abt an issue with the order via Seamless. I let her know that I really wanted the fish and grits BUT I think if things were optional, they should be optional. She agreed and while on the phone she fixed the option on Seamless. It was a small mistake with the platform that she was able to fix. She sent over the fish and grits breakfast instead of my wings! I offered to pay the difference and she told em not to worry about it.Okay, so BOOM - excellent customer service. She was so helpful and accommodating. Now, the food:I turn around and he scarfed down that burger and those potatoes SO FAST! He said he couldn't help it bc they were so good. The grits I had were SOOOOOO creamy! The fish was perfect. I was so happy she sent it over. She definitely made me a customer for life. I want to try more items on the menu."

Thank goodness my husband is persistent and we decided to take a chance and stop by because Yelp wasn't letting us make a reservation or even get on a waitlist! The food was oh so delicious and the owner Donna and her staff full of Harlem hospitality! Our entire party agreed, we'll be back! Oh and if you love grits like I do...they do them right!"
7/1/2016,5 star rating,"""So...how did you want your eggs done again?""My best friend and I were staying in a Harlem airbnb, so upon waking up I naturally Yelp'ed the best breakfast/brunch places here. We made the walk over to Home Sweet Harlem just behind City College but were surprised to see virtually no one inside (Thursday around 11 am). Tentatively we crept in and asked for a table.The menu contains a variety of affordable, Southern-inspired dishes; my friend got the Farmer's Skillet ($14) (sans cheese so I could try it) and I ordered the Fish and Grits ($14). The waiter kept coming back to clarify details with our order but we appreciated his honesty.The food came out promptly and we scarfed down the generous portions. The fish was battered nicely and the ingredients in the skillet frittata were fresh and high quality. Grits were thick and well-seasoned (a great compliment coming from a Southern boy!) Yams seemed a little over-caramelized (read: burnt) but were edible.I see that a lot of negative reviews for this place deal with the service. Our experience was excellent, but it's understandable given that we were nearly alone there. HSH is a great bang for your buck - would definitely come again to try the other options!"

Turkey sausage tastes sour, potatoes were dry old and burnt, eggs had shell and weren't scrambled like in the photo but fried, 2 tiny slivers of old avocado. The people who run this place also run a number of ""restaurants"" on seamless/grubhub. It's all coming from the same place and they all have gimmicky names and dishes. They're scammers! And I pray I don't get sick from eating this food! AVOID AND SAVE YOUR MONEY! These are the other places: LA Breakfast Club, Brekkie Bagels, Jupiter Juice, Friend Fries, Gastropub, Killer Wings, Excuse My French Toast, Fry Me A River, Thick Chick, B*tch Don't Grill My Cheese and they're all operating out of Home Sweet Harlem! If the food and prices were good, I wouldn't care, but this is a SCAM! They don't practice good policies and during this time it's imperative that food service establishments care about the quality of food they're serving to the public. These people just want to make money off of this pandemic and it's disgusting!"

If you can't do delivery I'm a timely manner, DON'T OFFER IT!Edit:Finally got my food 90 minutes after it was placed. I ordered grits with salmon cakes and eggs and a green juice. I live maybe 7 blocks away. The food is oily and smells good but has no flavor. Also came with the tiniest biscuit known to man. Juice is ok but there's no straw and it's very thick with lots of pulp. I'll take the fiber though."
12/25/2019,2 star rating,"Ok. So let me start by saying the food here is delicious! But what disgusted me was when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands I immediately was overcome by the smell of urine. It smelled like there was urine all over the floor that hadn't been cleaned in a few days.. gross...Second, in the bathroom was a dishwash liquid container instead of handsoap- but get this.. it was watered down... barely any soap matter in it.How are folk cleaning their hands with this 1% dish soap with water mixture. It was making me uneasy seeing someone walk from the bathroom into the kitchen. I just hope that there is more soap in the back that the cooks are using. Honestly this makes me want to get up and leave but I already ordered. Also the walk to the bathroom is very unorganized. The atmosphere in dining area is lovely, very homelike, and then to the bathroom it seems like a messy employees only area. Also, when I walked in I was directly greeted.. I walked into one waitress/host fussing at the other and then a greeting... disappointed.Also, there is a service charge included of 18% so you don't need to do any additional tipping. But I'm always weary because they can provide mediocre service and still receive tips... like.. today..One of the cooks came out to help deliver food- sweatpants sagging.. one of the waitresses had on sweats... nice girl though. They also forgot to cook one of my items. We are one of six people in here at the moment. Update: Finally received my pancakes- asked for them to go because at this point I'm ready to leave. After requesting them, They did agree to taking $9 off of the pancakes because of how late they came out. I received them in a box, left and got on my bus home. I opened the box took a bite and the pancakes weren't cooked all the way through! Dough dripping down my face! I got OFF the bus and walked back to show them. They agreed to refund me for the griddle cakes, but accidentally refunded me my full amount - rightfully so because this experience was NOT GOOD. One of the ladies didn't think I deserved it I guess, so they charged my card AGAIN for the amount minus the griddle cakes. Today just seemed really unorganized and unprofessional. Maybecause it's Christmas. They must do better cause honestly I love coming here."

It took 30 minutes for them to bring us an Acai bowl, and an omelette.  I also had to ask twice for the check. Although the choices were pretty limited, their salmon cakes are super yummy, and the fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing. Overall, it's a decent brunch place."

Came here for a pre-birthday brunch.  A friend & I wanted to get a bite to eat after church, which is located in the financial district.  Although, I offered a closer dinning option; I thought it can't hurt to see if she was willing to venture beyond our current zip code.  She agreed to go uptown for authentic comfort food.  Now commuting on MTA during the wkn'd can unnerve the most mellowed commuter.  So 2 trains w/transit changes & quarter mile in we arrived.  We were relived to see emptied tables & no massive crowd pouring out the door.  (Yes tad self-centered).  Upon entrance was a little bumpy.  As there was no host/greeter; so we spoke to the 1st pair of eye contact.  Which was a young man behind a counter. We asked ""can we sit anyway?"" The young man suggested a high table, by the window. I declined. Shared there were emptied tables but not cleaned in the main dinning area; which was a little off putting because it was not crowded.   My replied was ""I pointed at a table..."" He responded  ""...was for a party of four. At which point I looked around as there were several emptied tables & there were no other customers bustling at the door. Resigned he got from behind the counter & cleaned a table that seated 2.  Finally seated. Approximately 6-10mins in no one came to our table, no water, flatware or menus.  The one person who worked the area surveillance the area  & appeared to overlook our table; at which point my friend said ""maybe we should say something!""  So we did.  Waitstaff apologized & took our order.   After the ordered was placed, we were informed by the owner, Donna, that they ran out of shrimp to make one of the entrée.  My friend made another selection & Donna offered us complementary Bellinis - this small gesture upscaled the yelp review. Food arrived; it looked & tasted like Grams & Auntie cooked it.  The grits were perfect, eggs fluffy, biscuit soft & firm in the right bites. We later learned our waitstaff, Daisy, is an inspiring RN, Ms. Donna & my friend, Makeba, goes back someways... Home Sweet Harlem merits the Harlem travel for grits & better-late-than-never-mindset customer service."
9/3/2018,4 star rating,The food was really tasty and our waitress was very nice and attentive. I had the French toast and my daughter had the salmon cakes and chicken. We both loved the food. The only complaint I have is that halfway through my meal I was alerted that they were only going to accept cash. I was unprepared for that. I really didn't have much cash in my account so I planned to pay with a credit card. Then I had to walk over to the next door bodega to the ATM. They took $5 off my bill to compensate for fees but I was still turned off by the inconvenience. I would go back but with cash ;)
9/2/2018,5 star rating,"Great service! The food was bomb! The food tasted fresh and came out in perfect time, the place itself was cozy and welcoming! Definitely can't wait to go back"
8/10/2015,2 star rating,"Review for take-out only:: The Cobb salad to go was NOT good. Not even a little bit. It was Overly watery (from the washing of the lettuce) which was just plain gross, sloppily placed in a to-go container with mostly brown avocado. I took two bites and lost my appetite. $10 completely wasted. Although the lady that was half-assedly making my salad was nice, this place was in complete disarray and just a plain mess! Even if the salad was good the place was such a mess and dirty that I wouldn't dare return. I feel bad because it's obvious this place is family owned and run but cleanliness and timeliness is important in a restaurant, especially one that offers take out and is so close to a college campus!"
7/19/2015,3 star rating,"So this was a pleasant random selection that also plays into my vow to eat my way through a the new eateries in harlem. The location is convenient and unassuming and a clean layout......the staff needs a little work (they're young so I get it), but they make up for their inexperience and slowness with pleasantries and willingness to please. The food was amazing and just the right amount in terms if servings. The quaintness of the restaurant doubled with the owner Donna and some of the cooks coming over and conversing with us as if friends over in her kitchen for a quiet Sunday.Overall I highly recommend Home Sweet Harlem.....as it gives a good down home feeling of my childhood spent in my grandmother's and great grandfather's kitchen picking up the love that is cooking with a southern twist. I would otherwise give 4 but for the young inexperienced servers."
12/6/2015,4 star rating,"Brunch was great. Unlimited mimosas and Bellinis kept coming. I had fish and grits which comes with a biscuit, scrambled eggs and a choice of meat. I chose the salmon cake and the meal was good. All for $30.Great friendly environment with real southern food!"
3/29/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent breakfast food, coffee and service here.  People working there were friendly too.  Had some time to kill and found this place on Yelp while waiting for a van rental and I'm definitely glad we stopped here."
2/10/2018,4 star rating,Quiet....quaint....with good food. It was wonderful to sit a while and drink coffee on a slow Saturday morning. The only thing is the portion of food for what I was paying was ....quite small. I wish there was more..... Other than that. Great Mood...Great Food!
2/25/2018,1 star rating,"I did want to give this place a second chance but now reading the reviews from even back to 12 mos ago I know this place probably won't get any better if they haven't improved yet. I think their BIGGEST issue is not having enough staff, they need at least two more waiters and a bus boy. They are very disorganized the waiters aren't assigned to certain tables I was sitting there watching both waiters go all over the place serving every table. We sat for about 25 mins before getting service I had to stop both waiters and tell them we were ready to order, we were there for an hour or more before we even got our food. And they lied to me and told me that ran out of girts. The service here is very frustrating most of the time I was just observing how these only two waiters were attempting to take care of 7 tables and honestly everyone in that place looked very disappointed. I almost felt bad for the one boy he was really trying and being nice and hustling to service everyone. Its really not the waiters fault when management should have staff in place. The only two waiters had 7 tables with parties of 4 or more was also bussing tables. I heard them saying ""were out of glasses"" ppl complaining about not having silver wear when the food was already on their table. Ppl complaining about the wait. It's so sad that's these complaints I witnessed today I see reviews from 6mos to a year ago with the same complaints. I most likely won't go back the food was amazing but I'm not exactly sure it was worth it at all. There's a ton of places in Harlem to eat with better service.Place is a hot ass mess get help! Hire a hostess, hire more waiters, hire a buss boy. So many ppl need jobs!"
2/6/2015,5 star rating,I been planning on this visiting this location for months.  Today I ended up on this side of Harlem today and said what day is better than the PRESENT! I went around brunch time on a Friday.  I consider myself a French Toast connisueer.  The organic  challah french toast with organic maple syrup was amazing. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The menu they had was very diverse which definitely makes me want to make another visit VERY SOON. Everything from sandwiches to soups to salads to delicious entrées.  The staff and service was very personable and that is something I value just as much as great food.  The staff made me feel at home . Guess that's why it is called Home Sweet Harlem.  Met the owner and she is as sweet as pie and truly has a passion for food & her business. PLEASE DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS KEEP YOU FROM STOPPING INTO THIS HARLEM GEM!! I Plan on becoming a regular there.  Hope the staff doesn't get tired of seeing my face :)
4/30/2018,5 star rating,This place is really a hidden gem! The staff are super sweet and the food is to DIE for!!! Best shrimp and grits I have had ever!!! The ambiance is bright but still intimate! 10s across the board!!
11/14/2017,5 star rating,I totally enjoyed my meal and my time at this amazing little spot in Harlem. The food and service was great. The sangria is perfect.
4/29/2018,5 star rating,Good service and great food. Very spacious location. Very trend with lots of cool art pieces and best of all the food is great! The owner is very nice and accommodating.
6/29/2017,3 star rating,"I love the place. Staff is so nice and hospitable. I would go back to try the brunch. With that said... I had the Jackie Roberson Turkey burger. It was good, well seasoned and the roasted potatoes were yummy. The only disappointment is that the turkey burger itself was small. The patty was smaller than the bun. The party was shaped like a football. A small foot ball and not much gorgonzola cheese. If the parry was as big as the bun and had enough cheese; Damn that would be a slamming burger. Let me clear. I will go back for brunch!!!!"
2/2/2020,1 star rating,"Don't waste your time. Terrible, dry, tasteless food and mediocore service. Drastically overpriced."
1/4/2019,5 star rating,"Had a really nice brunch here. This restaurant has a very laid-back feel. The servers were all super-nice and attentive. The food was really good, and *very* reasonably priced (which is great because they're cash only). Gratuity is included as well, which made everything really simple."
8/3/2018,5 star rating,"We came here with our families for brunch and had an amazing time! The brunch menu is really diverse and we've tried a lot of items from it. The French toast is delicious and the shrimp and grits are out of this world! It servers were Alyssa and William, they were so attentive with our group (15 people!) And provided excellent service. This is an amazing restaurant that everyone in Harlem should check out."
2/3/2018,3 star rating,"So, still waiting for food.  Long wait. Hope it's worth the wait and price. If food is top notch I'll raise the stars but over 20 min wait so far."
3/2/2019,4 star rating,"Went here for Sunday brunch, the food is good, fresh, and made to order. The brunch offers mimosas. The menu is limited but the shrimp and grits ""were on point"" (my boyfriends words)"
11/13/2017,5 star rating,"I came here for breakfast on Saturday after hearing about it and realizing how close it was to me. I love the vibe in here, it has a very cozy relaxed mom & pop feel although it's actually a pretty big space. My husband was a little disappointed when he realized that the bacon on the menu was turkey bacon, but he loved his ""bacon"" egg and cheese biscuit sandwich with roast potatoes on the side. I ordered the skillet which was really good, it was my first time having a frittata and I'd definitely order it again. The little biscuit that came with my meal was so good I was tempted to order a bag of them to go. We asked for hot sauce and they brought out a little cup of Valentina which means that they have great taste :)The unlimited drinks are $20 for an hour, one person at our table ordered that and the waiter was definitely not stingy with refills. You'll get your money's worth, if not more!Highly recommended neighborhood gem, I'll definitely be back to try their french toast and smoothies."
6/20/2017,2 star rating,Way overpriced! Got a smoothie that cost $6 and it was the size of a small coffee! Even Barney is disappointed. No thanks.
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"Fish and grits is my number 1 order. Fish is seasoned and fried to perfection and cheese for the grits is  not just fancy but yummy. And let's not forget the hot sauce. Totally recommend to anyone in the City College area looking for brunch on any day, Tuesday after class or a girls outing on the weekend and let's not forget you church folks looking for something bone sticking than ihop."
4/19/2019,3 star rating,"Important to note that this place is cash only. There's a deli right night door, so upon getting here we were informed of the cash only rule, and I was able get cash quickly. Was off from work & went here on a Friday afternoon for brunch. I ordered the farmers omelette frittata. It came w/ a meat side (where you could select from a salmon cake, turkey bacon or turkey sausage), and a choice of potatoes or grits. I've never seen salmon cake offered as a side, so thought that was pretty cool. It also comes w/ a choice of Bellini, mimosa, or ""Bloody Mary"" (they make it w/ beer instead). The frittata was delicious and filling. I got potatoes, on the side, just okay. The salmon cake was okay to my standards, but would have preferred it to be more crispy on the outside. It was made w/ green/red peppers & onions, so again, pretty good...just my preference to want it more crisp on the outside vs soft all around. Left pretty full and fairly satisfied. The service was a little slow and it wasn't a busy afternoon. This is a churn and burn place. Meaning, you'd come here to eat and leave...as the ambience is pretty simple but clean. I'd give this place a 3 1/2 stars if I could, but yelp only allows whole number. Would come back again."
12/9/2018,3 star rating,"Came at 10 AM on a Sunday, and it wasn't busy at all. They were able to seat our party of 5 easily. They do offer unlimited brunch cocktails for $15-$20 for an hour, which is a pretty great deal. Most of the brunch entrees are $15 originally, but $23 if you want to add an extra side of meat (turkey bacon, turkey sausage, or salmon cake) and a drink. Honestly, upgrading to the $23 wasn't a great deal. We chose turkey bacon, and it came with two strips of it which were super dry and not very good. The frittatas, both the Farmer's Skillet and Home Skillet were tasty and filling, but pretty salty and hard to finish towards the end because of that. On the other hand, the grits were bland and congealed by the time we got our food; they must have been sitting out on the plate for a while. The home fries were average. Service was nice but super slow; we were seated quickly, but had to wait really long for our food to come out, so it was disappointing that the food wasn't that great either."
3/16/2019,5 star rating,"So I loved that they had a Friday brunch, people want brunch everyday not just Saturday and sunday. It was very dead the whole time but I loved it. I assumed everyone was at work or school. My friends were more than happy to have the spot to ourselves. The drinks were amazing and of course I had the unlimited mimosas and the waitress made sure to fill us up every few mins. The food was amazing ! I heard mixed reviews but it actually was everything I was looking for. I wish they had French toast as a separate option that wasn't going to cost $15 total. The waitress I believed was named grace. She was very helpful, she gave us a run down of the menu and even told us the total price of whatever we got which made it helpful since their card machines were down. Also if you used the atm next door they paid you the fee in cash once you got back. Overall my experience was lovely. I left happy and full."
10/20/2018,1 star rating,Th oh s vfc is OP laxecis so unprofessional. We waited a whole hour and 30 minutes for our food for one of the waitresses to tell us that our order was never placed! As if she never walked up to our table and asked us for our orders!! Pure TRASHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
1/27/2018,5 star rating,"This place does simple food *so well*!  I keep coming back for basic eggs and sautéed spinach (or kale), but I've tasted much of the menu as I frequently bring guests from out of town, land here when meeting a friend, or spring an impromptu date with my hubs.Savory: The shrimp grits is the best I've ever tasted, sautéed spinach/kale is perfectly seasoned (not overly salty, and dynamite with the hot sauce they have on hand). Eggs are made exactly to order (I like them over-medium, which is probably the hardest type to get right), and the different omelette options are probably the most creative flavor-bombs you can find this part of town. The salmon croquettes are *not* to be missed--I never would have ordered these on my own, but I got to taste them recently when a friend ordered them--lucky me!Sweet: Also have tasted others' sweet breakfast/brunch choices; the greek yogurt with fruit or maple syrup is a creamy, tangy option, but the challah french toast really stands alone.  Thick slices have ultra-crunchy crusts, rich succulent fluffy centers.Service pace is leisurely and food is made to order, so this is a perfect place to catch up with a friend, or conduct a working lunch. There is plenty of table space for laptops or notebooks, and the atmosphere is quiet enough that you can easily hear each other.  The friendly staff really rounds out the experience. The manager/owner (?) was so sweet, as was our waitress!  I briefly spoke with the cook on my way out, thanking him for all the good food I've had there over the years, and he was super friendly as well."
1/21/2017,5 star rating,"Wow! Exceeded my expectations of the reviews! Overall everything was wonderful. Even though the sign on door said prefer cash, they do accept credit cards, I used mine to get an extra 7% on my card, plus the 5% first time discount. That's 12% next bill. Even if there was no incentive the place was great!"
7/26/2018,5 star rating,"I was on a vacation in the city and was looking for a brunch spot with a laidback feel. Walked from my apartment to their location, it was easy to find and I was welcomed in immediately. My server greeted me right away, as well as the owner which I thought was really nice. The owner and I ended up chatting during and after my meal, and it was great talking about Harlem and her business. She also told me about the jazz performances that would take place from 7-9:30 pm on certain days of the week and invited me to swing by (which I'm going to try and do tonight!). The hospitality of this place is off the charts which I genuinely appreciated.I ordered the $23 meal like Miles G. suggested and I'm glad that I did. The breakfast I ordered was the perfect amount of filling where I felt satisfyingly full but didn't need to take a nap afterward. I got the waffle which was so delicious and fluffy, as well as the turkey bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese, their berries (strawberries and blueberries), and a mimosa which might've been the cherry on top of this wonderful meal. They do not accept tips like most places, as a tip is already included in the bill. I didn't mind at all because I tend to tip well anyway. Overall, I enjoyed my meal so much that I wanted to meet the cook who made it and he was cool about it and appreciative.I 100% recommend this place to anyone traveling to the area if nothing else to meet some friendly faces. Thanks for taking care of me Home Sweet Harlem.To the other reviewers who had poor experiences with service, I guess everyone has a bad day once in a while. I'm also curious how y'all acted. I was nice to them and they all definitely reciprocated."
4/27/2019,2 star rating,"Average brunch for twice the price! Orange juice was not freshly squeezed as promised on the menu and French toast was dry and plain. Disappointed by the portions (four slices plain served with small boat of yogurt and syrup, no sides included) especially after paying 15-24 bucks per menu item. The environment is open and beautiful, but we didn't get our drinks until we gave reminders halfway through the meal. Otherwise the food is quite healthy and pleasant."
6/19/2017,4 star rating,"The food was ok but the smoothies were exceptional. This is a spot to stop in on a hot day for a flavorful refreshing smoothie.Prices are really reasonable and the staff is friendly. No complaints, but the only downfall is it's cash only - there is an ATM in the next door deli."
5/30/2019,5 star rating,"I love coming here for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. The vibe and the whole atmosphere makes me feel comfy and at home. More than that they do great coffee, grits, and frittatas...but I'm writing this review because the biscuits are to die for. My family is from the south (New Orleans/Alabama) and the chefs biscuits (who says her family is also from Alabama) are just like the ones our family fights over when I go down there to visit. In Mobile we get our biscuits from a baker who has stopped making them, except for when my grandmother orders them for us. Needless to say these biscuits are very special to my family. So--I am so happy to have found biscuits like these in my neighborhood in New York! Love this place."
7/4/2015,4 star rating,"The restaurant itself is very quaint and cozy. I appreciated the fact that they gave my husband and friends the large booth to accommodate my baby's stroller. As a new mom, I was happy that I didn't have issues about bringing my baby girl. The waiter immediately asked if I needed a high chair, which I didn't as my baby is almost a month old. So two thumbs up for being family friendly while still preserving the ambiance of the restaurant! I took off one star because the service was a little slow and inconsistent, but the food itself was delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits. If I am in the neighborhood during breakfast/brunch hours I would definitely stop in again."
2/23/2019,1 star rating,Not really worth the time and money.  A mediocre meal at an expensive price. I feel that they can do better. The should really improve their biscuit recipe. Not happy with my meal at all.
5/19/2019,2 star rating,Arrived at the restaurant with barley anyone in there and waited almost five minutes to get seated not to mention that there was three people at the bar area doing nothing that could've seated us. Then took over fifteen minutes for the waiter to come over and take our drink order. He used cellphone to take our order. Which was odd that he couldn't find a pen in the whole establishment. When we got our drinks the coffee was bitter and the cup was dirty from the outside. The mimosa was warmer then average. The food was okay. The French toast was delicious but the shrimp and grits were not. The dish was cold and my grits were all lumpy. The waiter never check on us again. We finished eating the plates just sat there. I asked another waiter for my check and got up to pay because I wasn't waiting anymore. It's like they don't care since the tip is already included in your bill.
7/25/2018,1 star rating,"First of all, servers, get your act together !!  Seemed to be totally unfamiliar with the menu.......so I just took my chances..  Chicken & Waffles.....One piece of chicken....I think it was the back.  Soggy waffle. all their plates look like a dog's breakfast.  First and LAST visit to Home Sweet Harlem and I live just down the street......."
7/17/2016,1 star rating,"I'm writing this review as I am in the restaurant right now waiting for coffee that we ordered 30 minutes ago. On top of that, our water for the table didn't arrive until 15 minutes after sitting, menus didn't reach our hands until an extra five minutes after that and we didn't get to truly put in our order until another 10 minutes after that... The service is horrendous so if you're hungry, pick somewhere else.Not worth it."
4/28/2019,4 star rating,This was such a cute and intimate place. I saved this place to remember  but my partner ultimately got me to visit. The food was great . Very well seasoned and large portions. I got the shrimp and grits with a salmon cake and biscuit. The best I've had in all of Harlem and I've been here 5 years. I also got the unlimited mimosa which was only $15 for an hour. Which is also the best I've ever seen. My partner got the griddle cake with Greek yogurt and fruit which was so good. The rest area was so clean!!! and I was so amazed and grateful (I'm borderline OCD) lol. The only thing I would change was the music. It was super low and it didn't play throughout the establishment. It was on a tv and playing music choice from a cable network. Good music can make or break an experience. However that doesn't negate from this being a hidden gem. I will definitely be back for more brunch dates
6/20/2015,4 star rating,"This place is quite nice inside. The wait staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The menu has a lot to offer and they are willing to make changes as per your requests. I got the mushroom and scallion frittata; it wasn't bad but I think the omelette has more to offer. I was able to get the potatoes substituted with toast and the sausage substituted with a fruit cup. My friend got the egg and cheese croissant and was very happy with it. The salmon cakes were also received positively. Ambience is overall enjoyable and chill. The music was generally Top 40 from about 5 years ago. My friend and I ordered micheladas and they actually came out a few minutes after we received our meal, which we were not happy about. Generally drinks are nice to have before the meal arrives. The service was also a little slow but my conversations with my friends kept me entertained while we waited for the food."
2/25/2019,1 star rating,"Disappointed.  Upon entering we were greeted by a waitress who seemed to be having a bad morning already; no ""hello,"" no smile, just attitude.  When some of  the menus on the entrance stand fell on the floor and I helped pick some up, not even a thank you.  All of the food was either over cooked or bland.  I'm not picky about food or taste, but my two companions and I were very disappointed in everything we ordered."
7/28/2018,3 star rating,Was not impressed. My 11 year old son ordered chicken and waffles and the chicken looked weird so he would not eat it. I had French toast that had hard edges. The meal was rather pricey considering I was with kids and there was no option for kids menu (at least I did not see one). The food was edible but I wouldn't go back.
4/27/2018,4 star rating,"I love this place. Home Sweet Harlem feels like one of those restaurants that has been around for years and has stuck to its roots. You can tell that they really stick to traditions, and usually I gear away from restaurants like that, but it just works for this place.It has classic soul foods like mac and cheese and chicken. They have different specials each week, and their food is amazing. If I could, I would order their bbq fried chicken everyday. This place accepts large crowds, but it usually is never crowded itself. The staff is very nice and friendly, and they will cater to your requests. One downside to this restaurant is that they don't have some of the key foods that I love. Their pasta and fried chicken dishes are definitely limited. Also, the prices of the food can sometimes be an issue. Overall I would recommend you visit this place, it is great!"
6/11/2016,1 star rating,"We have just eaten brunch after 45 minutes waiting for our meals to get to the table. I can say that we were complete abandoned the whole time. There was another couple and they were as freaked out as us. After all, the food was good, but I couldn't enjoy it because I was really mad. If they can't serve so many tables, maybe they should have less tables."
1/31/2018,5 star rating,"This place is so cute and the food is immaculate. It reminds me of eating in my grandmother's living room. The ambience and the aesthetic is very welcoming. My favorite meal is the fish and grits with the salmon cakes. I also got the pineapple smoothie, which was delicious as well. Home Sweet Harlem is really home for me."
4/8/2017,5 star rating,"Grayson is by far the best server I have experienced in NYC. He serves with a smile and is very attentive but not overly so.I make decisions all week, so when I am trying a new restaurant I'm not always in the mood to decide what to eat. I asked Grayson my server what I should try, and he gave me some great suggestions with the why behind them. To my suprise this restaurant does not serve pork so needless to say my meal was a hit! :)Thanks Grayson I will tell my friends and I will definitely be back!Michelle"
3/28/2016,2 star rating,"I wanted to like this place, I really did because the food is DELICIOUS BUT it is so disorganized :( . I've been here twice. The first time was okay...even though we waited about 20-25 minutes for our food in an empty restaurant. The second was not so great. My friend and I went on a Sunday for brunch. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, which wasn't a big deal. We were given a different waitress this time (Short, White girl with glasses). She was very nice, but she did not know much about anything restaurant related.I asked about the wifi since I had read a tip on Yelp and she said she didn't have the code. I asked what was in the Michelada, and she said she didn't know except that it was similar to a Bloody Mary. I then asked if  turkey sausage or chopped up turkey bacon was in the frittata because it just said turkey, and she also did not know. She did go to find out though, but I think waitresses should know the menu. We placed our order at 1:45pm. We both ordered the brunch special (shrimp & grits for my friend, fish & grits for me) with unlimited 1 hour mimosas/bellinis ($10 extra). She came back to check on us at 2:00pm and asked if we needed anything...we needed everything because we weren't served our food or drinks. She came back at 2:06pm to give us our drinks and wrote down our time. It was a bit troubling that she started our time without the food almost 20 mins later and did not indicate when it would be available. I noticed the waitresses and bartender near the bar scrambling to figure out if the drinks prepared were either mimosas or bellinis. One of the waitresses sniffed the glass to be sure. At this moment I am holding my breath because I thought she was going to serve it, but she threw it out (thank goodness). They were so preoccupied with drinks, I started to get annoyed without my food. My friend's mimosa was gone, and she said they ran out of ""pitchers"" (they looked like cream dispensers actually) and she would bring him one as soon as it became available. She also said they were running out glasses...all of this information without filling his glass. SmhAt 2:24pm...39 mins later, (not exaggerating because I actually timed it) our food finally came out. The waitressed asked if we needed anything, and went to go and get ketchup, when she came back she asked if we needed anything else. I stated we needed silverware. They did not place any on our table since seating. She came back with a fork and knife and explained how they were out of napkins.... OKAY?! My friend looks at me and says ""Are they out or she doesn't know where they are?"" . A few moments later she came back with napkins for us...wow. I overhear the other waitress serving the table behind us informing them that they are only accepting cash at the moment, she says they will refund the atm fee...but the bank charges a fee as well.  Our waitress did not tell us anything so when the bill came we handed her our card. She asked if we had cash and we simply said ""No"". Do you know what she did? She made a card transaction! Idk if it was miscommunication on their behalf, but they were definitely able to swipe cards. The food is delicious and well seasoned, but the organization of the place if just terrible .:sigh:. it sucks because I knew when I saw the Black cook with the bonnet that the grits would be phenomenal and they were...just like my grandmothers! Smh, back to making my own."
1/22/2017,5 star rating,"Good food, good decor, good smoothies and great service!Ordered farmer's skillet with yams and home skillet with grits. The yams were great. I like them better than regular potatoes. I didn't like the skin too much. There were some too chewy for me and i peeled them off.  Some were soft enough to eat. Prefer the farmer skillet over the home skillet. It must be because I'm not use to having shrimp in my eggs. Still good. We ordered the fruit and vege smoothie. Great if you like kale. I don't like kale but i still liked it. I had the fruit smoothie and liked that better. You can taste the yogurt in the smoothie. I'm more fruit over vegetables. Service was awesome. The owner served us and she gave us great suggestions and have us time to make decisions without making us feel rushed. We also made conversation with her about New York and Harlem since we were out of state visiting."
8/13/2019,5 star rating,I didn't get to take a picture but I had shrimp and grits with a salmon cake. My food was great I would probably switch to stone ground grits and add a little white cheddar to them.The salmon cake was delicious and the conversation with everyone was even better. I'll definitely be back again. Oh and you guys should serve biscuits on the weekdays lol people live for hot fresh biscuits I know I do
12/15/2016,5 star rating,"On an early Saturday afternoon, my friend and I enjoyed a delicious brunch here. The atmosphere was so warm and relaxing we did not want to leave the place.The owner and waitresses were extremely friendly. The service was excellent! I can not wait to go again! Great choice Angela..."
12/2/2018,1 star rating,"My coworker and I decided to stop here before classes. We sat down and noticed the ""old"" musty smell inside of this place. The prices are too high for food that is just ""meh"". The yams I ordered looked as if it was microwaved--cold in the inside and hot on the outside. We will not be going back to this place again."
7/17/2016,1 star rating,4 star food with negative 5 star service. Incredibly disorganized with a very long wait for almost anything. Go elsewhere if you don't have two hours to spare.Edit: wrote the review as we waited for the check. After waiting 10 minutes our waitress told us she'd forgotten what we ordered. Never again.
3/13/2016,4 star rating,"I was visiting NYC for the week, and decided to come here for a brunch/lunch with my boyfriend and two friends. My friends were running late--so we arrived early and grabbed a table. The service was great, and we were able to sit and wait until our friends arrived. I ordered the Farmer's Skillet: egg frittata with shrimp, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, bacon--and no cheese for me because I'm lactose intolerant. (It was very easy to inquire about the menu for my dietary needs--and I was really grateful for this.) It was well-seasoned and delicious!My boyfriend got the Challah French Toast--so delicious! I had a bite, and he cleaned off the plate. My friends got frittatas and grits. (I heard that the grits were amazing).I also tried the salmon cake. (An order is 1 cake for $4). I thought I would get more than one when I ordered, but it was crispy, filling, and delicious. For the amount of salmon, I would say it is decently priced.Afterwards, we stuck around and studied on our laptops. Great wifi, and they are open 9 to 9. Great background music. Very chill and relaxing. The whole place has a cozy feel, with fresh flowers on the tables, framed art on the walls. I recommend!"
3/20/2015,3 star rating,"I am fairly disappointed at this restaurant. I ordered the st Nicholas burger but the service was very slow and took over 25 mins to serve.They serve ground turkey burger, which is quite novel. But far from good. If you were on a diet maybe the burger is for you."
9/18/2014,4 star rating,I came on a Thursday afternoon and it was empty except for one other girl drinking a beer by the door. I walked straight to the counter and looked at the menu. I got the half salad and half sandwich and was directed to sit anywhere I wanted. I was brought utensils and water immediately which was efficient. My food came quickly and it was surprisingly pretty good. I wouldn't say it was the freshest lettuce I've ever had in a salad but it was definitely good. The Caesar dressing wasn't over powering and the turkey wasn't dry. It was good for what it was. I would come back again for the quiet atmosphere which is nice to study since it is right across the street from City College. There is also free wifi and the waiter provided me with the password before I even asked.
3/3/2018,2 star rating,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't crowded, but there were a handful of other patrons in the restaurant. The table they waitress sat us at was sticky, she wiped it down promptly when we asked her to. She misquoted our meal prices and mixed up how many and which sides we got with our meals, because of this we each got $2 off our check. We got our order of pancakes and french toast after a bit of a wait. The food on its own was delicious. But the food was served without the requested maple syrup and whipped cream. It took about 5 minutes for those to arrive at the table, so by the time we actually started eating the food was already getting a little cold. The only reason this place isn't getting three stars, is because they automatically add a 15% tip, regardless of how big your party is. A 15% tip seemed very generous for the experience we had, and I did not like that they added this tip automatically when waiters, waitress and chefs were gossiping in the restaurant, openly on their phones and not checking in on their customers."
3/8/2014,5 star rating,"Compadres wanted to try a new brunch spot so we trekked half a mile from our friend's apartment to come here. The walk up the hill was more physical activity than should ever be allowed on a Saturday morning but Home Sweet Harlem's comfy interior, great music and smiling faces made it all better. I believe we were waited on by the owner who was a joy! Friendly, provided great, honest recommendations and kindly answered all of our questions about the menu. The rest of the staff were great too. I can't say enough about the service. Attentive without being intrusive if that makes sense?Their $12 brunch menu gets you coffee or tea and an entree. Coffee was a tad heavy on the grinds but fresh and good quality beans made up for it. And I was happy to have little pitchers of steamed milk offered to us instead of cream. Take one look at the menu and you can see this place prides themselves on healthy, fresh, quality ingredients. My sausage egg biscuit was delicious with a side of sweet potatoes. Biscuit tasted perfectly light and buttery and even my turkey sausage (which I'm typically not a fan of) was tasty.Initially I thought my gripe was I'd have liked more in the way of portion size. But hours later when I didn't feel bloated and sleepy, I appreciated not starting my day with a greasy, food-coma inducing meal. The place wasn't packed so the friends and I stuck around after our meal chatting and the staff didn't rush us out at all. True to its name, this place has a homey feel. I asked my friends what they would rate this place and most of them agreed 5-stars. A few of them disagreed and felt it wasn't a great value because of the small portions. But I thought about it and when I considered the ingredients, the service and the environment, this place definitely provided me with a 5-star experience. Probably won't have the opportunity to return anytime soon, but I definitely hope to be back!"
1/2/2014,5 star rating,"Pros: (+) Owner, Donna, is really nice! (+) Coffee is delicious(+) Prices are reasonable(+) 1/2 sandwich special with soup or salad (+) WiFi (+) Serves alcohol (+) Vegan/Vegetarian and healthy optionsCons: (-) Although I know the place is still new, expansion on the lunch menu will be great!(-) Take out order, takes a while if you're on a limited lunch break.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Owner Donna is really nice. They just got their liquor license so now they can serve alcohol. Donna gave us a tour of her newly renovated restaurant, including her kitchen. The kitchen was very neat and clean and you can tell she was very proud of her place. I really want to see this place become successful since Harlem is always in need of lovely cozy places like this."

1/14/2019,1 star rating,"I was here two days ago, it wasn't so good as the reviews they have.I waited for about 45! Minutes for a egg and cheese croissant, there wasn't a lot of people so I didn't understand why... I think it is too expensive in comparison with another places here in New York. (HARLEM).They include a ""service charge 18.5% and taxes of course"" and they are opened to receive a tip, but they didn't deserve for tips or gratitudes.They also use not purified water."
5/9/2018,4 star rating,"Southern food done very well. I came here to have brunch with a group of friends and we absolutely loved everything about this place. The brunch menu is very tight and has something for everyone. Even though we showed up late, they were able to accommodate us as the restaurant was not too packed."
5/4/2018,4 star rating,"The food is delicious. It's that simple. I had the best grits I have had in a restaurant in 40 years. I eat out for breakfast every weekend, Saturday and Sunday and people just can NOT make grits. So don't change the grits recipe and I will definitely be back. Our whole breakfast was delicious-eggs, omelettes,  potatoes and coffee. The restaurant is easy to miss from the street and could do with some sprucing up of the front. Some color on the windows, doors, signage and awning would go a long way to making the restaurant more noticeable. But once you've found this place you will find it's a lovely spot and I hope they will be around for a very long time."
11/18/2018,5 star rating,"Just came here for brunch with my toddler daughter and in-laws. Delicious food, generous portions, attentive service and very kids friendly. Great coffee too! It's hard to find that combination, so I'll definitely be coming back.I recommend the shrimp and grits with the salmon cake. Really hit the spot.Be warned though, it's cash only!"
6/17/2018,2 star rating,"Came here for brunch this afternoon. Very cute, chill place however, the service and food definitely needs work. After my party and I (just the 2 of us) seated ourselves, it took someone at least 15 minutes to acknowledge us and take our order. The place was not super busy either. Maybe they were understaffed.  The food was okay. The bananas for my french toast was served in a small Tupperware container. That was a first. The kitchen staff may need more training because both me and my party found bits of paper in our food while we were eating, the wrapping was not properly taken off the waffle or French toast bread before cooking it? It was a weird experience and I made sure to let our waitress know. She apologized and asked if there was anything they could do but by then our food was mostly eaten so we just wanted to leave so we paid and left. Unfortunately, we won't be returning."
4/29/2017,4 star rating,"This was my first time here, it's conveniently located near my home, so I decided to give it a shot. Man was I happy I did. The food was great! I went in the afternoon which at that time was empty expect for a few people. The decor is very relaxing and nice, perfect for getting q bite and to chill. I sat at the bar and Jennifer attended me. Very nice and sweet, she guided me on my order and made the experience much more enjoyable. Food took awhile to arrive but was well worth the wait! It was freshly cooked and tasted way better than what I have hoped for. The prices are a bit expensive but you are paying for quality food here. I highly recommend this place and also recommend you try the Farmer's Skillet. Definitely will be coming back to try other items on the Menu!"
11/21/2015,2 star rating,"After being seated, we were ignored for 15-20min while the restaurant was not busy. After finally ordering (once we asked someone), we didn't receive our drinks immediately afterwards.  But at least once the food was ready, our drinks arrived at the same time. Throughout our meal, the waitress was inattentive, rude, and uncaring.Food-wise, the omelette/frittata was delicious. The yams weren't fully cooked, biscuits and crab cakes were so-so. The young man who was the busser was EXCELLENT! He was constantly refilling water and checking in, with a polite and genuine attitude. He should be promoted ASAP and given a raise. The wait staff could learn a lot from him."
1/23/2018,5 star rating,"While visiting NY in November, we chose to stop by Home Sweet Home for breakfast, which was recommended by my sister from her prior trip.  What a pleasant time my husband and I had.  We had an exceptionally delish omelette and pancakes.  We got a chance to speak with the owner, who took the time to stop by our table and ""chat"".  The staff was very attentive and very warm.  I would say, don't miss a chance to dine at Home Sweet Home.  It will always be on our list of eateries while in NY because...  who comes to town and doesn't see family!?  That's what this visit was like.  Simply delightful.  Thanks for adding to our East Coast visit."
8/5/2018,4 star rating,"Great food!!  While they don't have any pork on the menu they have turkey alternatives which is a relief. Still not very veggie friendly. The main brunch items are either $15 for straight food item or $23 which includes a Mimosa or Bellini.  However, all items seemed to be meat centered.  I chose the Ala Carte and ""pieced"" my brunch together. The food was great! Don't forget the TIP was included. I would rate higher but the A/C was out.... it was a HOT Sunday Brunch day!"
11/5/2019,3 star rating,This place is quiet at times depending when you go. But the food is tasty. I like it because it's quiet and cozy. Went here with my boyfriend.  They have livecjazz music at times. Jazz it up have fun.
12/10/2019,5 star rating,"The food was SO good! I'm from the south and know good southern cooking. It was hard to choose because everything sounded so tempting, so I was gonna split two different dishes with my mom, but when my breakfast sandwich came, after a few bites I couldn't bear to share - and I love to share food! The grits. The biscuits. The gravy. It's all so satisfying, but not too heavy. They strike a great balance. I hope yelp as fixed the tech issues with their app/reservation system. It told us it was fully booked and wouldn't make a reservation, but we decided to go and wait in a line just in case because it looked so good. We'd heard from neighborhood friends the place is usually hopping and often there's a line out the door if you don't make a reservation. But when we got there, there were a LOT of open tables. The owner asked us about it actually when we mentioned - nice as she could be! - because they were surprised there wasn't more of a crowd on a Sunday afternoon, it's usually their busiest.It seemed that the issue with yelp reservations had been going on for a little while through their busiest season of the year but it was just coming to light what had happened. I hope yelp offered them some kind of compensation in addition to fixing the issue. It's a small family run restaurant, I've seen from experience how directly these kind of tech issues affect business."
12/7/2019,1 star rating,Disappointed in this restaurant thumbs down.The staff was very sweet but the owner has very bad customer service.We ordered food waited forever for it and then was told they ran out of salmon cakes.We asked could we have shrimp  or fish as a substitute because we do not eat meat. The owner said no after waiting 20 mins for a order that never came.Will not be back or recommend this place also the food was very mediocre.Its so sad when you try to support black businesses and then they give you their butt to kiss.
12/2/2018,3 star rating,"We came here on a Sunday around brunch time and were surprised to see there were a lot of empty spots, so we figured we were lucky and decided to eat here.First, we were not seated. Which I don't have a problem with other than the fact that the woman rudely gave us menus and gestured to an area to sit.Secondly, the service was HORRIBLE. The food was decent but the service alone would make me not want to come here again. We waited for so long to get our food and even when we finished we had to wait 30 mins just to pay the bill even though it wasn't that busy. I'd say, for the price, go somewhere else."
8/31/2016,5 star rating,Came across this wonderful place during my visit to Harlem. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing; the food is AMAZING and the mimosas are to die for. Will DEFINITELY be going back.

7/22/2018,5 star rating,This is such an amazing brunch place. It's a hole in the wall that has the BEST food! The scrambled eggs with cheese and the mimosas are to die for. Came here as a tourist and fell in love with the hospitality and the quality.

9/27/2015,2 star rating,"Terrible service, was extremely slow amd they forgot part of our order. This might be excused if the place was busy, but it was practically empty. The food was extremely over priced.  Something like 9 dollars for a side of bacon, and it came with 2 slices!!! The food was mediocre, not even close to make up for the issues listed above. I live in the area and was excited for a place like this to pop up. This pisses me off everytime i pass the block. It could be so much better."
7/23/2015,4 star rating,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR BREAKFAST. I can't speak to lunch or dinner, but the menu looked tasty, so I would definitely give it a go.Good sized portions at an affordable price - I got a croissant with egg and cheese (?) although I didn't see any cheese at all. The croissant was still flaky and good, and didn't make you feel totally crappy after eating it.We also got the salmon cakes, which were just okay. The salmon definitely tasted like canned fish, which is sort of what I was expecting, but was hoping I was wrong.The coffee is fairly good and comes with refills. If you order the fruit bowl, you won't be disappointed - really large portions compared to what you would expect!A fairly solid brunch option in Harlem."
12/2/2018,5 star rating,Excellent food. Very friendly service. William was a lovely server. Get the challah bread French toast!
9/8/2018,2 star rating,"I came with a couple of friends for Labor Day weekend lunch. The food was OK. I ordered their French toast brunch special, which came with a mimosa. I love French Toast, but I didn't enjoy this one. It was pretty undercooked so I ended up just eating the crust and pushing around the soggy middle. The turkey bacon tasted straight out of the freezer. The mimosa was alright, though. I'm definitely in no hurry to come back."
5/23/2014,5 star rating,"SOOO GOOD!!!!We all 4 people enjoyed our breakfast. The place was also very nice and nicely kept. I had a breakfast burrito that tasted so fresh and no heavy at all for an early meal. My friends had some scrambled eggs & turkey bacon, and pancakes, and they were so good that I had to try them as well... Let me tell you, I've eaten a lot of pancakes, but these were the best I had so far!We also met the owner and chef, she was a lovely person, and we appreciated so much the love she puts on her dishes :) will do definitely come back for the brunch!"
9/1/2016,5 star rating,"OMGoodness!!!! The food is so delicious and made with love. I feel like I'm visiting relatives on a warm summer's day, cool fall night, or holiday gathering!

11/11/2015,5 star rating,"I had brunch here today and was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was great, but the food was even better. Sunday brunch comes at a discounted price. My best friend got the French toast, I got the shrimp and grits & it was amazing!"

9/29/2018,5 star rating,"We had such a great time here!! My husband was working on the ""Antigone in Ferguson"" performance at the beautiful Harlem Stage, my daughter and I came to see the matinee. My husband had less than two hours before he had to go do the evening show, and so we tried Home Sweet Harlem, which I'd spotted from the M101. Firstly - everyone in the place was so lovely. We came at the very end of brunch (around 5 PM) and had truly delicious salmon cakes, fish and grits, scrambled eggs, biscuits, fresh squeezed orange juice and a pineapple ginger mint drink... SO GOOD. The room is pleasant & spacious, and apparently there's live music sometimes too. We live on the east side, but we will be back! YUM!!"
9/28/2019,5 star rating,"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating in. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the waitresses, especially Donna were super friendly. The coffee was rich and smooth, some of the best I've had. I had a frittata with potatoes and a salmon croquette and it was one of the most flavorful meals I've had. I also took advantage of their brunch special and enjoyed a few bellinis. 10/10 would definitely come back here and I would recommend it to any of my friends."

5/23/2016,5 star rating,"I visited this restaurant on a recent rip to NYC with my travel companion. It was our last meal before we were bound for JFK Airport. Surprisingly, this was one of the few brunch places that was open at 10am on a Sunday morning. LUCKY US! The restaurant was homely decorated and on a Sunday morning was staffed by one waitress and one cook. We ordered the farmers skillet and french toast challah (with greek yogurt) to share along with two coffees. The food was decently priced and sized and the food tasted wonderful. They even added hot frothy milk to the coffee, which truly upped the taste. So glad our last meal in NYC happened to be here and we will be sure to return when we are back in town!"
1/21/2016,3 star rating,"This place has a great atmosphere. Nice home-y vibe, it's a good go to. I've had the frittata, the yoghurt bowl, turkey bacon and eggs, and the breakfast burrito - my favorite was definitely the frittata. The morning yoghurt bowl is not a lot of food and you are paying quite a fair bit for it - especially compared to what you get in the frittata. I was definitely still hungry after finishing it. The turkey bacon and eggs AND the breakfast burrito is exactly what you would expect. I wasn't widely impressed and craved a little bit more creativity. To get : - frittata To skip:- yoghurt bowl"
3/25/2018,4 star rating,"This is a cool spot that's one of the few restaurants around that's north of 125th and south of 139th on Amsterdam.  Anyway there is a cool vibe here, I've only come here for breakfast but it's always good and they're always super attentive and friendly here.  Very nice people and they are building the business now with art, music, so that's great.  I had the omelette with home fries, all was good.  Looking forward to coming here when they have music nights.  They were playing cool music here too btw!"
11/8/2015,2 star rating,The service was excellent but my shrimp and grits were contaminated with old seafood water. Even my eggs. I asked the waitress to inform the cook and she brought out another plate in which it tasted the same. My friend and I were sick when we left.
8/26/2017,2 star rating,I had brunch here with some friends on a Saturday. We were looking forward to it based on the Yelp reviews. It was not very busy when we arrived around 11:30am. The waitress was very nice to us when taking our orders but then the trouble began. We had to wait a very long time for our meals. We didn't order anything fancy just brunch stuff like pancakes and french toast. When our food finally arrived it was missing many of the side pieces that we had to reorder. The challah french toast was burnt and the turkey bacon was hard. The staff wasn't even very apologetic. I will not return and I'd tell my friends to go elsewhere.
9/13/2016,4 star rating,I found this place by searching for shrimp and grits through Yelp. This little restaurant was right around the corner from me and did not disappoint. The decor is nice and chic and clean. The staff were young and friendly and knowledgeable about the surrounding areas. The chef in particular was very friendly and made the best meal I had in my entire week stay while in New York. My first stop will be here when I return.
7/22/2018,5 star rating,Went for brunch- food was delicious and service was very helpful and welcoming!  They have live music some nights as well. Great atmosphere.
9/10/2019,1 star rating,Went to this place because it had 4 stars but we did not get 4 start service. We came on a Saturday morning the manager said that the only two top we have and directed us to a high table in the corner we sat and waited ten minutes before getting a menu. The manager was screaming about how he didn't understand people and why they are so impatient that they are short handed and people need to understand that. It should have been a red flag for us to leave but we came a long way so we waited. Long story short we ordered we waited and the food came out burnt and dry it was gross. Not worth the wait or the drive!
3/20/2015,5 star rating,"I never leave 5 stars. Never. It's hard to imagine that a restaurant couldn't be better, but I can't find anything wrong with Home Sweet Harlem. It's not fast food so don't expect your food to be ready as fast as Chipotle.The people are warm, welcoming and the food is amazing. The owner came to speak with us to make sure we enjoyed our meal and we ended up talking for 20 minutes about Harlem. I've been twice and the food has been incredible both times. Hot out the kitchen and delicious. My favorite so far have been the salmon cakes but everything I've had has been really really good. Go, you won't be disappointed."
7/21/2019,5 star rating,"What a beautiful place to get brunch! The waiters were very kind and patient! We had the French toast  which was absolutely BOMB soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. It was not overpoweringly sweet which was great! Then we had the omelette the eggs and they had the perfect amount of cheese in it. Grits had a bit of butter on the top of it and melted really well into the grits. They didn't get hard from sitting out while we were eating our other food so that's great! The only thing that was weird was the orange juice. It seemed like there may have been one bad orange when they juiced it because there was just something a bit off about it. Maybe they didn't label the date on it when they put it in the fridge but it happens. A really great thing about this place was that in their menu they tell you that there is an 18% tip included. I value places that value their employees. Overall very friendly, warm, and welcoming environment! Will come back again!"

We were like okay we'll have it with no kale. 5 minutes after he comes and he is like sorry there's no fruits! Mind you is before 12PM, why aren't you guys stocked with everything you need in order to run an appropriate service. As a business owner you should make sure you have every ingredient in order to provide a good service. My meal was supposed to come with potatoes and It didn't. Personally I wouldn't visit again. And to top it all off!!! We we tried to pay the credit card machine wasn't working and they didn't let us know ahead! Oh nah I'm out"

8/25/2019,2 star rating,"Visited upon reviews and observed servers to he exceedingly untrained, which makes sense because tips are added so they don't have to earn them.  On Sunday am arrived at 11:15 and place was not packed but one table left because of travel plans and delayed service.  Observed a table seated before me get food much later than I did.  Observed servers to be scrambling instead of moving with order and purpose.  All of this would be fine if the food were exceptional, but it was not.  I suspect this is popular only because of the dearth of choices.  Biscuits are very dry with no butter or jam...avoid"
6/6/2015,2 star rating,Disappointing. I read the good reviews and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the challah french toast which wasn't too good. It tasted and looked like it wasn't soaked enough in the batter. Boyfriend had omlette which was luke warm. Server was sweet and friendly but took a few tries before she got our order correct. Cappuccino lacked froth. Nice decor but wouldn't come back because food was mediocre.
8/24/2019,5 star rating,Great restaurant with a nice vibe. The food was amazing and our server William made the experience even better. My next visit to NY will definitely include a trip to Home Sweet Harlem!
3/5/2017,1 star rating,"If I can give this place a zero I would. Most awful inattentive service ever! Really a shame since the food looked so good but we didn't even get a chance to eat because service was EXTREMELY SLOW! My friend and I waited for at least 15 mins to get someone's attention to get us seated. It was around 2 pm so it was pretty full in there but not packed like other brunch spots. The waitress finally sat us.. then we waited. We tried to get someone's attention to at least get us water and nothing. We gave it more time and tried to be patient 25 mins later without anyone coming to us we decided to just leave, if it is this slow to get water, I can't imagine how long it would take to get our orders taken and get our food."
6/29/2019,2 star rating,"Because the name was Home sweet Harlem is the reason that I wanted have brunch here.  The coffee came out cold, service was suboptimal, the worst thing was the waiter trying to charge me for something that we didn't order.   They got a two rateing because the food was not too bad."
12/15/2015,5 star rating,Home Sweet Harlem is a nice cozy spot filled with art and a nice home feel. The food is great! The prices are amazing as well. I recommend the shrimp and grits or the fish and grits with salmon cakes. The food is very fresh and the service is great.
3/21/2015,4 star rating,"I had the Challah French Toast, with 2 eggs and Turkey Bacon. The meal was yummy, the staff was friendly. My fiancé was a bit disappointed by the sandwich options for brunch (he's not really a breakfast person) and wished they had a chicken sandwich option of some sort .Overall, good experience, though."
3/11/2015,1 star rating,"You would get better food, ambiance, and service if I were serving you from my own kitchen.  Which really makes me feel bad for writing this because it seems like it was their first venture into the restaurant business for whoever opened this place.  First tip off, their menus looked like they were printed on an office or home printer, I'm talking 8.5x11 paper that was all crinkly because a bunch of people touched it.  While our party of 6 was seated relatively quickly considering it was Sunday brunch, half the table got water glasses and utensils, while it took the waiter 30minutes to give the rest of the table their place settings.  They ran out of museli and had to sub for steel cut oats (but we were still charged for the museli), the shrimp on the shrimp with grits were those really small, no texture, is this really shrimp, kind of shrimp, the pancakes were flat and all sorts of weird shapes and oh yea, we also found a HAIR in the pancakes... one of those pubic looking hairs!In any case we were not compensated at all for the inadequacies in service.  They even left stuff on the bill that they neglected to serve us that we ended up telling them we didn't want anyway since it took over 45min to get our food initially.  Whats worse we were automatically billed for gratuity."
4/8/2017,5 star rating,Found a new favorite brunch spot in my hood! So excited I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it did not disappoint! I got the farmers skillet  and it was delicious! They gave a great amount of food and everything was so flavorful! I also really loved the old school down south decor! I will definitely be back!!!
4/8/2017,1 star rating,"Service is slooow on a packed Saturday brunch day. 15 min to get coffee. Another 45 min to get food. I ordered a Farmer's Skillet that was dried up and over salted (and isn't it supposed to be served in a skillet?). The salad was old and limp. My boyfriend ordered the muesli, not warm like we expected, but COLD! Dry oats in a bowl with fruits took 45 min to make? Menu doesn't even specify that it's not cooked. Anything with oatmeal, people will assume is hot. And we weren't given a disclaimer by the server. The waitress (owner?) was unapologetic and made it seem like we were in the wrong, pushing us to order something else when the meal should've been comped after making us wait for so long. Also, the waiter never followed through on getting me ketchup and hot sauce. Furthermore, the same waitress asked us if were leaving when we just got in. Like, you don't even know your own customers? Not even that huge of a restaurant. The bathroom is disgusting and if it was in that state I don't even want to see the kitchen!"
3/20/2017,5 star rating,The food was absolutely delish...I went on a Sunday for brunch and got one complimentary Bellini. My server was really nice and made a great suggestion. I had the home skillet with grits and salmon patty. It was plenty of food. They also have bottomless mimosas and bellinis but I didn't have time to stay and enjoy.

The food was great and the mimosa that came with the meal was perfect! Definitely a nice calm family or friend get together spot - not for the turn up. Had the turkey and cheese omelette.

Took home half my food ate it hours later and it was still delicious... I love breakfast and they serve breakfast all day in addition to lunch and dinner. My co-worker had the the shrimp creole and cleaned her plate. Another co-worker had the salmon cakes, she didn't even share because they were so good. Healthy soulful cooking. Music in the bathroom is a plus  We will definitely return."
2/15/2017,5 star rating,"Wow. We went on a Sunday for brunch and the food was amazing! We had the home skillet and Farmers skilled with sweet potatoes! Perfect amount of food and tasted amazing. The coffee was also very good. The unlimited booze seems like a good option as well, but we weren't in the mood to drink that morning. Highly recommend this place! Service was fast and great as well, and we didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday around 11am. We will be back!"

2/14/2016,4 star rating,When I visit NY I'm always looking for something different and local. You will love this place for brunch.  Very southern and very good.  I had the salmon scampi with poached eggs.  I will return when I visit again.  The service was excellent too.
5/21/2018,5 star rating,"Blown away by the shrimp n grits dish. You get: Shrimp n grits, eggs n cheese, salmon croquet, salad w vinegrette, AND a sangria. Ambiance was cute. Chef was personable. The waitstaff could use speeding up but when they do serve you it's high quality attention."

8/20/2014,2 star rating,"Went on a Saturday for Brunch.Atmosphere: Simple and inviting. Crowd was mostly people in their 20s. Service: It took the waiter over 5 minutes to come talk to us. The food took a while to come and the place wasn't even busy. We also didn't get water till after being there for 10 minutes and our coffee came at the same time as our food.  We had to ask our waiter to bring us ketchup and salt for our food and sugar and milk for our coffee. I understand the ketchup, but bringing sugar for the coffee should be common sense. What made it even worse is that he took the sugar from the table next to us and the people were still eating. One of the ladies from that table later asked for sugar for her coffee and the waiter then took the sugar from our table and gave it back to the other table. Do they only have one sugar container? The waiter wasn't rude but just slow and maybe a little lost.Food: We had the frittata and the griddle cakes. The food was really good and flavorful. No complaints here. If I had to rate just the food they would get 4 stars but the service brought it down to 2.Overall this place has potential as long as they train their staff."
1/6/2017,5 star rating,"The food here is lush. That's the only way to describe biting into a biscuit with the perfect amount of crispness on the crust and moist flakiness on the inside. I had the best New Year's Day brunch with Ma, Baby Sis and my 7 month old prodigy for a nephew. We arrived late afternoon. But the staff accommodated us supremely well for what was one of their busiest days. The owner is sweet and the food here is so good: fresh, quality ingredients with perfect seasoning, that Baby Sis decided to plan my birthday party there for this spring. It's that good."
1/28/2015,5 star rating,Amazing food! Grits and omletes are amaze balls! Colby was our waiter and we had such great service
2/6/2015,4 star rating,"I had the shrimp and grits.  Partner had the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.  Food was delicious, and service was very attentive.  The decor looks much brighter and inviting than it did when it was La Pregunta Cafe.  Will definitely return.  The brunch comes with a mimosa, bellini, or bloody mary."
8/23/2014,1 star rating,"Having read the reviews and seen the menu, I had very high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, I was let down in so many ways, and in fact, I'm surprised any established or well-liked restaurant has the issues I experienced.I can't even comment on the food, and here's why: WE NEVER GOT IT.Arrived a little before 10 on a Saturday for brunch. The lady at the front was very welcoming, and told us to sit anywhere. The place was pretty full. After a few minutes of not being brought menus, I noticed everyone had a colorful one on their tables, so I realized we had to go pick up our own. Fine, no big deal. Until water came and our orders were taken, though, it was a good 15-20 minutes.We put our orders in and had plenty of time to watch how things were going down. For some reason there was only one waiter serving the whole restaurant - probably about 10-12 tables which were all full. Here's a sample of what we saw: condiments/salt and pepper not being brought; people served food without utensils on the table; at the same table, one of the three diners not being served with the others; at another table, a party of six that had two people waiting 15 minutes to be served while the rest of their group ate; no refills on coffee; people being served before us despite coming in after us; tables left messy with the plates/napkins/glasses of previous diners. You get the idea.Inexplicably, there was one waiter for the whole dining room. Apparently he was also meant to act as the bus boy. Occasionally the woman at the front came around to bring things, but she soon disappeared - we discovered she wound up in the back cooking. Two men - ""the cavalry"" as she called them - arrived at about 11 to ""help."" They didn't help us. Our water and coffee were never refilled. After waiting over an hour, I was getting fed up. Slow service is one thing. Nonexistent service is quite another. I was hungry already, having run in the 5K that took place in the neighborhood and finishing two hours prior. We made a decision to leave if our food didn't come within five minutes. Then, for the first time since taking our order at about 10:20 (it was now 11:10), the waiter came over and apologized but apparently our orders never made it into the system.Say no more. I told him we had to go and would just pay for the coffee. He told us how much it was, took our money, and just as we were saying we really shouldn't have to pay for the coffee, he brought the money back and said it was on them. It's really a shame because there seemed to be potential there, but under no circumstances have I ever experienced such abhorrent service. No one was incompetent per se, and the staff was friendly, but they were totally understaffed and overwhelmed. You'd think for a place that opens at 8 for breakfast and brunch, that by 10, they'd be hitting their stride. Nope, not even close. Very, very disappointing, to say the least. I won't be willing to give them a second chance.In rereading reviews from others and having had similar experiences relating to service, I'm shocked by how many people were told or wrote that the place was understaffed. Then why hasn't this changed? Makes no sense whatsoever.The best thing was we found another place on Broadway - Trufa - that was perfect. Delicious food with friendly, caring, passionate service. That's in the next review I'll write."

My husband and I dropped in for a late breakfast and was extremely pleased with what we experienced. Aside from food prepared to perfection and good music to dine to, Home Sweet Harlem has a warm and welcoming ambiance with fresh flowers on each table and Donna the proprietor reminding you of your favorite aunt!"
12/30/2015,4 star rating,"Had breakfast here on a sleepy work day morning. Cute restaurant with a very chill vibe. Ordered the farmers skillet frittata with a side of roasted potatos and salmon cakes. My breakfast was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Frittata came out hot and bubbly and the potatoes were perfectly cooked and crispy the way i like them. Salmon cakes were fresh, obviously homemade and not overly breaded. The owner, Donna, was extremely sweet and came over to introduce herself. Great find! I'll be back to try Sunday brunch.  For those particularly interested in supporting small and local businesses in the area, support Home Sweet Harlem."

6/6/2015,5 star rating,"Our server, Donna, was just the sweetest lady ever. She made sure we had everything we needed and just made this such a beautiful dining experience. The food was just amazing. Grits are extremely creamy and delectable. The biscuits were buttery and flaky. The omelette was fresh and was made with high quality ingredients. I also ordered the fruit smoothie which was SO GOOD. So many textures and flavors. Overall, it's safe to say that this is one of the best places I've eaten at during my stay in New York. Definitely a must have!"

I'm an avid foodie and Evens (our waiter) was able to answer all my questions efficiently and politely.

3/10/2018,5 star rating,"Went to Home Sweet Harlem for the first time in late February. Group of 11, for brunch at 11AM.Everything was so good and everyone had a great time. We were given a great spot. Moderately crowded, but we never felt like it took long to get anything.We all ordered the ""unlimited mimosas"" for an hour. Took just a bit to get the initial drinks, but after we did, we never went dry. Multiple servers and staff refilled out drinks throughout the hour. The food came up quickly, and was delicious. There was one small mistake in someone's dish, but they were super nice about it and corrected it quickly.The entire group loved the place. The owner even came out to greet us and ask us how we were doing. And one of the staff sang a little ""It's Raining Men"" to us. Delightful. Heavy rec."
12/9/2014,5 star rating,"This is a fabulous place to sit and work. The staff is warm and generous and the food is great. I just combined the vegetable sides for my lunch and it was fabulous.

6/19/2016,2 star rating,"We had little choice on a Sunday morning at 9:00 am but they assured me they could accommodate gluten free, as I have Celiac Disease. When I made reservations I double checked, saying it was not a choice for me but a disease.  I was told what I could and could not order which made me feel very comfortable. I reminded my server when we got there, who I had the feeling was also a manager or owner, about my serious gluten free status. Yet, when I received my meal, which was marked ""Gluten Free"" right on the menu, a frittata, salad and roasted yams, there was a biscuit on it. She had said the biscuits were not gluten free and all my gluten-eating companions also had biscuits. I called her over, quietly explained that since the biscuit was touching the salad and frittata the plate was contaminated and I needed a new meal, not just the same food on a new plate. My ""new meal"" seemed to come too quickly in comparison to how long it took the first time; however it wasn't busy, so I didn't question it. As I ate, I grew suspicious. Three hours later I grew sick--gluten toxicity sick. Please be aware that the two stars does not fully reflect my negative gluten experience. I only would have given the brunch three stars, as confirmed by my co-diners who ranged in age from 22-60. The bathroom was not clean when the restaurant opened! There were only three other tables there in the two hours we were there eating. The decor was not cohesive and oddly, worst, the TV was playing this God-awful ""Easy Listening"" music, that was so bad we laughed about each song that was played.If you have Celiac Disease, stay away. If you don't and you aren't fussy, go but don't expect much."
10/7/2018,2 star rating,"Overpriced and gratuity is charged automatically even in takeout. The food itself isn't of the greatest quality either.

I will definitely be back."
9/24/2014,3 star rating,"The place was completely empty, so my bf and I were skeptical. When the salad came out, my hopes rose! Usually you get a dry crusty boring salad with your entree, this salad was perfect with just enough delicious homemade dressing, sprouts, cranberries, and leafy greens (not iceberg :) ! The food was good, not GREAT. (mushroom ravioli, chicken dish, shrimp appetizer) The shrimp was the best dish.  I definitely want to go back for breakfast! The staff was excellent! Since we were the only ones there, the chef/owner even dimmed the lights and turned up the music after noting how ""romantic"" we looked in the corner. It was a nice touch haha."
10/31/2014,2 star rating,We came in and owner was sitting at the bar with a T shirt on. Friendly service but unprofessional. Orange juice was supposed to be freshly squeezed but tasted old and for $4 a small champagne flute I would expect to hear oranges being squeezed. Sausage cheese croissant came with out cheese. The feta cheese omelette came with a hair so we returned a couple minutes later owner came to ask if every thing was to our liking. Really! New feta and spinach omelette had egg shells in it. Nice place burnt he owner needs to work on performance.

8/24/2014,2 star rating,"First off,  1 whole star goes only to the biscuit.  Very delicious,  probably the best I've ever had. That being said,  let's get to it... Walking in,  aside from the awkward staring of the regulars,  the half eaten plate of food on the dirty table being the first thing we saw became an eye sore in what was such a beautiful restaurant. We were not greeted when we walked in but that was because there was no host,  no bussers,  no waitstaff...  Everyone just did whatever.  Our table was taken care of by two separate people so we didn't know who was going to collect the tip. We asked for coffee when we first sat down but didn't get it until much later (about 15 minutes).  I was already halfway through the water I received,  taking note that our glasses are the only waters without ice. When we did get the coffee,  we got it with whole milk (which the sweet waitress asked us what kind,  but gave us no options) but as I discovered that no one remembered to give us sugar with the coffee and sent the waitress to get some,  my date found things swimming in the milk. The waitress apologized immediately and fixed the problem right away.  About 10 minutes later,  that table with the half eaten food was cleared by the bartender,  but the table was never wiped down until the next couple took the table. I ordered the full breakfast ($20) while my girlfriend ordered the farmers skillet ($12). When the food came to us I couldn't help but notice that the farmers skillet was an omelete (there was no mention of eggs on the menu) with chopped sausage (probably not a whole link) not on a skillet,  but on a regular plate and looked exactly like my plate with the exception of the salmon cake and orange juice (portions were almost the same and still very small considering the price).  The salmon cake was about 1.5 inches in diameter,  bone dry, dusty and the orange juice was in a champagne flute ($8 extra?) the orange juice was very very fresh but the food was very lukewarm to cold.  Shame because the food was made with very fresh product,  well seasoned and probably would have been the saving grace to the sedimented milk for my coffee and the hair on my plate (absolutely no one wore a hat or hairnet), gross. The biscuit,  again,  very very tasty and probably the warmest thing on the plate,  not warm enough, though. I was halfway through my coffee and meal when that nice waitress came back to check on us. I said everything was fine to see if she would offer more coffee, but that was offered by a different person after I asked for a fourth time for the check.  Twice inconspicuously and twice directly and I watched them say okay,  then go off to do something else. The waitress did,  however apologize for the (extremely) slow service due to a large group that came in to eat.  However, that is not a good excuse for the secondhand service,  yet spoke volumes on her part as a front of house member,  because I didn't complain,  but no one was really hustling.  My patience ran out and I replied with ""I'm ready to go..."" when they forgot to bring the check and offered more coffee instead.  I was done by then, even finished my water to make it seem like I wasn't staring off into space waiting to pay and leave. When we left,  no one said ""thank you,  come back,  how was it?"" after seeing everyone who left get that treatment. So, we just walked out in this awkward silence with more stares from other customers... I think it could be a great restaurant,  it just lacks very much a team effort. Is hard to tell who was the host,  who was the barista,  I only guessed who was back of house by the aprons. The front of house also wore no uniforms with the exceptions of black shirts,  but some of them wore shirts with graphics,  jeans and Jordans, again,  no hats,  no nets and I couldn't catch anyone's eye because no one was watching the floor. I also hate to say it,  but I got a very big ""we don't belong"" feeling being there... The owner greeted everyone but us and there also a couple that came in thirty minutes later than we did and was served hot food earlier with ice water (in different glasses,  though) and left at the same time as us. I apologize to the restaurant and wish them the best of luck,  but I had a terrible experience and probably won't be coming back,  except maybe for the biscuits. Big, big maybe..."
5/17/2015,5 star rating,Stopped here this morning and the food was good. I had the shrimp and grits and I was not let down. Biscuits are delish!!!! I definitely recommend this place.
6/5/2016,4 star rating,"So this is probably my first review ever so here it goes.After trenching through the hill and steps of the park coming from the 135 C train station after work (Cipriani), first thing I thought was I need that Bellini now. So I get to Amsterdam and see the huge awning ""Home Sweet Harlem."" I get to the front door and I take one step in and everyone who was working there welcomed me like I literally came home to a good wife lol. So let's start talking about the consumption of foods. I started with sitting at the bar. The music though had me feeling nostalgic. I mean it was like being back in the New Jack Swing era. So I ordered the Bellini (they use a mango nectar and I forgot the champagne they use) and it was wonderful. I believe the person who served me said his name is Ben Frankenstein lol idk if he was telling the truth or not but he was funny and knowledgable of all types of Bellinis, mimosas, wines and beers (wish they had a full bar). I ordered the griddle cakes and maaaaaaaan let me tell you. Something good happened, patience came over me and said ""dress these babies up well."" Moist in the center, caramelized crunchy goodness on the outside...and they serve it with real maple syrup. So after I cleared that plate, my friend shows up finally and orders the fish and grits with a crab cake. Yoooooo it was wonderfully seasoned......everything maintained its natural flavor without being over powered by extra added seasonings. I got hungry again and ordered the cheese and fruit plate. Now I'm not gonna lie, you can't serve me like 7 cheeses and one slice of toast (different server at this time since Ben had to run some errands). Ben eventually came back and I asked him if I can have some more bread, homie gave me two slices of whole wheat toast and just thought, ""my man Sideshow Dynamite hooked me up"" (you'll get it when you visit the place). So yeah I'm definitely going back."

I had the French toast with eggs + turkey sausage. The Bellini is perfection. The staff is so warm and welcoming + it's black owned which is always a plus in my book! Happy Eating!"
12/2/2018,3 star rating,Food was good. Wait not so much. Waiter came and apologized for the wait which was appreciated.
9/21/2014,2 star rating,"I expected much more based on the reviews. Wasn't the worst food I ever had but for $12 I expected more than a palm sized portion of dry frittata and 10 chunks of roasted potato (which was the best part). Frittata tasted as if it had been cooked the previous day, very dry. The ""biscuit"" was more like a thin, dry puck and with the exception of the potatoes, nothing tasted seasoned. My friend got the challah french toast which was unfortunately undercooked. For $12, again, you get 2 slices of French toast and a dollop of melted whipped cream which seems a bit much since there were no potatoes, no eggs, no fruit, etc. We left hungry and a bit peeved. Tried to act as if it wasn't as disappointing as it was because it looked like the owners and staff were the only other people in there with us. I had such high hopes...maybe we came on a bad day (but noon on a Sunday? C'mon, you have to do better than that). There's so much great brunch in Harlem that Home Sweet Harlem can't even compete (probably why its consistently empty)."
5/21/2017,5 star rating,"I'm from CT and I'm often in the City for leisure and dining.  I flew in this morning from GA and wanted to get something to eat before heading home to CT. I googled Breakfast in NY and Home Sweet Harlem was one of the top 5 choices. I based my decision on the menu alone as I knew we both wanted grits. It was easy to find,  great atmosphere, excellent customer service, and most importantly the food was PHENOMENAL. I had the shrimp and grits and he had the fish and grits. Hands down the best we have ever had and we travel frequently and I'm so happy that we stumbled  upon Home Sweet Harlem. I will definitely be back and highly recommend. The coffee was great as well as the bellini mimosa. They offer Breakfast, lunch and diner. I would love to try lunch and diner and most likely will in the near future. I'd I could give them 10 Stars I would. Lastly prices and proportions are just right. I loved the garnish of fresh spring mix  as well."
3/22/2016,4 star rating,This is my first review and my first restaurant that I've stopped in since I moved to harlem from Newark. This is a very charming place with delicious drinks. The atmosphere was very inviting with many nice people. If this restaurant is indicative of harlem then I'm glad I moved here.
7/30/2017,5 star rating,"First time here and i was truly impressed. Having a degree in Hospitality Management and working in the industry for 12+ yrs I'm very skeptical of new restaurants especially ""mom and pop"" places but Home Sweet Harlem exceeded my expectations. The chef Khalif was AMAZING. Not only did he make an exceptional meal, he also came out to the table, greeted and talked to me and my guest and told us of the different events the restaurant holds. The service was phenomenal food was everything and i really enjoyed myself. I will definitely be back.... with friends."
4/27/2014,5 star rating,"The staff was super friendly and my meal was delicious. I got the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit with the roasted garlic and rosemary potatoes. I've never had a breakfast sandwich that tasted so good. They use Canadian cheddar and OMG, it was out of this world. My friend got the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and she was also thrilled. I'll definitely be back!"
5/29/2014,5 star rating,"Went here for my last meal in NYC with my roommates. We lived right around the corner for two years and never ventured inside Home Sweet Harlem. Oh man, am I regretting that right about now! I ordered the mango lemonade to drink - and it was outrageously good. Like, I want another right now just thinking about it. Then I ordered the chipotle shrimp with rice which was out of this world delicious. The owner made it herself on the spot because she hadn't yet taught the cook how to make the dish. It was $16 but there were at least 10-12 shrimp and around 1/2 cup of rice, all of which were impeccably seasoned - all in all, a very reasonable price. My roommates had a provolone and brie grilled cheese sandwich ($6) and a burger ($8 or $11, can't remember). Both guys were totally satisfied. I tasted the grilled cheese and couldn't believe how delicious it was. We had a chance to chat with the owner and one of the servers and really enjoyed getting to know them. They informed us that they will soon be getting a full liquor license, will start accepting city college meal points, and have a catering menu as well as occasional open mic events. Also, you can order whole pies (sweet potato or pecan) as well as individual pie slices, dulce de leche, and various pastries. They also have takeout and are joining seamless and grubhub, which would be so awesome for this area especially considering the lack of options in the neighborhood. Amazing!!On top of it all, the atmosphere was comfortable and cozy. I imagine it would be a great place for a date as well as a great study spot - free wifi!!!!I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed. Undoubtedly the best choice for a high quality, leisurely sit down meal in the area."
9/18/2016,1 star rating,"Sitting in the restaurant, been here for almost an hour with my family and we have no food, no coffee, or the drinks ordered.  The wait is insanely long and there is almost no one here!  Service is so slow.  Definitely never coming back."
4/26/2017,5 star rating,Really cute neighborhood restaurant with awesome home-style cooking. Barron Frankenstein was a great server!
7/10/2017,4 star rating,"I ordered an egg, cheese, & turkey sausage croissant. The croissant was light, fluffy, and delicious. I also ordered a green juice but the texture was more of a green smoothie. I enjoyed the light banana flavor in the drink. Great customer service."
7/5/2017,4 star rating,"Got the smoked turkey with Brie and spicy mayo on the 5 grain bread.  It was pretty good.  They only take cash but will reimburse you the ATM fee if you go next door and use the ATM and bring back the receipt.  The service was very friendly and the prices were pretty good.  I went with some coworkers and three of us ordered sandwiches.  The wait was a bit long, but other than that everything else was great!"
1/12/2014,2 star rating,"Oh, Home Sweet Harlem, how I wanted to love you.  After my second time here, I realize that we are not meant to be.  I really dislike posting negative review unless I feel very strongly about them and after this evening's experience, sadly, I do.I've been here twice.  Once on the day before Thanksgiving, when their gas had not yet been turned on, and the second time was this afternoon.  A friend and I decided to get tea and an early dinner.  I suggested Home Sweet Harlem since everyone was so nice and welcoming the first time I had been.  I'll talk about both experiences, but first I want to say that I really REALLY want this place to work, but honestly, a few things need to change.  So, my first time there was during a rainy weekday on the eve of Thanksgiving.  It was empty except for one other customer at the counter but I didn't think much of it considering the time and the day.  I needed a place to do some work and was hoping to get some good coffee and a snack.  I ended up ordering a cappuccino along with the soup and salad combo.  The coffee was not good-strong yet flavorless and the milk wasn't really steamed.  The split pea soup was really really tasty and hit the spot, but the sandwich was just some cold cut turkey with cranberry mayo on stale-ish bread.  Meh.  What I did like about  my visit there was how friendly the waiter and the owner were.  Also, it's a spacious place and really has LOTS of potential.  I had planned to go back soon, but wasn't able to, until today...Same waiter, and place was also empty.  I guess we did go at an odd hour, at around 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  The brunch rush, if there was one, was over and it's not dinner time.  I had some tea and we ordered food.  I had the split pea soup again, which was good and the tuna/avocado/sprout sandwich, which was subpar.  It seemed as though the ingredients had been thrown together, with the sprouts hanging out on what was supposed to be toasted sourdough, yet it was cold.    My friend had a turkey burger with mushrooms and sautéed onions.  The burger was also cold.  Did I mention we were the only ones in there?I'm not sure if they were closing, though I'm fairly positive they weren't, but the music wasn't on and the waiter hovered for way too long.  It felt like we were being watched.  The music finally came on towards the end of our meal.  My friend didn't want to complain but did say the burger was cold when the waiter asked how everything was.  He attempted to make good by offering my friend a piece of sweet potato pie on the house, but really, they should have offered to remove the burger from the bill.  The waiter seemed somewhat annoyed after that and I had to say thank you before he did.  Perhaps taking something off the bill wasn't in his power.  My friend was feeling a bit ill afterwards, too.  Not good.All in all, it's the little things AND the big things, Home Sweet Harlem.  Music is important always.  It was drafty in there as well.  And if you mess up, try harder to make good with the customer.  There is never a good reason for stale bread or a cold burger.  Please get better!  You are lovely, but the food and service need improvement.  PS:  I debated a lot about whether to give one star or two.  I'm giving two because I know you can do better and have hope that you will."
10/1/2016,5 star rating,Place is dope. The food is amazing. Also went in on a Friday night for karaoke which was awesome. If there is anything I suggest you try is their fish and grits and for dessert their sweet potatoe pie. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
2/15/2014,5 star rating,"Had a craving for a good hot chocolate in the middle of a snow day. Yelp said this restaurant was right around the corner, and it looked cute, so the wife and I went on over.I must say, the pictures don't do it justice. Home Sweet Harlem is trendy, upscale, and everyone that works there is quite friendly. Bonded with Pete, one of the managers, over our new puppy. He even offered to watch our dog when we go out of town. It just felt like we walked in out of the snow to a long-lost friend's apartment.Hot chocolates were delicious, made with proper bittersweet chocolate and almond milk option (YEAH!). Also ordered dinner (Salmon Burger, and Wings+Potatoes) which were both delicious.Looking forward to going back with friends for brunch. Delighted to have a restaurant of this quality so close to our apartment. Keep up the good work, Home Sweet Harlem!"
3/31/2014,4 star rating,"Of the many times I've been here, I've yet to have a truly 4-star experience. But I keep coming back. And I'm giving them 4 stars because of the potential awesomeness Home Sweet Harlem can achieve.I am obsessed with the soup, the soup of the day is made fresh in the morning so there's no set schedule or rotation, just really great soup whenever you decide to pop in. My favorites are mushroom barley and the carrot ginger. My boyfriend and very picky friend both really enjoyed their turkey chili soup. Honestly, the majority of the good rating was achieved by the incredible soup.The sandwiches are made with fresh ingredients, and I think they're organic as well? I don't know, just tastes wonderful. Anything with the ground turkey such as the soups and burgers will likely be a winner. Morningside Burger and the St Nicholas Park are the very best and I'm glad the waiter recommended them.Speaking of the waitstaff, they are all nothing but super nice and welcoming. It's just a real shame that there's only one person working there at any given shift, and if you're really unlucky as I am prone to be, you'll get there when a rookie is there by themselves. I just make sure I'm not in any rush if I want to pop in for lunch at Home Sweet Harlem, as in have at least 1-2 hours to spare. And then there's a lot of the little things, like bringing utensils before I get my soup so I'm not drooling over it while I wait for a spoon, refilling water, etc.I have to reiterate that they're all extremely nice and at times they're very understaffed so you could be neglected during those times, definitely have a lot of empathy for them when it's busy. I'm confident with time and more experience or hiring people with waiting experience, it'll be much better.If you've come here and had a bad experience service-wise, I'd say come back and give it another shot because the service does continue to improve, albeit slowly.If you've never been here, get some goddamn soup before winter is over and your soup cravings go away and you live a year of regret. You'll want to try the amazing soup at Home Sweet Harlem, but it's warm out and you're not craving soup, but it's so delicious and all anyone talks about, what do you do, wait until next winter?! You don't want to go through that.I'm a soup year-round kind of girl so I won't struggle with that dilemma, I'm just looking out for you guys."
3/1/2014,2 star rating,"We came here on the recommendation of a colleague who hosted an event at this location.  They posted some great pictures of the food so we said we'd try it out.   When we got in, the place wasn't half full - so immediately we just knew we'd get great service and quickly because they weren't overrun.  Clearly, we came in on a day that they may have been short a staff member or two.  The service was very slow.  As a result of being made to wait, I had enough time to observe a number of things I didn't like. My mimosa came to my table half full, but I observed someone on another table get one that was overflowing it's glass.  Another couple was quite vocal in their displeasure at being made to wait and also getting their order wrong.  One of the food handlers did not have on a hair net and she exited the establishment with the gloves she was using in the kitchen.... and returned with them on.    (Where in God's name did she go with those disposable gloves on and why couldn't she just... remove them?)  After waiting an hour - and don't get me wrong, when the waitress / cook (I have to assume this was Donna)  did come by, she offered many apologies about being short staffed and the wait (but didn't offer us anything FOR the wait - an extra drink, a piece of bread... nothing) - the shrimp and grits I ordered finally came.  It was warmish... and they cooked the shrimp in full shell.  This is a personal pet peeve of mine 1) i don't like to be reminded that shrimp are the roaches of the sea and nothing brings that home more than seeing their legs still on after cooking and 2) I wasn't into doing what I call ""arts and crafts"" with my  food where I have to get my fingers all involved.  I just wanted to eat at that point, but spent another 10 minutes shelling / scaling the shrimp. This place has SO much potential.  It's really cute, it's not designed in a way that makes it seems crowded with no one in it.  The people are extremely nice and the food is decent.  Now if the food was out of this world? I may have thought - well the wait was worth it.  But I can say I've had better.    In the restaurant industry if your food and service aren't the mainstays of your business - you don't really have much else. I pray that they'll pick up in these arenas.  I'd like to patronize again but not if it'll be like it was today."
3/25/2016,5 star rating,"Ok any bad review on this place is a joke. The person saying that colored people aren't welcome? The owner is a woman of color and their entire staff, from what I've seen, is very diverse. I am shocked that anyone would say that. It is NOT accurate at all. Ok the food is great. It's the only place in the immediate area that has good food. My boyfriend lives on the next block and it's the only place we'll eat without going on the train up/down town. I am a huge fan of the cholla bread french toast. The orange juice and lemonade are both homemade and so great. I ate half of my french toast and my boyfriend finished it because I was full. The owner was sitting nearby and came over and asked if I didn't like it and if I wanted something else. Explained that I loved it but was just very full. It's very quiet in the morning (never been there at night) and it's a great place to just relax. The food takes a little bit to come out but once it does it's super fresh and delicious. It's nice not to feel rushed. I would recommend this to anyone in the area to try it out!!!"
3/22/2014,5 star rating,"After an unexpected night out I needed a good hearty brunch. I knew there wasn't anything right in my neighborhood so I took a peek on yelp and saw Home Sweet Harlem wasn't too far. I'm so glad we ended up here because it was FABULOUS. The staff was attentive (if a little nervous/worried), the food was freshly made, came out warm, and was filling without being heavy. And of course I really appreciated that they had multiple dairy-free options (including soy and almond milk). They answered our questions patiently, including telling us that they've only been around for a few months. IT seems like they're still getting their rhythm down but it didn't impact our experience at all. I'm excited to come back and this is definitely my go/to brunch place from now on!"
3/23/2014,5 star rating,"I had heard about the place through a friend and wanted to try it.  I was surprised, my initial impression from the pictures and menu online was that it was a small cafe where I could grab a quick bite and some coffee.  I was pleasantly wrong.  The food was good, the staff attentive and the space calm and welcoming.Maybe I was weirdly early or cause it was because I was by myself but it was a bit awkward.  It's a great place that definitely needs to consider it's audience a bit more, especially since it's so close to city college but doesn't really have a menu or setup geared towards a commuter school.  Can't wait till they are a bit more grounded and ready, it will be great!!"
3/5/2017,5 star rating,Went 2/10/17 AND 2/11/17...so good I had to come back to back. More people came in on Sunday over Saturday but the service was still great and we got seated right away. The food was great and the mimosa that came with the meal was perfect! Definitely a nice calm family or friend get together spot - not for the turn up. Had the turkey and cheese omelette.
9/3/2014,4 star rating,"Great, reliable local spot! Really nice atmosphere, fine for casual dates, friends,  laid back happy hour for a glass of wine or a beer, family-welcome for kids, and awesome for meetings or study groups.Coffee is excellent, food ranges from pretty good to great. I recommend the chipotle shrimp (appetizer or entree)--slamming! The cheese plate during brunch was only OK, but everything else was solid."
5/10/2016,5 star rating,Awesome food and great service!  Get there early for good seating & to beat the crowd.
4/9/2014,5 star rating,I went in here with a friend during saturday brunch. We ordered the ham & cheese croissant and sausage& egg bisquits. Both were excellent! The staff was friendly and attentive. A true gem in harlem.  Chocolate lovers: try their chocolate wine.
4/22/2016,2 star rating,"I'm visiting NYC and I decided to check Yelp for good breakfast food nearby. I came to Home Sweet Harlem based off its 4 stars on Yelp. I strongly disagree with the 4 stars. The frittata tasted reheated, so I re ordered. The cook himself came out when I wanted to reorder, making the whole ordeal uncomfortable and over dramatic. The catfish was bland, and the grits were watery. Eggs were good. Best thing here is the mimosas. The waitress was good."
3/27/2014,4 star rating,"The food is amazing and fresh. Perfect joint for turkey burgers!! The st.nicholas must be my favorite, savory in every bite; (my previous time here was a fluke) hopefully it was just a bad day for the chef!!.Just had some griddle cakes and they cut so smoothly perfect with some turkey bacon. Nevertheless a new waitress has been hired  (in my opinion women are better at food service than males) which makes everything run so smoothly and fast. Soups? Soups galore!!. The chili soup is a must try I certainly enjoyed it too bad the soup isn't offered everyday and I still haven't gotten the hang of the soup schedule..."
8/10/2017,4 star rating,Feels like home. The waitstaff are sweethearts and the food comes f a s t. I had the veggie wrap and green smoothie-- it was delicious and healthy and served by the kindest woman a.k.a. by the end of the meal I felt ready to take on the world.
2/7/2017,5 star rating,"Me and my boyfriend came here for our first trip to New York and we loved it! Everything was good, the music was poppin ! And the service was like family! I would definitely absolutely come here again!"
12/12/2016,3 star rating,"Cute little place in Harlem. Standard breakfast fare, decent cappuccinos. My friend and I both got the French toast, which was a little bit too crispy for my taste, and a little to sweet for my friend's taste. The staff was incredibly nice and they were very attentive to things like bringing out more water, clearing plates very quickly, etc. Honestly, the place didn't make much of an impression, and I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but if I found myself in need of breakfast in the area, I'd go back."
8/18/2016,4 star rating,"I was there on 8/14/16 with my family.  I ordered the shrimp with grits and it came with salmon cakes as a side, eggs and a mimosa all for 20 bucks. The meal was pretty good but the salmon cakes could have been better.  The value is excellent, the service was ok but I think it could have been better if they had more help.  We all enjoyed our meals from the frittatas to the pancakes. I would go back again."
4/22/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely wonderful. Not only was the food great and the mimosas wonderful, but the service was among the best I've had. Jennifer was absolutely fantastic, and the experience couldn't have been better. When you come, definitely ask for Jennifer or Daisy."
3/30/2016,5 star rating,"This place is awesome. The Boyf and I were looking for French toast after 2pm because that's when we woke up. After calling around, this was the only place willing to serve this variety of breakfast. The food was great and the owner entertained us with stories of her travels. I'll definitely return when I'm in town again."
11/22/2013,5 star rating,"Delicious soups, hearty sandwiches, great variety of desserts served in a renovated space showing exposed brick walls, pot bellied stove in a spacious comfortable setting. Eclectic art collection with with soothing music played is a relaxing fun venue for lunch in Harlem near CCNY. We will return!"
4/3/2015,4 star rating,Our server William was awesome and friendly. Food was great- you have to try the guacamole and the yams!Will be back soon.
1/5/2017,4 star rating,"One of Harlem's best kept brunch secrets!Relocating to NJ, it's not easy to find  not at home.   I had a taste for fish a grits and this place did not disappoint my appetite.  It was well seasoned and the grits had the perfect consistency. My partner enjoyed his French toast and we were equally impressed with our personalized tea pots."
8/14/2014,5 star rating,"Good food, low key, very inexpensive but they could prepare a little better. For example we got coffee with no spoon. The breakfast burrito was delicious with eggs, avocado, black beans, lettuce and cilantro. Yum! The music is excellent and the staff is very friendly and constantly checking in! Definitely will come back here from the UWS. Again, the music was great!"
3/2/2014,4 star rating,"The place has potential.  A friend and I walked in for brunch on Sunday at 12:30.  The place was almost empty but filled up progressively as we were there.  The menu emphasizes quality ingredients--all organic or close to it.  As a result, it's not particularly cheap but the food was very good.  The brunch menu had some selections at $12 and others at $20, the latter including a drink from the bar.I ordered french toast and eggs and it was really delicious.  My only complaint is that the food took a really long time to come out.  Must be a problem in the kitchen because all other aspects of the service were fine.  I would come back but will be prepared for a long wait for the food."
9/4/2016,4 star rating,"Food is definitely good here. I got the omelet with mozzarella tomato and basil. It came with tasty salad, which I wish there was more of, and a choice of meat. I chose the salmon cake. I never had salmon cake before but I thought it was a bit dry. It also came with your choice of drink. The food is definitely delicious and filling. I didn't think it was the most memorable but if you are craving your basic brunch foods, this is a good place to eat. The price was a bit steep too."
6/16/2017,5 star rating,"I dont typical write review but I LOVEEEEEEE Home Sweet Harlem. Me and my sister went to have brunch last Sunday, which was AWESOME (especially after founding out they don't use red meat or pork because I don't eat either). Today I was craving some great food so I decided to order through seamless.. I was NOT disappointed.. The food was amazing (even after being delivered, we all know things can go wrong through delivery). I ordered the Lemon Herb Baked Chicken it came with Kale and mac & cheese. It was GREATTTTTTT !!!!... This is about to be my new go to place !!!!!!!!"
5/10/2015,4 star rating,"First and foremost this spot is kind of hidden, but it's really great, not too noisy, really chill spot and the brunch is great. I came here on Saturday May 9,2015 and dig the atmosphere. I had the spinach fete frittata, that came with a biscuit, Rosemary potatoes and a choice of turkey bacon with their fresh squeezed orange juice, and might I say everything was delicious. The waiter was also awesome and very friendly and polite, even the other waiters as well. The only thing that turned me off a smudged was the ceiling fan was dusty, kind of a turn off being that your table where your food is placed on is over it, but overall this chill spot is great and will be seeing me soon"
5/25/2014,5 star rating,"Home Sweet Harlem is dear to my heart. I remember fondly the original location on 135th. It was my go to spot for feel good food. I loved the old fashioned oven and the warm hospitality. I'm so glad for this second coming. Cheers to you, Donna! Well done, well done...I now live in Texas, but will frequent Home Sweet Harlem when I'm in the city."
9/7/2016,4 star rating,"I came here on a Monday morning, ordered the Farmer's omelette and home made orange juice. The orange juice was actually really good, just a really small portion. Omelette was a little too salty. Service was great and attentive."
1/21/2017,4 star rating,"Are here today for brunch, the service was very good we had a very difficult party (asking for food cooked a certain way, straws, substitutions, every sauce under the planet) but Jennifer was very helpful and attentive. I ordered the fried fish and so did my friend and our first was wayyy Too thick and not fried hard. Other than that the food was very good."
9/24/2018,3 star rating,"i really want to give a better review, i want to support local businesses, plus the staff is super friendly; but every time I have been here the food has been sub-par, sometimes even terrible....  Most of the time the food is cold.   They need to work on the menu, and to be frank the food is overpriced for the quality of the food.  I really want to like it, but after a few times it is just not that great :-("
1/16/2015,5 star rating,"Amazing food and amazing service. Amazing customer service. That's 3 amazings. Clean, fast and error free. It's also right next to CCNY, far cheaper than  on-campus food (and much better food/coffee).Highly recommended for any time of the day! And they do take-out!"
8/28/2016,5 star rating,"Very quite, quaint brunch spot. It was not crowded at all and the staff was very friendly and answered all the questions we had. It's kind of in a weird spot, around nothing else, but that's why I kind of like it because it's not well known. I got the French toast and it was great!! They had ran out of the normal fruit, but they substituted bananas and it was just as good with the Greek yogurt."
3/6/2016,4 star rating,"I went around 1:45 on a Sunday afternoon and had no wait. While the wait staff was packing, the food is great and the price is even better. They offer a prix fixe menu for 20 dollars that includes either French toast, pancakes, or a frittata with a side of potatoes or grits and your choice of turkey bacon, turkey sausage, and a salmon cake. The price also includes your choice of a mimosa, Bellini, michelada or fresh squeezed orange juice. You can't beat a price like that in the city- especially considering the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back"
3/20/2017,5 star rating,The food was absolutely delish...I went on a Sunday for brunch and got one complimentary Bellini. My server was really nice and made a great suggestion. I had the home skillet with grits and salmon patty. It was plenty of food. They also have bottomless mimosas and bellinis but I didn't have time to stay and enjoy.
7/19/2014,4 star rating,"Good food, like others have said. But I was rather impressed with their grits. Perfect! Hard to find good grits. Kudos! Great staff. Attentive and shared the work load. Seems like a good team. Recommended!"
8/4/2015,4 star rating,"This lovely breakfast/brunch place is a delight! The atmosphere is very classic and homey--just like grammy's house with a little bit of funk. The coffee wasn't great... Although decent as far as espressos go. The food--wowza! No flashiness but darn tasty. If you're looking for a cute spot to take your family, definitely check this out! The prices for the area are unreal. $6 for an amazing, filling breakfast burrito. As I write I just took a sip of the green juice and it is...  Incredible!!! The service was a little here and there at first but the staff was just so darn friendly that none of our party minded. It sounded like unusual circumstances let to this--the waiter even discounted our meal because of the wait on the juices! Bottom line: if you're not in a huge rush and you're a little patient, you can get an incredible meal in a great atmosphere for an even better price."
4/30/2016,4 star rating,"Very, very good food. I'd actually rate it at a 4.5 came in early on a Saturday morning, there were only 3 other tables occupied. We were warmly greyed and seated by our server. French toast and Frittata were delicious! Freshly squeezed OJ was wonderful. All the food tasted fresh. I loved the ambiance with unique art, fresh flowers on the table, a nice mix of R&B playing overhead. Easy to access by train... What more can you ask for?"
11/24/2014,4 star rating,This place is very close from my school and i enjoy many times.food is actually good but service is very good. Very kind waiter and waitress work over there. if you r a ccny students u should visit this place becuz they have discount 10% off to ccny students
4/26/2016,4 star rating,"I liked it, but I didn't love it. The place is very quaint, and the waitresses are really nice. Between my friend and I, we got two different frittatas with grits and potatoes. I really liked the rosemary potatoes and her sundried tomato frittata. The grits were okay. The orange juice is to die for. I messed up my order (accidentally said to add mushrooms when I meant to say peppers), and they were nice about changing it."

7/26/2015,1 star rating,"Just left right now. Arrived at 1:30 (it is 2:22 right now). We were seated in large booth. Did not receive any service for 20 minutes (1:50). Put in our orders and finally got water. Did not receive any further information on food, status, anything. Appears to be only one waiter. 8/13 tables filled when we arrived. Of those all had received orders which begs a couple questions: why only one waiter, what was the kitchen doing for the 52 minutes we were there, and did they even care."
1/15/2017,5 star rating,"There was nothing lacking. From the music playing in the background to the customer service, everything was perfect. I got the shrimp and grits, with a side of potatoes, salmon cake, and a biscuit along with a Bellini for $20 and it was all delicious!!The server was really on point and I got a chance to speak with the owner and she was really nice too. I found my go-to spot in Sugar Hill!"
9/11/2016,4 star rating,"This place was great! Definitely one of the better brunches I've been to in NY. The food was seasoned well and the biscuits were actually good (surprising!) The icing on the cake were the fantastic unlimited mimosas! It was like the perfect ratio of champagne to OJ. Thumbs up for this place, I will definitely be back. Oh AND this place is black owned! Yes yes yes!!"
9/9/2014,5 star rating,"Great food, very nice people,  great music,  great atmosphere, great prices and with school ID you get discounts (you can't beat that) .  The servers are very attentive and the food was delivered fast.  St. Nicholas is a must try. This is a must try place. The people here make you feel at home."

8/28/2016,5 star rating,"Another hidden gem with amazing food and a great atmosphere, nice and cozy for a Sunday brunch. Music not to loud, you can actual hear the person across from you & the unlimited brunch is very reasonable. Will most definitely come back!"
1/7/2014,5 star rating,"Enjoyed a delicious brunch with my daughter this past Saturday. The mushroom, cheese and scallion omelet was delicious, and the grits and homemade gravy were especially good. And mimosas are available along with the many brunch options. Everything on the menu looked great.The place has a great vibe, Wi-Fi access, reasonable prices, and a delightful owner/cook. It will be a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to my next visit."
8/29/2018,1 star rating,"That this place has 4 stars shows the weakness of yelp. The place is horrible and has been so for years.  I live next door, and every few years try it in an attempt to support local businesses, and am disappointed every time.  How they are still open is a miracle. problems:1. no air conditioning.  2. the front door bangs so loudly that you jump out of your seat each time it closes3. extremely loud blender that made it hard to talk4. $15 for one waffle (regular size, nothing special)5. The 2 cut up strawberries that came with the waffle had one rotten spot in each piece of strawberry.  (I sent them back and the replacement ones were without rot.)6. The shrimp frittatta was inedible: very fishy tasting 7. The final insult was to be charged 18% service charge - ON TOP.  I had read about the service charge, but foolishly thought it was included in the food charges (since the food charges were so ridiculously high.)The only thing positive I can say is that the wait staff, who seem to be in training are young and doing a great job."
7/8/2018,5 star rating,"I kicked my birthday off with brunch here, and had a great time. The food was great. No complaints here. Can't wait to go back."
5/8/2016,3 star rating,"This place is in the neighborhood and I've been here a handful of times for brunch. The food is great however the service is subpar. If you order unlimited mimosas the staff does not regularly refill your glass and I've had to consistently ask for refill during multiple visits thus not getting my money's worth. The mimosas tend to taste more like orange juice than actual mimosa. I met a few friends there and I arrived a little later than them and had request water etc despite the waitress welcoming me and taking my order. If the service was better, this place WOULD be a gem."
10/21/2015,1 star rating,"The Cobb Salad consists of old lettuce, old and browning avocados and stickers from produce.  Need I say more?"

1/24/2015,2 star rating,"So let's start with why it gets 2 stars as opposed to 5. I could even be being too generous when I give it 2 stars. 1. nice homey decor with enough space2. well crafted brunch menu that is decently priced. full plates of food + brunch drink options. now on to the experience. 1. only one active waiter, who really wasn't that attentive and slightly messed up the orders. 2. ordered coffee (which didn't taste too great) with a side a milk that contained an unidentifiable object floating inside of it. not to mention, didn't notice the object until I already poured some milk out and drank coffee.3. the cherry on top - as we were mid way through the meal, suddenly the the credit card machine wasn't working to pay and of course didn't have cash.  the waiter then preceded to say they would take a percentage off and guess what - when the bill came there was no percentage off. this place has soooo much potential. the food was tasty. the biscuits were awesome. the mimosa and Bellini had just enough champagne, however, needs work. the experience was horrible."
10/9/2015,5 star rating,"i dropped in here a few times. beautiful place to chill and be at peace, to study, or chat it up with friends. artsy interior with art. spacious. lovely people with awesome personalities. definitely makes you feel like you know these people for a long time. i had the fish tacos one time. pretty good. latte was great! wifi available.they have live bands on Thursdays now. looking forward to it. . ."
1/28/2018,5 star rating,"What wonderful people run this neighborhood eatery.  We had a party of 3 adults and 3 kids between 1 and 2 years of age.  One of our party was having a bad day, and the chef came out from the kitchen: ""What's the matter? I can hear you in the kitchen. Do you want some fruit?"" Then he went and made a special plate of fruit for the kids (which he didn't even charge us for).  Then, about half an hour later, the kid started crying again, well the chef came out again, and he took the kid on a ride through the restaurant!  Then he picked up another kid and bounced him a bit.  At no point did he seem upset or irritated--just loving and kind.  What a gem of a man!  (I should note that they only have 2 high chairs, so if you are looking for a place that can accommodate 3 kids, one will have to sit in a lap.)"

10/10/2015,5 star rating,"Everything here was great. Came in at opening on a Saturday for breakfast, and our waitress was kind, warm, and attentive. The coffee is bold and just perfect. And our food - the farmer's scramble and challah french toast - was fantastic. This is a really nice neighborhood spot. Also has a comfy, casually classy ambience."
6/2/2018,1 star rating,Sat for 15 minutes in a half empty restaurant and all we got is water...don't know what the food tastes like because we walked out. Terrible service! Won't be back!

5/30/2016,5 star rating,"We decided to try a new brunch place today and Home Sweet Harlem was a great choice. We ordered the shrimp and grits and I loved it, in addition to the shrimp and grits we also ordered the home skillet brunch with the unlimited drink option. The servers were attentive yet not intrusive. A Relaxed atmosphere and in a somewhat hidden location. Definitely a place worth trying."

7/27/2015,5 star rating,"Excellent!  Excellent!  It was a Holiday Monday, the menu was light and the chef came from the kitchen to explain, they hadn't expected to be open.  Even such, they expect a light crowd.  The place was packed and they were out of the usual.  The chef suggested the fish and grits.  Home run!  Tender fillets and rich frits with a side of green salad.  I discovered a secret across the street from city college.  I will be back, again and again."
2/14/2018,5 star rating,Great food and super friendly staff!!!! Had the breakfast burrito and it was incredibly delicious. They didn't have beans yet so they put in potatoes but it ended up being awesome. They were perfectly roasted and crispy but soft on the inside. Mix of avocado and spicy mayo was so good. I want another one right now. Highly recommend!!!!
11/18/2015,5 star rating,This place really feels like home. The waitress was extremely friendly and welcoming and let us know that they have free live Jazz every Thursday night at 7. Their soul food was delicious and affordable.
4/1/2015,4 star rating,"I came here for breakfast on Monday. I've been looking for someplace in the neighborhood that has a good breakfast without being too greasy or commercial. I was not disappointed! Once inside I was greeted by William the server. It was around noon so there was ample seating. The decor is laid back and I didn't feel rushed. I told William I wanted ""everything"" (I was hungry and had to wait for several minutes to find parking) a combo of eggs, turkey sausage, 5 grain toast and especially grits. He put together two of the specials so I could get what I wanted without breaking the bank. The food arrived, but some of the order got mixed up. I got bacon instead of sausage. William apologized profusely and offered to change my order but there was something about the way he handled it, that it was no big deal and I ate what he brought me. He came by the table a few times to make sure everything was ok, very attentive but not overbearing. The organic eggs were fluffy and cooked perfectly, the potatoes were a bit dry but since I was really interested in the grits (which were very tasty - just enough butter and salt)! I had a nice relaxing meal. The service and staff made a big difference.  Thank you! I will be back."
7/6/2018,1 star rating,"The worst all around--food & service. My friend and I arrived around 11am on a Thursday morning. The place was empty save for a woman and her young daughter. The cook/chef was sitting upfront as well as two other women (one apparently the owner, the other, who took our order, said she wasn't a waitress. When we walked in we were told to take any seat except for the booths.  We grabbed some menus & sat.  We sat for awhile before any approached us.  The woman who took our order knew nothing about the menu, she had to keep running in the back to find out things. Then it was determined that we had Sunday brunch menus. (Why were they out in the first place?). I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese on a croissant with a side of turkey sausage and home fries.  (I wanted biscuits but apparently you can only get them on the weekends.)The eggs were not scrambled--it was an omelette.  The cheese was nonexistent. The turkey sausage was like none other I've ever had. It was very, very pale and after I bit into a piece of gristle, I questioned whether or not if it was truly turkey sausage. The potatoes didn't not taste as if they were made recently, they were tough and funny tasting. My friend's food fared no better; she ordered an order of salmon croquettes but only one came . When she asked about it, the chef/cook who was once again up front had to go back and make another. When it came time for the check, that was another issue. Apparently the registers did not work, so the non-waitress had to rewrite our bill that a whole lot of time. By the way, they only accept cash and a service charge is included on all checks even though they don't say how much it is (18%}. The one restroom is unisex. It was clean, however they had a broken bottle of hand soap that had to be picked up and turned over to get some soap, Yuck! I would not go"

4/15/2016,5 star rating,"A group of us friends were visiting NYC and decided to try this place out. Glad we did.  I have the shrimp and grits- delish!!My son had the meatballs- delish!!  They happened to make some biscuits while we were there (the owner told us they only make them on holidays). They were amazing. Very nice people work here. My only suggestion would be that the servers get a bit more training. It seemed like they weren't familiar with the menu and what can or can't be substituted.  So if you're in the area and want fresh tasting soul food, stop in."

5/9/2015,2 star rating,"Nice owner, but the food is mediocre. I really, really wanted to like this place. The shrimp and grits were bland, and the service was slow. The owner claimed that the chef was from Texas, but the food tasted otherwise. I am writing this review solely based on the fact that the hype is too real."
9/17/2014,4 star rating,"We are from Portland so we have a lot of little spot just like this . So it was nice to find something to give us a feeling of home from so far away .It was the hospitality that we experienced here that made it great. The owner was so nice and welcoming and even talked with us for a bit since we were  traveling and gave us some ideas on where to go and what to do.The food was good. Not amazing but it was good! It filled our bellies and make us happy. I got the breakfast burrito and it was yummy ! Everything tasted fresh And my husband got thE pancakes which were the winner here , they tasted like home .... Pancakes your mom makes for you early on a Sunday morning .It's too bad we won't be here for Sunday brunch to try the biscuits. We will just have to come back to NYC ."
3/23/2014,4 star rating,"Went here this morning with a friend. I liked the casual vibe because we wanted to eat and talk. So, for us the service wasn't too slow. The staff was very friendly and seemed to take pride in the place, which is a plus.  The food was good - attractive, home made style. I appreciated the juicy, turkey sausage and griddle cakes with yogurt and bananas. My scrambled eggs had a little cheese in them which I didn't expect but really enjoyed. My companion also enjoyed her griddle cakes and turkey bacon. Ohh, also liked the touch of warm milk to go with my coffee. All in all, we had a relaxing, delicious afternoon. I recommend it and hope to go there again."
9/30/2015,4 star rating,Delicious food. Only downfall was that the waitress forgot to put our order in and we spent at least an hour waiting for our food
9/3/2015,5 star rating,"Shrimp and grits were way too good. Borderline problematic because I could see myself coming here more than I should. Super friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere. And most importantly the food was amazing."
1/5/2015,4 star rating,"Dropped in for brunch at Home Sweet Harlem. The place was fairly empty, but it was a weekday morning. The menu had about less than a dozen dishes. I ordered a hot cider and the mimosa and shrimp/fish and grits combo. The shrimp/fish and grits had about 4 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of fried crusted white fish topped with a salsa garnish. The shrimp and fish and grits were amazing. The grits were creamy  and fluffy with nice subtle flavors and the mixture of both the shrimp and fried fish in the dish came together nicely. A nice little spot in Harlem for a bite and drink. After eating a shrimp and grits meal a few days before from a popular place that missed the mark, the dish here reminded me why I like shrimp and grits so much. The service was friendly and attentive."
3/4/2016,4 star rating,"My new favorite local hang. Food is quite good (the roasted potatoes are actually roasted), prices are great, portions substantial. Friendly, spacious atmosphere with a variety of tables (I like the high ones). The service is on the slow side, but everything feels so genuine, a pleasant contrast to the micromanaged, polished, fast pace of the rest of the city. A true, legit ""mom and pop"" that has somehow found elegance while escaping the several cycles of ultra-refinement most NYC cafes go through. If I were ever to open a restaurant, this would be what it looks and feels and tastes and sounds like, complete with the local art and live jazz. I stumbled in two weeks ago, and already I'm practically part of the scenery."
1/1/2015,1 star rating,"I saw this place on yelp and thought to give it a try since they have pretty good reviews. My friend and I was in the restaurant waited for 10mins to get seated when there was couple of tables open. Didn't take long to place my order considering the limited selection for brunch. However, took forever to get our food and they didn't even have salt/pepper or condiment ready set on the table. We had to ask for them as well as a silverware set. Really?!? Our drinks was sitting at the bar for awhile. Not all of my food came out together. The food was okay. Presentation was not all that! AND I HAD EGG SHELLS IN MY FRITATA.... Would not recommend anyone to go there, unless you have a lot of time to do nothing..you can waste you time there. It's pricy for not that much food!!"

3/18/2015,3 star rating,Great staff as well as food. However their food is Overpriced and the portion size is small.
10/14/2014,2 star rating,"I really like supporting black owned businesses, especially here in Harlem. I'd go back if they worked on the adjusting the prices or the serving sizes. $20 for brunch is okay if the plates are shareable or pretty large in size. They're not -- beware! You won't leave hungry but you won't leave happy either. Also, the service, while extremely friendly and warm, was a bit slow, if you're in a rush, better try another spot."
11/9/2015,5 star rating,"This place is a delight. I took an out of town friend here and the service, food and atmosphere were everything you'd want from a brunch place: simple, reliable and a good value. I hope they stick around."

She created a special combination plate for me, and the food was great!"
4/3/2018,5 star rating,"This is my favorite place for breakfast. Never been for any other meals besides breakfast but their menu for lunch and dinner also look great. Reminds me of the good local places you find in New Orleans. Food is good stick to your bones kind of home cooking. You get so much for your money here. Me and my wife always get the egg combos which come with a ton of food and side of griddle cakes for good measure.The biscuits and the sides (yams, grits, etc) are the icing on the cake of a great meal. The people who work here are so nice and always super accommodating to me and my wife even when we bring our 7 month son. I would eat here everyday if I could. Can't recommended it more. Every neighborhood in NYC should be so lucky to have a place like this."
5/20/2018,5 star rating,"The food, service, and atmosphere are amazing. We had a massive group come in and all of us were well taken care of. Home Sweet Harlem boasts home cooked food and they do not disappoint - their chicken and waffles, grits, mac and cheese, walnut apple salad, and plantains and guac were so so so good. Highly recommend and well worth the visit!"
5/23/2015,5 star rating,"Nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood. I am brunching on a Saturday and was surprised how well the food is cooked. Brunch menu is small and simple, but it helps for making selections easy. Got a mozz sundried tomato omelet with turkey sausage and potatoes. Turkey sausage and potatoes had a slight crisp which was delightful. Omelette is tasty and well prepared. Includes a beverage (alcohol too) for $20. Of course I just settled for a mimosa. My server Yvens was very attentive and friendly, but not talkative which is what is preferred. Food presentation is lovely. Come here if you want a simple brunch without all the bells and whistles - elaborate brunch."

8/22/2015,3 star rating,"We came here after the Percy Sutton race for brunch.  The food was very good and the proportions were adequate.  I had the farmers skillet with potatoes.  I highly recommend it, especially if you like sausage. Not too thrilled about the  the service.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food to come out, and within that time, the waiter only came to our table once to refill our drinks only because we got his attention.  It was somewhat busy that morning, but not all the tables were occupied.  Perhaps the service would be better on a less busy day."
9/27/2014,5 star rating,"Upon moving to New York from Tennessee, I gave up on finding a good biscuit in the North. It's like finding a good taco outside of California, it just doesn't happen. But low and behold, Home Sweet Harlem makes me forget the city streets, confusing subway maps and 24 hr bodegas.  For breakfast, I'm back home."
6/15/2014,2 star rating,purchased the egg cheese & biscuit. I was shocked on how small it was for 12 dollars. Could have gone to corner store and got same thing for 2.50. It. Was nothing spectacular. My grits we're clumpy and cold.
6/16/2015,4 star rating,"I had breakfast here with a friend. We had the option of eating at the bar or being seated. We sat at a table in the lightly crowded dining area where a waiter greeted us immediately. They offer a simple and somewhat healthy menu. I had scrambled eggs, fried yams, and a fruit salad. The bananas in the salad was kind of mushy but everything else was great. Altogether It was a good food along with great service"
8/4/2015,3 star rating,"Quaint/cozy atmosphere, slow service, average to decent food.After visiting a nearby coffee shop my family and I were on the hunt for some food. We saw that this place served brunch and decided to stay. When we first arrived there were only about 3 other seated groups/couples. The menus are on plain computer paper and a bit wrinkled which is OK, but there were different versions and at first it was confusing.I had the griddle cakes with a salmon cake on the side, my mother had grits, and my sister a fruit and cheese plate. My mother said the grits were really great, which says a lot because we're from New Orleans. My griddle cakes (flat pancakes) were OK. They weren't anything special. They were made with fennel seed which was not on the menu.The thing that got us was that after waiting for 15-20 minutes for our hot food, my baby sister had to wait an extra 10 minutes for a fruit and cheese plate. It required no cooking, but simply putting cheese and grapes on a plate. That was a disappointment. Additionally, the server never came to refill our water glasses, and I had to work really hard to get the check."
11/1/2014,5 star rating,"So...I have to say I believe in second chances.  Home Sweet Harlem is a great local spot and the proprietor Donna is so sweet and kind. I love her ideas behind getting the community together and supporting local artists and chefs. Donna has been so generous to let a local group of mothers, myself included get together and have a weekly story time in her fabulous space. The first week I tried the Caesar salad with organic chicken and it was honestly delicious!  Each week now I have enjoyed a large portion of Caesar salad with their yummy homemade dressing and croutons. Home sweet harlem is a great place to book large parties and events I definitely recommend working with Donna and the Caesar salad!!"
1/12/2014,1 star rating,This was a very disappointing encounter. My friend and I just ate here for an early dinner and it was terrible. We walked in to be greeted by a friendly server but no heat or music and a very empty restaurant. (Now I see why.).  The menus were on ratty pieces of computer paper and the edges were curling from general wear and tear and lack of lamination. We ordered our food. I ordered per our server's convincing recommendation of the turkey burger. To my dismay the burger came out tasteless and COLD.  COLD. It was disgusting. The best part of the burger was the sight of it and even the sight was questionable. I could have made a better turkey burger at home from scratch and I've never made one before. I was so hungry I ate a couple tasteless bites until I couldn't bare the cold burger anymore. I let our waiter know it came out cold. He did not offer to take it back or have it remade. He only offered a slice of sweet potato pie which I politely declined. The lack of service is speculative maybe due to no manager or just bad service. And no music was weird and intimidating. As someone who has worked in the food & beverage industry I know the first thing is to take the food back and take it off the check and THEN offer complimentary dessert. (That's what should have happened). As a local this regrettable 'find' was super disappointing because the venue itself is a gem. Despite the waiter's attempted swag I have to give my recent dining experience 2 thumbs way down. Don't waste your money.
4/12/2015,5 star rating,"Really enjoyed the food here. 20 dollars got me stuffed and semi boozy, can't beat that. Good mimosas and the challah french toast were my fav along with the fresh whipped cream. Griddle cakes were good too. Side of yams was necessary in my case and boy was I stuffed. Will definitely return. Also, Joanna our server was very attentive. I love supporting small businesses like this."

We walked in and were seated immediately and since we were starving, we took one look at the menu and we all ordered the sausage, egg and biscuit. I also ordered a cappuccino and grits with cheese. The grits hit the spot for me and the coffee was really good, it definitely woke me right up. Service was slow but it was fine because my group was so busy talking and eating. I would go back after another long run :-)"

Hot, delicious coffee came with steamed milk, and the hot chocolate arrived especially rich, but not too sweet or heavy.  All this with friendly service (perhaps more attention than usual because the place was in between busier service hours)...a homegrown spot that's cozy the moment you walk in. Music kept me focused, not distracted, on my work. Even with their wifi. Seriously, this is mom 'n pop in Harlem. It's the way it should always and forever be."

5/10/2015,1 star rating,I am severely disappointed by my second experience here. I loved my first time so much I decided to take a group of six for Mother's Day. Everything possible that could go wrong with our order did. It was not crowded and yet the waiters were running around like their heads were chopped off and did not give us half of our food despite multiple requests for the items. The waiter kept saying it is on the way and then would not bring the items. I ordered the same thing as last time and it was not nearly as good. The waiter made no attempt to rectify the disaster and charged us full price despite the fact he did not bring us everything. Will not be going back.

6/25/2014,3 star rating,"I had awhile without ordering turkey burgers anywhere because they are usually dry. The one I was served here was just perfect. The turkey burger and the corn on the cob were the best part of my meal. Buffalo wings were not spicy and I wasn't a fan at the blue cheese crumbles melted on it. Also had iced  coffee with almond milk, I was only provided with sugar packets which kind of sucks for iced coffee. Nice clean spot, I would not mind coming here again."
9/6/2015,1 star rating,"Food was Editable, food presentation wasn't great, customer service was slow, forgetful. On top of everything there were only five people dining at the time, don't understand why service was so bad. Waiters and waitress were more concerned with their conversations then their guests. The young busser was very attentive and refilled our water. He was great! That's the only reason for the one star."
6/5/2017,5 star rating,Donna the owner is great and the breakfast that she made for me was just as great!! I walked to Home sweet Harlem from the edge of Hamilton Heights/Harlem and it was a fantastic walk. Highly recommend!!
4/8/2017,5 star rating,Found a new favorite brunch spot in my hood! So excited I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it did not disappoint! I got the farmers skillet  and it was delicious! They gave a great amount of food and everything was so flavorful! I also really loved the old school down south decor! I will definitely be back!!!
6/1/2017,5 star rating,"Love Love LOVE this place! My favorite is the weekend brunch (I've never had a meal here any other time of day to actually compare) but the brunch is AWESOME. Really flavorful home cooked, warm your soul type food. Kind service. And it's Black Owned."
4/2/2015,5 star rating,"I came here for breakfast with my best friend on a Wednesday morning. Location is prime, right in  front of city college. Waiter was very friendly and cute. Space is pretty big but has character. We ordered a very traditional pancake, omelet and gritz.  They had run out of whip cream but after pouting a little, the waiter proceeded to whip the whip cream on the spot.  At the end the owner, Donna, came out and asked how we enjoyed it all. Even shared about her dreams with the place. I love supporting great spots so, if you're in the area looking for a casual but home spot.  Visit them and order some yummy food."
4/1/2015,4 star rating,"My girlfriends and I discovered Home Sweet Harlem online, while trying to find a kid-friendly brunch spot. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon, and were greeted by a warm and friendly staff. The place has a nice, and cozy feel of a cafe. The food is super fresh, and clean. The owner even came out towards the end of our meal, for some conversation. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, and will return."

6/15/2014,2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place (mom/pop shop, straightforward cooking, etc.), and after reading the previous reviews, I ventured past the familiar brunch spots on FDB to try this out. I'm not familiar with brunch spots north of here so maybe it's good for the neighborhood, but there are just much better options south of 135th St, like Maison Harlem, Harlem Tavern, Amy Ruth's, even Jimbo's. The bang for the buck just isn't there: $12 for a breakfast sandwich on a mini biscuit? They're $4 from the bodega and taste better. Biscuit was too dense, grits were clumpy, eggs were over cooked, and the potatoes were lukewarm. Service was friendly and personable, but not very present. I wish I lived closer so I could have another opportunity to see what the hype is about, but the food will not bring me back."
5/7/2015,1 star rating,"It looks cute and kind. I was feeling it would be great. However, I think the chef smoked a fatty and left his head at home. It took over an hour to make 2 burgers and no one was in the restaurant.  Then my food had wilted lettuce and a stale bun. My man's food some how was forgotten and took another 20minutes.  Plus the coffee taste burnt. Then they didn't even comp any of our food. Don't eat here."
7/26/2015,5 star rating,"Perfect for a chill Sunday brunch. $20 will get you griddle cakes, sausage, eggs, and a cocktail included. And bottomless coffee. Cute decor, friendly staff, not at all crowded. Definitely can't complain."

I called and ahead while in my cab I arrived and was greeted by Donna herself (the owner) I have called ahead and so my amazing roasted sweet potatoes and biscuit sausage egg and cheese sandwich was waiting for me oh my God it was so great they even made a special chocolate latte for me!"
6/28/2015,2 star rating,"I was very excited to go here and upon arrival I was surprised by the quick and polite service but after about 10 minutes that all changed. My service went from being slow to almost nonexistent, we had to try and get the attention of another waiter just to get our order.  We then ordered and they didn't bring out the correct sides to our breakfast and my french toast was so crunchy my knife had a hard time cutting it.  Overall, while the environment was nice and most the food seemed to be decent, for the price you could find somewhere more suitable for your brunch in the city!"
4/7/2015,5 star rating,I had the farmers skillet. It was tasty and didn't take much time to be served. The sweet potatoes on the side were delicious! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing during breakfast hours. Will come back for dinner. Inviting wait staff!

6/15/2014,2 star rating,"I really wanted to give this place more stars but the service was TERRIBLE. Decided to try this place for Sunday brunch because most of the reviews were positive, boy was I wrong. I don't know if our server was high, tired or a mixture of both. He never came and checked on us, messed up our order and gave us the wrong information on what came with the meals. After sitting for about 30 mins after the meal another server came up and asks ""did you order anything yet""? No I'm just sitting here for the view, of course I did!  This place really needs to get a grip on the service. The only thing that saved this place was the food. The scrambled egg on a croissant role was delicious. I want to give at least three stars but the service was that bad!"
3/18/2015,4 star rating,"Went here for brunch twice with friends and it was a great experience! The food was very tasty, the service prompt and friendly and the prices were reasonable. The first time we had a nice chat with the owner and staff and ended up staying for another 20 minutes, talking about food, service the and the neighborhood. Felt right at home!"
4/24/2014,5 star rating,"Went to Home Sweet Harlem in NY city yesterday for lunch on my way back to Boston. This new place was great!! The turkey burger I had was one of the best. The Caesar salad was fresh and crunchy, the dressing had a great zing. Check it out when your in up-town NY. Cheers, Bill from Boston"
2/3/2014,5 star rating,Found this place on Yelp when looking for somewhere to work and have a bit to eat while visiting from California. This place is a find. Great food. Great service! and WIFI! The coffee is really really good! The food was really really good. It is well made and focused on good healthy ingredients. It reminded me of a cafe you would find in California.
6/2/2015,5 star rating,"Phenomenal! The best breakfast I've had in months. I had the farmer's breakfast - buttery biscuit, warm sweet baked yams, savory egg scramble. Great service, clean and comfortable atmosphere. The only that would make me happier if this place was in my hometown."
10/4/2014,4 star rating,Came here with friends for a happy hour and had a great time.  The fish tacos are delicious! Grilled basa with good seasoning and a nice sauce. Wine was $5 and bartender Gabe generous portions. The place is known for good soups and turkey burgers so I'll be back!
5/15/2015,5 star rating,Love this place! We went out for a late breakfast and were not disappointed! Donna (I believe she is the owner) accommodated us with the breakfast menu even though it was past the usual breakfast time and recommended the shrimp skillet--yum! The yams were also delicious. My husband had the farmers skillet with grits --also a winner! We plan to go back and visit whenever we are in town. Highly recommend!
5/10/2014,5 star rating,"My wife and I just were crying there are no great brunch spots in The Bronx. Well go 2 stops on the D over to 145th in Harlem and there are a few - not UWS type options, but this place is as good as anything in the Upper west side. Wow. So damn good. And the service was exceptional. Great kid waited on us this morning - more on that in a bit. But so good and it fits the grit of harlem and the trendiness of the City College area. So the food - really good stuff. I ordered the baked French toast with scrambled eggs and turkey bacon, wife had the frittata, coffee, OJ. The French toast-  ordered with bananas and whipped cream. Server told me right after order was placed they were out of bananas and would any other fruit be okay, I said strawberries would be fine. Well when order showed up - bananas on top - said owner went out and got some. Only in NYC! Well the French toast was divine, good flavor. Scrambled eggs- I'm weird about eggs, like no brown at all. They had just a teeney tiney touch, and went ahead and tried them- so moist, so flavorful. Seasoned well with S&P, and scrambled really well. So yummy. Turkey bacon when it came out on plate you could see the shiny oily part to it, meaning it was freshly cooked. My wife's frittata - real good, the turkey sausage in it, was so moist and had that perfect sausage flavor to it. Just sweet and spicy enough. She doesn't eat flour so I took her biscuit , oh wow. Cheddar cheese in it, and really good. Highly recommend the biscuits, I ordered 2 extra, no kidding. And the OJ was freshly squeezed. And the coffee too - not sure what it was, but very good. Service - kid who waited on us you could tell was either newish or just learning to be a server maybe? But he was so damned polite, professional, and courteous. He got me extra syrup, 3 extra cups of coffee, the biscuits I ordered, joked with my wife and I, was on top of it. Asked about dinner - talked about the burgers and the turkey burgers. Such a nice guy. Met owner on way out - she talked to us for a while. Had a great attitude, talked biscuits and such. About 15 others came in to brunch while we were there, so very hopeful the place gets going and does great. It's a wonderful addition to that hood. Good luck Donna ( owner we met ) hope it makes it and we'll be back!"
2/12/2017,5 star rating,"This place has really good food. The venue itself is a little shabby, but the food and service make up for it. We ordered the farmer's skillet and the fruit and cheese plate and a few drinks, and everything was really well prepared. The waitress was also nice!"
3/15/2014,4 star rating,"Adorable place with lots of light. The espresso is solid, but the fresh biscuits were the winner. They were fluffy but not crumbly and buttery in all the right ways. It's a grand place to do work (fast wifi) without being bothered by waiters trying to flip your table. The staff is friendly and casual, just as they should be."
1/31/2014,5 star rating,"I'm not sure what happened to those that weren't happy but this place is simply OUTSTANDING. Very warm, well designed place and friendly staff (seems to be common with other reviews), and any previous negative comments about the food is perplexing as the food was DELICIOUS!  The staff even welcomed our requests to make our sandwiches with special changes.  Service was timely as well, so again, not sure of previous experiences but ours was simply exceptional. I guess staff can vary but it's hard to believe with the obvious pride that the owner places in this wonderful restaurant and the over-the-top warmth we found from the staff we met during our visit. Great to find healthy organic food along our travel route!  Give it a shot - good bet you'll be very happy you did!"
1/19/2014,5 star rating,"This place is wonderful! I have been twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner. My sister and I live super close by and we were really excited when it opened up. The best thing about this place is the absolutely delicious food. At brunch my sister got the Farmhouse breakfast and I got the griddle cakes. My sister's meal came with delicious turkey sausage, toast, roasted potatoes and a frittata. Totally devoured.Their griddlecakes were the best I have in as long as I can remember - thinner than most pancakes and really flavorful, served with whipped cream and fresh fruit. We returned a week later with our other sister for dinner and were not disappointed. They graciously extended happy hour for us and we got two for one pitchers of sangria. We ordered a LOT of food and ate every bite. One of my sisters had a soup and the Riverside burger which had really delicious spicy mayo. Other sister and I split a harvest salad and a grilled cheese, which made a perfect meal. The salad had all my favorite goodies and they were happy to customize (I switched blue cheese for goat cheese and added beets). Everything in the salad was ultra fresh and the house made balsamic dressing was wonderful. Other positives: food is healthy with lots of fresh and organic ingredients, super friendly and warm staff, WiFi, and prices"
4/24/2017,5 star rating,"Went here for breakfast while I was visiting NY and it was really good. The French toast was delicious, especially with whipped cream. I also got potatoes and eggs; the portions were bigger than I expected. It's $4 per side which is a little pricey but seeing as how it's a small business I didn't mind. Went at about 10-11am Saturday morning and I was seated as soon as I walked in, however it did start to fill up after that. The atmosphere was really nice for a calm Saturday morning. If I ever went back to Harlem I would definitely visit here again."

1/29/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch. Great homemade style of food. Home skillet and Farmers skillet are on point! Mango Bellini's are delicious. Make sure to order yams as well. Unfortunately, the only negative was that the coffee was not so good but just order more Mango Bellini's and you'll be ok.  Enjoy!!!!"

1/12/2014,5 star rating,"The owner, Donna, is welcoming and friendly and the space is attractive. I had a great crimini mushroom omelette (which the chef customized using egg whites) with tasty crab cakes and a Mimosa made with freshly squeezed OJ. The combo (omelette, 2 sides, coffee/tea and mimosa) is a decent value.  My server was very attentive: They were out of skim milk for the latte I requested, so I just asked for a regular cup of coffee (which was good).  She offered to bring me several other milks, including almond milk.  When I settled on whole milk she brought it heated. A nice touch."

6/24/2014,4 star rating,"I saw Home Sweet Harlem while walking the neighborhood early one Saturday and decided it was worth a visit.  I am so glad I came back while they were open - my friends and I had a great dinner, it was a combination of good food and feeling like we were in somebody's home.  We will definitely be back.Highlights - homemade guacamole, freshly roasted chicken on the chicken Ceasar salad which was so good  you wouldn't even notice how fresh the lettuce was, black beans that were so nicely seasoned they almost outshined the shrimp!"
6/8/2014,2 star rating,The service was terrible and the food wasn't very good either. The chicken cutlet was good though. Won't be going back here.
7/13/2014,5 star rating,"What a wonderful place. The food, service and atmosphere were all top notch. Was able to talk to the owner (and compliment her unbelievable biscuits) and she is a sweet woman. Can't help but hope for her, and this restaurant, to succeed! Definitely get the grits and gravy."
10/26/2014,4 star rating,My mom and I decided to stop by for brunch due to great reviews on Yelp. By all means did our experience live up to them. Our food was delicious and the service was great. I ordered their popular dish Farmer's Skillet and my mother had their griddle cakes. The owner/chef was kind enough to greet us and ask about our food/service. I will definitely come back to support a black business!

6/18/2017,5 star rating,Went here for brunch on Father's Day with my family as 12 people (8 adults and 4 kids). Not that easy to find a place that will accept a reservation for 12 people for brunch. We had one person with a dairy allergy and one with a gluten allergy and they were extremely accommodating. Service was fantastic and the food was equally as good. I had the turkey and cheddar omelettes . Omelette was moist and tasty (hate dry omelettes). We shared the challah French toast and the cheese and fruit plate which were both delicious. The fruit smoothies were light and tasty! The comped us some drinks as a thank you for our business. My whole family loved it and helped contribute to a great Father's Day. We Will definitely be back.
1/26/2014,5 star rating,Just had my first brunch here and ....biscuits are quite possibly the best I've ever  had with just a hint of cheddar.... and I chose the farmers skillet- I'll be back! Good crowd too!
1/17/2014,5 star rating,"As a former chef and foodie, my only complaint is that I have to bike up or walk up a huge hill no matter where I come from to get here! But that just makes the food even better than it already is! It's also VERY reasonably priced, bordering 'cheap' which is another reason I keep coming up this hill! The place is aptly named as it feels like home! The soups ( try the chicken peanut stew & the cheddar broccoli!) are delicious; hearty, healthy and memorable. The Cobb salad was perfection; marinated chicken with the house secret recipe has me hooked. But I've also had the tuna melt which doesn't sound like much but it's on a higher plane. Everything I've tried so far over my 4 it 5 times I've been here has been delicious. WW approved! The staff is very friendly, there is WiFi and the cappuccino is a favorite. The owner, Donna, keeps the menu fresh and has new specials all the time- she's a creative chef (which I appreciate) and always incorporates fresh herbs and spices which make everything a cut above. Its the details in decor, updated menus and real desire to bring healthy and delicious cuisine to Harlem that make this place ""foodie-approved"" im my opinion. I'll be back!"
2/23/2015,5 star rating,Came here on Christmas because I was hungry and it was the first place I saw. Food is so amazing and fresh...actually everything in the place is fresh from the food to the drinks. Our server messed up our order but was so nice and apologetic that we didn't even mind. Will come here again soon.

5/28/2015,3 star rating,"The food is great and the owner is wonderful. Every time I come there I enjoy myself. My rating would be higher if the service was better. There were several times I came there and we weren't given utensils, the servers didn't check in, and on at least three occasions, they waited until we had finished our meals to let us know that the credit card machine wasn't working."
5/20/2015,3 star rating,Still visiting from down under. Second place I've been in Harlem and I'm so happy. If you know any other good places in Harlem then yelp a brother out lol.
9/19/2016,3 star rating,"Let me start off by saying that I really, really wanted to LOVE this place. The first time I came here for lunch I was in love with the quaint atmosphere, cozy décor and the bumpin' R&B music coming through the speakers. I ordered a turkey cheeseburger with turkey bacon and loved it so much I came back two days later to try the shrimp and grits. They were delicious! I thought to myself that this will be my lunch spot for now on. Two weeks later I realized that I spoke way too soon. My colleague and I stopped in for lunch hoping for the shrimp and grits, only to be told that they did not have any shrimp or fish. The owner then states that she does have one piece of fish left and one of us could have that. Really?! Is that even a complete order? I order a turkey cheeseburger again along with a side of macaroni soufflé, my colleague orders something else. We wait...and wait...and wait. Why is it taking so long? No one is in the place but us. The burger was the most tasteless thing I have ever eaten. I think she made the patties and did not put any seasoning in them. The macaroni  was simply some leftover macaroni and cheese that was hard and dry. I immediately thought what is going on? I then overheard someone say that the chef wasn't in. I was like oh okay that's why this food tastes like crap!!! I return a few days later and order fish...again the food has no taste. It seems as though the only people there was the owner and her server, a young girl from Kentucky. Again the ""real cook"" wasn't there. After the last two visits I realized that I can only patronize this establishment if the cook is there. The owner is a very nice, quirky lady, but she can't cook."
5/15/2017,5 star rating,Why did I not know about this place sooner??? Went for brunch...The food...amazing!! The service... amazing!! This place offers beautifully prepared food that is fresh and delicious. Kudos to Kalif the chef and his associate whose name I can't remember and our server Daisy who was always right there when giving us free wine and Bellini refills! Going back for Thursday night karaoke! This is a true neighborhood gem and people should definitely go there and see for yourself.
5/12/2017,4 star rating,"If you're looking for a cheap, decent sized meal this place is great. Cosy restaurant and great comfort food after a big day of exploring the city. Waiter was lovely as well."
4/6/2016,5 star rating,"My job brings in different restaurants for lunch every day. Today's restaurant was Home Sweet Harlem. The food was so incredibly good! I got a lemon herb chicken entree (lemon zest, garlic, oregano, parsley, sage, rosemary, kosher salt, scallions, and butter) with a cheese noodle soufflé and salad. The chicken was so tender, just absolutely mouthwateringly delicious! The cheese noodle soufflé was perfect! This is my first time trying food from Home Sweet Harlem. I can't wait to go to the restaurant and try the rest of their menu!"
7/16/2016,4 star rating,"Overall, great experience. Went for brunch with manfriend; we both got a $20 deal that came with brunch beverage or choice of fresh squeezed OJ. I got cremini mushroom frittata with yams and a moan-worthy cheese, flavor was sublime, also chose grits as a side which were very yummy, some sort of meat thing cooked with for seasoning( maybe a chicken liver) not sure, didn't eat that part but it had great flavor, also came with a light thin biscuit, very flaky and so happy it was very small because this was so much food, also came with a little portion of mixed salad, AND salmon cake, it was nice  but it's not rave-worthy. A little on the dry side and reminiscent of tuna texture. The man got a spinach feta omelet which was tasty but relatively small compared to I guess a normal brunch omelet. Definitely go with the frittata and you won't be disappointed! Also we chose the mimosas and they were very well balanced between booze & juice. Now for the place: LOVE the interior, good amount of seating, awesome art work all over the place, service was very friendly and welcoming, a HUGE group walked in right before us and the staff had the foresight to warn us to order quickly so we could get our order in before theirs! AC was perfect to keep us comfy from the crazy heat and I'm just happy it's so close to home. Will definitely return!"
12/1/2014,4 star rating,"Love this spot in our neighborhood.  Sautéed kale is my favorite dish, followed by griddle cakes with a side of turkey sausage.  The vibe is very friendly.  Must try a glass of pinotage wine!"
7/6/2014,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch and the good and coffee were both very good.  The space itself is beautiful, with exposed brick and great lighting.  I had the Frittata and my friend had the French Toast.  Both were excellent and good portions.  The service was earnest, if a little inexperienced.  The only critique is that brunch was pretty expensive for the area - $20 a person not including alcohol."
2/25/2017,5 star rating,"Really solid brunch, amazing micheladas. Ordered the shrimp and grits and skillet and both were great. Will definitely be back!"
1/30/2014,3 star rating,"I may go back and try this place a second time to see how they do, but here is my experience:Pros: The owner and waiter were extremely nice. Super accomodating and friendly. The food we ate (turkey burgers) was also pretty tasty. The decor is nice and they have a nice, big space.Cons: The service was really, unbearably slow, even though the place was almost empty. We wanted to order appetizers but we wound up just getting dinner because we could tell that it would take forever for anything to arrive. The menu is also really limited...I would use this as more of a lunchtime place for salads/sandwiches than a dinner option. I am interested in trying the brunch, though, and might consider trying it once more. Also the dinner option I was most interested in was unavailable for the night, so in addition to a tiny dinner menu, some of it wasn't available.I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to amp up their service (and also order real menus..their menu is printed on computer paper).EDIT ON 5.27.2014: I went back with some friends for brunch. Again, the food was very good and the servers were very attentive. I would add back in a star for faster service (much more reasonable this time), but would have to take it back out again for these two issues: 1. Brunch was a bit overpriced for what we got...$12 for a bowl of Muesli is a bit much.  2. Two people at my table ordered a sausage-biscuit sandwich thing, but one person's was missing the top biscuit for some reason. There was also a weird moment of tension where a group of servers stood near our table and seemed to be having a light argument over something. So I'm keeping at three stars."
3/7/2016,4 star rating,"Great food! This place looks like nothing from the outside, but the inside is a breath of fresh southern air! Shrimp and grits, and French toast bigger than I have ever seen it! Such good food for a decent price, and our server was a doll!"
4/15/2015,4 star rating,"I went here to meet a friend for breakfast last week. I was one of the first customers there and was greeted by  the server, William. He was very friendly and personable as we chatted while I waited for my friend to arrive. Once she arrived I ordered the vegetarian burrito w/ chipotle mayo on the side. I don't eat eggs so they substituted it with more black beans and avocado. I was very satisfied with the taste and presentation. The chipotle gave my burrito a nice level of spice that meshed well with the burrito.  My friend had salmon cakes, veggie omelet, and grits which was fresh and tasted good(she's a foodie plus she finished her plate, good sign) ..made me even hungrier. Our bill was under $25 so it was time and money well spent. William and the owner of Home  Sweet Home made sure our meal was to ur liking, which it was.I'll definitely be coming back more often for brunch or to try some of their other breakfast dishes. Good price and good food in NYC, that's a win-win."
10/14/2016,1 star rating,Mediocre at best.  Horrible service with a ridiculous wait time considering we are the only people here. Plus I didn't know that it was possible to make a griddle cake with absolutely zero flavor.

Previously, I picked up coffees to go (they have milk alternatives for lactose intolerant folks like me), but today, I needed internet for a project (mine was down).

10/21/2014,5 star rating,Hands down the most genuinely nice people working there. They were so passionate about their establishment and the food accompanied by it. I had a breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the gumbo soup with a sandwich. Everything was incredible. Can't wait to go back!
2/22/2014,4 star rating,"The place was pretty empty for brunch on a Saturday. The staff was very friendly, checking to see if we needed anything and asking how the food was. The food was good. I originally ordered the waffle with fried chicken cutlet (I'm from the south) and the owner came back a saying that their waffle iron was new and it wasn't ready to be used yet. So I got the pancakes. They were good, I could tell the batter was from scratch. The chicken had been fresh fried in a light seasoned batter. Together it was comfort food. $12 for the pancakes and coffee (or tea) plus $4 for the cutlet. Expensive in my opinion but it's Manhattan and it was tasty. The friendly service was icing on the cake. I will likely come back if I'm ever in the area again."

The challah french toast was delicious with yogurt and strawberries, and I had a few bites of the frittata and turkey sausage and everyone in my party was happy with their meal!  The coffee is also delicious-- the staff whipped up the half and half cream which was pretty wonderful!"
10/16/2016,2 star rating,Just had brunch the food was only ok. The biscuit was cold and hard. The salmon cake was cold. My grandson had to wait over fifteen minutes for bacon that was ordered. He received his griddle cakes way before receiving the bacon. They need more wait staff and there was some flies.
7/7/2014,4 star rating,"We came for a late brunch here on Saturday and LOVED it. I had griddle cakes with berries, and homemade chicken apple sausage - both were RIDICULOUSly delicious. My boyf had sausage egg and cheese on a biscuit and swore it was the best biscuit he's ever eaten. It was comfortable, cool and cozy. We were there at a weird time so it wasn't crazy busy, and we had a great time chatting with the hostess and servers. Donna, the owner, even came over to make we were happy.One thing: Google will tell you that it's on Fred Doug Blvd but it's NOT, it's on Amsterdam. Luckily it was totally worth the hike!"
4/8/2017,1 star rating,"Service is slooow on a packed Saturday brunch day. 15 min to get coffee. Another 45 min to get food. I ordered a Farmer's Skillet that was dried up and over salted (and isn't it supposed to be served in a skillet?). The salad was old and limp. My boyfriend ordered the muesli, not warm like we expected, but COLD! Dry oats in a bowl with fruits took 45 min to make? Menu doesn't even specify that it's not cooked. Anything with oatmeal, people will assume is hot. And we weren't given a disclaimer by the server. The waitress (owner?) was unapologetic and made it seem like we were in the wrong, pushing us to order something else when the meal should've been comped after making us wait for so long. Also, the waiter never followed through on getting me ketchup and hot sauce. Furthermore, the same waitress asked us if were leaving when we just got in. Like, you don't even know your own customers? Not even that huge of a restaurant. The bathroom is disgusting and if it was in that state I don't even want to see the kitchen!"

3/30/2018,5 star rating,"If real home cooking is your thing, this is your place.  The food is all home cooking (by Donna, the owner) and utterly delicious. We stopped in for breakfast, and both ended up ordering the Home Skillet, which gives new meaning to mouth watering.  Home cooking takes a little longer, so if you are in a rush or the impatient type, save this place for when you have time. Be prepared to linger over your meal. Everything here, however, is worth the wait.  Before ordering, we were served water automatically, and offered a cup of good, hot coffee, which arrived at the table along with ketchup and hot sauce for our meal, served elegantly in small cups.  Our dishes came with a choice of two kinds of roasted potatoes (herbed russets or yams), or 4 kinds of grits, and a small green salad, and homemade biscuit.  I ordered the yams, and by accident ended up with both potato varieties, both of which turned out to be melt in your mouth wonderful.  My other half ordered the grits and gravy, which he pronounced lip smacking.  The ambiance in the restaurant is charming and warm, made warmer for us by the happy advent of an extended conversation with the owner.  There is live music on several evenings, and a ladies night in their schedule.  We loved the whole thing, and plan to come back for other things, and check out the dinner menu!"
9/11/2014,3 star rating,A little gem in my neighborhood. Not many places in Harlem serve food made with organic ingredients. And freshly squeezed juices. This place is a great brunch spot. The service was very attentive. Was even greeted by the owner and cook. I will definanly go back.
7/7/2015,1 star rating,Overpriced on everything. They tried to charge me $12 for a bagel and when I complained it went down to $4. I ordered muesli and it was dry and fit for farm animals. It was basically farm feed. My friends son ordered their famous grits with eggs. The entire dish tasted and looked as if it came from a instant microwaveable food. Their only saving grace was the fried chicken and pancakes that my son ordered but the waiting time for all this was nearly an hour. It felt as though they took their time to raise and grow all the ingredients for our food. I would give this establishment 0 stars but I am unable to without giving at least one.
1/24/2016,4 star rating,"Had brunch here with our 8 month old and some friends with their baby after the blizzard. I called ahead to see if they were open before hand and at the time were not. Donna the owner called me back twice! Once to let me know they were going to open and a second time  that they had staff and would have a table ready for us if we still wanted to go. Amazing customer service on her part. Food was good, Donna actually made it herself as she was the only cook. The service was a little lacking but I'm sure that's because they were understaffed, but our waiter was still very polite."
7/14/2016,1 star rating,"I visited this place on two separate occasions. The first time it was lackluster but tolerable. I thought it was me, because I like things a certain way. The second time it was bad! We we were seated Expeditiously, no problem. My daughter and I each order a skillet, mine is shrimp and hers sausage. Our food arrives and we begin eating. Don't live it but ok. Then I realize that I haven't come across a shrimp! I explain this to the waiter, he says oh I switched your orders. No problem we are family we just swap the plates. I came across one shrimp btw! This dish comes with salad. However the salad was brown. We did not eat it. I can tolerate waiting, mistakes etc. shit happens. When you serve people brown salad, that means you really do not care and I can not return to this place! I do not recommend it!"
6/29/2014,5 star rating,"I checked out Home Sweet Harlem for Sunday brunch. I didn't have to wait at all to be seated. I sat at the bar and had a lovely conversation with the guy who took my order and fixed my drink. But the best part was yet to come. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which came with eggs, stewed tomatoes, a homemade flaky buscuit, tea, and a bellini. They were out of shrimp and were able to substitute with fish. The dish was prepared to perfection and every part of the dish was outrageously delicious! I met the owner who cooked my food and she was great too, just like her staff. This restaurant is the best kept secret in Harlem!"
6/26/2016,4 star rating,"My sweetheart and I had brunch here today. We really enjoyed the food and hospitality.  They provide you with a descent amount of food of filling food. The wait for the food and Mimosas were on point.  The food was seasoned just right. Comfortable atmosphere for a Sunday brunch, not crowd at all.  The only thing I did not like were the unlimited Mimosas for just one hour. It should be extended for a least two hours. However, I will definitely go again."
6/24/2016,5 star rating,"I love the food. I had a burger with the sweet potatoes, delicious. I had a very pleasant and attentive server name Shaniah. I will recommend this restaurant to all my coworkers and family."
3/15/2014,5 star rating,"My mom and I were staying in the area and stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday. What a gem! The biscuit sandwich was seriously the best I have had. The biscuit was so tender and flaky. Eggs cooked and seasoned perfectly. My mom had the rosemary potatoes and I had the grits and gravy. Both were wonderful accompaniments and perfectly done. Service was so friendly and attentive. The owner sat and talked to us and was very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. Highly recommended!"
11/23/2015,5 star rating,"Few places in Harlem are more inviting and welcoming than this gem.  I appreciate a good brunch and Home Sweet Harlem has one of the best I've ever been to.  The frittatas are super tasty and the french toast is quite savory.  The portions are sizeable and will keep you stuffed for the day and give you the right base if you decide to imbibe in the bottomless drinks, which I encourage you to do.  The customer service is a delight and very attentive.  I enjoy this place so much that I often take out of town guests and family members here since I know whatever they have will be tasty and their experiences will be exceptional.  Glad to live nearby this place."
7/5/2015,1 star rating,"Found this restaurant on Yelp as I was looking for a restaurant in Harlem that served a slightly healthier brunch (aka no soul food). E and I walked into the restaurant and there were about 4-5 other diners there. There was no hostess or wait-staff to greet us so we just grabbed one of the empty tables while catching the eye of a waiter. We sat there waiting...and waiting..and waiting for menus. Weird because the restaurant was pretty empty and I knew the waiter saw us grabbing the table. Finally I hail him down and he tells us that we can't actually dine there because they were expecting a church group. The owner then came out and offered for us to sit at a bar, by the door. We were ok with this since we were waiting for our other friend to arrive so moved to the bar area. However, the door was left open and I asked them to close it because it was a rainy and cool day. They refused to accommodate this request even though the restaurant was empty and it was very chilly by the door. So with everything combined, we decided to just forget dining there and left. It was obvious they didn't want us there and why force our patronage on a restaurant? So we went to Trufa and had a pretty delicious brunch instead. Avoid, particularly if its a Sunday!"
5/4/2014,5 star rating,Excellent service and food! The brunch menu has a good variety of choices. Everything I eat was very fresh.
3/24/2018,4 star rating,"I have recently visited this location again as i have been many times before even celebrated a birthday here. However things have changed Daisy isn't there anymore (Sad). My waitress was not so pleasant and had a bit lack luster service. She spent more time just looking around instead of serving and keeping up with her tables. We ordered unlimited mimosas and if it weren't for the only delightful person that day Mavelin we would've probably only got 1 or 2 refills. When she seen we were in need of anything she gracefully came from the bar to assist us as our waitress was no where around for 15 min at a time. Mavelin was such a delight that she was the only reason that made our experience positive great energy,great service and great conversation. The unfortunate pat was after our meal and drinks was completely done our original waitress decided to come over and explain that she had a long day or she would've been better.... someone teach Jennifer that in the service business the ""The Time is Now"" not next time. As we were wrapping up we could see and hear the bus boy and waitress cursing and yelling at Mavelin instead of focusing on the guests like professionals. Four stars just for Mavelin and the food!"
3/21/2017,4 star rating,Daisy is such a pleasure. She makes an outstanding sangria!  I was recommended by a friend and then I recommended a friend and now that friend is recommending friends. See you soon guys!
3/20/2016,1 star rating,"This was a joke! First of all, we had to step up to enter, so disable individuals were NOT welcome. We were NOT seated in the ONLY booth because we were told it was ""reserved"" for a party of five. Our waitress was uninformed, and the answers to any questions should have been, ""I don't know, but I'll find out."" Instead, she simply answered, ""I don't know."" When we were forced to sit at a particular table, we thought perhaps we could still get on with our meal. When four vanilla people came in well after us, their order taken, and then served while we still waited, we simply left cash for the drinks on our table and left.  Even if the food is good, it's not worth being disrespected and ignored. Perhaps it's only to serve City College people? It is very clear the people of color are not welcome."
3/2/2016,4 star rating,"This is a great little spot to grab brunch with the girls or with a new boo. Good food. Very nice owner. Service varies, but mostly good."
2/6/2014,5 star rating,"This restaurant is, in my view, the crown jewel of the neighborhood.  I teach across the street at City College, and I've been waiting a long time for a place like Home-sweet-harlem to open.   It's in the location that used to be the restaurant ""La Pregunta"".  But H.Sw.Harlem. is on a different level altogether.  When you order a coffee, they ask if you want steamed milk.  (Not just for espresso drinks, even with regular coffee!)   The coffee (and espresso) are excellent.      I haven't sampled all of the food on the menu, but I can say that the soups are amazing.  I've had the  Curry Lentil soup (really special) and the Turkey Chili (also excellent).  As you know from the earlier reviews, the staff are wonderful, and the layout of the place is charming.   The general motif of the menu is 'healthy-eating' but also 'delicious'.  This is a winner."
3/17/2018,5 star rating,"Omg....where do is START! This place is absolutely incredible! From the food, to the service, to the Vibe. I came here not knowing what to expect. I was visiting Harlem, staying in an Airbnb, debating on whether or not I wanted to move to the area. I found the restaurant on yelp and the reviews were good. So decided to go for brunch. The staff was overwhelmingly gracious and welcoming. It was an unexpectedly amazing way to start my morning. The owner literally personally grilled me up the best shrimp and grits to ever grace my taste buds!!! I'm talking overwhelmingly delicious. I was eating alone and she witnessed my enthusiasm while eating the food, and asked to join me for a few minutes. Now, me not being from the area and thinking of moving to the area was completely enthused at the fact that owner of this establishment with such excellent food wanted to sit with me and chat me up over her cooking. She joined and I got to know her a bit. And what a GEM! She is super passionate about her business and the impact that she wants to have with her clientele. Her passion was inspiring. I decided in that moment that Harlem was the place for me!! Thank you Home Sweet Harlem for keeping the true spirit of Harlem and hospitality alive in your establishment. I suggest that anyone in the area who wants to have some good home cooking at amazing prices to come here. You won't regret it!!!!"
6/6/2015,5 star rating,"This place is da bomb. Stopped in for brunch and left very satisfied. Had the Farmers breakfast fritata with grits and a biscuit. All were on point. The biscuit was light and flaky.  The grits were wonderfully creamy and the frititta is a well balanced blend of egg, cheese and potatoes in a light pastry shell. Our host, Donna, is very friendly and welcoming and the perfect addition to a great visit."
7/2/2014,5 star rating,nice little coffee shop with wifi and the food is really good and the cook is a sweet heart!! if i lived closer i would go be there all the time to just relax and get something too eat before i go home............im going back for sure
6/29/2014,2 star rating,"I went with my friend on Sunday morning for brunch. I ordered the shrimp & grits w/ turkey sausage, oj & coffee & my friend ordered the frittata with a side of salmon cakes, Arnold Palmer & coffee. The service was terrible- a group of 4 walked in 15 mins after us & was immediately given water & mimosas; I had to ask for water. Food came- shrimp & grits were ok, sausage was too sweet- very average food. I was never given a spoon for my coffee & had to ask for it. Biscuit was bad. My friend said her salmon cakes tasted like they were out of a can, she received a lemonade instead of an Arnold Palmer &  the lemonade had a medicinal taste ( they exchanged it for a sweet tea); her frittata was ok and was very rustic with largely chopped veggies. My friend asked for butter for her biscuit 3 times & I asked for my oj 3 times. I don't know if it was an off day for them, but I would not recommend this place & would never go back. I hope they read this & improve their service & food.  It definitely was not worth $20 for each entree."
4/13/2014,5 star rating,"Great brunch spot.  We had an excellent meal with great service.  I got the pancakes, eggs, salmon cakes and greek yogurt with bananas.  The pancakes were delicious and everything was properly cooked.  My girlfriend got the farmer's skillet which was a fluffy egg frittata with a good portion of turkey sausage and potatoes, red peppers and onions.  Very, very tasty.  Plus, they refilled my coffee as much as I wanted, which is a huge plus in my book.  All in all, will definitely be back."
5/30/2014,2 star rating,"Food was ok, nothing remarkable. Service was terrible. Many of the dishes our table ordered were inaccurate or not delivered at all. Here for lunch with only two other tables, but the waiter was really overwhelmed."
2/10/2014,5 star rating,I love this place! It's become my home away from home. I am in Harlem a lot bug usually on 8th ave but I make a special trip to go here to just say hi and grab a bite to eat. Love the soups and I can't wait to see what the spring and summer holds for this hidden Harlem gem. Say hello to Donna the owner. She's the best!
6/14/2015,1 star rating,"Instant regret. Water tasted horrible, horrible service, utensiles looks like they weren't washed, and the turn around for food.... don't  waste your time. You will be disappointed. Utterly disappointed."
6/3/2015,5 star rating,"Delicious food every time! I love the cheese and noodle souffle. I have been here a couple times for dinner, once bringing a group of 40 for an event. They were helpful, accommodating and gracious. Another time I planned to meet some colleagues here for dinner and they were closing but actually opened up their doors and stayed open for us. If that's not customer service I don't know what is!"
5/12/2015,4 star rating,"Been here a couple of times, the food is good! I had the best buffalo wings I've ever tasted here (though unfortunately they are no longer on the menu, but there's plenty of other good food to make up for that). I ordered the St Nicholas burger just earlier today. The restaurant doesn't serve anything that walks on four legs, so it was a turkey burger. Came with turkey bacon, herb cheddar, grilled onions, romaine lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun with a side of baked sweet potatoes. My friend had a similar burger with cream cheese (unusual condiment for a burger and he liked it) and a side of baked potatoes, and we had a glass of fresh homemade lemonade on the side. The space is well-lit with exposed brick walls and folk art paintings hung all around the place. The staff are super friendly and gracious, including the owner who clearly takes pride in serving great food and will go out of her way to make sure you are satisfied IF YOU TALK TO HER!!! My friend and I had lunch and stuck around for another good 40 minutes after we ate studying and they were cool with it. Displeased yelpers who left bad reviews below could have easily remedied their issues if they had just spoken up. I never understood why people will take their complaints to yelp instead of actually trying to resolve them, valid or not. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. I was looking over at the table next to mine and they were having some tasty-looking avocado dish, so I'll probably order that next."
10/30/2014,5 star rating,"As I was walking towards CCNY (City College), I suddendly bumped into the place. I walked in, and the environment was super low key, quiet and very neat with a friendly staff. Great music choice; nothing crazy, over the top or loud, that you can't establish a good communication with whomever is there with you (like in must places in NYC). But let's cut to the chase, I went with the lunch option of a turkey burger with baked potatoes and I finished it off with a homemade piece of sweet potato pie. I was stunt! The food was done just right with the perfect touch of flavor. Every item placed in my burger, in the potatoes and in the pie was totally fresh and truly organic. The freshness of the food and the cook's hands it's a slamming combo. Some people ask a lot for their buck, but I am only interested on quality not quantity. With this said, I believe the serving size at this location is a nice normal portion that definitely does justice for its price, quality and flavor. Two thumbs up!"
6/21/2014,4 star rating,Came to this place for breakfast on a weekday. The staff was absolutely amazing. They were very sweet and very attentive. The food was also pretty great and I definitely plan on coming back here again sometime soon. I do feel like it is a little pricey for breakfast food but every now and then it doesn't hurt.
12/10/2014,4 star rating,I fell in love with this place when I walked in.. The staff is super sweet and the dining area is so cozy and homey. I felt like I was eating my Grandma's food. It was on the heavy side but in a good way! prices are great as well...
8/16/2014,5 star rating,"This place was hands down my favorite place in New York. The staff is ridiculously friendly and the food is delicious! They were really welcoming and we ate here 4/9 days. You know the food is good when you keep going back even though your visiting a new city that has countless options! They were also incredibly kind as they let me park myself and my two huge pieces of luggage inside while we waited for a few hours until it was time to go to the airport. Recommendations: Challah French Toast and a Latte (seriously best latte in New York, and I'm picky!)."
10/23/2016,5 star rating,"When we first arrived at 10:30 a.m., having read that the restaurant opened at 10, they were closed.  A woman came to the door and said rather brusquely that they were accommodating a catering order, and they would possibly be open by 11.  We wandered over to the Hamilton Grange, had a tour and enjoyed the park, and then, since it was on our way anyway, a few minutes after Noon, we returned to Home Sweet Harlem, which was JUST opening,  Business quickly picked up -it was clear that other customers had been awaiting the opening - and the single waitress/hostess was already running behind.  The cook came out to tell us they were running slowly, that they apologized.  But no offer was made to sweeten our experience or to mitigate what felt like a blow-off by the waitress.  HOWEVER, though the food did take an inordinate amount of time to get to us, it was superb.  The coffee, which is included in the price of the food,  is delicious, and the fritattas we ordered were perfect, served with a choice of grits/gravy or potatoes or sweet potatoes.  (I had sweet potatoes, which were done to perfection, and my friend had grits with the gravy, which she judged as excellent as well).  I have not had as good or as reasonably priced a brunch in a very long time.  I sure hope this restaurant gets its act together in terms of customer service because the food is truly exceptional.  My advice to anyone heading over there is that you call first and make sure they are open.  Unfortunately, there is probably no way to ensure that you will be served quickly, so go prepared to be patient. . . ."
5/4/2014,4 star rating,"Amazing Food and atmosphere!  They have a really sweet staff. Have had dinner and brunch there and have been more than satisfied each time. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because sometimes the staff can be a bit forgetful with minor things, but they are truly a sweet and polite bunch."
8/9/2014,1 star rating,"You're better off popping into  a cheap chain restaurant. Very ordinary cuisine at extraordinary prices, slow service, a misleading menu and ridiculously poor value for money. If you're not overly particular, ihop could provide the same meal with more bang for your buck. If you'd like to get what you pay for, head over to Malcolm X Blvd and roll a dice. I promise, any place will be better. Extremely disappointed with my $23 brunch that added up to 3 regular pancakes, scrambled eggs, ONE sausage link and a flute of pastuerized orange juice (not the freshly squeezed OJ that they advertise)."
2/9/2016,2 star rating,"Cute atmosphere, GREAT MUSIC, great food...HORRIBLE SERVICE. I almost never leave reviews like this but I must of had the worst waitress in the world when I ate here. It took at least 5 minutes for her to come over and greet us, and when she did she awkwardly asked us how we were and then said she would be back with waters...5 minutes later she comes back with two waters (there were three of us) we told her we needed some time even though she looked like she had no interest in taking our orders. 10 minutes later we order and get our food in a timely manner. And that was the last I saw of our waitress. All three of us had to get up and walk to the counter to get coffee and water refills. We literally waited 40+ minutes (after we had finished) to get a bill and a take out box. And we still had to get up and flag down another employee for the box. She was still in the store, I could see her walking around, sitting down, and wiping off random tables while we ate but she never came back over to our table except to bring us the bill after we all stood up, put on coats on and waited. I wish I knew her name."
3/14/2015,2 star rating,"One afternoon, a few of my friends and a few staff members from my old high school decided to try Home Sweet Harlem. We checked the reviews on Yelp and they had great reviews and ratings so we were ecstatic about trying out this place to eat. As soon as we entered, the place was awkwardly empty. Two people in my party had ordered something on the menu and they were all out. Our food came out at different times, and the St. Nick Park burger (which had been recommend) was tiny, cold, and the grilled onions were barely cooked! My friend and I ordered shrimp that contained brown rice and the rice was not even cooked all the way! I asked the waiter about the rice and he said it was supposed to be crispy. If I wanted crispy brown rice I would have asked, however that was not an option on the menu.  Twice we asked for glasses of water and our waiter kept forgetting! Not only that, he seemed confused the whole time we kept asking him questions about the food. The automatic gratuity that they added was overpriced and nowhere near what the waiter deserved. I give this place 2 stars. B for effort and a C for semi-good food."
