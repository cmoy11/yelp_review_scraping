6/24/2017,5 star rating,"Incredible restaurant!! We ordered a traditional Senagalese chicken dish, Le Poulet Yassan, and the Kasbah Lamb Shank. Both were absolutely incredible - wish I could describe it more but you have to try these dishes yourselves. The chicken was well spiced and the lamb had a great sauce. These dishes are pricey but com in generous portions. Three of us split two dishes and it was the perfect amount of food. If you're looking for something different to drink, I'd recommend the French Ginger cocktail. It was tasty and definitely worth trying. We also got a free cheesecake which added to the good experience. I definitely need to come back here again!!"
5/27/2017,4 star rating,"I had dinner with party of 10 friends here. We loved the ambience and the fact that it closed at mid-night which gave us time to drink, chat and catch-up. Food-wise, I had the Le Poulet Tagine and replaced the couscous with rice. It was delicious! My only reservation was that we ordered the ""sweet plantains"" and it seemed like the rubbed syrup on the plantains . I like my plantains fried with no syrup. A friend ordered plantains and it didn't have syrup. I'm not sure if the offer 2 different types of plantains so beware. Lol. I also loved that they gave us separate checks without us having to ask for it!"
6/21/2016,4 star rating,"The Quick: Great brunch with standard and more eclectic options. Easily seated a group of 5 with no wait. Great indoor/outdoor option for summer.The Details:  overall we had a great experience at this restaurant. The staff was friendly, they kept our coffee mugs full, and did not rush us out. The scramble was the groups favorite with a side of lamb sausage, but everything we had was very tasty. We did not love the bloody Mary as it was I have a taste of tomato. But absolutely return.Pro tip: They have a phenomenal happy hour with drink and food specials if you're in the area. The Damage: Brunch for 5, with multiple sides and one drink was ~ $100 before tip."
4/7/2016,4 star rating,"Dinner for two on a Saturday night! This was the only place in our list of restaurants that had a table available so we decided to give it a try. It was a small restaurant but very cozy with great decor. It's a great place for a date! We ordered the crab cake special for appetizers. It was extremely tasty. They also put this cole slaw type thing on the bottom which complemented the crab cake. I was impressed. Only thing was the portion - there was only one serving, I think we each took like 3 small bites max. I wish it was a bigger portion. As for entree, I ordered the seafood linguine and my friend ordered the seafood risotto. They were both great. The risotto wasn't too soggy or too hard. My dish was too saucy and too bland for my taste. I was looking for pepper and salt but I didn't want to ruin the dish. We also got a free creme brulee for checking in via Yelp! But it was a disappointment. It was a pre-made refrigerated dessert, we did not like it at all. Overall, the experience was great! Our waitress was attentive and nice. I would come back!"
5/7/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for Saturday brunch. Interior was pretty standard bistro looking, waiter was very smily and friendly.We had the Lobster Benedict and Steak and Frites. The portion for both dishes are decent, not too much and not too little.Lobster Benedict was tasty. Great hollandaise sauce and lobster was succulent! Home fries was perfectly cooked.The steak came perfect medium-rare. The super peppery steak sauce was very delicious. Their fries is crispy and very yummy.We also got the free cheesecake from Yelp check-in. (You can choose Creme brûlée or cheesecake).I'm very interested in their dinner menu as well, will come back to try!-dinner review-We ordered Niokolokoba coz we kind of love their brunch steak. Same amazing peppery sauce and fries we love! But the sirloin was a bit tougher not the type of meat I love....Had the fish empanadas and fried chicken wing as the appetizer. The spicy sauce came with it was mind-blowing!"
11/22/2016,5 star rating,"As I was looking up places on Yelp that delivered, Ponty Bistro was one of the closest with a high rating and I was intrigued because they serve African food. I'm not entirely sure if the cuisine here engulfs many different countries or just features one culture, but either way Ponty Bistro was enough to make me deeply consider a foodie trip to Africa.So delivery. In New York. On a Friday night.But no joke, I got my food in a little under thirty minutes. And when it arrived, I think a chef actually delivered it (based on his attire). And they had a deal going where if you ordered over $35 or $40 you also got a free cheesecake. And being that they had so many tantalizing options, it was not hard to rack up a $40 bill.I ordered the Fataya (similar to an empanada), Three Cheese Gougere (a cheesy bread pastry), Moules Africana (mussels), Rosemary Potatoes, and of course the free Cheesecake. Everything, and I mean everything, was delicious. Both the gougere and mussels had a little kick, but it wasn't overwhelming. And the sauce the mussels were in was amazing for dipping the gougere and the potatoes. What really surprised me about the mussels was the amount, I ordered the appetizer size which is smaller than the entree, but it was still a lot of food. The Fataya were really delicious and I can't really describe the flavors inside other than to say I devoured them quickly.But the cheesecake. The CHEESECAKE! With the first bite the only thing that raced through my mind: Have I ever even had real cheesecake before? Honestly, I don't think they use cream cheese, I think they use mascarpone. This was the smoothest, most heavenly cheesecake I've ever had. I would absolutely put them as one of the top cheesecakes I've ever had.I don't know when I'll be back in NY, but I know when I am I'll be making it a tradition to eat at Ponty Bistro. The food was beautiful (even being served in plastic containers), flavorful, and sinfully good!"
2/7/2017,3 star rating,"Good food, bad price. I got the seafood risotto. It was quite delicious. the flavors and the little kick, and good amount of seafood. But it wasn't really worth $30 to me. why did i order it? i guess i felt the yolo calling me that day. My friend got the mussels which were really good. well cooked with a good aromaservice was nice but a little curt.i think on food alone, this place deserves a 4 or 4.5, but it's just unnecessarily expensive. maybe if i was richer i could rate it higher haha but $30 for a risotto hmmmm... i can get 4 burritos with that."
11/25/2016,5 star rating,"If there is any place to be impressed by service, this is it. There's no rush to leave, but the waiter seemed to know exactly when to step in and transition from course to course. My friend, a bit of a food snob, and I were impressed by the main courses!This is a fantastic place to celebrate or splurge on a nice meal. The attention to detail on plating and food flavors was rather fantastic. Relatively good prices on drinks! Was empty when we got in at 5:30, but more people showed up around 6. Music at a perfect level or loudness to make silences not awkward and not too loud as to disrupt conversation."
4/13/2014,2 star rating,"Open Letter to Ponty (Part One):Respect ALL of your customers. Do not participate in voucher programs if the end result is unfavorable to your business and it's future. I have to say that last night was quite an unexpected and unpleasant experience that my friend and I had dining at your establishment. Firstly, I'll start off with this: I first learned about your restaurant through Groupon a couple of years ago. You offered a three course meal with wine for a very reasonable price and the thought of trying African/French fusion was very intriguing to me. I was hooked. I loved the food, the ambience, the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. Based on my initial visit, I returned; I returned quite a few times, thereafter. On several occasions, I brought my sister, a chef friend, my husband and his mother, many other friends on different nights and some other family members as well. On a few of these occasions, I used vouchers that you offered on the different social dining sites but more often than not, my guests and I paid full price for our meals because I felt your food and treatment of your patrons was that good.I consider myself a foodie and I work in the medical field, along with many other people from all walks of life and, when asked for my input on a good place to dine in the city, your establishment was the first I would recommend. I have written wonderful reviews and tips on Yelp about your food, staff and how amiable they have all ways been, each and every time I have visited. A few fellow Yelpers even decided to try you guys out after reading my review because of how much I raved about your food and my dining experiences. Last night however, made me see your restaurant in a different light. My sister and I purchased a few vouchers and realized that they would be expiring this week. Each voucher was worth $40 off the bill, along with a dessert. Each voucher cost $27. Essentially, the patron is getting $13 off the bill and a free dessert. This deal is a far cry from what you offered when your restaurant was doing much more poorly. I used my voucher for a dinner with my husband and mother-in-law on Sunday, returned again with my sister on Wednesday for another meal and then again yesterday with a new friend that I had wanted to bring to your establishment for quite some time but never got around to doing so. I live in Westchester, so you can understand the commute to Murray Hill is not an easy one. Between all three nights, I believe I spent about $300, not including our very generous tips for your staff or the cost of the vouchers. Considering that we only received thirteen dollars off of each meal and two complimentary desserts out of the three dinners, I think we supported your establishment plenty."
4/11/2014,2 star rating,"Open Letter to Ponty (PART II):Open Letter to Ponty:Now to talk about last night in more detail. I made reservations for my friend and I to enjoy your food and I raved about how much she would enjoy the evening for the entire drive downtown. We stood in the doorway with another group of patrons, waiting for the bustling dining room to empty some, so that we might get tables soon. After some time, we were seated and waited a little too long for our menus, considering the couple who arrived about fifteen minutes after us, waited for about ten more minutes, were seated and promptly given menus. Maybe I should have taken that as an omen but instead, I decided to graciously request a menu from what looked to be the only server you had on staff on such a busy night; another reason I let the menu mishap go.We ordered a bottle of wine, some appetizers and our entrees. We had some light conversation with the friendly gentlemen seated next to us. One of them was French and he was dining with a friend whom he brought to your establishment with the same intent that I had; to offer a delightfully new meal and experience to a colleague. The Frenchman inquired as to how I came across your restaurant and I began to explain that it all started with the voucher program.I told him that the cuisine sounded interesting and after trying the food, my sister and I were hooked. I was telling him that I visited the restaurant a few times earlier in the week. I was in the middle of explaining to him that my sister gifted me the voucher we were using for dinner because it was going to expire when you, Cisse, after overhearing what could only have been a portion of our conversation, we're prompted to attempt to embarrass and berate my friend and I by telling our dining neighbors that you don't make money from the voucher system. You proceeded to climb some imaginary restaurateur soapbox and explain how the voucher system doesn't help your business and how the companies harass you to utilize their program when it doesn't benefit you. You took it a step further to retrieve a receipt to show how little you make from the vouchers and explained how much your food costs. Side Note: About how much profit did you make from that bottle of Sancerre I purchased? It cost almost $40 on your menu but I am sure it probably cost less than $15 retail and you probably spent even less for it, wholesale.  You spoke in English but mostly French and I gather, from the reaction of our neighbors, that you were being a bit insulting. I really wish you would have spoken completely in English because then, maybe, I would have put you in your place right then and there. You spoke as if you were disgusted by patrons who use vouchers. You walked over to the four-top that were huddled alongside my friend and I while we waited for our tables upon arrival, and proclaimed that you are only in business because of them. That they have been dining with you from the beginning and they are the patrons that keep the heart of your establishment beating! This, I'm assuming, was to separate the voucher diners (us) with the originals (them). My question to you, then, is WHY ever participate in the voucher program in the first place? Why after your business picked up, did you continue to participate over and over again through more than one voucher company on several occasions over the years and sometimes, even participating on multiple sites simultaneously? It seems to me that your little rant and how you would like your business ethic to be, are a bit of a contradiction. I must say that you may have lost in your effort to try and make us look bad. I felt vindicated when the gentlemen seated next to us assured me that we had nothing to apologize for and again, if your establishment gets no no benefit from the voucher system, then you should not participate. Plain and simple. I am happy for your sake, Cisse, that you chose to verbally attack two women because had my husband been my dinnermate, I believe the night might have ended quite differently for you. Not to mention, the reason I stated earlier that I received two out of the three desserts is because once we received out check, we left. You turned a nice night sour and we weren't even able to full enjoy ourselves. You chastised us enough to leave our dessert and we won't be back to claim it. You obviously need it more that we do. Neither my or my husband's family will be dining with you. My friends will not be dining with you and I will be sure to pass this little experience on to my chef friend who I am sure will not be dining with you in the near or distant future. In the future, if Groupon or LivingSocial bully you into participating in their voucher programs, why not add to the fine print and ask that patrons who have utilized a voucher in your establishment in the past please not purchase another for use in the future. After doing so, let's see how many new followers you have, dining with yo"
3/2/2012,5 star rating,"First time here. Dining out with my sister.We used a Living Social voucher to dine here after a harrowing shoe shopping adventure.  I must say that I was intrigued to try this African/French Fusion cuisine.  It's a small and dimly lit, sexxi little spot; a go-to for a romantic first-date or a date night with your already established, significant other.  Good stuff.  The decor is cool with a very chill vibe and the staff is just so friendly and very accommodating.Our main server, Jeanette, was just the bestest.  We we perusing the menu, wanting to order much more than we originally intended and Jeanette knew that we were excited to try everything.  She was soooo sweet and very knowledgeable about the ingredients used in the dishes, which was a plus, considering that my sis is vegetarian and wanted to make sure no meat stock was used in the production of some of the dishes.So, we were asking about various items form the menu.  I asked about the soup special, which was Carrot Ginger but, instead, settled upon ordering the Moules Africana.  My sis ordered the Three Cheeses Gougere (French Cheese Puffs).  To our surprise, we were brought two tasing bowls of the Carrot Ginger Soup!  Jeanette wanted to make sure we didn't miss out so she gifted us a taste of the soup which was so creamy and silky with hints of ginger and citrus.  I told you she was awesome!!My Moules Africana was OMG!  I've had provencal/mariniere and tomato sauces with my mussels and I have to say that these mussels with the African seasoning and spices trump all others I have ever had.  The dish was so tasty and unique, I requested a spoon so I could finish every single drop of it.  When I feast, I take no prisoners and if I enjoy, I ENJOY.  BTW, they have an Early Dinner Pre-Fixe Menu and a Mussel Special (Call to find out the days/times).For our entrees, I ordered the Lobster Risotto which was creamy, cheesy and chock full of succulent chunks of fresh lobster meat.  To die for.  Very well seasoned with a nice texture.  Perfectly prepared.  My sis ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto and I think that, despite not containing a protein in the dish, it may have been prepared even better than my risotto.  I seriously had risotto-envy.  If sis ate seafood, I would have been brought back to elementary school times of trading meals (You know, ""I'll trade you my PB&J for your Twinkie"").  Its ok, though, because now I know what I'll be ordering when I make a return visit.Now, mind you, we could not even finish our entrees because we were stuffed but that didn't stop me from ordering dessert (perhaps you have not yet seen my self-proclaimed nickname?).  We shared the Caramelized Apple Tarte Tatin with, wait for it, Cinnamon Ice Cream!  So good!  The only thing with the dessert is that I wish the Tarte Tatin was heated up a bit more.  Both components match perfectly, though, and rounded out an exceptional meal.On a side note, we were greeted and regularly checked upon by A. Cisse, one of the owners/executive chefs of this fine dining establishment and I didn't even realize it.  He was so nice and funny.  Very attentive to our needs and genuinely interested in whether or not we were enjoying ourselves.  A woman dropped by to order a few desserts for take out.  She stood right next to our table to make her order and I could tell that she was a regular.  Mr. Cisse knew her right away and over-hearing the conversation, I could tell that her patronage was greatly appreciated in a most sincere manner.  That tells me that this is a restaurant that deserves a big following.  They care about their patrons and the products that they serve.  The Ponty Bistro is a definite KEEP in my restaurant 'black book""  :o)"
1/24/2014,3 star rating,"French and Africian cuisine? Sure, why not. 9 degrees out? No problem, I'm a NYer. It was my friend's turn to pick a restaurant this month and she wanted something different other than our usual Italian, Asian or American. That's when she stumbled upon Ponty Bistro AND booked it through Savored to get 30% off. Yay!It's not a huge place but it's not too small either where it'll be rubbing elbows with your neighbor. Once you step through the double doors, you're greeted by the warmth, cozy, dark yet light setting. The Christmas lights hanging all around and the little tiny well lit bar reminded me of Whiskey Soda lounge in Brooklyn. We started off with some yummy sangria then appetizers (listed by order of preference):Truffle mac and cheese - wow.... never knew mac and cheese can taste this good. So THAT'S what truffle taste like, kinda garlicky. Topped with shaved cheese on top, my favorite out of the three. I think my friends heard me say ""Mmmmm"" at least 3x lol. Escargot snails - infused with garlic, butter, herbs and cognac. Yummy especially when you dip it with bread. Although I had better (best was at Jewel Bistro), the flavors were all there and quite tasty. Mussels - small mussels but the tomato broth was good. It had a spicy finish at the end which I liked. My friends order the Niokolokoba (grilled sirloin steak with Senegal spices) and Kasbah Lamb Shank with Merguez (five spices, couscous, and merguez sauce). I'm not a fan of lamb, too gamey. The peppercorns and spices on the steak were very overwhelming and basically overpowered the entire taste. I ordered the Poulet Yassa (traditional chicken dish from Senegal). Honestly, I was disappointed in all the entree dishes especially mines. I guess I was expecting a more exotic taste but what I got was a roasted chicken with a tangy veggie sauce. Ten minutes into eating, I was still left wondering how to describe it. The appetizers definitely outshined the entrees.For dessert, we asked our hot Adam Levine look alike waiter to bring us a tiramisu. It looked so good and heavenly! We could not stop drooling.....  wait, am I talking about the waiter or the dessert? :X This definitely saved this review. Top with a chocolate sauce, powdered sugar and strawberries. Creamy middle. I practically ate all of it. Sorry ladies."
8/20/2016,4 star rating,Potty Bistro is a very nice quaint restaurant that would be a great first  date restaurant. The staff was extremely nice and the food was delicious. I had the 5 star risotto which was customized to my liking. Others in my party had chicken and lamp chops which were very tasty. It was topped with a delicious piece of cheesecake.
11/6/2015,5 star rating,Last July My friend and i went this restaurant while waiting for a comedy show on the cross street. We asked the waiter for any suggestions and foods were fantastic! I strongly recommend this place!
5/7/2016,1 star rating,The lamb shank was terrible . Omg didn't enjoy it at all. It wasn't boiled enough and it was so hard to chew. The service was slow as well. I won't be returning . The servers were nice and polite though
1/13/2017,4 star rating,"Lovely WAITSTAFF and good MUSIC, although it stopped for maybe 10 mins as if to signal closing time when it was just the 8 of us and another table of 2 left. Then, it restarted when another table for 3 came in.Kindly, they were able to take 4 separate credit cards when we paid the bill. It was nice not to have the limit set at, say, 2 credit cards.*WINTER TIP* It was a bit cold at the front of the restaurant even though they have an extra canvas door outside. If all the doors are open at once, in comes the cool breeze.Onto the feasting section...FOOD:_ CRISPY TUNA ($14) seared tuna was a lovely with a crispy phyllo dough surprise!   Highly recommended!_ FISH FATAYA ($12) salmon empanada was tasty_ STRIPED BASS *special* ($32) with asparagus & ratatouille was nice_ LE POULET YASSA ($26) with white rice was tasty. Chicken is on the bone._ TARTE TATIN ($8) with vanilla ice cream   = Apples were toooo sweet, as if coated in caramel. Would not get it again._ PROFITEROLES ($8)    = I had a bite and it was enjoyable. Another friend could not get enough!Would return, especially with their $10 for $20 Yelp deal and/or their free dessert with 2 entrees check-in deal. Curious to try their chicken appetizer, truffle mac, and would definitely re-order the SEARED TUNA."
9/9/2015,4 star rating,"Great option for a nice casual dinner with excellent choices!Their menu is very varied from traditional dishes to typical NY new american type food. Aka great to bring people to dinner here since everyone can find something. We came on a Thurday( before a holiday weeked) at around 6:30 and was completely empty, but by 8pm it was packed! Our waitress was great! Super nice, gave great suggestions, we decided to get the traditional senegal dishes because, why not, I can get an asian steak salad at panera if I so desperately need too. We ordered the crab cake to start, it was pretty good, a little dry. The ""Yassa"" dish was so good, the chicken tasted super delicious, it reminded me a lot of coq a vin, with rice. Would reccommed trying something different. Also, the portion is HUGE. We also tried to do the yelp (check in for a free dessert!) but that only applies to the tiramasu and creme bruelee, but we wanted the nutella crepe, it was SO good....heavy on the nutella, which is always good."
5/27/2015,4 star rating,"A cute charming reaturuant tucked away on the east side of Manhattan.  Ive had this place in my bookmarked list for a while and I decided to finally try it out.  Im glad I did.  I arrived at 6 there was only one couple there but little by little more people came.  They have a special from 11pm-7pm 2 for 1 martinis (say what?!) They won me over instantly. I ordered the Lamb Shank and although it was a little sweet and I needed to ask for salt I found the lamb very tender even though I ordered it Medium Well (that takes skills).  The food was so good I went ahead and ordered the Moules Africana and that sauce was on point!  I felt like I was ALMOST close to Haiti lol although different, the french and african mixture bought a sense of home. My server was very attentive and we even had a discussion of his native country Nepal and the recent events that have taken place there.  This place is awsome and I would deffinitly return!!  Hopefully we can schedule a yelp event here."
3/7/2015,4 star rating,"We came here thanks to a Travelzoo deal and had an excellent lunch!  Ponty Bistro has some pretty unique offerings like octopus and escargot, and this is definitely the kind of place where you should consider deviating from your food comfort zone.  Everything we got was delicious, service was fast and friendly, and we will definitely be returning again!"
1/23/2015,5 star rating,"This is probably one of my top ten favorite restaurants in NYC. Unique food and excellent service!Pros:-2 for 1 Martinis till 7pm on a Friday! They have a bunch of different flavors, even lychee!-servers were very attentive. My water cup was never empty and they described their special dishes perfectly-the food!!! Yes, it may seem a little pricey but the portions are generous and food is scrumptious! Their steak plate (starts with an Niccio...something) was my favorite-we also ordered the chicken and seafood risotto- which were both awesome (you'll definitely have leftovers)-I wish I had more room to try their Mac and cheese because I saw another table order it and it looked amazeballs-the chef came out and greeted every table! Such great service :)-clean bathroom-they take reservations! Cons:-the place gets pretty packed starting around 8pm so o would definitely make reservations to avoid a waitHope to come back again soon!"
9/20/2015,4 star rating,"Delicious, and wish I could've ordered more off the menu because there were so many tempting options. Had the following:Mussels in African Spices -- Favorite dish. The sauce was rich and creamy, chock full of perfectly cooked garlic and onions. Escargot -- Good, but I wanted it a little saltier.Niokolokoba -- Sirloin steak in a Senegalese spiced sauce. Excellent service. Will be back to try more soon."
1/6/2017,2 star rating,"My brunch partner and I popped in to this restaurant on a whim. We are faced with the dimly lit nondescript quiet spot and bustling Manhattan. I was interested in the mixture of food from African, French to American and wanted to try something unique. Nothing really jumped out at me and the atmosphere was not wowing me so After hemming and hawing over some interesting items I settled for steak and eggs. I choose over easy eggs that were perfect they came with potatoes and a few pieces of chewy hanger steak. The meet had flavor but was tough to get through. There was a full table of local regulars next-door that were enjoying all sorts of plates of food. I kind of wish I sat with them and ordered better."
3/26/2015,5 star rating,"The food is amazing and prices are fair. I had THAI CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS, VICTORIA LAC SALMON and the CRÈME BRULEE. The portions are just right, you will be satisfied but not overstuffed. If you like extra large meals you might have to order seconds. 2 for 1 martinis till 7pm!! If you want to get away from the usual meal come here for a refreshing change. Chef and owner Cisse and his staff, always have a smile, are happy, friendly, accommodating and connected. I had forgotten my reading glasses and the waiter must have notice my difficulty in reading the menu and he quickly without hesitation or embarrassing questions, read my choices to me hospitably and discretely. My experience was inviting, familiar, warm and welcoming kind of like coming back to family. I was part of a rather large group (50+)  the staff never looked frazzled or overwhelmed, they seemed to be having a good time as you would when sharing time with loved ones!! I had a wonderful time and definitely recommend the Ponty Bistro!! Win-Win!!"
4/24/2017,3 star rating,"I came here with a friend upon purchasing a Groupon deal. Reservation was easy to make- I called a day in advance. My friend and I arrived slightly later than our reservation time but the staff was really nice about it. We got seated right away and was given a menu. Since we both had a late lunch, we were not hungry so we opted for 2 appetizers and an entree to share. For appetizers, we shared a crispy tuna and escargot. The crispy tuna was alright, slightly overcooked and lacking in flavor. The escargot on the other hand was too salty and oily. We ended up using the sauce as bread dip since it was so flavorful. For entree, we ordered roasted lamb racks with potatoes gratin and spinach. I'm not normally one to order lamb as I haven't overcome the gamey taste but my friend really want to try it and I was feeling adventurous so we gave it a go. We asked for medium and the lamb was cooked close to what we requested. The lamb was flavorful and roasted until there's a slight crisp on the outside which is how I like my steak as well. It was pretty good as far as my experience with lamb dish. We ended up ordering a crème brulee since we both had room for dessert. The crème brulee was the best part of the meal. It was creamy and perfectly torched on the top, giving it a crunch to every bite. Overall, food was average but customer service was exceptional. With the Groupon deal, the meal was a good value but it's not a spot I would revisit."

3/31/2017,3 star rating,"I came here for my brothers birthday. There was a group of 10-15. The customer service was exemplary especially since we continuously dropped water on ourselves and even broke a cup. For the food...eh. To me the food was bland and when asking others at my table most of them felt the same. I had the shrimp scampi which was bland. The appetizers weren't my favorite. I wasn't a fan of the mac and cheese, cheese puffs or calamari. The crispy tuna and escargot was delicious. Overall I'm not sure if I'd come again due to the lack in taste."

6/26/2014,4 star rating,"Quaint neighborhood spot that serves up a mix of Senegalese, French, and Mediterranean plates.I was craving pasta, so I got their penne with chicken. The pasta was moist, flavorful, and prepared with a minimum of fuss. I was not disappointed, thankfully.Our group polished off a few bottles of wine (and how), so I'm not exactly sure how long it took for our food to get to our table. Either way, service was tops, and we weren't rushed at all (and the place was packed).I will return to try their Senegalese and French dishes."
8/15/2014,5 star rating,"This place is kickass, so much that I'm writing this review in real time. This restaurant is really killin' it.Came here for an early bird dinner, just by myself. There were two other people in the restaurant at 5:30pm, leaving me this huge place almost to myself.Ordered the early bird prix fixe. $25 for an app, entree, and dessert. I ordered chicken spring rolls for the app (really good with two exotic sauces), the grilled hanger steak (awesome, tender steak with super flavorful spinach and amazing mashed potatoes), and the creme brûlée (which I haven't had yet since I'm writing the review in the restaurant). Also comes with slices of this pre-seasoned bread that tastes great. Food is densely flavorful and rich, and super unique. Great stuffAmbiance is also nice. The place looks cooler at night when it's wine bar hopping time with the candles, etcThe service is also top knotch. Glasses are refilled frequently but not so much that it's annoying, staff are really courteous and nice. Awesome establishment in every way."
7/30/2014,2 star rating,"The food was bland, the prices were insane ($32 for 4 shrimp over a small mash-come on!) and it was humid inside. I think I'll pass. The service was amazing- which is sad, because we won't be back."
2/27/2015,1 star rating,"I ordered 2 filet mignon dishes for pick up today and it was absolutely horrible. First of all it wasn't filet mignon at all tasted and looked like a bad steak. It was very fat and looked and tasted like a skirt steak much less quality then filet mignon. I also ordered it medium and it was completely rare and the meat was so horrible and bad quality I couldn't  even cut the meat. I couldn't eat my meal when I got home so it was a waste of money and had to buy another dinner for that night from a different restaurant. It's really disappointing and I am very upset. The staff there were very friendly though. I am posting pictures of what my ""filet mignon"" looked like ."
6/6/2017,3 star rating,"This place is a little pricey. The food is good, but I don't know if it's really worth the price. The grilled fish was quite good though, I'll be honest. I think it was called Poisson Braise. It comes with salad and sweet plantains. Went here for a reunion dinner with about 8 people. Besides a family of 4, we were the only ones there at about 9pm on a Friday, so it seems like there's not a lot of traffic here."
2/17/2015,3 star rating,"The service was great, the food was just okay... I had the lamb with potato gratin and spinach, I loved the gratin, the meat was okay, there was so much sauce on it though... My husband got the Senegalese spiced steak but it tasted just like an overly sauced sauce au poivre steak. The fries were sadly limp. So overall, food is nothing spectacular, too much creamy sauce is fishy, what are you hiding? Didn't have much dimension to the dishes. Overly priced for the quality, our dishes were $30 each, really not worth it, even with a 30% off coupon."
11/17/2016,5 star rating,I just moved into Savoy Park (one block away from Ponty) and experienced this wonderful bistro at the recommendation of a long-time Harlem resident.  The food is fabulous; the service is excellent and the atmosphere is modern/classic bistro; which you would expect.  I plan on visiting here many more times in the future!
6/5/2014,5 star rating,"""It's nearly Africa""""Go tell your stale friends,Go tell false prophets,And drug traffickersTry to push our taste buds farther""Ok, I'll be clear.  I really liked this place.  Especially for this neighborhood, it's one of the best things going.  And in the vastness of Gotham, there isn't much like it around.What it's not: AFRICA.  Real Africa is ugali, starchy potatoes, unusual flavours, gristly and overcooked meats, goat, very well done vegetables. This is more developed world tourist, contemporary take on Africa.  So if you don't get your authentic panties up in a wad, just relax here and enjoy the food. I've been here a couple of times, and unlike most restaurants, it seems to get better with age. Good pre-movie dinner if you are going to Kips Bay Cinema (the best kept secret, for  uncrowded big movie viewing the city).What's to cheer*Wonderful selection of dishes that appeals to a wide audience*Unique in the world of Manhattan ""me-too"" cuisine restaurants, finding obscure items to put on the menu for the sake of it.*Calm, relaxed atmosphere -- you can definitely enjoy your meal.What's to jeer*Not the hippest crowd in the city*Some main courses and selections on the wine list can get pricey"
2/2/2017,2 star rating,"We've been there many many times over the years since they opened.  It's a cute local place that serves french-senegalese dishes.  Staff and the chefs always friendly, and their food is pretty good.  The menu changed slightly over the years, but my favorite is still chicken tagine - so tender so yum.  But the big thumb down is that my husband always said their bathroom was dirty.  I don't usually use it since we live 2 blocks away.  But the thing is, when you consistently see a dirty bathroom (we were always there during the week), it's a turn off and makes you wonder about their standard for cleanliness.  Please keep your bathroom clean so that my husband will agree to go back."
6/29/2014,3 star rating,"A small neighborhood bistro, but ""french-african"" theme adds a little twist to the typical bistro food.  Food is consistent, good portions, and not expensive.  Some dishes are better than others i.e. chicken, lamb, burgers.  But their fries are not skinny, crispy fries that I like.   I think desserts can improve, especially their chocolate mouse.It's a comfortable neighborhood joint, not a scene nor a place to be seen in.  Decent food and prices.  I have to say the benches along the walls are uncomfortable though."
6/12/2017,5 star rating,Delicious food and great service. I had le poulet yassa with plantain - it was quite q large portion so in my opinion definitely worth the price (more than I'd typically spend for lunch). They do have a  cash only 3 course meal for appr 30$ which is even better value.
5/9/2017,4 star rating,"I have been meaning to come here for a while, and I finally made it!Came here for a weekday dinner with a friend.Recommended by the waitress, ordered beed fataya (empanada) and smth yassa (grilled bass and veges with rice). It was very good and a decent portion to share between 2 ppl.For dessert, we had Tarte Titan and Pilero??? smth. Either way, it was good.It was not crowded, so you will most likely not need a reservation here.Atmosphere is nice, cozy, not loud, clean, and good for friends, family, and a date.I would come back to try out other dishes."
2/23/2014,5 star rating,I reserved a table at this place on Yelp's website because it's one of the few that have good reviews and take reservation before 11am. It was pretty busy already on Sunday  at 10:30 am when I arrived. I liked this place a lot. Service was warm and attentive. Food was bit slow but it was so delicious. I am not a home fries fan so I hesitated to order the lobster benedict. But the home fries on my plate truly won my heart instantly. Lobster and eggs tasted great too. I'd definitely want to go back to try the crab benedict. I hope the confit duck benedict will come back to the menu too!
1/22/2014,5 star rating,"Okay... The apology was sincere, so I went back the day before the New Year, to see if I would either go back in 2014 or not.  The food is still fantastic. That was never the problem. The attitude has certainly improved. The Chef/Manager came out personally to apologize and talk to us. I am very happy with this gem.Looking forward to the Harlem location!"
9/14/2013,1 star rating,"CHEF/MANAGER TOTALLY RUDE and AWFUL PERSON!!!!!I do not write reviews unless I am totally impressed or appalled. Unfortunately, this place is the later. I live on the upper west side. This place is out of the my way, but I been here a few times, so my friend and I planned for brunch. I ordered steak and eggs Over Easy. My order came out with SUNNY SIDE UP. I sent it back and the second eggs came out the SAME WAY. The manager/chef came out to tell me that he has been a chef for 18 years and that's how he always do eggs (What chef does not know how to make over-easy eggs? That is basic culinary school.) and you should just eat it! I was so upset. I asked for the check. The waiter was so nice, it was a stark contrast to the chef/manager, who said give her the check so she can go, sat at the bar and didn't care. Anyway, I don't recommend this place."
12/20/2015,1 star rating,"We didn't even get to eat. I moved to Seattle a few months ago and having brunch at Ponty was on my list of things to do during my 1 week visit home. I double checked both their website and Yelp to make sure we would have time to go to Ponty before visiting my parents. They open at 9am! We got there promptly at 10:45 am. When we walked in the open door, the waiter, who was washing glasses, kind of glared at us and told us they weren't open. When I asked what time they opened, he responded, ""12ish."" 12ish?? Either way, we didn't have time.They used to have an amazing lobster Benedict. I wasted my one Saturday brunch in NY and don't plan to waste my time again. We had egg sandwiches before running off to see the family."
3/12/2014,5 star rating,I love love love the lobster benedict. I can't say much about anything else on the menu because I always get the benedict. Adding a glass or 2 of Prosecco seals the deal. Ooooooh - the 2 for 1 martinis are also awesome.  Hopefully I can check out their dinner options soon.
5/30/2015,4 star rating,"Really great restaurant to go to for a quiet date! We didn't feel pressured to leave, which happens quite often in NYC restaurants, so that was a huge plus. There were four of us and three got egg dishes and I got the Ponte burger. Let's just say our plates were empty at the end of the meal. Negatives: only one. Seems like they don't have air conditioner Conclusion: YAY! Wait staff were very friendly and nice, food was delicious with a bit of a culture twist and we felt at home there."

I just turned my head a bit for to check my things, and she again went to me and was grabbing the rest of my money!!! So much bad attidute! I told her already you stolen 10 dollars stop stealing again. Im not complaining about the food but just about that waitress. She is black woman, be aware of her if she comes to serve your table(my advice)"
12/28/2013,5 star rating,"5 stars, hands down!!Found this place on yelp as my friend and I wanted to throw a surprise birthday dinner for one of our friends. Decorations and ambience were absolutely lovely!  The lighting made everything more intimate. It's a small place but comfortable. I didn't even notice the other tables. The chefs/owners and the rest of the staff were exceptionally kind and friendly.  I showed up half an hour early on a cold winter evening to our group reservation. They let me use the restroom and offered me a seat and water in their little bar section as I waited for my friends. I requested a surprise cheesecake dessert with a candle for the birthday girl. (They brought it out at the end and sang happy bday!) I had a great time chatting with the staff.  I was actually surprised at how comfortable I felt!Long story short, the food was excellent. The stuffed filet of flounder (with crab meat inside and bok choy / potatoes underneath) was smooth and delicious!  My friends also enjoyed their entrees!  Two of them had the shrimp special. One also had the stuffed filet and the other had a pasta dish. The sangria was also nice. Our 2 apps were nicely textured and flavored, the French cheese puffs and crab cake. And DESSERT!  Best creme brûlée EVER!  Perfect caramelized top layer with a soft and rich citrusy custard underneath. Amazing place. Amazing staff. Amazing meal. I will be back one day soon!!"
12/10/2016,5 star rating,"Wonderful evening tonight.   This is truly a ""find"" in NYC.   The Bronzino is terrific and the owners and staff top notch.   I love coming to Ponty and have done so for about 8 years.  Look forward to trying their other location in Harlem.   The food is always consistently fresh and yummy!"
3/9/2012,5 star rating,"I adore Ponty and eat there as much as I can.  I try to steer myself away from the Branzino but it haunts me. Everyone is so friendly.  The last time I was there with a friend, we met a pretty famous celebrity. I won't  tell you WHO  he is  since....this is a favorite place of his as well.. The food is delicious. I am so happy to have this restaurant in my community. Maybe one of these days I will add variety to my choice and ask for something else....However, that Branzino calls me..."
1/23/2014,3 star rating,"3.5 stars. What better way is there to spend a cold Thursday evening than with great friends over great eats and flavorful drinks at Ponty Bistro!? The place itself is a hidden gem tucked away on the corner of 19th and 3rd. Though the place is fairly small, it offers a nice charm of its own as the waiters are inviting and the food is comforting. We started off with a few glasses of sangria which were both fruity and light - just the way a sangria should be. You can order a pitcher which gives you about 4 glasses or so or by the glass with your choice of red or white. Dollar wise, it comes out to about the same so if you're in the mood for drinks, go for the pitcher! Moving on to appetizers, I highly recommend the Truffle Mac n Cheese, Escargots and the Mussels Africana. The Mac n Cheese had just the right amount of truffle oil and a nice sprinkle of bread crumbs which offered a nice bite. The escargots were prepared in a garlic oil which was flavorful but not overwhelming and the Mussels were cooked in a nice tomato broth which offered a little bit of a kick. Our waiter also gave us a side of bread along with the appetizers which complemented the escargots and Mussels quite well. *Tip: Dip the bread in the broth that comes with the Mussels for an added dash of Yum! For our mains, we ordered a trio of dishes consisting of steak (a bit over seasoned with pepper which was a bit intense), a chicken dish which was served with pearl onions and veggies (forgot the name but was the first item on the menu and came highly recommended by our waiter), and the lamb shank, which was my favorite out of all the dishes! The lamb was tender, cooked in a sweet (but not to sweet) sauce, and portions were generous. It was complemented nicely with a side of couscous, which was just delish!Dessert - try the tiramisu (served with some chocolate sauce and topped with a strawberry!)As an added bonus, our waiter reminded us of a French - inspired Adam Levine and was super friendly, which made our experience at Ponty even more favorable.It was a great ladies night, indeed.  Thank you Ponty for a great time! :)"

2/4/2016,4 star rating,"On a quiet Thursday night I visited Ponty Bistro (Gramercy, there's also a Harlem location). The menu was a great mix of traditional french and Senegalese food. I was surprised to see a fish empanada on the menu and it did not disappoint! As my entree I ordered the Branzino which, much to my delight was the whole fish and I loved every bit of it. Washing this all down with a delicious Kenyan beer made my night complete. The only downside was the crème brûlée being a little overdone.I plan on going back again for sure."
2/4/2017,5 star rating,"Every time we chose a restaurant, we seem to keep coming back to ponty bistro.  This was my fourth time and the food still wows me and my friends.  The ambiance, staff, appetizers, entrees, desserts and martinis made it a memorable.  Kudos to the chef for making the flavors worth remembering. The combination of flavors explodes in your mouth wanting more. Definitely check out this restaurant."
12/22/2015,5 star rating,"I arranged a dinner with some family members last night and I selected Ponty Bistro.  I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and each time my experience gets better.  The flavors are outstanding and the service was impeccable.  Janet, who was our waitress was very attentive and respected everyone wishes.  Derek also assisted and he was great.  I would definitely come back again, you will need never be disappointed.  Compliments to the chef for making our experience great."

4/2/2014,5 star rating,"I organized my girl friend's birthday party here last weekend. Open table didn't allow me a reservation at this place for a party of 14, not sure why. But, I had no problem getting a reservation on the phone two weeks in advance. It was one of those rainy New York days with no cabs and heavy traffic, none of us were on time. They had a lot of people waiting for a table, still the owner was kind enough to understand our situation and hold the table for us for 40 extra minutes. Considering that they were losing business by doing so, that was nothing but great customer service. We were very pleased with our server as well. She handled the group so large without any panic or hesitation. She was on top of things throughout, gave us some great wine and food recommendations. We ordered few bottles of wine for the table, the Argentinian Malbec was spot on. Definitely ordering a couple of bottles for home. Similarly we ordered few appetizers to share. The African Mussels were my favorite. For entree, I went with 'Poisson Yassa', I have never had branzino so delicious in my life. Trust me, I eat quite a lot of branzino when I go out. The fish was cooked just right, there was so much flavor in the fish and in the topping. I highly recommend it. Another popular item from the menu was my husband's Lamb Tagine. After he had a bite of it, he was a happy man. More than he ate, he probably shared most to the rest of us cause he wanted to show what a great choice he had made. :)We had brought a cake for the birthday girl from Paris Baguette. Ponty Bistro charged us absolutely no fee to cut it and serve it. Also, unlike most restaurants do it, they didn't include gratuity in our final bill. We paid with 7 Credit Cards and remaining cash, there was no difficulty. Overall, it was a great night and an amazing experience."
7/26/2013,5 star rating,"I had lunch here on Thursday (7/25) and had the entire place all to myself! Perfection.I was greeted and served by the owner of the restaurant. He was pleasant and had a nice sense of humor. The restaurant is very cozy and familiar, a great space for a date or even group dinners.I ordered the truffle mac & cheese to start, the poisson braise a el guet ndar which is a braised whole Branzino with salad and sweet plantain, and the homemade tiramisu for dessert.This was my first time eating anything with truffle oil and I must say, I do love the flavor. The mac and cheese was cooked to perfection, extra gooey and cheesy- just how I like it. OMG. I nearly passed out when I tasted the Branzino. It was probably the best meals I have had in a LONG LONG time. The fish had a nice crispy skin and the inside was moist and perfectly cooked and seasoned. The salt from the fish mixed with the sweetness of the fried plantain was the most beautiful composition of flavors. All I kept whispering was ""Oh My God"" as I was eating. Down to the last bite, so freaking amazing. Even now I'm drooling just thinking about it! The acidic flavors from the salad dressing also finished off each bite perfectly.The tiramisu was absolutely the perfect end to my lunch at Ponty Bistro. This was my first time having tiramisu and I am so happy that my first experience was so delicious. Damn near orgasmic! The whip cream, chocolate and cake was perfectly moist and bursting with sweet goodness.UGH... I'm going back next week, I can't take it...."
8/30/2016,4 star rating,"This place was great. I gotta admit--I did not have high hopes going in, but boy, was I mistaken.I got the lamb, which was PHENOMENAL. My friend got chicken (maybe Senegalese). I wish there were more places like this.Everyone should go here."
10/6/2015,3 star rating,"I used to love this place, but that's when I only got the muscles, salads, and pastas. Today I tried their brunch. What a disaster. Asked for a Cosmo, they don't have it. Ordered lobster eggs Benedict, it takes 40 minutes to prepare and they over cook the eggs, not to mention that they put two small pieces of lobster on it and that was it. Then they were out of espresso, cappuccino, everything except black coffee. Really one of the WORST brunches I've had in this city. Never again! I was there on Saturday, October 3, 2015."

If you come here early it's more a retiree crowd, but I appreciated that it was more quiet as a result.Like many people mentioned, the grilled sirloin steak in Senegalese spices was the highlight dish of the night. Have the steak cooked medium rare and there's pretty much nothing wrong with this dish. Their fries are a bit thicker than I'd like, so there's less flavor thereWe also got the herb-crusted rack of lamb. While it was delicious, the Senegalese steak won us over. Service was standard. I noticed several larger groups dining here so it looks like they can handle birthday parties as well."
3/25/2017,1 star rating,DO NOT COME HERE. This is a terrible business. I came here for my birthday boozy brunch. The service was miserable. Half of our group did not receive their full meal or coffee after asking MANY times. They wouldn't refill our drinks. The mimosas were 99.9% orange juice with no champagne. The worst - they took over 30 minutes to take our order. Then told me our bottomless time was over when we had been eating for less than 30 minutes (1.5 hour bottomless) DO NOT COME HERE.

8/19/2015,4 star rating,"Great casual dining spot!Ordered the lamb shank and the grilled lamb chops.

5/26/2016,2 star rating,"I normally don't write negative reviews.  I'm hoping they take this as constructive criticism.  I was excited to see that they offered a Salad Nicoise, which is so hard to find around here.  It looked good in the container, too.  But then I tasted it and it was...warm.  By warm I don't mean ""not cold,"" I mean warm...like it had been sitting in the sun.  Or maybe the cooked tuna was added too soon and warmed up the salad in the container.  In either case, it was no good.  Have you ever eaten warm lettuce?  It's pretty gross.  I pretty much ate just the tuna and nothing else.  Please...don't do this to such a nice salad."

5/16/2016,5 star rating,"Working at School of Visual Arts next door and in the Gramercy area, it's VERY difficult searching for Black-owned businesses (maybe 3 around here, tops). But needing breakfast and moving fast, I looked this place up as they were near my favorite ""Punjab"" shop. Asking for a capuccino and oatmeal, I received an awesome large bowl of buttery oats (with pineapple, blueberries and strawberries), finely cooked that never became hard after picking at it for hrs at my desk.In love and will be a regular here."
5/11/2016,2 star rating,"The seafood risotto was rich, well-cooked, and tasty. The mussels Africana were also very delicious (save some bread so you can dip it in the sauce!). The passion fruit martini was very sour and kind of meh.The issue, and the reason for 2 stars, was that the Poisson Yassa (red snapper) was FULL of bones. This was not a whole fish and the server did not tell me to look out for bones, so I expected 1 or 2, but not nearly as many as I found, including several that were very large and even a fin. When you pay $27 for a piece of fish you expect it to have been properly de-boned. Because the fish is served skin-up with a large amount of olives and other veggies directly on top, it is extremely difficult to find and remove bones before you take a bite, so I found myself picking bones out of my mouth as I ate. This is not only disgusting but a choking hazard. I would not go here again, but for those who do, I do not recommend the snapper unless you are very careful and look out for bones."
5/8/2016,1 star rating,Made reservarions for 12 noon for 10 for Mothers Day. At 12:51 they tried to seat us at a table big enough for 6. Really I was totally disappointed and my mom was very unhappy. So we left needless to say we wont be going back and I won't recommend this place to anyone.

The portion for both dishes are decent, not too much and not too little.Lobster Benedict was tasty. Great hollandaise sauce and lobster was succulent! Home fries was perfectly cooked.The steak came perfect medium-rare. The super peppery steak sauce was very delicious. Their fries is crispy and very yummy.We also got the free cheesecake from Yelp check-in. (You can choose Creme brûlée or cheesecake).I'm very interested in their dinner menu as well, will come back to try!-dinner review-We ordered Niokolokoba coz we kind of love their brunch steak. Same amazing peppery sauce and fries we love! But the sirloin was a bit tougher not the type of meat I love....Had the fish empanadas and fried chicken wing as the appetizer. The spicy sauce came with it was mind-blowing!"
5/7/2016,1 star rating,"Good food, non-existent service. It took 8 minutes before we were acknowledged or even given menus. Another 6 minutes before we even had a chance to order drinks and at least 10 more minutes before we even received our drinks. We ordered an old fashioned and a margarita and unfortunately both were poorly and improperly made. The old fashioned had slices of oranges and way too much sugar. The margarita came without salt and with an orange. We received our appetizer before we even received our drinks and our waiter had no idea what he was doing. The lamb shank and the seafood risotto was were amazing, but it's unfortunate that the service was practically non-existent. We literally had to find our server for everything needed from asking for menus, to asking him to take our order, following up to see if our drinks were coming to asking him to remove the finished plates that remained at our table for over 20 min. He never came back to see if we needed another round of drinks throughout the entire time we were there. It seemed that he had never waited tables before and completely oblivious to how terrible his service was. Overall, we won't be coming back."
5/7/2016,1 star rating,The lamb shank was terrible . Omg didn't enjoy it at all. It wasn't boiled enough and it was so hard to chew. The service was slow as well. I won't be returning . The servers were nice and polite though

Have brought family and friends whom also highly recommend this place. Will keep coming back! :)"
4/4/2015,5 star rating,"There is an overwhelming number of restaurants in NYC, and it can be hard to find the gems among the slew of meh. Ponty is one of those gems. And it's never crowded which is surprising considering how good it is (although, as a crowd-averse being, I also treasure this). I've been here 3x and the food and service is always EXCEPTIONAL. I don't even like desserts, but that dessert crepe...oh my goodness.It is on the pricier side, but considering the excellency of their execution in preparing their food, it's worth it and is actually a great value if you're looking for a nice meal. A $24 dish may be a little hard to take at first, but then you eat the food and that fades away and you're happy you spent every penny there. Their dishes are always very flavorful and cooked perfectly. And they have such a varied and fantastic menu!Although everything I've tried at Ponty has been delicious, the stuffed flounder in particular really stood out to me. Reading it off the menu, I didn't think much of it. However, luckily, my boyfriend ordered it, and I was blown away. Juicy, tender, flavorful and rich, but not heavy. And it was piping hot, which I know may be kind of a weird thing to rave about, but I didn't realize until I had something so perfectly hot that it's actually kind of rare to get something so wonderfully and perfectly piping HOT served to you at a restaurant. Did I mention this perfectly cooked fish is stuffed with crab? It's so good."
7/23/2015,5 star rating,I have only one thing to say about this place: LOBSTER RISOTTO! Go there and try their lobster risotto and you can not go wrong. I'm not sure if lobster risotto is even French or African cuisine but who cares when it's that good? I've been dreaming about this dish since I had it. All their food was really well executed and full of flavor but I will absolutely be going back for their lobster risotto and I suggest you find your way there and try it too.

8/12/2014,5 star rating,"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE (NEW!) HARLEM LOCATION ON 139TH AND ACP**Ponty Bistro is a super new (just opened a few weeks ago) French-African inspired restaurant on the corner of 139th and Adam Clayton Powell, a seemingly random location but it makes sense considering the activity happening in the area with Manhattanville Coffee and The Edge (coming late August, hopefully!) nearby.  Harlem Gem Tip:  if you don't live in the area or haven't visited I'd highly recommend a walk along 139th between Frederick Douglass and ACP- Striver's Row is ridiculously beautiful.A note on the menu, while the wine selection is decent this place has a full bar but no real signature cocktails - at least they aren't advertised. They'll definitely need to step it up in that area but for now it's not counting against them. Word to the wise: They've got happy hour 4 (or 5)pm to 7pm on week nights with a special bar menu and lower priced wine and beer (unfortunately the happy hour menu doesn't include cocktails as of now).  As for the food, in a word: DELICIOUS...Time will tell how they fair in the (increasingly competitive) Harlem dining scene, but I'm really hoping that they're here to stay- how else will I try everything on the menu??For more thoughts (and pics!) of decor, food, service, check out my full review on Uptown Lovely: uptownlovely.com/2014/08…"

10/25/2012,3 star rating,"Service - 1 starVegetarian options/food - 2 starAmbiance - 3 starsUniqueness - 4 starsI am averaging it to 3 stars but service was painful. From not having cutlery or water, to our wine being mixed up, and waiting forEVER to receive the check, service was so bad that it ruined the rest of the experience."
7/17/2009,4 star rating,"I give it 3 stars as a restaurant and the one star for location.  In a neighborhood surrounded by mediocrity - or bank breakers- I know I know the east village is right there, but its a walk- voila Pontry Bistro.  Very cool deco - African French - laid back went on a Thurs night and it was perfect: no wait, I could actually talk politics with the party and not shout over loud music or people.  The food was good. The Sangria was awesome. It wasn't cheap eats, but it wasn't over priced.  I was content. I had the lobster roll with bacon - yumm - and it was just lobster chunks, no lobster salad with mayo - lobster chunks - it was awesome.Anyway, I dug it.  If you are like me and live over there or you are in the neighborhood and need a place to eat - check it out, I don't think it will disappoint."
5/12/2009,4 star rating,"4 stars for the early bird prix fixI know its almost an impossible task, but if you get to the french-african influenced Ponty Bistro before 7:00 a 3 course meal is $20. Appetizer, entree, and dessert for twenty dollars! Any day of the week, this is for real people. Powerful martinis run $5. I made sure to take advantage of that.I found out about this place through my mom, who is always right about everything. She recommended the mussels as the appetizer. They came in a rich broth with tomato and lemongrass.The hanger steak entree was cooked to my liking, not at all bloody and with a great charred crust. The crispy side of potatoes also did not disappoint. I ordered the creme brulee and was pretty certain it would be forgettable.Could a $20 prix fix really go 3 for 3 with spot on dishes? And yet they did.The brulee had the right amount of sweetness and they even took the time to sprinkle on some powdered sugar and a strawberry. The space is filled with color and art and the big windows were kept open when the weather is nice. Our waitress was sweet; she there when we needed her and left us be when we didn't. This is an almost too good to believe deal up in here. So if you can bare the idea of dinner while the sun is still up, listen to my mom and get over there."
11/22/2014,2 star rating,Mussels were delicious: I wouldn't dissuade you from coming here on whatever night it is they run a special on them all night.Everything else was mediocre at best including one of the most poorly butchered pieces of steak I have ever been served...unforgivable.
2/28/2013,4 star rating,"Very interesting blend of two cuisines one would never think to combine. The space was a bit crowded and cramped, but the decor is beautiful!The dishes...different indeed, pretty pricey even with a % off. Nothing really memorable as far as service wise. Cute date spot or taking out-of-towner. Wouldn't recommend it for a regular night out (due to the price menu). The Crab cakes & Lobster BLT? To DIE for!!

4/6/2015,5 star rating,"Finally a west African place in Manhattan! Delicious food and atmosphere, ponty bistro will not disappoint. We went for the crunchy tuna and spring roll appetizer and they were both delicious. For main we had the lamb shank, cooked to perfection and the steak au puave, done exactly as we like it. The chef is not kidding around, this place is a hidden gem!I was there on a Saturday and it got quite full, to the point they had to turn people away so if you are planning to go make sure you put in a reservation."
4/30/2015,4 star rating,"Came here for a friends birthday dinner and was very impressed. Very nice dim lighting, an intimate vibe, and a noise level that allows for conversation.The server was very attentive and patient (we were a group of about 8). The food was really good. I ordered the steak and the truffle mac and cheese. The steak was tasty and the mac and cheese was ONE OF THE BEST I have had. I am pretty critical of mac and cheese, this was like none I have ever had the truffle for sure adds an amazing twist. My friends had great reviews as well, no complaints. I NEED to go back for the mac and also want to try their brunch."
6/7/2017,5 star rating,"This place is truly incredible. I'd love to keep it a hole-in-the-wall secret spot so it can stay calm and not crowded but I hope it's open for years to come. The place is in a beautiful area of the city; and has an open air format. Great date spot. The food was amazing --  high quality and you could feel like the chef cared about what he prepared. They offer great deals too. Try the ginger martini! So glad I found this place through Groupon, I'll definitely be back!"
6/28/2010,2 star rating,"Okay I was excited to try this place that was categorized as ""African Fusion"" and so S and I went after watching SATC2.S was really excited about tasting African food, since S never tried it before and I only had it once at Merkato 55 - both of us were no experts to African cuisine.When we arrived, we were seated on the left side of the restaurant. The benches were really uncomfortable and the throw pillows were a bit annoying, since there really wasn't enough room for them.Went to wash my hands and the small hallway between the unisex bathroom and employees only room was danger zone. The area was stuffy and hot as hell and you'll be crushed between two doors if both were to be open simultaneously. Oh the bathroom door was done poorly as well - be careful with this door.Moving on....I looked at the front of the menu and it was labeled as African, French and Mediterranean Cuisine then after skimming over the menu, I am wondering if this place is even African?This menu has A.D.D. - it's all over the place. Lobster BLT? Wouldn't that be more American? Oh my bads, it was on a Brioche bun, so it must be French then?I know I am no African food expert, but the menu here is more French than anything else.They even had Tiramisu and Thai Chicken Spring Rolls....ummm wouldn't this fall under Italian and Thai then?The disheveled waitress came and took our order and S got the ""American"" Lobster BLT and I got the Moules Africana mussels with African spices and shallot garlic white wine sauce. served with french fries.We ended up sharing our meals and Lobster BLT came with shredded slices of lobster meat. I am talking about 6 measly cut of lobster shreds. I tasted more of the Bacon than the lobster meat but S is easy and thought it was tasty.  I am not saying this BLT minus the Lobster meat wasn't tasty as a regular BLT would taste, but this thing was listed under LOBSTER.As for my Moules Africana mussels - I didn't taste any Africa in my mussels. It tasted like any other French Moules I had with white wine.But my fries, OMG they tasted like they been reheated and I didn't touch them after one bite.S was downing the frites and raving how good they were and I said something must be wrong here. I tasted S's fries and S tasted my fries, S agreed that my fries tasted off. S's fries tasted better but I wasn't into the lacklustre fries here. They're more addicting at Jane's!After the waitress was clearing off our table along with the large bowl filled with my untouched fries...I mentioned the fries tasted different than S's. The waitress told me it was because it was different spices. Ummm no, if you call chopped up cilantro used as garnish on BOTH of our plates as spices...NOPE! Or how much percentage of Salt....NO again. I didn't bother when she made that comment, it's like really....my freaking fries tasted disgusting and they were inedible but oh wells.The waitress brought out the dessert menu....PASS on the French desserts. If I wanted to eat at a French restaurant I'd have picked a better one and one with better serving staff that were more well put together."

1/24/2011,5 star rating,"I was here this past Saturday with my girlfriend and had a blast.I had known about this place for a few weeks, but hadn't have the time to go. This past weekend I got my money's worth, because we ordered 4 entrees! Yes, the appetizers selection is not that interesting, so we went heavy and opted for a big meal. We were not disappointed.I had the seafood risotto and my girlfriend the vodka penne. The risotto was outstanding, very tasty indeed; creamy but not greasy; and the seafood was delicious; if I had ordered it as my entree, it would have been very little, though; so I was not happy with the portion. The penne were good, but they tasted like usual red sauce, so, I'm sorry yelp-reviewers, the penne are overrated. Ok, I'm Italian, so my standards are higher for pasta, but I wasn't impressed.Then we ordered the tuna steak and the filet mignon. The tuna was fantastic: tender, perfectly marinated, tastefully dressed... A+. The filet was very good (the sauce was delicious), but the meat itself wasn't very tender.We had the chocolate fondant for dessert and it was delicious.Overall we had a great experience. The service was courteous and reliable. The place itself is not that cool, but with this food it doesn't really matter. The chef came more than once to as how we liked the food, which I found very sweet and welcoming. I would totally go back.Highly recommended.P.S. Just went again for lunch and found it impeccable!"
4/10/2009,3 star rating,"Solid food and friendly service. The special beet salad was perfect -- it had lots of juicy beet, some chunks of gorgonzola, perky haricot verts, and nicely dressed greens. Get it if it's on offer. My entree of lamb shank with onion sauce and cous cous looked amazing and tasted great. It was an impressively big lamb shank with lots of falling-off-the-bone meat in a red wine sauce with sauteed onion and it paired very well with its cous cous pilaf. My companion's chicken tagine, which I sampled, was great too...we both cleaned our plates. They have a decent list of wines by the glass. 2 entrees, one shared appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine came to about $40 per person, with tax and tip. The vibe is candlelit. Love finding a neighborhood place with solidly good food!"
9/25/2016,4 star rating,"Came here on a weekday after work. They might've just been opening as they seemed to still be doing handy work outside as I was walking in. Service was good and the food was delicious, no complaints here. The creme brulee could've been better though."
7/29/2017,5 star rating,"Great place and convenient location! You don't need to travel uptown to get West African food. I had my rehearsal dinner here to showcase my West African culture and it did not disappoint. Delicious food, excellent service and big enough space to cater to a group. It was a success and everyone enjoyed trying West African food.  Of course there are plenty of equally great French dishes if you want alternatives. The owners are cousins from Senegal who worked in the restaurant industry with some of the best and I'm happy to see how successful they are - they recently opened a second location in Harlem."
6/16/2012,4 star rating,"Get:~Moules Africana (5 stars): we ordered the appetizer version, and it was much larger than we'd expected.  Mussels were large, juicy and tender.  And the sauce was simpy amazing.  A little spicy, with a bit of tarragon, and just a tad sweet, with the cream rounding it all out.  Would come back just for this. $12~Ginger martini (4 stars): very gingery and refreshing!  The flavor blended in very well with the alcohol.  Plus, it's 2 for $12.~Croquette de crab (3.5 stars): crab cake with mango salsa and avocado coulis.  The crab cake was surprisingly good, filled with crab meat and fried just right.  The accompaniments went ok with it, although the avocado coulis was a bit bland. $12Skip:~Lobster BLT (3 stars): it really wasn't bad, but the lobster meat tasted as if it'd come from a frozen lobster.  It was a bit dry, but the overall flavor was great, with bacon and arugula on brioche bun.  Fries were very mediocre, too starchy in the middle. $15~Lychee martini (2 stars): this was a bit too sweet, with the lychee flavor strong at first, and then with a strong alcohol aftertaste. 2 for $12Wait:~none for 2 at 3:30pm Saturday.  Service was friendly without being overbearing, and water was always filled.I'd come back here for mussels for sure!  Cute little place, and they were playing a Euro Cup game while we were there."
4/4/2015,5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon Ponty on a lunch break in the area and ended up blown away by the food we received as well as the amazing service. The chef came out to even give us samples of new appetizers and desserts he was trying out. We've been back three times now and have yet to be disappointed by any of it. Highlights from our visits:The Seafood Risotto is possibly the best risotto I've had in the city. The flavor is so rich and cheesy and pairs perfectly with all the delicious seafood in it as well. The stuffed filet of flounder with the crab meat ragout was incredibly delicious. Not too heavy but still very flavorful and plenty of tasty food to fill you up. Also, the Niokolokoba ( Senegalese spiced hanger steak) was really great. The meat itself was cooked perfectly and the spice sauce  adds a lot of interesting rich flavor to the meal. Finally, if you like sweets go for the crepe. Absolutely DELICIOUSWe'll be coming back to try the monday mussels soon. I'm sure the brunch menu is good but I feel like asking for a lunch menu will get you much more interesting food but that may just be my anti-brunch bias speaking."
7/22/2014,5 star rating,"This is a perfect Sunday morning brunch spot! Though.. I must say that the Lobster BLT that they have for lunch on weekdays is also very very good. In all honesty though, how often do you find a French-African restaurant snugged in a quiet yet vibrant and chic area of Manhattan - right by Union Square, but not too far east as Alphabet City? After enjoying your Lobster Benedict and White Sangria for Sunday brunch (both of which are amaaazing!), you can take a stroll in the area, walk towards Union Square (potential shopping on 5th ave) or choose to go uptown towards Madison Square Park or walk down towards East Village. OR if you have weekend grocery plans to stock up your supplies for the week, you can always stop by Trader Joe's for food and wine after your meal.The place is not big, but definitely a comforting place to sit and catch up with old friends! They also have a ""Check in and get free dessert"" offer that you can use via yelp so you really get the most out of your experience!"

1/1/2015,1 star rating,"Wow, this was possibly the worst brunch experience I've had since...possibly ever. First, our waiter was dirty. I'm not talking like, been in a busy restaurant and have some stains, we're talking like gross dirty shirt, stained and marked on tie.Second, we ordered crab cake eggs Benedict. Terrible decision. They tasted fishy and gross. Avoid at all costs. Third, this might have been able to be remedied had the waiter come back to the table, I don't know, ever, after we sat down and asked how everything was. I would have kindly replied, ""not good,"" and maybe we could have worked out another suitable plan to get satisfactory breakfast.  However, that did not happen. So when we were finally desperate to leave at the end, had clearly not eaten most of our food, we flagged him over and asked for the check.  He came over, saw that we hadn't eaten much, but didn't say a word, just handed us the check and walked away. Ugh. All of us felt gross and frustrated as we left. It was a miserable experience."
12/2/2015,2 star rating,"What a shame. I arrived before my friends. The waiter sat me and then left, no offer of a drink or menu.The appetizers were ordered and Fish Empanadas  were tasty and with a spicy sauce. My friend ordered Onion Soup but we had to ask 4 times and the waiter had forgot. It arrived after 20 minutes..not good.My African mussels were the driest, smallest quality with grit in some and many not opened. There was a weird root vegetable with them that I kept having to remove from my mouth, so I gave up. Desserts were ordered and after 20 mins we asked  and the waiter slapped his forehead and put the order in. I wish he hadn't, my Chocolate cake was room temperature and tasted like it came from Target.There were 8 people in the restaurant and we had difficultly getting a waiters attention as they chatted by the bar at the end of the restaurant..The owner/chef was super friendly and I feel sorry that the wait staff were so inattentive. They need to improve the attention to detail on the food and source better ingredients.The menu holds promise but with so many alternatives in the area I wont be back fearing another average meal and awful service."
12/20/2014,4 star rating,"Lovely service, very kind waiters and waitresses. Tried the Classic Fish & Chips: the crisp of the fish was perfect and delicious tartar sauce. Not too heavy. Cozy and warm atmosphere, can't wait to come back and try other dishes."
3/14/2014,3 star rating,"Came here with a livingsocial deal that was $20 for $40 plus a free dessert. I like the type of restaurant deals that don't limit you to a prix fixe so I decided to buy it. Over all I'd recommend this place as a 1 time try but not a destination or special night type of place. I had dinner with my sister at 7 on a Thursday and it was not crowded at all. If you come in the winter sit in the back-it gets cold (especially because they have delivery service)!!  We started with the cheese plate which I enjoyed. It had about 4 types of cheese both hard and soft and would definitely suffice for 4 people. For my entree I got the mussel Africana after reading rave reviews. It was good, but I thought it could use more spice--also no bread at the bottom which is one of my favorite parts of getting mussels!! My sister had the chicken tagine which came with a spicy creamy sauce. The flavors were great but it was very saucy. Also to note, it's bone in. For dessert we shared the creme brûlée. A little over Caramelized on top but it was really good!I thought the service here was pretty good. With all of the spice and salty foods I was throwing back a lot of water and I never had an empty glass. They also don't have ice in the water which I like because I usually just end up with a massive ice cup after so many refills."
4/8/2014,5 star rating,"We attended Ponty Bistro as apart of our Sunday Brunches. We were not disappointed.  The small restaurant and eager to please staff sat my guest of 12 immediately.  Our waitress informed us of the specials. Everyone order drinks, appetizers and meal. Not one person was disappointed, in a group that can be ""hard to please"". The escargot, steak, yucca mash (light and airy) the ginger martini were a perfect antidote to Sunday. The chef was gracious enough to stop by and greet us and the staff was amazing. We will be back and as many said a great kept secret. Our guest from Canada, Pa and the mid west had a great time.  Great news they're expanding in Harlem. Great luck"

11/20/2013,5 star rating,"Came here for a friends birthday last week with a group of 10 and we were all blown away! Everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was incredible (granted it was a Tuesday night so we accounted for about a third of the traffic at 8pm). We were helped by two waiters throughout the night - one of whom turned out to be the chef/owner as well (Cisse?). Between the group we ordered a lot of different items and shared tastes around the table, so I can say with complete confidence the: French Cheese Puffs, Truffle Mac n Cheese, Fried Calamari, French Onion Soup and Escargot were all delicious. There was a bit less sharing going on with entrees. I had the Kasbah Lamb Shank (med-rare) and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Also managed to steal bites of the other lamb option (Carre D'Agneu), as well as the Filet Mignon and the special they were running that night, a delicious veal chop. Every single person in our party left the meal talking about the next time we could come back. One of our friends actually brought his girlfriend here the following night. All in all the price is reasonable as well. I personally have been recommending it to anyone who will listen to me for the past week. Can't wait to get back here."
6/17/2011,5 star rating,"This is one of the best restaurants in the area.  I wish it had been there when I lived in NYC.  I try to go there every time I visit my family in NYC.Everything i've ordered there has been great.  I usually get some kind of steak for a main course, and that is always tasty.  All of their appetizers are great, and I particularly recommend the crab cakes.  Desserts are all really good too.  They have a Early Bird Menu where you get three courses for $25, which is a great deal for considering the amount and quality of food you get.Special occasion dinners there are remarkable.  I was there for New Year's Eve and the menu they came up with for that was great, and they had a DJ playing music.  It was a great atmosphere."
2/19/2016,1 star rating,"THEY CHEAT!! I bought a Groupon and came in just a week later for dinner. The waitress told me that the voucher has been discontinued and I'd have to pay the full price. The voucher is there in my app, valid and ready to go. The waitress wasn't even apologetic about it. She delivered the verdict and left us to serve other tables. No no no that's not how you mess with customers. I'd give zero star if I can. Boycott those with no moral standards."

4/25/2016,5 star rating,"I came for a dinner date and there was a great ambiance in the restaurant. We were ushered to our table and immediately given some bread. The menu is extensive, almost overwhelming at first but great options all round. We got some complimentary traditional spring rolls. The portions are sizeable. I ordered a delicious steak dish and my date order the Yassa Poisson. Both were great. I recommend this place for dates, casual dinner with friends, business dinners. The chefs have really made it authentically African with some side of Frenchness. I am definitely coming back again."
4/24/2016,5 star rating,"Great food! Great service (they were extremely efficient, as they had multiple staff serving the table - in addition to our assigned waiter/waitress, we had a person who brought the bread, a person refilling drinks, a floater making sure all tables in the restaurant had what they needed etc...you get the point)! I ordered the Branzino and it was very fresh. The yukon gold potatoes are on point and I am super picky about the texture of mashed potatoes. Lastly, the restaurant had a low-key sophisticated ambiance, which I love when I am eating a well-prepared dish."

The chef sent us a complimentary piece of NY cheesecake, nice added touch. It was cozy and warm....the perfect place on a cold Winter night. Thank you from Buffalo!"
10/18/2014,3 star rating,"It was okay.  Too pricey for what we got.  I feel like it's a bit hit or miss here.  I enjoyed the food but was a bit underwhelmed.  With tip we spent nearly 70 dollars and only ordered two entrees...no drinks or dessert or appetizers.  I consider that $$$ not $$.  don't get me wrong, the food was good, just not good enough for what we spent."

8/21/2013,1 star rating,"Yelp... you have failed me. Once again I used Yelp to find dinner last night. Seemed like mostly good reviews from my fellow yelpers. Clearly, they didn't have the same experience I had. Perhaps my experience last night was an isolated event. Honestly, there was nothing bad about the restaurant until a giant cockroach fell onto our table. That one cockroach really just ruined everything. We had finished eating and the waiter (who was quite friendly) was clearing our dishes when this cockroach came out of nowhere and landed on our plates. The waiter claimed it was because the front doors were open so it probably came off the street. After clearing our plates, he brought over the complimentary dessert (from my Yelp check-in). My dining companion was unphazed by the experience, but I was completely freaked out. I really wrestled with whether or not to write this review. Did the roach really come from the street? Does that make it ok? So before writing this up, I visited the NYC Health Ratings Site. They got a score of 11 at their most recent inspection, which is good, but in April they got an 86. Among the many violations was ""Live roaches present in facility's food and/or non-food areas."" That was 5 months ago and if their current score is any indication, they've really cleaned the place up, but one roach is one too many in my book."
7/20/2014,4 star rating,"I've been walking past this place for years, and finally decided to go in. Sorry it took so long, because it's really good. We enjoyed the truffle mac & cheese, nice and creamy with plenty of truffle flavor. The salads have a nice dressing, also liked the pasta dishes. For drinks, they have homemade what-they-call ""bissap,"" also called ""sorrel"" in the Caribbean, and a pineapple juice with A LOT of ginger, as well as a full bar. We all enjoyed it, and will be happy to go back, to try more of their African dishes."

Literally I take my team here for dinners now when we could be going to more established restaurants because the food quality is so impressive.Also, the peppercorn steak sauce is incredible... make sure you add it to your meal! The Calabash soup... ORDER IT, there is no better squash soup in the city y'all"

The service was very fast; I managed to get a two-course meal in about half an hour. The waiters and hosts are both very kind and attentive. The ambience and atmosphere are great, without swinging too far into being too casual or too formal. A great place if you're looking to try something different from the usual Traditional American and burger places that dot Gramercy at a reasonable price."

Perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious, I'd have been happy eating another for my main.Picked the Niokolokoba (steak) for the main. Asked for it rare and it was perfectly cooked and once again had a really unique taste due to the spices.Can't fault the service at all and atmosphere was very intimate - though the place was nearly empty (a crime!). In the 6 months I've lived in NYC this is one of the the best places I've eaten, will definitely be returning."
12/10/2016,5 star rating,"We have been to Ponty's many times in the past two years and find the food outstanding as well as all the staff from the Owner to wait persons and kitchen.  They truly care about their customers and that is evident by the return business they have.  Dishes are prepared with care and presentation is A-1. There is nothing negative to say and as the resturant gets crowded, it is good to have a reservation first."
4/10/2016,3 star rating,"Went here for a first date recently and I was pretty bummed out by the service to be frank. While the food was delicious and the portions were reasonable, our food took quite a while to come out and then they forgot about our bill to top it off. Because my date was so patient and interesting to chat with, it made the 3 hour dinner experience bearable. I came to the place based on great ratings for both the food/service, but can only vouch for the food itself. Besides that, like others have said, the atmosphere is cozy and a smaller space. Demographically speaking, most of the people there were 60+ so we were definitely the youngest of the crowd. Overall, good food but crummy service. My tip would be if you plan on coming here, pay special attention to the waiters or you could easily be forgotten!"
5/23/2016,5 star rating,"The food was amazing, I had the Poulet Yassa chicken which was so tender and well marinated. My friend had the steak which likewise was cooked to perfection. Also, they have a great deal everyday which is 2 for 12 martini's until 7 pm so we took advantage of that. the service was awesome from the host, to the waiter, to the chef even coming out and asking how was dinner. I will definitely be back soon."
10/23/2013,3 star rating,"Came here for African Restaurant Week because it was the highest rated participating restaurant in Manhattan. I ordered mussels to start, steak as my entree and creme brulee for dessert. The whole meal was $36. Note they only take cash and AmEx (which I didn't know before I went).I had no idea what to expect; the meal was ok but I wasn't blown away."
1/26/2016,2 star rating,"I have eaten a few excellent meals here - albeit they were sometimes a bit too salty.Drinks and wine were good.However as many of the other reviewers state, the servers are very inattentive. On more than one occasion there were 6 or less diners in the restaurant and 2 waiters on the floor. Not mission impossible. I am courteous and tip well. I worked as a server for many years and the comfort and dining experience of the customer is part of the reason people go to the restaurant. Otherwise they get take out or cook at home. Very surly staff, particularly the black woman with the turban who always acted as if the job was too good for her. Maybe it is, and she should get another job. I love to eat out, can overlook a menu imperfection here and there. But rude service - no way. It made me feel very uncomfortable. This is most unfortunate as the value for dollar is reasonable. However I will spend my money and eat my meal elsewhere."
3/22/2017,5 star rating,A neighborhood gem!  Walked by this place for years before giving it a try which I now regret.  Their chicken tandoori is fantastic.  My husband tried the bouloubaise special the other night - he loved it so much I didn't even get a bite!  And the chocolate fondant dessert is to did for.  Tried it for lunch for the first time yesterday.  Loved the salad nicoise. The tuna was delicious.  Well be returning

3/4/2014,4 star rating,"I've been to Ponty before and I had a great time the first go round. That being the case, I took a few friends for dinner. This time things did not go so well. Once there, they proceeded to move us from a seating which was more comfortable for 5 people (my group) and seat a group of 4. Additionally, we had bags which made our first seating ideal and not in anyone's way. I did not know what the reason was but they now explained to me that it was due to handicap accessibility so I have adjusted the rating accordingly. Thanks for the hospitality."
1/27/2014,2 star rating,"The food was good, but the service was so bad that it was embarrassing for all involved:1) They called me to confirm my reservation after I'd already been sitting at my table for 10 minutes2) They gave me dirty menus, covered in some kind of slime/sauce3) The waitress interrupted my order to tell me she'd ""Give me more time""... and walked away before I could correct her assumption and give her my orderI mean, it was funny, so... there's that."
6/25/2014,5 star rating,"Wow!  Poulet Tangine!  I frequent a French Moroccan restaurant near my home in Oakland as well as local Senegalese restaurants but this place was amazing. Perfect balance of heat and flavor, light yet rich, plus fantastic service.I literally finished my meal and reveled in the wonders of Life, the Universe and the brotherhood of man. And I hadn't even finished my second glass!16 trips to NYC and finally a meal to Yelp! about."
12/18/2014,5 star rating,"This has been one of my favorite places since I discovered it 3 years ago. They have 2 for 1 martinis before 7pm which are strong and delicious. I highly recommend their chocolate martinis! There dinner menu is diverse and I must say I have never been disappointed. Their food and service is consistently superb to the point that I make this a go to spot for any visitors I am showing around NYC or any special occasion. The restaurant is an intimate, tastefully decorated with African decorations reminding you of the Mediterranean-African theme that will take you far from Gramercy. It is often filled with locals, but it is without a doubt worth any distance traveled to. The wait staff is a consistent and a familiar group who are professional and some of the few waiters in the city who have not lost the true meaning of hospitality. They will make you feel welcomed the moment you enter and are from the Mediterranean and thus, are very knowledgeable and passionate about the food. Just yesterday when I had the pleasure of dining here I accidentally knocked my spoon off the table and before I even had a chance to react, one of the waiters rushed over to pick it up for me. The chef you will often see walking around the restaurant making sure everyone is enjoying their meals (which they surely are). When you are first seated the staff immediately will provide you with delicious pieces of french bread drizzled with olive oil. Their menu is very diverse but definitely has a lot of seafood options. For starters, their mussels are popular and consistently good.For an entree their Chicken Parmesan is literally the best I have ever eaten in my life. I recommend it to everyone and, so far, no one has been disappointment. It is out of this world. It comes in a delicious white light sauce with marinara over the chicken and the combination with garlic and spices is delightful. I've also tried their filet mignon and lamb which were likewise exquisite. For dessert the tiramisu is home made, light and scrumptious. I come here regularly because I know the wait staff will be professional and I know I won't get better food anywhere else. I have complete faith every time I enter the front door I will get consistently outstanding food and service. Thank you Ponty Bistro for being my favorite restaurant these past three years!"
4/7/2014,4 star rating,"This is an exceptional little restaurant!  It is part of my regular spots and I expect to dine here frequently.  The cozy little restaurant offers a variety of great dishes to fulfill any palette's craving for the night.  Of note on the menu is the Niokolokoba which is perfectly cooked, tender and flavored with senegalese spices that makes my mouth water as I write this review.  My buddy had the lamb which was equally wonderful.We ended the meal with a Tiramisu and found it was a perfect way to end the night.I would also recommend the Macaroni and Cheese and French Onion soup if you are looking for something conventional."
4/7/2014,4 star rating,"What a great place to have dinner with friends! On a Saturday night, we were able to get a table for 7 at 7PM. Even during this time, there wasn't a long wait for anyone who walked in and they were able to seat my party without everyone being there. We started out with fried calamari, moules africana & ahi tuna tartar. The moules & tartar were awesome! Moules or muscles was made with lots of spice and the soup was delicious with the bread! The tartar was fresh and sweet. Best I had in a while! I ordered the kasbah lamb shank with merquez, which is basically a lamb leg with a sausage. Both were excellent! Not gamy and very very tender. The sauce is delicious! I had a piece of the lamb rib (dibi haoussa) and that was very tender as well!& FYI if you check in & order 2 entrees, you get a free dessert!"
12/12/2015,2 star rating,"What a difference two years makes--and that ain't good. The whole place is remodeled: the romantic dim lights are now bright, there are fewer artifacts, the unique qualities of the place are gone. Worse still are the changes in the food--the tender hanger steak I'd dreamed about is a different and cheaper cut. Tough, I must add, and too done outside, not done enough inside. Only the fabulous sauce and Yukon Gold mash were unchanged. (The asparagus was replaced by really good baby spinach--acceptable substitution.) The service was the most unkindest cut of all--the server was spraying disinfectant on the adjoining tables, and it wafted in the direction of our drinks. When we asked for replacements, he told us that nothing had gotten in them, and he didn't replace them until we insisted--this was ginger ale and Coke, y'unnerstand, not even cocktails! Our crème brulee came in a chipped ramekin, and the cashier had trouble breaking a twenty. Robert Irvine would have knocked a few heads together on this paragraph alone.(I'm seeing this review over a year later (12/15) w/no idea why it says I didn't finish it, so I'll try posting again.)"

3/29/2012,5 star rating,"My friend and I discovered Ponty through Groupon, and it's one of the top three meals we've had since I got into Groupons. The African artifacts, dim lights, and super music (Youssou N'Dour) gave it an exotic vibe before we even sat down. The staff was unfailingly patient (we asked questions about every dish on the menu) and friendly. Two nights have passed and I'm still dreaming of the hanger steak with the sweet/savory sauce and the Yukon Gold potato puree and the asparagus, to say nothing of the creme brulee. When the chef came out to thank us afterward, I practically kissed his hand."

2/28/2014,5 star rating,"Amazing African food with an American twist. The poisson yassa fish was soooo tender and literally fell right off the fish bones- delicious. Everything was so well seasoned that I had to taste everyone's plate.My experience at the restaurant was great. In the beginning I was upset because they moved my party of 5 (who had a reservation) to another table after we had already sat down and got comfortable. However, the manager gave my table free champagne and apologized, and even explained what happened (handicap-accessible table)."
7/21/2016,5 star rating,Amazing! Had the mussels to start and the hanger steak for entree and enjoyed every bite! Would come back again and again!
9/7/2016,5 star rating,I had an amazing lunch. Make sure you ask for the Grilled Salmon  from Samir. The Salmon was perfect and the veggies super crisp you can taste the freshness. I wish my stomach was bigger I would order another. Can't wait to come back and taste everything on the menu. 10thumbs up

7/11/2018,4 star rating,Everything was delicious and the staff treated us very well! I recommend the mussels in African seasoning and seafood risotto. The desserts were also on point!
2/16/2014,4 star rating,"Good North African / French restaurant.Mussels in African spices were flavorful, but the broth was on the bottom and the vessel didn't allow even distribution.  Nitpicking, I know, but its really all about getting the flavor with the mussels.My guest had a beautiful salad.  I don't remember the specifics, but she really enjoyed it. The place is small, so make a reservation and be prepared to be close to others.  That being said, I'll go back."
9/15/2015,5 star rating,"Omg.  I love this place.  Best muscles ever!!! The Africana muscles sauce is absolutely delicious.  I visit New York every so often and I alway have to devote a dinner night here for the muscles.  The atmosphere is pretty nice and cozy.  The window sitting is the best when the weather is nice.  It is a bit small, however it's never been an issue during my dinning."
6/7/2016,5 star rating,"I had lamb chops and it was very good! Service was very good too; my waiter was very polite and i didn't wait more than 10 minutes, even though the restaurant was not empty. Great ambiancs too. Highly recommended!"
9/22/2013,5 star rating,"This may be the best restaurant in the neighborhood from 3rd avenue and east.  As you head west towards Park Avenue and Broadway, there are many fine restaurants, but between 3rd ave and 1st ave, this is probably the best in the area.I walked in randomly late on a late Friday evening  without knowing about this place and had a top notch meal.  I returned recently and was once again treated to an excellent experience.  Our lovely African waitress was attentive, polite, and friendly.  We started with a cheese plate which was enough for 4.  last time we had the olive appetizer, and that was also plenty for 4.  I had the pork chop special and my wife had the steak.  We shared both and couldn't decide which was better.  The food here is both familiar and exotic.  Grilled meats prepared skillfully, but with unique and delicious seasonings.  This is a special restaurant and I'm glad I live so close by so I can come here whenever I want!"

5/11/2016,2 star rating,"The seafood risotto was rich, well-cooked, and tasty. The mussels Africana were also very delicious (save some bread so you can dip it in the sauce!). The passion fruit martini was very sour and kind of meh.The issue, and the reason for 2 stars, was that the Poisson Yassa (red snapper) was FULL of bones. This was not a whole fish and the server did not tell me to look out for bones, so I expected 1 or 2, but not nearly as many as I found, including several that were very large and even a fin. When you pay $27 for a piece of fish you expect it to have been properly de-boned. Because the fish is served skin-up with a large amount of olives and other veggies directly on top, it is extremely difficult to find and remove bones before you take a bite, so I found myself picking bones out of my mouth as I ate. This is not only disgusting but a choking hazard. I would not go here again, but for those who do, I do not recommend the snapper unless you are very careful and look out for bones."
12/10/2013,5 star rating,"Cozy little restaurant and all the wait staff is awesomely friendly. It almost seemed like they were jumping over each other to serve me. Great service, delicious food, and the strongest espresso I have ever had. I made a reservation a day in advance without any problems for 6.30 on a Friday night. By the time we were done, the restaurant was packed full. Everyone seemed to have ordered the muscles and they smelled heavenly, but we went with the chicken spring rolls, branzino, and the hanger steak. They were all fairly big portions and I was stuffed, but who can say no to dessert? We shared the profiteroles and espresso. All in all, this is a very lovely restaurant."
11/3/2013,4 star rating,"Summary: Solid food options, with some dishes having a unique taste due to the African spice blend. Happy hour drinks option is great.A small group of us came here for dinner, and I think overall we left happily stuffed. We managed to get there in time for their 2-for-1 martini happy hour special, which is a pretty great deal. As for the food, some of the dishes were fairly standard options, but some were much more unique with more of an emphasis on the African spice palette. I got the lamb in this style, and it was surprisingly approachable while being definitively unique.Some of their other dishes, like the truffle mac and cheese and the mussels, were good but not that unique. I would definitely come back to try a different dish off of their fairly large menu!Service was great. Restaurant as a whole was a bit crowded, so definitely make a reservation before coming."
1/11/2013,5 star rating,"I went to Ponty Bistro last night for a friend's birthday. My fiance and I arrived about 30 minutes before our reservation, and they sat us quickly. It's small and very charming, and they have beautiful French and African music playing softly. We ordered drinks while we awaited the rest of our party. I had the Chocolate Martini, which was divine, and my fiance had the Bissap Martini, and he enjoyed that as well. When our 5 other friends arrived, the service stepped up even higher. They made sure everyone had drinks, answered our questions about the menu, and took our orders. The food didn't take too long to come. It's perfect to relax, talk, listen to music, and enjoy your drinks. I hate when other restaurants rush you and dump all your food on you like they can't wait to clear the table. This experience was a needed reprise! Everyone ordered their own entree, but when the food came, it was so beautiful that we all passed our plates around the table to sample each other's dish. Everything was remarkable. The truffle macaroni and cheese appetizer was exceptional. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they used, but it was melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Their escargot was killer, too. There was a lot of seasoning and breading that I am not used to on my buttery snails - but, wow! I'm a fan now!My entree was the Niokolokoba, which is a grilled sirloin steak marinated with Senegalese spices.  They served it with French fries and au poivre sauce. I asked for it well done, and it was still so juicy and tender. The sauce was amazing. I've never had such a perfectly seasoned steak in a restaurant. Even the French fries were better than usual fries. My fiance ordered the Kasbah lamb shank with merquez that has five spices, couscous and onion sauce. That was unbelievably delicious, too. I sampled a roasted chicken dish my friend ordered that left a simmering heat on your tongue, but didn't take away from the meal, and the crab cakes were fantastic. Even the birthday cake they brought over for my friend was delicious. Rich layers of dark chocolate, beautiful and not too sweet. I loved this place and will definitely return!"
1/23/2013,4 star rating,"Found my way over to this gem over in Gramercy a few months ago. The food here is absolutely delicious and I'll definitely be back many more times. The main stand out is their truffle macaroni and cheese. While not comparable to places like Beechers, (which is pretty much unbeatable) it's delicious and some of the best mac n cheese you can get. I also had an order or wings in pineapple sauce and shrimp scampi. Both of which were delicious, especially the wings. The wings weren't breaded or overly drenched in sauce, it was just right. The scampi was very good as well, not as good as the wings and mac n cheese, but it was none the less delicious.The chef came out to introduce himself and check to see how we enjoyed the meal and he seemed like a pretty nice guy as well. The staff was a bit slow, but the food more than made up for that. Look forward to coming back here soon!"
12/28/2013,4 star rating,"Absolutely delectable! Stumbled upon this place while searching for a local restaurant with some friends. To start off, the atmosphere was really amiable and the waiters were more than friendly (I think we even got served by one of the chefs). Make sure to go early or make a reservation, as the place fills up quickly. Now on to the food. Appetizers: We ordered the Mussels Africana,  which were really nicely flavored. It was a little spicy (as a word of caution, they don't indicate on the menu whether certain dishes are spicy, so you will have to find out for yourself). At the end, quite delicious. Entrees: I ordered the stuffed filet, which was basically a flounder stuffed with crabmeat on top of a bed of spinach and some fingerling potatoes. The fish almost melted in my mouth. I wish the dish was a little less salty though, which was the only minus. I had to drink a lot of water. My friends both got a chicken dish, which was also very tender and well-prepared.Dessert: We shared a tiramisu cake. It tasted really fresh, with a strong coffee taste. Loved it! One of the best tiramisu I've had.The place is a little pricey though, but if you are looking to go somewhere with a nice atmosphere, quick service, friendly atmosphere, and good food, this is the place to go."

8/29/2016,5 star rating,Came across this place doing a random search on Yelp. Great find! The food was wonderful and our waiter was so friendly and helpful.

I will definitely be back when I am in NYC next.

With the French influence, everything also had a richness to it.It did start to get busy around 7:30/8PM, but that's a good sign of an awesome restaurant. If you go around 6:30PM the atmosphere is more low key and quiet, which is perfect right after work.Can't wait to go back!"
4/28/2013,4 star rating,"I love Ponty Bistro because they have perfected three of my favorite things (mussels, fried calamari, and a good cocktail, they offer 2 for 1 martinis), on top of a menu of authentic African-French fusion, and dishes inspired from around the world. The owners and chefs are brothers from Senegal and have worked in renowned NYC restaurants including Daniel and The Mercer Kitchen. They have fulfilled their dreams of opening their own restaurant, located on Third Ave and 19th.Ponty Bistro stands out to me because of their diverse menu, offering flavors and dishes from West Africa, France, Asia, Italy, Spain and America. My favorite thing we had: The Moules Africana--made with Senegalese spices,  a shallot-garlic white wine sauce combined with a coconut-milk broth, infused with lemongrass. This mussel dish was an exotic twist on mussels that I have never experienced. Be sure to try their martinis and fried calamari. I'd love to come here again with a group to try more of their enticing menu.Menu highlights from around the world:Crispy Tuna with cilantro, pickled, soy ginger vinaigrette & wasabi aioli   Croquettes De Crab - Crab cake with mango salsa and avocado coulis   Lobster Shrimp Salad avocado tempura, baby greens, fennel and lemon vinaigrette Roasted Beet Salad roasted beets, blue cheese, walnuts, garnished with sliced of orange & balsamic vinaigretteEscargot with a herb garlic butter and cognac  Shrimp Tabouli - Grilled shrimp with tabouli and tomato vinaigrette Pan seared filet mignon, served with asparagus, potatoes, mushrooms and bordelaise sauceFive Stars Seafood Risotto with lobsters, shrimp, mussels, scallops and calamari"

12/17/2012,4 star rating,"I feel like you need to understand what you're getting into when you decide to eat here.  This is a small, family-run (or so it would appear) establishment, so if you're looking for a place for a quick bite and rapid service, this isn't the restaurant for you.  However, if you seek a nice, relaxing evening for a date or a brunch/dinner with a small group of friends, this is the place to come.  I've been here many times for dinner and twice for brunch.  Every single time, the food has been excellent.  The Mussels Africana are so good that the last time we ordered them, we just asked for spoons so we could eat the broth.  No need to waste time with bread.  The salmon tartare is also to die for.  It comes with avocado mousse and is thick cubes of raw, seasoned salmon.  It was definitely not taken from a can!  The main dish portions are reasonably sized but never skimp on the ingredients or flavor.  I had lobster risotto one evening, and large chunks of lobster were laced throughout the dish.  Delicious!To add to the perks, the martinis are always well mixed and always two for one!  My only reason for docking it one star is that they took away their unlimited brunch, and that greatly disappoints me."
12/2/2012,2 star rating,"Brunch review only. There are much better brunch places around. I'd be curious to try their dinner from looking at the reviews, but I'm not sure I'll be back.I really had high hopes based on the other reviews and an awesome menu. However, the food was mediocre. We ordered:Norwegian Benedict - terrible hollandaise destroyed this dish, eggs were slightly overdone, and the salmon was tasteless and dry. Home fries were okay but were littered with peppers. Zero seasoning on anything.Scrambled Bruschetta - lacked any flavor and was just ""meh.""Oatmeal - fine, no complaints.Coffee - fine, nothing to write home about.Service was nice but we could barely understand the guy (one of my friends is bilingual in French - this was a mumbling issue) - and he disappeared for LONG periods of time. It took like 10 minutes to get salt and pepper, and more than 30 to get the check.They did leave us alone to visit and chat, which was nice. It was clear, however, why the place was more than half empty on a Sunday morning when other brunch spots had lines out the door.Edit: I got a message from the owner and hope to try their dinner in the future. Props to owners who acknowledge unhappy customers and try to remedy the issues."
3/4/2013,5 star rating,"Everyone customer that walks in the door says they have a reservation so make your reservations. The decor inside was very different from the outside. Wish they changed up the outside so people can come in here without questioning what type of cuisine this is. Ladies love a clean bathroom, but this was a unisex bathroom and it was still very clean. Credits to maintaining a unisex bathroom.  (****)I started off with the crab cake...a must order. It was deeeelicious. They served bread as a complimentary as well, but you can definitely make room for that crab cake. (*****)I had the Lobster BLT which was last thing on the menu, but it caught my eyes like that. Bacon was crispy and not oily. Lobster had its own favor. I was picking if off the sandwich. Might I add... I didn't let one piece go to waste. The bread wasn't soggy either. They toast the bread and so you feel a crunch when you bite into it. It felt so health at the same time so right. I can order a whole bunch of it and never get bored of it. (*****)Service was amazing. They were very busy, but never gave us a check to kick us out. I never had to ask for refill for my water because they come before I could ask. (****)Ponty Bistro...you will definitely see my face again because I'm coming back for you lobster BLT."

We told the waiter that they forgot the bacon for both of us..and he brought bacon only for one. We asked two other people for more bacon and it took almost 20 minutes to get it. how long does it take to bring over bacon?When the waiter brought us the check we brought up the fact of the bacon delay and he said he'd be right back. He then came back and said that he couldn't take off one of the sandwiches because the check had already been processed and his boss would get mad...he offered free dessert, but we were already full.Poor service."

The atmosphere is relaxed and calm. My only complaint is that it gets very hot in the summer..I don't know if they don't have good AC or if it just wasn't working.The menu is diverse and can please all types of people. (Example--I came here with two friends--one who is a pescatarian, Kosher, and allergic to soy products, peanuts and more and another who is on the very strict dukan diet.  Fun bunch! But we were all able to find something and all left very satisfied)I definitely recommend."

1/30/2018,4 star rating,The dinner & brunch at Ponty are great! My favorite is the African mussels. However the location in Gramercy is closed. Someone should update this information on Yelp. Good thing they have a location in Harlem.
9/5/2014,4 star rating,"a great combination of cuisines, Ponty nails it. it's an interesting mix of French, African, Middle Eastern, and even some Italian influences. do you crave pasta? merguez? moules? tagine? they've got it all.the atmosphere here is a warm and friendly bistro with African/Mediterranean artwork. friendly and helpful service.my choice of entree was the lamb shank with merguez and couscous in an onion-based sauce. tender, juicy, and spicy, it hit the spot.fairly priced and tucked away in the middle of a busy street, it feels like a hidden gem. I'll be back."
7/13/2016,5 star rating,The food is too good to describe!! We had the crispy tuna appetizer and it is to die for!!! Mushroom risotto was excellent!!! I can't say enough amazing things about this restaurant!! 10/10 recommend
11/1/2014,5 star rating,"This was an outstanding find for us in Yelp! The food was amazing. The service was impeccable, Amir was very conscientious and helpful! We had a party of 6, and they fed us at a leisurely, but attentive pace. We never felt rushed or neglected. I had the steak with Senegalese sauce and it was delicious. The soup special was Lobster Bisque and it was outstanding. The restaurant was busy and had a great, young, active vibe. There was a nice African background theme music playing. We l highly recommend it if you are in the Gramercy Park area for dinner."
5/26/2016,2 star rating,"I normally don't write negative reviews.  I'm hoping they take this as constructive criticism.  I was excited to see that they offered a Salad Nicoise, which is so hard to find around here.  It looked good in the container, too.  But then I tasted it and it was...warm.  By warm I don't mean ""not cold,"" I mean warm...like it had been sitting in the sun.  Or maybe the cooked tuna was added too soon and warmed up the salad in the container.  In either case, it was no good.  Have you ever eaten warm lettuce?  It's pretty gross.  I pretty much ate just the tuna and nothing else.  Please...don't do this to such a nice salad."
9/2/2015,4 star rating,"Excellent food, great service and so quiet! I feel like an old person saying this - but this was the perfect spot for an intimate birthday dinner. We could actually hear each other! what a novelty. Food was reasonably priced and so delicious! Service was excellent.  I'm not much of a wine drinker, so cannot comment on drinks. I cannot wait to go back!"
5/15/2014,5 star rating,"What a wonderful find!  My wife and I stopped in last night in time for the early bird (pre-6:30) 3 course dinner for $25, and 2-for-1 martinis for $12.  Our waiter was more than accommodating, even allowing us to make a few substitutions due to my wife's dietary restrictions.  The drinks were delicious (I loved my ginger martinis), and the service was attentive.  I loved the salsa music playing while reviewing the French-Senegalize menu--truly a cross-cultural experience.And the food!  I had the chicken spring roll appetizer, and my wife had the artichoke salad.  Both were delicious and different than anything I've had elseswhere (and I've been eating out for 35+ years).  The main courses were hanger steak (my wife) and the seafood tagine (me).  The latter was in an African-spice infused sauce that was unlike anything I've eaten elswhere.In short, we have a new favorite neighborhood spot--so much so that we're going back with friends tonight!"
5/8/2016,1 star rating,Made reservarions for 12 noon for 10 for Mothers Day. At 12:51 they tried to seat us at a table big enough for 6. Really I was totally disappointed and my mom was very unhappy. So we left needless to say we wont be going back and I won't recommend this place to anyone.
5/6/2015,4 star rating,"I've eaten here a few times now. My favorite thing I got here was the lobster benedict brunch, but everything I've had has been good quality. The ambiance is nice, and but the service is not always as reliable as the food. On my last visit I was pleasantly surprised by how good the mixed veggies with couscous entree was. The other thing I like about Ponty is that it isn't too crowded. On a Friday or Saturday night it is a great date dinner option where I know I'll get decent french fare with a Moroccan flare and we probably wont have to get a table."
2/28/2013,4 star rating,"Who do I sell my soul to for this Wild Mushroom Truffle Risotto?I could eat an endless bowl of this, foreverForever ever? Forever ever.My friends and I still have dreams of this risotto to this very day.The Niokolokoba sirloin steak with pepercorn sauce is smashing. Really great food."
3/17/2013,5 star rating,"We live around the corner and have been wanting to review this place for a while now. We absolutely love it! French cuisine when done right is unbeatable, throw in some Senegalese fusion into the mix and the result is divine. It's fine dining with a twist- classic french dishes with african aromas, The quality of food should have the place packed everyday but it remains an underrated gramercy gem. It's not cheap but it's worth it.The steak is sublime, the mushroom risotto is fantastic and the Senegalese chicken dish looks simple but has complex layers of taste and spiciness that fills your mouth on the first bite.nice for a quiet dinner for two, also works for groups. This is a family run place and the people are super warm nice and very friendly, during rush hours (weekend dinner etc) they are sometimes understaffed and the food takes longer, but be patient- it really is worth it - highly recommended !"
1/20/2016,5 star rating,Three of us ate here for the early bird special. We were delighted with our two course delicious meals.  Don't miss the wonderfully tasty butternut squash soup. All three entrees bore the mark of high quality preparation and presentation. Leave room for the sumptuous desserts. We had the creme brûlée and the warm apple tart. We will be back again!
1/16/2016,5 star rating,Great Restaurant!Came here after a spa treatment at Red door with my hubby. The ambiance was warm and inviting. We ordered the Ratatouille and French onion soup for appetizers and they were excellent and tasty.  Ordered Sangria and it was made fresh which tastes wonderful. For dinner my hubby had the flank steak with mashed potatoes and I ordered the stuffed flounder with crabmeat.  Both were delicious and we ate from each other's plates.  We finished with cappuccino and creme brûlée. It was an awesome experience and well worth it. Will come back again. Thank you.
7/14/2012,4 star rating,"Ponty's is what you would call a neighborhood gem. It is not fancy. It is not especially trendy or breakthrough. But you will have a good meal, from the owner-chef, which will offer a lovely fusion of French and African flavors. You will be treated well and you can drinks so lovely wine here. Try the Tangine night. Try the African mussels. Try the Lamb."
4/2/2016,4 star rating,Love this place !!! everything I've tried has been amazingly delicious - especially the tangine. even the chicken sandwich with Carmelized onions was memorably good! Everything tastes fresh and the flavors are exceptional. It's the perfect neighborhood bistro the way Nyc used to be - come here for lunch price fixe good deal and skip the chain restaurants robbing us of NYC ethnic cultural diversity
1/7/2014,5 star rating,"Amazing food, great service, VERY accommodating chef!!I ate at Ponty last night and had a wonderful meal. The Calabash soup was incredible, along with the artichoke salad with truffle dressing. The wait staff was amazing. As a picky eater, the chef came out and made me everything I wanted to my crazy standards and it was all so goooooood!!Also enjoyed profiteroles for dessert. They actually make them on the spot- I know because they were even willing to substitute the ice cream flavor. All in all was amazing experience and would recommend this to anyone looking for a cozy spot with some warm food and friendly and flexible service. Yes!"
2/5/2012,3 star rating,"As a former child puzzle champion (word, math, logic, 3-D puzzles: shit, I was well rounded!), I've solved some mighty wily conundrums, but how Ponty Bistro has racked up a 4-star rating is a riddle beyond me. By my powers of assumptive deductions, I must conclude that people who rated this establishment above average (4 or 5 stars) must satisfy two axioms:1) They have experienced sheltered, bland food lives in which little flavor has ever graced their tongues.2) They have a Midwestern understanding of the proper ""doneness"" of meat. (I can say this because I am from the Midwest, where the mountains of well-done steaks consumed annually could blanket the U.S. in shades of ashy grey. Yes, it is proper and right that we deeply mourn this tragedy.)Did I have a terrible meal at Ponty Bistro? Not by any means. Ponty Bistro seems perfectly capable of serving up a solidly mediocre meal. A perfect C.The Alcohol:2 for 1 martinis sounds like a good deal if your definition of ""good deal"" = well gin + one additional flavor additive that fails at masking the ""well."" We ordered a ginger martini and a lychee martini. The ginger martini had a strong, stale ginger taste, and its lychee counterpart clearly was no more than gin mixed with the sugary preserve liquid that houses canned lychees. I'm fairly certain that the ingredients never even saw the inside of a cocktail shaker.The Food:*Mussels Africana smelled amazing and did have a nice sauce--hints of chili and cumin and turmeric--but the mussels were small and tough (overdone) and hadn't absorbed any of the flavors. Eventually, we totally gave up on them and just asked for more bread to dip in the sauce.*Kesbah Lamb Shank was a calamity of overcooked mutton. This could not have been lamb it was so tough and sinewy, and so overcooked and dry that little shards that were burnt crisp slashed away inside my mouth. The only redeeming component was the merguez, which was really delicious.*Braised Branzino (whole) was simply ordinary. The accompanying plaintains, however, were disappointing--dry and flavorless--and made me long for Pio Pio.*Tarte Tatin dessert promised me cinnamon ice cream. In that round of hide and seek, the cinnamon was hiding. And I failed to seek it out.The Ambiance: The service is the real redeeming factor. Ponty Bistro may not look like much from the outside (has black and orange bubble font ever turned anyone on?), but wandering inside, the vibe is friendly and warm with just the perfect level of inaudible buzz. The kitschy decor strikes the perfect tone of homey, and the service is attentive, yet laid back. We finished dinner at 8:45 but sat around chatting (first over dessert, and then over tea, and finally over water) until 11:30, without any disturbances or pressure to leave. Granted, there was no longer a wait, but still, I have to really appreciate their graciousness.Come here to linger over 2 for 1 glasses of wine. Skip the overpriced, uninspired (most definitely NOT French African) food."
3/19/2013,4 star rating,"This place is excellent, but quite pricey. Luckily, we booked our reservation through Savored, so we got 30%, which made a big difference. I believe it was 30% off for 7pm and 15% off at 7:30 for a Friday night. My boyfriend and I each ordered a glass of sangria-- I got white, he got red. Both were very good.. definitely recommend (the white was particularly unique-- pear or something.. yum!) Also, with the 30% off it was only around $6/glass-- AWESOME. For apps we ordered the raved-about crab cake-- it was good and I would get it again, but not the best to share, and the caesar salad, which we also really enjoyed. My boyfriend had the Senegalese Chicken (I think that's what it was called) and I got the lobster risotto that was one of the specials. I don't think my boyfriend LOVED the chicken but it was definitely very good. I, on the other hand, LOVEDDDDDD the lobster risotto-- packed with lobster, VERY flavorful, cooked amazingly, but very heavy if you don't like that kind of thing. The risotto was $32/$35 I think, so I'm really glad we had the discount b/c I did not ask how much it was before ordering it.. ouy, my poor boyfriend. We ordered the crepe for dessert-- my boyfriend loved it, I thought it was good, but probably wouldn't get it again. The wait staff is extremely pleasant and the chef/owner comes out and talks to nearly every table, but not in an annoying/offensive way. In fact, to his credit, my date and I were deep in conversation and although it looked like he wanted to come over, he had enough sense to just walk by and wait for another appropriate time--very attentive. We will be back."
7/20/2009,4 star rating,"Wow...the best 2 course lunch I've had in a while for less than 12$. It was a great find after visiting my great aunt in Gramercy, I passed by this empty yet inviting place for a little lunch and discovered they had a 2 course lunch special for $11.99 with a pretty large menu to choose from! The salad I had was fresh and well-dressed. The lobster BLT was AMAZING! ....unexpectedly, I had the BEST FRIES here! :)The waitress was very friendly and offered me a cocktail for their happy hour price! Awesome, but didn't take it cause I had other things to take care of in the afternoon...couldn't take that chance. @_*."
12/23/2013,5 star rating,Went with 3 other friends. Each of us ordered something different and loved it. The portion size is more than enough and the lamb I got was perfectly cooked and tender. Got the Tiramisu for dessert -awesome! A fun surprise was the craft beer options from Africa. Awkward story behind Tusker on the back.Great place to bring friends & family visiting from out of town or a special date night. Service was also excellent and relatively quick despite the restaurant being packed.
3/10/2016,5 star rating,"This place caught my eye and I'm glad it did. The French style mussels were the best I've ever had. The server suggested the African style for our next visit. Lovely service as well, but for real. The mussels are so good."
12/13/2015,1 star rating,Food is OK but what really sucked is that I was presented with a credit card charge of $159 for a $131 bill. At least they apologized... Still it wasn't cool. So watch your credit card receipt.
8/27/2012,4 star rating,"What an amazing find! I must go back for more. You see, it was brunch-time and a dear friend was staying nearby. So, for the sake of convenience, Ponty seemed like the way to go. The food and service was pitch perfect. My eggs benedict w/salmon was great and my side of crispy bacon was baconlicious. We all agreed the home fries were far more superior than the average mushy, flavorless glob you find at brunch. When we asked for hot sauce - OMG, the server brings out a cute lil serving dish of both Tabasco AND Sriracha. He brought out two diff't sauces for our saucing pleasure. Which is amazing, since everything in life can use a lil Sriracha spice, if you ask me. Oh, and the sangria, full of fruit and also delicious.If Ponty serves up a mean a$$ brunch, I can't wait to see what's in store for dinner..."
12/26/2011,2 star rating,"I'm seriously confused about how this place has 4 stars. We went for Brunch and aside from the fact that it looked like a diner packed with senior citizens, the food was meh.  I had the Steak Sandwich. It wasnt anything special. The potatoes were burnt. Wasn't impressed."
4/30/2012,1 star rating,I really had high hopes for this place given that Yelp had good reviews and the menu looks delectable but the experience was horrible.Came here with two friends and we got the mussels to share. They must've used some poor grade mussels because most of the ones I punctured with my fork came out black. I didn't realize this until I had eaten a good plateful and I was disgusted. I knew it tasted off and I wish I had looked carefully before popping these in my mouth. I had the lobster risotto and there was barely any lobster in there. All I tasted was the essence and the fat. My friend's steak was alright. I had a bite and it was a bit too dry for my liking even though she asked for medium rare. The other friend had the special fish of the day which was better than all the food we had on the table.Both my friends wound up staying up late in the toilet. Quite possibly from the bad mussels. I apparently have an iron clad stomach. It rumbled like the train but i wasn't sitting on the crap pot like my friends were. I felt so bad for my friends since I brought them here. It was such an awful night for them...
5/11/2010,1 star rating,"A friend and I came to Ponty Bistro for brunch based on strong reviews.  Although we had a reservation we waited for around 20 minutes.  The food was less than mediocre, my goat cheese and mushroom omelet looked like it was deep fried, and it had some bacon in it--not pleasant for a strict vegetarian.The waitstaff first told me I was wrong, and he was completely unapologetic when he realized it was indeed bacon.  They didn't remove the meal from my bill until I insisted."
2/27/2012,4 star rating,"One day around five months ago, my then-boyfriend and I were walking to Mumbles from Baruch College to get ourselves something for lunch.  When we got to Mumbles and saw that it was closed for a private party, we stumbled across Ponty Bistro while walking back towards school.  Because we were starving (and the menu looked pretty good), we took a chance and went inside for lunch.The first thing I noticed was how friendly our host/waiter was, along with how empty the restaurant was at the time.  Normally, seeing only one other occupied table at  any restaurant during lunch hours can make me question how good the food may (or may not) be....boy, was I wrong.Everything about Ponty Bistro screams professionalism.  Our waiter was patient and helpful while we were trying to decide what to order since I wasn't really great at reading some of the menu.  We decided on the fried calamari for the appetizer, my then-boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the penne and vodka sauce with chicken.The calamari was perfectly spiced, tender, and delicious.  Our waiter even joked around about how quickly we ate it.  I think we inhaled the calamari within the time it took for him to get the pitcher to refill our glasses of water.  XD  My then-boyfriend was absolutely floored by his filet mignon, and so was I.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the potatoes roasted to perfection, and the sauce... DAT SAUCE.  I'd give up a paycheck just to know how to make that sauce at home.  As for my meal, the vodka sauce was very tasty, but there were a LOT of garlic cloves in the sauce.  I love garlic, so this wasn't a problem for me, but I figure some other Yelpers might want to know in case they plan on ordering it.As if the meal couldn't get any better, we decided to order some dessert.  After being unable to decide, I asked the waiter which desserts he would suggest.  He informed me the only dessert not made in-house was the cheesecake (which I found to be funny because it's literally called ""Ponty Cheesecake""), so I went with the creme brulee.  My then-boyfriend ordered the chocolate fondant.I never realized I spent my entire life until that point eating less-than-par creme brulee, because what Ponty gave me was truly exceptional.  The consistency of the dessert was soft enough to melt in my mouth, but firm enough to stand up on its own in the ramekin.  Thinking about the contrast between the cold custard and the warm toasted sugar layer on top gives me cravings as I write this.  My then-boyfriend's chocolate fondant was so thick and rich that I couldn't handle more than a couple of small bites.  However, he loved it so much he said he would have ordered another one if he weren't so full.Overall, I cannot think of a better place to have a special lunch or dinner with either your significant other, close friends, or business associates.  I've been back here on numerous occasions just to drag my friends along and make them addicted to the food.  (And to answer your question, they are!)"
9/16/2013,4 star rating,Went there with my friend for dinner on Friday night. The ambiance was very nice and noise level was just right so we could hold a conversation. The service was kind.The food was amazing: it taste wonderful and the portions were just right (so you don't stuff yourself) - best  value for price!If I would have live in the neighborhood I would definitely eat there more often.
11/7/2011,2 star rating,"French, African? Sounds amazing. This place has been on my 'to try' list for the longest time.  We were looking for brunch spots in the area and Ponty Bistro was an option, so I steered the girls over to try it out. The menu looked pretty standard for a brunch menu. I immediately started with a bloody mary and was served an anemic cousin that was naked and undrinkable, even after my sinusitis has depreciated my sense of taste. I ordered the bruchetta [sic]  with eggs, goat cheese and pesto and was served scrambled eggs on top of a buttered baguette with a drizzle of pesto sauce. The home fries were soggy. A friend with high cholesterol unsuccessfully tried to order her salmon benedict without yolk, but the got frustrated and just ordered it sans egg. I hear the lobster benedict was good, though.   The kicker was, as soon as we were finishing up, the table next to us got a beautiful, healthy looking bloody mary... The 2 stars are for the service, though. Aside from the egg yolk fiasco, the servers were so attentive and quick, but I don't think I'd ever go back for the brunch."
5/10/2010,5 star rating,"It would be difficult to overstate how positive our experience was.  Walked in on Mother's Day with 3 adults and 2yr old baby--obviously not ideal for a small bistro--and were warmly greeted by the chef/owner and told we could be accomodated immediately (they even took the stroller downstairs to make room).We asked if we could order off the full menu although it was lunchtime and they let us order from the $45 prix fix menu which was created for mother's day dinner.  Started with lobster bisque, which was excellent.  Wife and I had the sliced skirt steak (l'onglete) with bordelaise and delicious mashed yukon gold potatoes and sauteed spinach.  My sister-in-law had the seafood pasta which was also fantastic.  Dessert was very good as well; we ordered one of each dish offered and shared cheesecake, tiramasu and chocolate cake.  Chocolate cake was the best.As we walked out, we noticed a photo of the chef with daniel boulud and realized he was a chef at Daniel before opening Ponty--makes sense!Great find in gramercy, look forward to my next visit."
1/2/2015,2 star rating,"This restaurant has gotten incredible reviews, so I was quite excited to try it. The restaurant is a bit pricey with entrees ranging from $25-$30, and appetizers from $10-$20. For that price, I definitely do NOT think the quality of food and relatively unimpressive ambience is worth it. Everything we ate was ok-- fried calamari, filet mignon and hangar steak. The meat was DRENCHED with sauce, which to me indicates a lower quality product. The filet was delicious, and if it had been about $15, I would not have had a complaint. But, for $30, it seemed like a rip off.The ambiance, as I mentioned, is not one of a pricey restaurant, but more like a lower end chinese or thai restaurant. I also definitely did not get a vibe in either the ambiance or food of anything African or Mediterranean. The service was fabulous, and everyone was incredibly friendly, attentive, and great. Again, I am not saying don't go to Ponty Bistro. What I want this review to indicate is that the food is priced WAY too high for the quality of the overall experience."
6/3/2012,1 star rating,"When we went to the restaurant we were greeted by the Chef which was great. But then came the waiter Rahim, a tall young guy whom I thought could have gave better services to us. I asked him for Sparkling water and I'm not sure did he not heard me but he gave us both tap water and he even spilled it on our table. Okay, then I guess I'll say it a second time. The second time around, we got our glass of Sparkling water but my glass stink like hell. I asked my bf to smell it, at first he couldn't smell it but then he did. I asked another waiter to help us change the glass. And he definitely was the nicer waiter out of the two. He actually take time to tell us the special of the day. I wish he was our waiter. We were not greeted with bread. I was wondering why because all the other table had it. So i was like you know what we will just order our entrees. Once our entrees came, my bf asked for the bread to our waiter. He was like oh if you want it, we can give it to you. I was like what was that suppose to me. You gave it to all the other tables besides us. Bread was served 15 minutes after we got our entrees. I had the Nickolokooa which was 27 dollars and my bf had the some kind of spiced chicken served with rice. Mine was Hanger Steak which was overcooked served with regular french fries. I kind of think this wasn't the African type of food I was looking for. Though portion are big, I think I will pass on this restaurant. My bf's entree was just chicken wtih regular white rice you can find at a chinese restaurant, and also some peppers mixed together, nothing special. After we're done with our food, our waiter clear our table but didn't ask us if we want dessert, I was like if i was gonna ask for the dessert, I am not gonna order it. To think I was to order dessert would take forever because we wanted to take the check and it took us 15 mins for that. I kind of was effy on even giving a tip since the service is so bad. But then we thought of the other waiter and we're like okay let's just give it. I wont' come back because of the service sorry."
11/2/2015,5 star rating,"The food is really, very good! Very flavorful! I especially love the tagine's curry gravy and the sweet, mustardy citrus sauce that came with the shrimp tabouli. I picked my chicken tagine to the bone even though I don't usually like dark meat. The rice is nice and buttery, mmm, just as it should be! My boyfriend really likes the lamb chawarma and lemon cheesecake!.. Though to be fair, he likes all chawarma and cheesecake. All in all--delicious! We'll definitely be coming back!"
1/19/2012,4 star rating,"The Blackboard Eats coupon brought me in, the food will bring me back.On my recent visit to NYC, I checked this place out thanks to a 30% off coupon. We ate there on New Years Eve day....early afternoon. The place was eerily empty, only one other table had diners and they left shortly after we sat. I'm guessing the place was packed later that night, especially given their hype of what fun festivities were coming in the evening in the restaurant and surrounding area. But for lunch, we pretty much had the place to ourselves.Armed with a big, fat coupon, my girlfriend and I (sort of) went to town on the food. Ponty salad: Loved it. Mixed baby greens, apples, carrots, grape tomatoes with a shallot vinaigrette? More please.Lobster ravioli: Loved it. The cream sauce was so good. More please.Side of grilled asparagus: Tough to screw that one up, but still...loved it. More please.White wine sangria: Loved it. More please.The service was friendly and attentive, and the place itself looks nice -- clean and well decorated. The prices are a bit high and may make me think twice about returning, but if I'm  hungry enough for a meal I know I'll love, I'll be back."
12/5/2010,5 star rating,"Delish! I had my birthday brunch today here and was super pleased! This place was chosen due to my love of eggs and lobster (they are one of the few places in NYC that have a lobster benedict) and I saw that my fellow Yelpers rated them well. My finance made the reservation for 14, and they had no problems accommodating. Even when my friend found a hair in her food, the chef/ part owner offered her unlimited free drinks. Now that's what I call service. Everyone loved their food, I LOVED my lobster benedict, and the owners even came out with some free bday desserts at the end. I would happily go here again, especially because I read on their whiteboard that there is an all you can eat mussels night. And I can eat a buttload of mussels. Thank you, Ponty Bistro, for providing me with a great 28th great birthday!!! I may be no more wiser and/or cooler than last year...but I certainly filled my belly well. xx, Anne H"
1/7/2011,5 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing. Good food, good service, good wine, good ambience...who could ask for anything more? I had the crab ragout stuffed flounder with baby bok choy and fingerling potatoes. It was so good! Everything was prepared to perfection!My sister had the vodka penne which was also really good. The seafood risotto was amazing too and I almost wished I had ordered that, but I stole enough from my brother to satisfy my needs.We were too stuffed to have dessert unfortunately, but that's a great testament to a really quality restaurant at a very affordable price. I sooo wish this was my neighborhood hang! (I live in CA)And PS--I hear the Chef was on the Food Network show, Chopped!"
9/12/2011,2 star rating,"Probably one of the slowest, worse service ever.  The waiter took forever to even give us water.  Then he never gave us any bread,even after asking for it twice.  The food was good, but didn't make up for the poor service.  Sad.. I thought this place had more potential.They have 2 for 1 martini specials, but its better you just skip those."
3/29/2011,5 star rating,"Been going to Ponty Bistro since they opened. It's a great neighborhood restaurant near Gramercy.  The food is always fresh, delicious (they really know how to prepare tuna) and inventive. The chef/owners are friendly and welcoming, and often bring out special treats to your table to try. The decor is nice and the service is good (except the one night our waiter spilled food on me - twice!) And did I mention the two for one martinis? Nice!Highly recommended."

I just had the delicious Ponty burger with cheddar. It was fantastic--even gluten-free, without the bun. I asked for non-starchy veggies instead of fries and Ponty really delivered! They gave me lots of yummy sautéed green beans and asparagus (with what I think was endive or fennel). Thanks for such a healthy and satisfying lunch! Yum!"

A few more peices of lobster meat would've been heavenly...but it was still on the money. So good, I had to go back. This time I had the samon burger...I've never tasted a salmon burger before and this one gave me life! It was seasoned to perfection. The third time I went there...which happens to be yesterday...I tried the shrimp sandwich...yummy, yummy, yummy was that shrimp in my tummy. So good. The chef/owner sent out some truffle mac & cheese for my toddler, he didn't like it too much..he's a simple little guy, but mama sure did. It's different than the mac & cheese I'm used to (southern baked) but it was good. Ponty Bistro has been added to my tried & tested lunch spots. I will be back...hopefully one day for dinner. Oh...and Amy (the server) is such a sweetheart!"

Both fantastic, along with the truffle Mac and cheese, which may be the best truffle mac&cheese I have ever had. Very friendly service as well!Monday is mussels night and Tuesday is tagine night. $25 for entree + wine!!"

7/7/2013,5 star rating,"This is my go-to resto in NYC. Whether you want to have a relaxing weekday dinner or want to treat out-of-town guest, this is a must. I've been lucky that this gem always has a table available when I arrive. One Friday evening, we came in around 8:30pm with a group of 8 and they were able to accomodate us immediately. Though that won't always be the case. This is a place for NYC locals (hence my hesitation with writing this review, but they deserve it). I am obsessed with their mussels and they always hit the spot. I always want to try something new, but can never turn down a great bowl of mussels, in which they offer a variety of sauces. I've yet to come here with a friend that was dissatisfied with their meal. Their Senegalese/French menu has something for all palettes (and I've been here with extreme foodies and picky eaters). Wonderful for seafood lovers, because their menu is seafood heavy, but they offer many other things. Their 2-for-1 Martinis are also divine! What a deal.Lastly, I want to highlight their exceptional staff. They have some of the friendliest people in NYC working here. They are prompt, kind and personable. The last time I was here we chatted about LAAMB wrestling with one of the staff (not sure who he was exactly) and he even shared some youtube videos via iPad. I felt as if we were being entertained and dined at someone's personal home. There are many other highlights and perks about this place, but I leave that for you to check it out. Can't share all their secrets."
7/7/2011,4 star rating,"After almost a year of living in the neighborhood, I've finally found a go-to brunch spot. Despite my preconceptions about French servers, people here are always charming, the music is comforting, and it always feels intimate. If you're looking for an escape from the myriad of undifferentiated Murray Hill brunch establishments (and don't want to wait in the ridic line at Penelope), look no further. Ponty has a $20 menu that includes classics as well as more elegant dishes, alongside a cocktail and coffee. Servers here are SO accommodating too - I requested extra bacon and shrimp in my bloody mary, and they were quick to oblige (for a modest fee, however). The lobster benedict is my favorite choice, followed closely by the duck confit omelet (not a huge fan of the swiss cheese inside though). The homefries they come with are adorned with rosemary, and even specks of bacon, and are cooked exactly to perfection. I could eat these all day.I confess I haven't been to dinner here yet, but friends have raved about the hangar steak. Soon this will be in my stomach. Even as I write this I'm conflicted, because while I do want to publicly endorse Ponty, I want it to remain as intimate as it has been during my previous visits."
1/22/2013,3 star rating,We ordered delivery from here and got the lobster BLT and steak sandwich with the chocolate fondant for dessert. The lobster BLT was just okay but I had really been looking forward to a steak sandwich and was just a touch disappointed. The steak was a little bit chewy and under seasoned. The chocolate fondant was the best part of the meal and it was only average.
8/15/2012,5 star rating,"absolutely amazing! just came here for lunch with a co-worker. They have 2 for 1 martinis - need I say more? The food here is homemade and you can taste the effort and love put into by the chef.So we had the french, apple, lychee and passion fruit martini. All delicious but the french was the best.Appetizers - shared the crab cake and shrimp tabouli. The crab cake was 95% crab which is awesome and the mango salsa and avocado complimented the cake well. The shrimp tabouli (4 pieces of shrimp) was gooood; especially the spices they put on it.Entree - sirloin steak and the seafood risotto. Big delicious servings; plenty to share.Dessert - they have a wide selection of desserts; never seen so many choices. We had the tiramisu and the tartini? I can't remember the exact name but it was caramelized apple with cinnamon ice cream - a perfect combination. The tiramisu was homemade and scrumptiousWe are definitely going back to sample the other martinis, dessert, and food."
11/15/2010,2 star rating,"I went here on a Saturday night for my friend's birthday. I actually recommended to try this place since it got 4 stars on yelp and my friend gave it 3 stars. Unfortunately, i think my friends left here a bit unsatisfied.First of all, my friend made reservations the morning of for a party of 7 ppl, and they said they were able to accommodate us, which is a plus. The place is small and narrow. The waitress didn't memorize the specials of the night, nor was she very knowledgeable of the contents of the menu. She also seemed disappointed when we only ordered 2 drinks, 1 app, and 7 entrees. I mean I agree that we were a bit on the cheap side, but still as a server, you shouldn't be showing a sour face in front of your clientele. The bread came out warm and toasted, which was a plus. It was brushed with olive oil, and it also came with butter. It was so good that one of my friends asked more because she loves her carbs.  For the app, we shared the Terrine de Fois Gras. This was weird. It was hard, cold, and it was in a rectangular slab shape so it reminded me of a pale chunk of spam. The taste was good, but it would have been nicer if it was warmer and softer. They offered only 2 pieces of bread, so we had to ask for more. It's pretty stupid in my opinion to offer 2 small pieces of bread for a huge slab of fois gras. The plus to the dish was the onion marmalade as well as the port wine reduction which really complemented the fois gras.For my entree i had the niokolokoba, which is the sirloin steak marinated with senegalese spices and topped with au poivre sauce and it also comes with fries. I asked for med. rare. They came out with an overcooked steak...medium. Granted this place isn't a steakhouse, so I let that go. However, the steak was pretty bland. I dont think they marinated the steak enough with the spices. It was barely noticeable, which was pretty much due to the fact that the au poivre sauce was overpowering it. I had better au poivre sauces at other steakhouses. The fries were seasoned with rosemary i believe, but they didn't really salt them. This dish was a total miss in my opinion. I had 2 friends that got the rack of lambs, which looked pretty good. However one lambchop was severely overcooked. I can't speak for the other dishes because i didn't try them, but I didn't hear any rave appraisals about them.In conclusion, i had high hopes for a place that served french style foods with Senegalese spices, but i left the place utterly disappointed. If i could do it over again, i would have gotten the escargot app and the veal chop special entree or the lamb shank."
4/16/2015,4 star rating,"Came here for a birthday dinner-date with a girlfriend and we definitely enjoyed it. Their service was attentive but they never hovered, and it's a quiet ambiance. I got the Poulet Yassa which was very flavorful and delicious - their yellow rice was great (not mushy at all) and chicken was very tender. The portions were pretty big though so lucky I have a massive appetite. Not a cheap option but definitely worth trying out for a nice dinner in mind."

9/23/2011,5 star rating,"This place is by far one of the better and more interesting dining options in the neighborhood. I seriously could not stop saying wonderful things about my experience in the 48 hours after my meal. There was a 50% off Scoutmob coupon (up to a $25 discount), so for whatever reason this doesn't give me extremely high hopes for the food - but it exceeded my silly/unwarranted expectations.We shared the truffle mac and cheese which was rich and flavorful but a bit too loose/watery for my taste, still a decent dish. We did family style for some entrees - fish and chips, seafood risotto and chicken parm. The seafood risotto was great, the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. The fish and chips were pretty delicious, not the best I have ever had - but compared to the other places in Gramercy that serve them I'd put them high on the list. What shocked me the most was the chicken parm, it was delicious and I have high standards for dishes with Italian origin. The pasta underneath the chicken was in a creamy white wine sauce that was so tasty, I liked it better than the traditional red sauce soaked pasta that's typically underneath parm.The service was excellent, our waiter was working for the first time but was so friendly and accommodating. The only complaint I might have is that the space is small and tight, and it was a Friday night so it was packed, wish there was more space to eat/wish it were easier to here.Overall Ponty Bistro is that restaurant that you'd take Mom and Dad to when they are in town, or bring a cute date out for a not-so-typical meal. I will definitely return!"
2/15/2013,4 star rating,"I really like this place.  It is very small but I enjoy the food and the drinks.  The service is good but you may have to wait for a table as it is a very small place.  Personally I love the schwarma, it is the best I have had.  Great spices and seasoning.  They make great drinks too!"
9/25/2012,3 star rating,"Like everyone and their mother said, get the Moules Africana. It has an awesome kicky sauce that makes you want to soak all your bread into it and thereby ruining your appetite with carb overload, but it's worth it. For entrees, we had the Saint Jacques Du Chef [scallops, beets and asparagus], wasn't fond of the orange marmalade sauce and the Niokolokoba [sirloin steak]; both weren't bad but nothing amazing. I had tea and some sort of chocolate cake for dessert. Can't remember the name but it was really good; warm and not too sweet with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall a good place to eat and the service was fine, but at their prices there are alot better alternatives out there."
10/5/2011,3 star rating,"Came here for a girls night dinner so naturally, we started off with the cheapest bottle of red ($34 Pinot Noir). There were so many good-looking items on the menu that it took us a while to land on our orders. We asked the waitress for appy recommends but she didn't have much to say.We shared the truffle-mac and cheese (truffle flavor was strong, cheesiness was lacking), and enjoyed the complimentary bread.I ordered the Lobster BLT. There was a good amount of lobster, but it was a bit overcooked and chewy. It tasted good...because it tasted like butter. Lobster cooked in butter, butter-topped brioche spread with more butter... was the bacon fried in butter?Needless to say, by the end of the meal I was a bit lethargic. Luckily (?) I had about 40 minutes to gather strength while we waited for our check to arrive. Ugh, never a good way to end a meal that was otherwise well-serviced.We had a nice evening here and the food was good enough, but I probably won't return."
4/3/2012,4 star rating,"Okay, BBE, you got me: thanks for the incentive to try out a restaurant that I normally would have skipped.The restaurant was empty when I came here, but the servers were nice and it was positioned on a busy street. It was pretty early for lunch, though, so maybe it gets busier at dinner? I don't know.I splurged and got the seafood risotto. I kind of wish I hadn't because it wasn't amazing - little grains of sand in some mussels, but everything else was great. The Ponty Salad was really refreshing, with apples, grape tomatoes and a shallot vinaigrette - a perfect starter.My friend got the lobster ravioli and loved it - the pasta, the innards, the sauce. He couldn't stop raving over it. The quality of the food was really good, I'm not sure why the seafood risotto was such a miss with me."

The decor and music were great and the wait staff extremely friendly.I took a star off because it took forever for our food to come (people who came into the restaurant after us were eating their entrees while we were still waiting).Now, onto food:Tusker Beer: goes down easy, my first African beer ^_^ Fried Calamari ($12): good portion for appetizer and tasted great.L'onglet A L'echalote ($22ish): Grilled hanger steak with yucca mashed potato, spinach and bordellaise sauce. this was yummy in my tummy. the meat was cooked to my liking. I was surprised the steak came already cut for me. The meat was juicy and flavorful and the sauce went well with both mashed yucca and the steak. put a bit of both on your fork and its a great combo.Niokolokoba($27-29): Grilled sirloin steak marinated with senegalese spices served with french fries and au poivre sauce. OMG this dish was the star of the night. perfectly cooked steak and that au poivre sauce was addicting. I kept stealing the rosemary fries and dipping it into the sauce. so good.The portion sizes were generous. Wish I had stomach leftover to try the desserts. Next time =)"

12/2/2008,4 star rating,"Stopping in to sample some of the appetizers they were all quite good and the place was more enjoyable than expected.  The Macaroni and Cheese was very rich without being overly cheesy, thank the truffle oil.  The wings were good and the pineapple sauce is an interesting little enhancement.  The sangria was also quite savory and conspiciously they had led zeppelin on the entire time and it never seemed off.  Wouldn't mind trying their entrees one day."
9/21/2009,3 star rating,"Good food, well priced. I enjoyed the Victoria Lac Salmon entree - the lemon grass curry sauce with sauteed onions was creamy yet a tad spicy, especially interesting when combined with grilled salmon. On the flip side,  they don't include disposable flatware or bread with the take-out order...maybe I just expected more from a restaurant with a price point like this one."
9/5/2010,3 star rating,"I'm typically not too impressed with anything fusion, and this place is basically on the border between marginal and just good enough to come back again.  We started off with the truffled mac and cheese and it was a solid dish, though I'm not sure if it's worth the $10 price tag.  For a main dish I got the mussels and french fries, the broth that the mussels were in were really good, but the fries weren't great, soggy and not well seasoned.  Looking back on it now, it was actually a weird pairing that I'm not a big fan of.  I also got to try the lamb shank, and it was good for the first few bites, but as you dig further into the dish you just get tired of the flavor.  The restaurant itself had a nice cozy feel and the service was very friendly.  But unfortunately our waiter had a very strong French accent, so as he read the numerous specials, you couldn't help but stop paying attention because you had no idea what he was saying.  Again, they do have a lot of interesting dishes with pretty big portions for about $20 - $25 an entree, so it's worth trying once if you're in the area."
5/11/2012,3 star rating,"Nice ambience, friendly courteous service. The place was little cramped tho, I could hear the lady at the other table talk about her dogs and how shes such good friends with the chef. Anyways, I had the steak, it was very tasty, great sauce, wish they gave slightly more though. My fiance had the risotto and grilled vegetables, she liked it.I liked the food and experience but wasn't that memorable to me, nice romantic place in thecity tho."

Highly recommend, I would definitely return. Thanks!"
11/16/2010,1 star rating,"Went to this place for a friend's bday.  Decor and atmosphere is decent, spacing is limited though.  For a Saturday night, most tables were filled.  We were here for a Birthday Party, but it wasn't a great experience.  Service was very poor.  The female server, kept pushing our group to order more drinks, appetizers, and desserts.  Reminded me of a money grubber, so it was an instant turnoff.  I had the special African beer, which was way too sweet and light.  Would not recommend it.   The chef seems like a nice guy, as he greeted guests.  At times it seemed akward, since he'd be starting at the customers while seated at the bar area. The service of the bread seemed visually poor.  The bread was cut up and placed in dissarray in a plate.  I would've preferred either a small loaf or bigger pieces.  It was grilled with some olive oil, and with butter it tasted good.  The best part was that the bread was warm.The menu is eccletic, and portions are pretty generous.  I had the red snapper which was a special that night.  It was served over a bed of crispy veggies(red peppers, leeks, red onion in vinagrette).  The skin was crispy and the fish was very tasty.   Nothing though wowed me about this dish. The red reduction sauce was average.  The appetizers, seemed decent.  I tried the fried calamari, and it was pretty OK, not great.  A group next to us had the fois gras, which didn't look great.  We saw another group next to us order the Escargot, which looked good.  One of my friends got the octopus salad, which she said was pretty good.  I would have given this place 2 stars, but since we were a large group,  they put a ""delivery charge"", AKA a gratuity of about 23%.  I'm fine with gratuity being 18% when there's a group of 5 or more, but 23% without any notice or warning is pretty unacceptable.  We would've created more of a fuss about this, but since it was our friend's birthday we took it in stride.  I'd pass, and opt for better food.  I don't want to say it, but it's a HYPE."
5/29/2011,4 star rating,"What a gem! My boyfriend and I went to this place without any real expectations, aside from being excited to eat in a restaurant with African roots. This place is so reasonably priced which ended up being dangerous because price often serves as a point of portion control for us.  Started the meal with a great selection of French cheeses and perfectly dressed salads. I ordered the salmon which came over one of the yummiest sauces I've ever had paired with salmon - a cranberry, shallot, and cilantro cream sauce. He ordered the Chilean sea bass over artichokes. Both were delicious though the salmon was leaning towards overcooked. For dessert we shared our favorite - profiteroles - and they were good, but the ice cream in one of them had some pretty bad freezer burn. Whatever. I was also happy because they had a New Zealand sauvignon blanc I'd never tried and it may be a new fav, especially at $9/glass! This place could easily turn into our new go-to spot. Can't wait to go back."
1/5/2015,5 star rating,Amazing staff and amazing food. African spiced muscles were incredible. Crispy tuna was too. And my lamb shank entree was great. Add in 2 for 1 Martinis before 7pm (we had an early dinner) and I can't speak highly enough about it. Friendly people + fine food. Lychee and French Martinis were the best ones!!

9/9/2012,4 star rating,"Ponty Bistro exceeded my expectations!  I'm pretty sure when I checked Yelp reviews months back, it wasn't a 4 star. The fact that is was persuaded me to take my bf here on date night last Thurs around 8pm.  The restaurant was pretty empty, but the service, warm and inviting.  The restaurants offers a wide-variety menu of French-African cooking, and the portions are big!  Prices in the high teens, low 20s, but we used the Scoutmob deal that was 30% off (had no issue using it).  Our server was really sweet, made good recommendations, refilled waters, etc.  The only downside was that we sat in a cramped table.  We didn't order drinks but they do a lot of cocktails here.  There were a lot of specials that night- we started off with the special salad.  It was an artichoke salad with a strong lemon vinaigrette, arugula, and and shaved parmesan. I really loved it- it was fresh. As for the entrees, I went for the moule frites in African spices.  It's more French but thought the African spices would be a good twist.  It was largely flavored with tomato, onion, and gtinger.. I think that's what gave it a zingy spice. It was different than an African spice though. The mussels were small but there were a lot of them. Most of them were cooked well- there was only one bad one that didn't open.  The fries (smaller in portion- good for my waistline!)  were actually food- crispy, nicely salted, etc.  $18. My bf ordered the broiled branzino (a whole fish- so beware of the crispy skin, head and small bones!) which he loved. It was quite fresh and had a nice lemon zing..even though I don't love branzino, this was one of the better preparations I've had.  The white rice it came with was so flavorful- simple but lemon-y.  The veggies atop- tomatoes, and onions were a nice touch.  The waitress recommended this is as one of their best dishes. It's nice to see that there are seafood options at an African place! (But their lamb and such is there too)My bf liked it better than I did but I'd possibly go again. Thanks Scoutmob!"

2/13/2011,5 star rating,"Came here very early on a Friday night and had no trouble finding a seat as the place was empty, although by the time we left (just after 6) it was about half-full so making reservations is probably a good idea.There were two fish specials and a duck special and I had a hard time deciding. The waiter recommended the sea bass and I'm glad he did as it was delicious! And served on a bed of artichoke hearts, yum.The two for one martinis are a nice touch -- definitely appreciated, even if the drinks are small and a bit weak. The ginger martini is spectacular!We used a Scoutmob coupon which was nice because this place a bit out of the usual price range of a school teacher and a non-profit employee. The service was polite and helpful."
10/7/2011,5 star rating,"I must say my experience here for my birthday was most memorable. I reserved a table for 16, but only 12 came. They had the table ready by 730 I had reserved at 745. Many people slowly rolled over the next hour, but the waiters never rushed us to order our entrees. In the meantime, they simply asked if we'd like any drinks. When all had arrived, we ordered and soon enough we got our food. The food was simply amazing. Everyone on the table of 12 loved their dishes, from my flounder to the lamb chops, to the mussels. It was all good! We were pleasantly surprised at this lower east side restaurant. The ambiance was low key, the place clean, and not loud. It may have been good for a birthday party, but i think it'd be even better for a date! It could be quite romantic. There was a constant flow of people throughout the night, small groups, couples and the like. I highly recommend this place. I want to come back with other friends and show off this great find!"

Moist and clean.  Then lobster ravioli for me which was totally fab as well.  Linguini a la scampi for my friend was awesome too. If you are looking for a little taste of everything good, I suggest ordering and sharing.  Its that good!D."
10/22/2012,4 star rating,"We go here more often than I thought we would due its proximity to our home and delicious food, plus it's on Savored and Scout mob so that makes it better value for money - without those it is a little on the pricy side for what you get.We went the other Friday and it was more packed than I'd ever seen it!  Sadly this seemed to affect the service (slow), and the food (less well-presented than one might expect). We got the beet salad, which was absolutely delicious - although I might try caramelizing the walnuts if I was to make this myself.  I got the whole branzino, which was delicious but I did spend a lot of time picking out bones...  Husband ordered the rack of lamb, but this turned out not as he expected, which was a rack of lamb chops, rather than a few lamb chops scattered on the plate.Four stars though because the guys that work there are lovely, and the food is always flavorful without ever being fussy.  Oh yeah and our visit before last, I departed from my usual mariniere and tried the moules Afrique: OMG. No regrets at. all. If you like mussels, you've definitely gotta give these a try."

As for the FOODbe sure to get the stuff with asteroids! those are apparently delicacies. butternut squqash soup --  Have to say I like this one better than Wolfgan Puck's. This is  not as creamy and has the right kick of spices! SHRIMP TABOULI -- very fresh and again, brilliant use of spice! The Cous cous was refreshing and has soaked up the juice of tomatoes and cucumbersSTUFFED FLOUNDER -- this dish really surprised me. Did not expect a local bistro to have done their seafood so well. Usually seafood dishes at bistroes are just there to offer you an option. yet Ponty makes their seafood with heart. The fish was fresh, tender yet rolled up perfectly. stuffing was tasty too! way much better than your regular chicken/fish rouladeCOCKTAIL -- oversaw some neighbors ordering cocktails. They planend to get one each. Yet they all ended up with another around. That says something right?one pet peeve though-- maybe the food smells too good? at least 3 bugs tried to share our dinner that night..."

9/27/2013,1 star rating,"I'm so disappointed I can't give this place a better review. I wanted to like it because the atmosphere and feel of the spot are great for the neighborhood. Sadly, the food and wine are overpriced and arbitrary policies are enough to keep me from going back there. The food was fine, nothing special, which is why I was surprised by the prices. $27 is too much for fish with a couple of olives and tomatoes with some greens on the side. My friends and I are always excited when we can use a yelp check in for a deal at a new spot but don't be fooled by this one. There are rules that are not stated on the check-in. When we ordered we were told that we had to choose between 2 and neither were ones we had decided on. Further, there were 5 of us and the check in deal says you can get one free dessert for 2 entrees but when we ordered dessert we were told it was only one per table. Since we didn't feel like arguing we didn't fight it, ordered our one free tiramisu and moved on. I'm so glad we didn't have to pay for it because it was the worst tiramisu in New York. Lastly, come prepared with your Amex because they don't take any other cards."

The place was a little noisy thanks to a couple of loud tables near us, the service was on the slow side, and the food was decent but nothing special.It's a nice little spot, but just not my cup of tea. I think I'll stick to other places in my 'hood."
6/25/2017,5 star rating,We love Ponty Bistro! It's our favorite brunch place in the neighborhood. The lobster Benedict is my favorite. High quality food in a casual environment. Service is so great too.
8/24/2014,5 star rating,The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious. Try the lamb burger and maple crusted French toast.
6/16/2015,4 star rating,I have eaten at Ponty several times. The food and service is always excellent. I usually eat the mussels that can be made in a choice of 3 different sauces but on Saturday I had the soft shell crabs. It was excellent!
1/5/2012,4 star rating,"Had a Blackboard Eats for this place but realized the ScoutMob deal might be better. Check out before you go.We didn't order much variety but I can comment the stuffed flounder was very good. Not the best I've had and I'm unsure there was much crab meat but a good size portion and flavorful. I liked the capers as they added nice flavor. And the fish was cooked properly as sometimes it's overcooked and dry. The pinot grigio and the malbec glass options were also good. What not to get - the serrano ham $16 appetizer. I probably should have said something - but it was some thick cut, too fatty, lack of flavor ham and some slices of a dried salami. The ham really was not very good. I expected the ham to be cured and quite salty - not even salty enough to make me reach for my water glass.Everybody else's meals smelled great and looked great. There were ample servers (maybe a few too many) but I was brought extra plates of complimentary bread when i asked and my water was continuously refilled.Solid neighborhood spot."
11/4/2011,3 star rating,"Truffle mac and cheese - fail.  If you like a RICH cheesy mac and cheese, do not get this dish.  Unless you're a truffle fiend.  Else, the mac reminded me of a simple Kraft mac and cheese i've made, without the good rich cheesy Velveeta cheese packet.  Lobster brioche was ok.  Bacon and leaves overpowered the lobster, so what's the point?  I'd rather have a straight up simple lobster roll personally.  I didn't mind that in addition to some lobster pieces that they also used parts of the lobster claw that you'd normally discard (the rubbery ""wrist"" of the claw), but, i just couldn't taste the lobster flavor through it all.Service was good."

11/3/2013,5 star rating,"We live nearby and come here often because the food and drinks can't be beat! We almost always get the ginger martinis, but they have some good wine options too. We've tried almost everything on the menu but here are some of our current favorites: The mussels - Africana or Mariniere are both delicious! Spicy, flavorful, fresh mussels in a big portion with yummy salty fries. Truffled mac n cheese - heaven.Lamb shank - boyfriend would eat this everyday if I let him.Lobster bisque - big portion, lots of fresh lobster in it.Caesar salad - simple dish executed perfectly.The french toast at brunch is SO good - has a crunchy maple crust with fluffy center.The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Truly one of the best places in the neighborhood."
11/8/2014,4 star rating,"Came here for a quick dinner before a show around the corner on a busy Friday night, having made reservations beforehand online. We were seated promptly, which was a relief given the tight space. Tables are very close to each other, so if you're looking for an intimate date night spot, this won't be it, as you can hear everyone's conversation around you. Unfortunately, the wait was excruciatingly long, and the food took about 25-30 minutes before it came (I even had time to purchase something from the pharmacy across the street and returned to my seat before the food arrived).That being said, the seafood was absolutely delicious. We ordered the seafood spaghetti and the steak with fries, but the latter was overcooked and the fries were nothing special. The white wine sauce, paired with an assortment of seafood, including mussels, shrimp, squid and scallops, were robust with flavor and I will be returning for that dish specifically."
7/3/2011,5 star rating,"Amazing food that is fresh, delicious, and distinctive. French food that incorporates influences from other cuisines. Great service and the chef comes out to see how you are doing...you can really tell he cares. The ambiance is lovely and intimate without creating an annoying scene. A great place for a date or a small dinner with friends. Definitely one of my go-to neighborhood spots for a great meal.

1/31/2012,5 star rating,The spices are amazing. Mussels with African spices could be the best mussels dish ever. That includes memorable mussels in st barths!!!!!Sea bass special melted in our mouths.  Crepe dessert was also amazing!!!!!Found this place on broadway eats and we live in the mid 50's but we will certainly be back!!!!
9/4/2009,4 star rating,I had brunch here one weekend and the food was awesome! I had the french toast which was slightly different than most french toasts I have had. It had a really nice crunch to it and tasted delicious. The service was excellent and the chef (owner?) came around asking how everything was. I would definitely like to come back here and try something else.
1/16/2012,3 star rating,"A great many ups-and-downs at this restaurant.  The food is billed as French-African-Mediterranean.  Not much Mediterranean that I could find; rather, it is a peculiar fusion that is not quite French or African.My meal started with a chicken vegetable soup.  It consisted of a rich broth, with a large piece of chicken dropped in.  Flavorful, although I had to watch for bones in the chicken.Main course: a mushroom risotto.  This was not bad, tasty chunks of mushroom and green onions in a nicely-textured risotto.Dessert was disappointing.  An ice cream sundae was basically a plate of vanilla ice cream with a strawberry and some chocolate sauce.The space is not large at all.  It fills quickly.  Decor is pleasant, but not outstanding.  Service generally good.The main drawback is the price: a glass of mediocre sangria was $9.  While the overall experience is pleasant, I would be hard pressed to become a regular given the high price tag (overall meal, including a glass of port and a tip, easily exceeded $80.)Grateful for the presence of Tusker beer on the menu, although it seems strange for a French-African place to feature a Kenyan beer."

The owner self is a chef checking his customers with his smile ;)  My boyfriend ordered parmesan chicken pasta  and I ordered seafood pasta. Wow it was so delicious! And the best part of the finale was the dessert treated from the owner for my boyfriend's B-day. We only ordered two delicious pastas though, the owner's kindness gave us a happy moment and at home mood. Thank you. We marked your restaurant as the best year 2013."

10/17/2014,3 star rating,"I've ordered delivery several times and have been to the restaurant once. When we dined in, the food was good but the portions were small. The service was abysmal. We had to wait 20 minutes between meals and another 20 minutes to get the check. The staff sat down to eat and forgot about us, even though our table was right in front of them. There was another table right next to us that got their food and bill promptly so I felt like they were singling us out.. :(As for delivery, it's always within 30 minutes, food is always hot and portions are HUGE. I highly recommend getting the Moules A La Maison and crispy tuna."
3/9/2014,1 star rating,"This place is not good and reservations are not honored.The food is bland, comes out look warm, super salty (it's the next day and we're still thirsty), mussels had literally droves of garlic slices, tuna was completely overcooked, chicken was dry and overcooked (despite having a way too heavy sauce on it), fried plantains were still hard and were nothing special. There was a huge lag time between each course. No clue who our waiter/waitress was because they all came over at different points; though they were all nice enough. It is also very loud in there. We had an opentable reservation, and I confirmed it earlier in the day. There was no hostess where to check in, had to find a waiter serving a table to talk with; and after he laughed at us about having a reservation, he called over the chef to talk with and he also laughed. They both seemed very surprised when we arrived to be seated, and after laughing told us ""umm maybe wait like 20 minutes"". It was absurd and so poorly and rudely handled. We wanted to leave but had to wait for one person in our party. They ended up moving a table of two about 20-25 minutes later and made room for us. But it was handled so poorly. Other reviews also said something about not honoring reservations, and it's absolutely true. Basically a ruse to get business/people to come inside. They really just should not take reservations if they want to fill the space with walk-ins. Not recommended at all. Some of these positive reviews have to be fake."

2/23/2016,1 star rating,"One of the absolutely WORST experiences i have ever had as a native NYorker. Horrible staff and CHEF slash OWNER who refused to honor our GROUPON bought IN GOOD FAITH just two days prior. First, the waiter said: ""IM NOT SURE WE CAN TAKE THIS VOUCHER TODAY"". Then the maitre d or manager said: WE DO NOT ACCEPT GROUPON"". Then i wasted thirty minutes with ALI the so called chef owner who just kept repeating: ""DO YOU THINK IM IN THE BUSINESS OF LOSING MONEY?!?"" Whatever business he is in there is a profound lack  of integrity here, as i explained. AWFUL EXPERIENCE TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS. Does not even deserve a single star."

1/11/2014,2 star rating,"I went here solo on a Saturday night with the goal of getting a (reasonably priced) steak with some atmosphere.I walked in during the evening and got a table right away by the door. They have the door covered so there were no issues with drafts even sitting right up by the front. The ambiance and decor were nice. However, there were candles lit on all of the other tables, and throughout the meal, they never lit the candle on my table. To me, it's the little things that count...I ordered the Niokolokoba (sirloin steak with fries) that I had seen on the menu on their website... only now it was 30 dollars for the dish as opposed to the 25 listed on their website. Fine...Food came out fast enough. Presentation was nothing fancy, but I'm more of a substance guy anyway. I ordered my steak medium. The steak tasted alright with whatever spices were part of the dish, but some of the meat was stringy and not tender enough. Some parts were tender enough to enjoy, but I definitely had to chew harder than I would have liked on some of it. The fries were your average restaurant fries.... overall I would give the dish a 3/5. I was drinking only water and as I was coming close to finishing my meal I ran out. I was not checked on during my meal by the staff. I waited 5-10 minutes for a waiter to come by (and ask me if I would like a dessert menu). I told him ""no that's alright, just some water please"". He came back with both the water and the check. I understand the meal was over, but it would have been nice if he refilled my water THEN got the check. So in summary...- The food was average- The price on their website does not match the actual (higher) price of what I ordered- The service was sub-par. I might understand if it was packed but the restaurant was less than half full and throughout my meal there were employees setting other tables when they could have been better attending to me (and the other patrons)."
2/21/2014,2 star rating,"$20 prix fixe for an entree (limited selections), a coffee and a cocktail, which is a pretty good deal. I had the omelette which was okay, but nothing special really. Switch the home fries for the fries which I prefer. Service was faultless though. It's not a bad place for brunch if you are in the area but I won't be back for it again as they are too many other places to check out in the city."
6/8/2014,4 star rating,Great place for a date in the Gramercy neighborhood.  My girlfriend and I came here with a groupon or living social deal we had for dinner one Friday night and we each had the filet mignon which was very good.  Would definitely try this place if you're in the area.

11/26/2009,3 star rating,"Went out to dinner with a friend, and decided we'd just take a walkabout to figure out where to eat. Stumbled across the Ponty Bistro.Dim but not dark, long and narrow, it was empty for a Monday night. Two for one martinis didn't hurt either. She started with a Sangria, I went for a Ketel Martini, dirty and up. Of the two that I had, the first was eh, but the second was phenomenal, even though I had to ask for olives. Her sangria got solid reviews.Appetizer choice was a bit limited, but we were able to settle on the cheese sampler. While good, it was certainly uninspired. Parmigiano Reggiano, Camembert and blue cheese. All were fresh and tasty, but maybe I was hoping for too much. Disappointingly, the waiter did not know ANY of the cheeses on the plate, so me and my date were forced to do some detective work.The menu was pretty varied, with lots of African and French inspired dishes. I went with the veal special, which was a spiced veal chop on the bone, in a brown sauce with mushrooms and asparagus. My ordered the steak, but in fear of it coming out to be humungous, switched from the skirt steak (I believe) to the smaller filet mignon cut. Came with roots vegetables and some green beans.Apparently Ponty must have a flux capacitor in the back, because the only place this veal chop could have come from is a dinosaur. It was ENORMOUS. The sauce  was very flavorful, but didn't taste overspiced. I was very impressed with the veal, both its flavor, and the way it was prepared. I asked for it medium and it could not have come out any better. The outside had a nice char, and the inside was slightly pink at the very center. The cut itself was tender. All in all, this was one of the better entrees I've had in a while, and some of the best veal I've had in a LONG time.My date seemed pleased with the flavor, and commented on how good the sauce was. However, her steak was overcooked.It was late in the evening, so we were the last folks in there, so the chef came out. It was nice to meet the man, and he enlightened us as to what the sauce was (his accent was a little heavy, but from what I got it was some kind of red wine/veal au jus combo).This really was a great meal. Besides the disappointing cheese plate and the overcooking of my dates steak, I found it slightly over priced. An appetizer, two entrees and four drinks came out to about $120 something before the tip. But I would definitely come back here"
3/20/2012,5 star rating,"Food was excellent! Im surprised there were so few people  at prime brunch hour, but that may be due to the location.  Will definitely become a regular brunch location for me!Had the salmon burger which was well cooked.  Sangria was a bit expensive but alcoholic and delicious."

3/12/2013,5 star rating,"Friends were in from out of town, and we couldn't find an available table anywhere on the East Side of Manhattan. A friend who lives in Murry Hill recommended Ponty Bistro, and we're glad he did!! It's well located with a charming ambiance and a good menu. Two of us had the butternut squash soup to start, and two the fish soup special; all four of us were pleased. The butternut squash had just a hint of spice, and it's one of the best I've had. For my entree I had Poulet Yassa, a chicken dish prepared with traditional Senegalese spices. It was wonderful. When ordering, I asked the waiter to compare Senegalese spice to some other cuisine (it was my first time) and he couldn't. He's right. It's its own thing. Peppers, onions, ginger. Marvelous. We shared a couple of bottles of Black Pearl, a cab/shiraz blend from South Africa, which was excellent. There were a couple of times where the service was spotty -- we never received the olives we ordered, we waited a long time for the check -- but the waiter and the servers were so friendly that we didn't care. And honestly, it was nice to be in a NYC restaurant where we weren't hovered over and rushed out the door. We will definitely go back."
8/10/2014,3 star rating,"This is for weekend brunch, which is a bit disappointing considering all the raving reviews on yelp. I got Crab Benedict with fries. Fries are decent, but the crab meat doesn't taste quite fresh, and I'm not a big fan of the sauce.However, service is good and the weekday menu looks more interesting (French African?) so I might give it another try."

2/17/2015,3 star rating,"When we arrived at the restaurant, we were only given the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu. At $75 pp for three courses, it was not what we intended at all. We had to specifically ask for the regular menu, which felt a little silly. The waitstaff was rather inattentive, although I'll concede it was a busy night. When we finally got our order in and received our food, the night improved considerably. We started with the truffle mac and cheese which my date and I loved. I ordered the Poulet Yassa and it was absolutely delicious. We were stuffed so we skipped on dessert. It took another 20+ minutes to get the check  but we were in no hurry.Overall, service was about a C but the food was definitely an A"
3/26/2014,4 star rating,"We chose this restaurant for brunch because there are so few spots that accept reservations in this part of town.  We were a group of eight and they were very nice to us even with a toddler who did not want to sit still.  The food was good, and pretty fast.  This is a good brunch choice for the Gramercy area."
11/25/2014,1 star rating,"I got delivery from this place and was excited b/c the menu looked good. However, upon arrival the delivery guy buzzed and stated that he was ""out front."" when I said, ""ok,"" he repeated that and asked if I wanted him to bring the food to my door. I'm,yeah,that's why I ordered DELIVERY. Then, I  found out that I was missing an item(the guy gave me my food and ran off before I could check). I called e restaurant and told them I was missing an item,and they claimed they would send someone back over with it. An hour later, no sign of e food, and I called back, at which point the person on the phone said, ""So, what, you want a refund or something."" I actually wanted the food,but clearly that wasn't going to happen so I said yes. Then I was told that I would need to get the refund via grub hub, and he hung up. Lovely service- well,at least grub hub came through with the refund."
8/6/2010,5 star rating,"Love Ponty - love the background music, the mellow yet sophisticated vibe, the always amazing sensually satisfying food. I've had brunch, lunch and dinner at different times and have never left disappointed. The fresh fish specials are always perfection. On different recent evenings I have had fantastic red snapper  and perfectly seared tuna. My friend had a beautiful lamb tagine. The wine selections have been spot-on, delicious (but not too precious, nor expensive). It's an easy place to have a real conversation with your friends, over a great meal. That counts for a lot in my book. So tired of having to shout to be heard.I just read some of the other reviews and I'm a bit stumped. I guess I just enter with very different expectations - I appreciate the global fusion and the friendly atmosphere (that's not too intrusive). But I've never entered looking for some sort of exotic ""other"" travelogue experience - I'm delighted to have delicious, fresh beautifully prepared food nearby."
8/22/2011,4 star rating,"Wow, it's been a while since I've been to a place with such good food!!I called the morning of to make a reservation for dinner that night. I told them I had a deal code for 50% off for up to $25, is it okay if I just show them the e-mail on my iPhone when I get there? They said no problem.Got to the restaurant a little late (sorry! it was pouring!), but they were nice about it, and when I asked if I should give them the deal code before eating, they said no, don't worry about it - enjoy the meal first!That definitely gave me a feel for the kind of service that Ponty Bistro offers - the waiters are really nice and aim to give you an enjoyable experience. They're courteous, prompt, and the water glass is never left empty!We were given a bread plate as we waited for our food, and to be honest, I couldn't really eat the bread. It was so hard that it hurt to bite through it! My brother managed to eat a few pieces because he was starving, but the bread was kind of inedible in my opinion.The actual meal, though, was amazing!!I ordered the Victoria Lac Salmon, and my brother ordered the 5 Stars Seafood Risotto. The salmon was really nicely grilled. There wasn't a part of it that was undercooked or overcooked. The skin had a nice crisp to it without being burnt. And the braised endive and grilled asparagus went well with the salmon. I could have done without the cranberries, but the dish was still excellent!I didn't have much of the Seafood Risotto, but it got rave reviews from my brother. He said it was nice and creamy and definitely very filling.All in all, I'd have to say that Ponty Bistro was a hit!(Why did I knock off 1 star, though? Because if I hadn't gone with my deal, I think the meal would have been a little pricey - not by NYC standards, but by the standards of an early-20s on a budget NYC-er. Slightly, though, just slightly!)"

2/1/2015,1 star rating,"Underwhelming is an understatement. I'm not usually a person who yelps based on a single experience at an establishment, but I felt like my experience this morning warranted it.Came here for brunch and descriptions seriously oversold offerings -- the bruschetta scramble I ordered sounded like it would be great: french baguette, eggs, tomatoes, pesto, goat cheese -- what's not to love, right? Well, in the first place, as soon as the waiter placed my dish down I noticed all he'd given me was scrambled eggs on bread. Somewhere along the line, someone had literally forgotten the dishes main selling points -- no tomatoes, no pesto, no goat cheese. I pointed out the oversight, and the dish was quickly returned -- identical -- except for some bits of goat cheese, a squirt of pesto, and TWO cherry tomatoes scattered on top. By that point, the eggs were cold and the bread soggy. I am not a picky eater, but come on dudes -- this is brunch! How can you go wrong with brunch?! Literally easiest meal ever, which seriously didn't warrant such an amateurish fix. To top it off, restaurant wasn't even busy and I had to go up to the counter to pay the bill. (After a serious lag in taking our order as well.)Can't believe this place has such good reviews. Maybe it just shouldn't be open for brunch. A pity since there were so many other (and seemingly better) options in the neighborhood."

12/21/2010,4 star rating,"This is a great standby for me and my girl friends. So it's not Le Bernardin or Per Se, but it's an intimate restuarant with thoughtful owners/executive chefs. (I love when they discuss their specials.) The dishes rarely disappoint... I am usually pleased with the steak or fish entrees that I try and my sister loves the risotto here. I also appreciate the extra spices the chefs use. I can't comment on the wine selection, but the martinis are delicious. My friends and I especially like the lychee ones.As for one of the the previous reviews, yes, the owners sometimes sit at the bar and seem to gaze around their restaurant. But what I've found is that they are either making sure no one is looking around for their waiter or they are occasionally planning some appetizers or desserts to provide to us ""compliments of the chef.""Every once in a while, we have a weird waiter. (There is one guy who sometimes seems a little confused when you ask him some questions about the menu or try to mofidy your order.) But for the most part, we have good experiences here."
2/12/2011,4 star rating,"Went to Ponty Bistro on a Saturday night with no reservations. It was around 7pm and a bunch of tables were reserved. We waited at the bar for about 15 minutes and were seated promptly when a table became available. The drinks were good. I am very picky and asked for the following: passion fruit martini over ice, in a water glass, with a splash of sprite. The drink came to me perfectly at the bar and when I ordered the seconded from my table it arrived in 2 minutes and was just like the first. There were multiple bartenders but I am sure my drink was made be the same guy as it wasn't standard and yet came quickly and just as ordered.As for the food, my husband ordered the pork loin special with a side of sweet plantains. I ordered the hanger steak with haricots vert instead of mashed potatoes. My husband's plantains never arrived but the pork was amazing. The crust was fantastic and the sides, spinach and potatoes, were expertly prepared. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium and the sauce it came with was so good I was tempted to lick the plate. However, my meal was supposed to come with spinach along with potatoes (which I exchanged for haricots vert) but there was no spinach on my plate. The food that we were served was great. The 4 star rating is because we were not served what we ordered...although we also didn't get charged for the sides we didn't get. On a side note, we were seated near the door and with NY winter temperatures it was pretty cold in our seats. We will definitely be back to Ponty Bistro but next time I want to get there in time for the pre fixe menu as it would have made our meal half the price."

Esp the chicken which was juicy and flavorful. Every restaurant serves Chicken but its never really exciting. This was Exciting and a joy to eat!r"
3/5/2013,5 star rating,I love this place hands down! My boyfriend and I are a bit hard to please when it comes to nice restaurants because for the price of many they really aren't worth it. This place on the contrary had us both shocked and amazed at how good fancy food can be. We had a groupon for $20 for $40 worth of food so we got the Carre D' Agneu (rack of lamb with potatoes gratin) and I had the Le Poulet Roti Au Jus (chicken with potatoes and baby carrots). We practically licked our plates clean! Since it was my boyfriends birthday they even helped me surprise him with a chocolate mousse (candle and all). The sweetest staff and most amazing chef!!
7/6/2016,4 star rating,Very delicious North African/French place. A good menu with many options. Went back thrice already - yes it's that good. The lamb shank is to die for!
12/10/2013,4 star rating,"Ate lunch with 2 coworkers. The food was flavorful and delicious. We ordered the nicoise salad, grilled tuna steak, and seafood pasta. Everyone was very happy with their food. The serving sizes were reasonably generous. No leftovers, but no hungry bellies either. All I can say is there were many more things on the menu we are eager to return to try. The food is generally familiar with slight twists in flavor to make it ""African."" We checked-in on Yelp and were happy to find a free dessert (with 2 entrees) offer. We took the housemade tiramisu to go. IT WAS DIVINE. I generally dislike tiramisu but licked the takeout box clean. Service was a bit hands off (water never refilled) but responsive when we made requests."
8/24/2014,4 star rating,"Amazing food. Unassuming place with very fresh, delicious, and authentic plates. Awesome brunch as well. Perfect neighborhood spot. Try the poulet yassa, mushroom risotto, chicken pailard salad, lamb tagine. But everything is great!"
6/18/2016,5 star rating,"Had dinner with my few of my friends last Friday and it was amazing. Food was great, live music was nice, and the chef even came out to greet his guests!! Happy hour martinis were awesome and I can't say how delicious all our dishes were. It was also my friend's birthday and the staff all sang happy birthday to her. They even played the birthday song with their chorded instrument (don't know the name of the instrument). The staff was very kind and always had a smile on their faces. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I'm definitely going back there again to try their other dishes!!!"
8/17/2014,1 star rating,"Service was dead slow. I went to the bar and ordered my own wine by necessity. Food was decent, but then they overcharged us by a lot. A great example of a chef opening a place with no management experience whatsoever. Pretty disastrous. Skip it."
6/11/2016,3 star rating,"This is a cutish spot. I'm a bit undecided as the service was very friendly, but slightly inattentive and the food was a bit inconsistent.  The restaurant was packed and seemed to only have 2 waiters who also bussed the tables.  They clearly needed at least one other waiter.  Good news and bad news...bad first.  We had the fish empanadas, the fish mix was tasty and the exterior was golden brown, but there was still some uncooked parts on the interior of the pastry.  The plantains tasted as if they were fried previously (not fresh) and they were oily (hint: fried plantain should go on a plate or be sure to completely drain the bowl).  The asparagus were perfectly done and delish.  The stuffed flounder with spinach and tomatoes felt very Senegalese w/the rich seasoning and sauces, it was well made and delicious.  So overall it was ok, we'll give it another try. You should try it, and hopefully it's more of a hit than a miss. Enjoy."
8/25/2015,1 star rating,"it's not african, nor french nor mediterrenean. it's a mess. they didn't have many of the items listed on the menu, or they served dishes with only parts of the ingredients listed. the waitress was defiant when asked as to why some ingredients are absent from the plate. seriously?? what i tasted all tasted the same - overly sweet and heavy. ugh. the place is terrible."
11/22/2010,2 star rating,"I suspect that the food was delicious when it was originally cooked; however they did such a terrible job packing the food that it was ruined in the short time it took to deliver it to me. I order profiteroles for our dessert. This has whipped cream in it. It was packed with hot food so all that was left of the cream was a liquid mess at the bottom of the container. The sandwich was rattled around so much that it came undone. Finally, and perhaps the worst of all was the hot coffee drink was spilled all over the bag. I lifted off the lid and 2/3rds of the drink were gone. I really should have called and complained but we were so hungry that we ate what we could and threw the rest away. A real shame. In person, the food is delicious but they were so careless with the delivery service that I would have to rethink if I want to go back -- even in person."
3/25/2014,4 star rating,"I didn't know what this place was when I walked in.  To my surprise it was a French/Sudanese restaurant.  I picked a dish I couldn't pronounce and it was great. The regulars spoke French as did the wait staff as well as Sudanese and English.  Very friendly staff, quick service and great lunch specials for a decent price."

11/25/2012,5 star rating,This past August I picked up a few dishes for our crew during a shoot. The staff was friendly and attentive. The chicken was melt in your mouth good. It was covered in a rich brown sauce.I had never seen any one consume chicken so quickly. We loved it. Can't wait to go back.
5/7/2013,3 star rating,"I love their food and their service.I should write a review because they do not fully honor the Yelp deal.  When I arrived, I was told that I wasn't allowed to order anything from the last page of the menu since I had a Yelp deal.Check out Thomas V.'s review."
9/10/2016,2 star rating,"The food was great, but we saw a giant roach when we were first seated. We asked to be moved to a different part of the restaurant, and we were. Then - as the last group left in the restaurant - we watched as the giant roach came darting across the restaurant and under our table. Everyone screamed and climbed onto their chairs as it climbed up the wall next to us- the entire group of nine of us. The restaurant captured and killed it, but refused to comp our meal at all."

2/9/2014,5 star rating,"Loved Ponty Bistro! The food was unique with a mixture of African and French spices and options and the service was outstanding. It is a small restaurant so it's more suited for a party of 2 or 4, but it wasn't especially loud. It's definitely not a cheap place, but for what you get it's more than reasonable. My wife and I shared the truffle mac and cheese and the french onion soup, which were great while I had the sirloin steak and my wife had a shrimp special and then we shared the french crepe for dessert. All excellent. We really enjoyed our meal and despite being seated for over 2 hours, we didn't once feel any pressure from the staff. They really couldn't be nicer. Highly recommended!"
3/31/2016,5 star rating,"shared calamari for starter - not the freshest but taste was good. gf had the scallops which were delicious, as were the lamp chops. free crème brulee via the yelp check-in was also good - particularly for free! Very nice staff."
1/30/2012,5 star rating,"Service: I came in with a party of 12, and the staff were super accommodating, even though two of our party were running late and slowed down the pace of the evening. Even so, the waitstaff was incredibly attentive and responsive to our requests. Our waitress had excellent pronunciation of the French items of the menu, and was ready to tailor menu recommendations according to the likes of each guest. The Chef, Cisse, was very friendly, and as a former chef myself, I could tell that he truly loved what he was doing, and that he was proud to be showcasing the unique flavors of his homeland. His passion really showed in his smile when I chatted with him about the food, and that means a lot to me.The Food: I ordered the Niokolokoba and I must say that this was the BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. To be clear, I do not say this lightly. I have had many a steak in my life, and this was the best. Cooked a perfect medium-rare, it literally melted in my mouth. Even the fat around the steak was tender and delicious. Whatever traditional African spices Cisse has paired with this steak are phenomenal; an absolutely unique flavor that compliments the beef perfectly, and pairs surprisingly well with a traditional French style poivre (black pepper) sauce. Honestly, if I never eat another steak again, I will be happy. I just want many many more of this one.The Moules Africana were delicious. The African-French fusion of Ponty Bistro really comes through on this dish; the traditional French style of steamed mussels in a garlicy white wine sauce paired with pungent African spices was a very interesting and unique combination, but one that worked in perfect balance. Most impressive was the serving size! When seeing mussels on a relatively fine dining menu, I have come to expect a plate with 10-12 mussels, not a huge bowl literally overflowing with shellfish! Any of their variations on Moules are an amazing value. If you like mussels, I highly recommend them.I also had the French Onion Soup, and it probably ranked among the best I've had. The stock was just packed with flavor, and they didn't skimp on the caramelized onions, bread, or cheese, like many places do. I tasted the Chicken Tagine; the pungent African flavors of the chicken and sauce were deliciously paired with a flavorful couscous. I also tasted the special of the evening. I forget what it was called, but it was a traditional Senegalese lamb stew served with rice. I don't even like lamb, and that was delicious.Atmosphere: I enjoyed the atmosphere, though some may find that it gets a little too loud on a busy night. It didn't bother me, as to me that is a sign of a restaurant filled with happy, satisfied people, but some of the people in my party said they would have liked a quieter atmosphere. But, that just isn't the type of place that is Ponty Bistro. I would recommend making a reservation, regardless of what time or day you wish to go. Better safe than sorry!Overall, I had a phenomenal meal in a wonderful little restaurant with an extremely friendly and attentive waitstaff and a Chef who truly loves what he does. What more could I ask for? I will certainly be back. Oh, and if you like white wines, I highly recommend their 2009 Casal Caeiro Albariño."
3/21/2012,5 star rating,"Loved this restaurant. Everyone working there was very friendly & knowledgable.  The owner even checked on us multiple times. The food was AMAZING...I had the Flounder & my boyfriend had the Lobster Risotto (a special that evening). We also had the Calamari for an appetizer & it was soooo good!The atmosphere was also very romantic. In a city full of such amazing food, I promised myself I would never go the same place twice, but we will definitely be returning. Compliments to the chef !"
10/28/2012,5 star rating,"Three words: Get the steak.  The steak I had at Ponty Bistro was one of the best steaks I've ever had!  The Senegalese spices were simply amazing.  The steak was cooked perfectly!  The steak was quite sizable as well, so my dinner companion finished it off for me.  I will be back as soon as possible for another steak."
7/30/2016,1 star rating,"My friend saw the deal $10 for $20 and we went, not only they didn't honor that deal on Yelp, but they owner/manager was so sketchy and scary.

4/27/2014,1 star rating,"Nice atmosphere and nice wait staff, but that's about it.My waitress and waiter both recommended the steak ""the chefs specialty"" - sounded good, so I did.I got the meal:#1: it was so tough I could hardly cut it - literally - my hand was cramping up. Terrible experience with super cheap meat - GROSS!#2: ordered medium, it was bleeding. Had to send it back. Waiter apologies profusely.My boyfriend got the ""traditional chicken dish"" - it was a rotisserie chicken with olives on it.Ugh! And I was so excited to be spontaneously adventurous and try an African place. What a disappointing Saturday date night."
9/19/2013,5 star rating,"I only had brunch here and it was great! I had the lobster & egg's benedict and my boyfriend had scrambled egg bruschetta and they were both delicious. However, mine was better ;)  The bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's were perfect. Not very important, however, I ordered a coffee and loved that they warmed up my side of milk (I like my coffee hot!) Anyway, a nice little spot to go with your boyfriend/girlfriend or a few close friends (it's tight). Oh, and the Senegalese art is also very nice... Bon appetit ;)"
12/15/2013,4 star rating,"The Lamb shank and Le Poulet tagine were about the best I've ever had. The house Tiramisu was just the perfect ending to a great meal. Pleasant and attentive service. The main entrees are a bit on the expensive side, but the overall pleasant experience made it worthwhile."
9/9/2013,4 star rating,"I ordered the rack of lamb, it was slightly overlooked but the flavors of this dish made up for that fact. It was a savory, delectable meal. I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and was pleasantly pleased with my lunch experience.  As other Yelpers have cited, this restaurant is desolate around 2ish. I had the entire restaurant to myself which was awesome. I will definitely come back to the restaurant for future meals."
8/7/2013,5 star rating,"I had a wonderful time here with my friends! The servers were all really helpful with recommendations and we basically got everything they loved. But, definitely make a reservation through Savored because you can get 30% off their food and drinks menu. Lychee martinis: I'm used to bartenders only using lychee juice but they blended in the actual fruit so these were nice and pulpy.Crispy tuna: This was amazing! It looks more like something you'd expect at a sushi place, but tasty nonetheless. Whole braised branzino: Simple and tasty; plus the plantains on the side were nice and unexpected.Grilled sirloin steak: I loved the au poivre sauce it came with.Chicken yassa: This was definitely the most Senegalese of all the dishes we ordered. I loved the heaping amount of spiced veggies that went on top of the chicken."

Service is wonderful. They are all sooo nice there. Great for a non-pretentious dinner out. They have $5 martini specials almost every night. And they let you bring your own bottle of wine with a corkage fee. And for you guys, my waitress was super cute."

1/20/2013,4 star rating,"This is now one of my favorite little restaurants in the city!  My husband and I ate there last night for the first time - what a gem!  We started with wine - nice selection - the Pinot Noir was quite good!  Then came out the Moules Africana.  O...M...G.  I love mussles and this was by far the best I've had so far.  I'm not sure what all was in that sauce but we wanted to drink it - soooo good!  If everything else was horrid (which it wasn't) I would for sure go back for the Moules Africana!   We also had ceasar salad.  Wish the lettuce had been a little less of the iceberg variety, but they get thumbs up for anchovies and a good dressing.My husband got the Branzini on the menu - the house special.  Albeit you need to watch out for a few bones, the spices and vegetables were well paired - delicious!  I got the boullebaise special.  I believe it was done in the same sauce as the Moules Africana - which was good, but the sauce is better reserved for the mussels alone - it lost a little something in the seafood stew but was still delightful.  The scallops were so very tender!  We finished by splitting the nutella/banana/strawberry crepe - very nice!  Also had decaf coffee - which was done the way it should be - from espresso and very freshly brewed.The only drawbacks here was that the space is a little small. If you're a two-top, you may see yourself squished in between others when its packed.  Also, after the rush came in, the service started to slip, but that being said - we did get there at 6:30 and were spoiled for about an hour.Also nice - the chef came out and stopped by all of his tables before it got busy.  Clearly he was dedicated to being in touch directly with his customers.We will be back for sure.  I watched other dishes come out during the evening and am dying to try more!"
5/2/2016,4 star rating,"Great neighborhood bistro with a personal touch. The chef came out twice to make sure we were happy with our order. Authentic Senegalese cuisine with a twist. Made my soft shell crabs to order with his extra special additions. Wait staff is is not super professional but that is part of the charm as they were very friendly and eager to please. In the wasteland of lower Third Avenue, this is a place that I will enjoy again."

Highly recommend, I would definitely return. Thanks!"
9/9/2012,4 star rating,"Ponty Bistro exceeded my expectations!  I'm pretty sure when I checked Yelp reviews months back, it wasn't a 4 star. The fact that is was persuaded me to take my bf here on date night last Thurs around 8pm.  The restaurant was pretty empty, but the service, warm and inviting.  The restaurants offers a wide-variety menu of French-African cooking, and the portions are big!  Prices in the high teens, low 20s, but we used the Scoutmob deal that was 30% off (had no issue using it).  Our server was really sweet, made good recommendations, refilled waters, etc.  The only downside was that we sat in a cramped table.  We didn't order drinks but they do a lot of cocktails here.  There were a lot of specials that night- we started off with the special salad.  It was an artichoke salad with a strong lemon vinaigrette, arugula, and and shaved parmesan. I really loved it- it was fresh. As for the entrees, I went for the moule frites in African spices.  It's more French but thought the African spices would be a good twist.  It was largely flavored with tomato, onion, and gtinger.. I think that's what gave it a zingy spice. It was different than an African spice though. The mussels were small but there were a lot of them. Most of them were cooked well- there was only one bad one that didn't open.  The fries (smaller in portion- good for my waistline!)  were actually food- crispy, nicely salted, etc.  $18. My bf ordered the broiled branzino (a whole fish- so beware of the crispy skin, head and small bones!) which he loved. It was quite fresh and had a nice lemon zing..even though I don't love branzino, this was one of the better preparations I've had.  The white rice it came with was so flavorful- simple but lemon-y.  The veggies atop- tomatoes, and onions were a nice touch.  The waitress recommended this is as one of their best dishes. It's nice to see that there are seafood options at an African place! (But their lamb and such is there too)My bf liked it better than I did but I'd possibly go again. Thanks Scoutmob!"
9/9/2012,4 star rating,"Neighborhood gem! It's great to see a bistro that infuses African elements into its ambiance. Have to say the arrangement of artworks is a bit haphazard... As for the FOODbe sure to get the stuff with asteroids! those are apparently delicacies. butternut squqash soup --  Have to say I like this one better than Wolfgan Puck's. This is  not as creamy and has the right kick of spices! SHRIMP TABOULI -- very fresh and again, brilliant use of spice! The Cous cous was refreshing and has soaked up the juice of tomatoes and cucumbersSTUFFED FLOUNDER -- this dish really surprised me. Did not expect a local bistro to have done their seafood so well. Usually seafood dishes at bistroes are just there to offer you an option. yet Ponty makes their seafood with heart. The fish was fresh, tender yet rolled up perfectly. stuffing was tasty too! way much better than your regular chicken/fish rouladeCOCKTAIL -- oversaw some neighbors ordering cocktails. They planend to get one each. Yet they all ended up with another around. That says something right?one pet peeve though-- maybe the food smells too good? at least 3 bugs tried to share our dinner that night..."
9/2/2012,1 star rating,wanted to like it here...but not the case..came for drinks on a friday night because of a scout mob deal I had seen and it was totally empty..the sangria tasted like peach schnapps with extra sugar and the server argued with me about letting us use the scout mob deal even though we met the criteria listed in the fine print. He ended up giving it to us but left a bad taste in my mouth...almost as bad a taste as the awful sangria. Won't be back to try my luck with the food.
8/28/2012,5 star rating,"Wow I can't believe I forgot to review this place!!! I've always wanted to try African food. My friend told me to find a bar and an African place blocks away from each other. Luckily I found this place in a great area close to a lot of nice bars and clubs. The place was empty when we arrived at around 9. The waiter was cute and sweet, and explained everything on the menu. I got some kind of tuna steak appetizer that was cooked rare in the middle but so delicious with a great soy wasabi sauce. Then the stuffed filet of flounder with bok choy and crab meat and potatoes. Omg, SOOOO GOOD!!! The flavors were awesome and wonderful, with a certain freshness a lot of restaurants lack.We were there till closing but nobody was pushy or bitchy. They also had a 2 for 1 martini special that went along great with our food. I am so looking forward to going back to this place. The only thing I would watch out for is the prices. They are a bit expensive but this is Manhattan so we all should be used to it right now. And I do remember being hella hot that day but I know how Manhanites love to sit outside or sit by open windows while they eat BUT NOT ME! I like air conditioning and cool air blown at me from all angles, so maybe next time I should voice that to the staff. But besides that a wonderful experience!"

So, for the sake of convenience, Ponty seemed like the way to go. The food and service was pitch perfect. My eggs benedict w/salmon was great and my side of crispy bacon was baconlicious. We all agreed the home fries were far more superior than the average mushy, flavorless glob you find at brunch. When we asked for hot sauce - OMG, the server brings out a cute lil serving dish of both Tabasco AND Sriracha. He brought out two diff't sauces for our saucing pleasure. Which is amazing, since everything in life can use a lil Sriracha spice, if you ask me. Oh, and the sangria, full of fruit and also delicious.If Ponty serves up a mean a$$ brunch, I can't wait to see what's in store for dinner..."

The food here is homemade and you can taste the effort and love put into by the chef.So we had the french, apple, lychee and passion fruit martini. All delicious but the french was the best.Appetizers - shared the crab cake and shrimp tabouli. The crab cake was 95% crab which is awesome and the mango salsa and avocado complimented the cake well. The shrimp tabouli (4 pieces of shrimp) was gooood; especially the spices they put on it.Entree - sirloin steak and the seafood risotto. Big delicious servings; plenty to share.Dessert - they have a wide selection of desserts; never seen so many choices. We had the tiramisu and the tartini? I can't remember the exact name but it was caramelized apple with cinnamon ice cream - a perfect combination. The tiramisu was homemade and scrumptiousWe are definitely going back to sample the other martinis, dessert, and food."

A few months ago , Living Social offered a ""$40 off"" the bill voucher so I purchased two vouchers. I went to Ponty on Wed with my sister and had a great time. The food, atmosphere and wait staff were all perfect. Then  I suggested that my sister use my second voucher the next night because she wanted to take her friend out for a nice dinner. My sister is an avid yelper and has been declared ""Mayor"" of Ponty Bistro on more than one occasion. The next night while at the restaurant, the chef/ owner was uncharacteristically rude. He got upset because my sister was explaining the voucher system to another pair of diners who had inquired about the Living Social deal. He starts telling the diners ""Uh yeah, we don't make money with those. Patrons abuse the vouchers"". He then brought over a receipt without the discount so he could SHOW the diners how much money HE was losing from the voucher system. Not only was it embarrassing, but it was also unacceptable. Maybe he was having a bad night, maybe he was pissed because a lot of voucher customers came in that night,  but that's no excuse. Restaurants shouldn't participate in the voucher program if it hurts their ""bottom line"", but most of all, don't take it out on the patrons. We won't be having any more French-African fusion at Ponty Bistro. We're done."
1/17/2010,5 star rating,"One of my best dining experiences ever.  The staff was incredible; friendly and attentive.  The atomosphere is comfortable and he food is delicious and well priced.  Including the exquisite resturants I've dined at in the city, Ponty Bistro is one of the highest ranked."
1/3/2010,5 star rating,"This place is very unassuming. At first glance you won't think much of it, but the food is really fantastic. It is thoughtfully prepared, every spice, salt, oil. Every dish is made with love, and when you meet the chef who regularly comes out to mingle with guests, you'll see it in his eyes. I've been there a few times, and have ordered in, and it has never failed. Their martinis are always 2 for 1 and strong (can't beat it), the house one is a ginger martini and delish. Service is attentive and friendly. The cuisine is North African, and French, nothing too too exciting on the menu, but definitely makes you wanna go 'hmm I want that, or maybe that, or wait, I think I want this'. My go tos are the fried calamar and truffle mac n' cheese. My last venture was for the seafood risotto (overflowing with shrimp, mussels, calamari, and lobster) and my other had the lobster entree. They were cooked to perfection, not rubbery, not raw, each bite of the risotto more heavenly than the previous. We shared the mac 'n cheese made with truffle oil. Man that thing is sin in a bowl. Me thought a bowl would not satisfy one, much less two of us, but it is decadent and guilty enough. On a dirty night, I will finish it myself, watch. Without dessert, a meal such as this will run you an average of  $30-$40 pp. Good for a date night, or comfy hug on a plate night."
10/10/2011,3 star rating,"Had a reservation, but didn't need one... Was hoping there would be more African influence in the dishes, but since I like French food it was still satisfying. The escargot was standard (delicious) but my friend got the foie gras which tasted fine, but resembled a giant square block of meat margarine.  It had been raining off and on but it was so humid in the restaurant that we sat next to the street, where we were unfortunately frequently visited by a couple of fruit flies (one of which introduced himself by landing on the rim of my wine glass where I almost ate him). The servers were really attentive and pleasant."
8/26/2012,4 star rating,"Very good restaurant, nice ambiance, customer service is great. Awesome Gem in Manhattan which contains a  sea of the same standard cuisine of restaurants, I'm not hating just saying, this is NY, we need variety.  I had the Dibi lamb, with sauteed onion, salad , plantains and the truffle mac and cheese.  Wow. I was satisfied portion and taste wise after a long day and trek back from BK.  i plan to be back to try the Yassa fish, sorrel and hopefully desert."
4/9/2009,5 star rating,"Tried this little place out recently with a girlfriend & it was everything we could've wanted. A slight pricey as the bill came to about $45 for each of us (& we skipped dessert) but well worth it. The chef is very attentive and interactive, he even gave us complimentary Senegalese berry juice after we polished off the entrees. I recommend the salmon, it was served with a delicious sweet creamy sauce, & the crispy tuna was amazing as well (appetizer). Try the mushroom risotto, too! :) Pleasant, unassuming restaurant. I'd definitely go again."
3/9/2013,5 star rating,Amazing place with great food and service.  This place should be jammed packed every day and night.
8/21/2011,2 star rating,"Went here with a scoutmob coupon yielding a $25 discount; otherwise I most likely would not have come here...UItimately, this place is disorganized (they gave us our bread 30 seconds before our meal came out and there were only two other occupied tables in the restaurant)The seafood risotto I had was pretty good and I believe my friend enjoyed her lobster salad though keep in mind that there was something just off about the place, the least of which being:(1) the bench was too short (didn't have enough depth) to be comfortable to either me nor my friend (fyi both my friend and myself are normal sized individuals)(2) it was too hot and humid inside the restaurantfor a place with $20-30 entries, basic creature comforts should be there...I'd avoid this place, even with a big coupon"
9/14/2011,5 star rating,TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE AND LOBSTER BLT. ultimate hungover food.
1/23/2011,4 star rating,"This might be my new go-to brunch place for large groups.  They let you make a reservation, which is so key for brunch in New York, especially with parent types.  The price fix menu has great options, including a lobster option with a drink for $20.  I got the crab cake eggs benedict. This was perfectly prepared and delicious -- pillowy egg, creamy sauce and crunchy delicious cake cake.  Even the home fries were good, and I usually hate those. Skip the bloody marys though.  Not good at all."
1/16/2011,4 star rating,"I'm still jonesing for the Lobster Benedict on Sunday's brunch menu. This African inspired menu is executed with classic French cooking techniques. Great service, terrific price and outstanding food. This is my go-to bistro in the Grammercy area."
5/29/2013,4 star rating,Decided to grab dinner with a group at the last minute. Was thrilled they could accommodate us. They honored the four square offer that one of us had and managed to serve a large group with ease. The truffle mac and cheese was outrageously good but very filling.
4/3/2014,5 star rating,"what a gem. the senegalese/french inspired restaurant is a-mazing. get the warm seafood salad (on the specials), the senegalese chicken, and the mushroom risotto. oh and try the sauvignon if you're like me and like a dry white wine. service is friendly and ya can't beat the cozy atmosphere~"
3/29/2011,5 star rating,"This has become my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything I've gotten here has been amazing. The service is incredible - I always get the French waiter with the curly black hair, I think his name is Rahim. The restaurant is super cute, dimly lit and perfect for a date or intimate dinner with friends or family. My favorite thing on the menu are the plantains as a side dish. They're smothered in some kind of butter sauce that must have crack in it, because I can't get enough! The salad with fennel and shaved parmesan is great too. Download the ScoutMob app on your iPhone, and you can get 50% off, too!!"
9/24/2015,2 star rating,"Very disappointing. I went to this restaurant based upon the reviews. I had a crab cake to start which was good. But, they brought out my main course before my appetizer was completely finished. I had an Asian steak salad. The steak was overcooked and extremely tough and almost cold. When I complained they asked me if I wanted something else, which I did not at that point. They charged me the full price. I will not go back."

8/28/2012,5 star rating,"Wow I can't believe I forgot to review this place!!! I've always wanted to try African food. My friend told me to find a bar and an African place blocks away from each other. Luckily I found this place in a great area close to a lot of nice bars and clubs. The place was empty when we arrived at around 9. The waiter was cute and sweet, and explained everything on the menu. I got some kind of tuna steak appetizer that was cooked rare in the middle but so delicious with a great soy wasabi sauce. Then the stuffed filet of flounder with bok choy and crab meat and potatoes. Omg, SOOOO GOOD!!! The flavors were awesome and wonderful, with a certain freshness a lot of restaurants lack.We were there till closing but nobody was pushy or bitchy. They also had a 2 for 1 martini special that went along great with our food. I am so looking forward to going back to this place. The only thing I would watch out for is the prices. They are a bit expensive but this is Manhattan so we all should be used to it right now. And I do remember being hella hot that day but I know how Manhanites love to sit outside or sit by open windows while they eat BUT NOT ME! I like air conditioning and cool air blown at me from all angles, so maybe next time I should voice that to the staff. But besides that a wonderful experience!"
9/2/2011,3 star rating,"While I wouldn't neccesarily travel to eat here, its a good neighborhood restaurant. We've eaten dinner here a number of times and the food ranges from just okay to quite good. Last time we had dinner at Ponty we ordered duck and Chilean sea bass both of which were quite good. In addition, I am always happy with their squash soup."
4/5/2013,4 star rating,"Nice spot for a cozy dinner with interesting african infused french food and wine. On the small side, so reservations are appropriate during prime dining hours. Great spot to walk-in when dining early though."

1/15/2011,1 star rating,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE NITWITS!They sent a delivery man who couldn't speak or read English, and despite the fact that the order sheet he held said in big letters ""Prepaid do NOT charge."" and ""Customer signature"" he kept insisting ""cash. cash"" (this appeared to be the only word he spoke). Then he mumbled and stared vacantly into space for about 15 minutes, before finally getting someone on the phone who spoke his language to explain the situation to him. After waiting with increasing frustration in the cold hallway for him to give me my meal, the food was cold and rubbery. Sending this guy who can't do the simplest job in the world with my dinner shows how little this restaurant cares about its customers. Don't make my mistake!"

3/7/2009,3 star rating,"Came here with a couple of friends who won't quit raving about the place and, well, not sure if I see what all the fuss is about.  As Randy Jackson would say, it was just a'ight for me, dog; I can't say I was blown away.  Tried the maple french toast and a few bites of the mac and cheese with truffle oil.  Service seemed kind of confused, and the place certainly isn't much to look at.  I'll give 'em another try next time I'm down here, but not making a special trip for it."
12/15/2012,2 star rating,"I had brunch at ponty bistro using a deal from Travelzoo.   My girlfriend and I got there at 11:15a.m, there was only one table in the back with 6 people and a table of 3 next to us. Other than that the restaurant was empty.  Terrible Service.  It took ONE HOUR for our food to arrive.  Other tables of two that arrived after us received their food before we did.  When I asked the server at 12:15pm where our food was, it's like he had forgotten our table existed!  He brought the food out about 5-10 mins I asked him to check.  When he arrived at our table I asked him ""what took so long?"" He didn't have an explanation and certainly did not apologize.  The food is here is really delicious (Scrambled Bruschetta and Eggs Florentine). After he cleared our table he brought us a complimentary dessert and offered an apology.  The dessert was fantastic too - chocolate tiramisu.So, the food is great but it's no fun waiting an hour for food and seeing everyone else's order come out before yours.  I've definitely experienced better service.  I probably won't be going back to Ponty Bistro."
6/12/2015,4 star rating,"Enjoyed the soft shell crab special appetizer very much.  African moules,  the  sirloin steak and the house Malbec were good.  The ginger martini was a bit overpowering.  The server was not friendly and the a/c insufficient for a hot June night.  I would have loved to have met the owners but did not.  Would gives it another try if in the neighborhood on a cooler night nonetheless and hope for a different waiter."
3/24/2013,5 star rating,Soooo delicious! Came here with our adopted son from Senegal. He gave the food 5 stars and so did we!The staff was wonderful and we came with 25 people and they were terrific!

12/2/2014,5 star rating,"We had Thanksgiving dinner at the Ponty Bistro.  Food was exceptionally good and my girlfriend and I agreed it was one of the two best restaurants we'd ever been to in the city.  I had the stuffed flounder and she had the hanger steak.  Atmosphere was good for a date, decor was nice, and server was very friendly.  Five stars!"
8/18/2011,2 star rating,We always order in from Ponty.  It is a bit expensive but the quality of the food is fairly high.  Hits include the lamb leg and the mushroom risotto.  Misses include the salads and pastas.
1/22/2015,5 star rating,"I have had the pleasure of eating at Ponty in house once before and it was a wonderful dining experience. Tonight, I ordered in from Ponty, the steak salad.  I can honestly say that it was THE BEST SALAD I have ever had; moreover, it is the BEST TAKE OUT I have had in quite some time.  Fresh, crisp, tasty!  I actually called the restaurant to say Thank You!  That is a first for me!"
12/17/2010,5 star rating,"I went here for my coworker's birthday.  there were 10 of us.  some of us had pre-fix and some of us had a la carte.  I had a a la carte dish of lobster salad.  They gave me half a lobster on top of a huge salad with grilled shrimps.  I tried the mac and cheese and lobster risotto from other people's dishes, and they were all excellent.  we ordered two pitchers of white wine sangria, which had a bunch of pear and mangos inside.  It was a really good combination of refreshing and sweetness.  They let us stay on as long as we wanted, and everyone was too full to have coffee later on."
1/22/2011,3 star rating,"Went here for dinner tonight.   Food was good, and portions were large.  Tables are very very close together and the table had little room between.  We had to move the table to get out.  There is only one bathroom (a uni-sex) so as the night goes on, there is a line.  They have no place to hang your coat so for winter, this is a problem especially given the close quarters with neighboring tables.  I probably will not go again, as the crowdness was more a pain than the food was good."
2/9/2011,5 star rating,"This just might be the best food I've ever had at a restaurant.  My friend and I both had to keep interrupting the conversation to exclaim how great the food was.  She had the duck that came with the most amazing sweet potatoes ever!  How did they do that?  I had the chicken tajine that came in an amazing savory sauce and a side of flavorful couscous.  We also had a side of plantains.  I thought I loved plantains, but the truth is that I never really knew plantains before tonight.  Everything was perfect...I will go back again and again and again."
2/24/2012,5 star rating,"I had like 2 bites of my chicken tagine and already started planning when I could come back. The food quality is high, the cooking technique superb and the unique spices and flavors outstanding! I can't wait to go again. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal in that part of town. You can taste the love and sincerity that goes into the food. I am officially a big fan of Ponty!"
12/25/2014,5 star rating,awesome restaurant! intresting blend of flavors! reccomend everybody to come! casual and good for kids. i reccomend the lamb shank and the filet mignon. the  food comes out quickly and the escargot and octupus salad is divine! desserts are delicious!
5/6/2015,5 star rating,"I have never dined at Ponty Bistro, so this review is based solely on my multiple delivery experiences. Every time I have ordered from here, the food has been fantastic and the delivery has been quite speedy. Literally every dish I've ever ordered has been delicious - from the truffle mac n cheese and crab cakes to the wild mushroom risotto, chicken parmesan and lamb burger. It's a little pricey, but the portions are very generous. Definitely would recommend Ponty Bistro, and hope to dine-in one day soon!"
2/1/2014,4 star rating,"Pleasantly surprised. We liked everything we ordered. The Nokololokoba was cooked just right, and the sauce was delicious. The rack of lamb was perfectly done, and the chocolate fondant cake was delicious. We will definitely be back to try the brunch."
8/3/2012,4 star rating,"One of the better brunch place I've been too. My friend ordered Asian Steak Salad. It tasted awesome!!! I enjoy my meal there with nice neighbors(on the nearby table). Service is B+. Our waitress was very nice, but there were times that we couldn't find her.  She is the only waitress at the time, so we can understand that. I used a groupon, but she accidentally click the used bottom without writing down groupon number. However, she still nice enough to gave me the discount. Definitely will take my friends there again."
2/18/2015,4 star rating,Delicious food with unique flavors (had chicken & fish entrees). Very pleasant staff. Food & wine prices are very reasonable for a nice dinner in Gramercy.
6/2/2012,4 star rating,"Service was good.  Food was good.  We had the risotto; it was great.  While the items on the menu all sounded delicious, they seemed more French (even Italian) than African.  Dessert was great even though I am not usually a dessert fan.  Dinner price was closer to $$$ than $$."

12/11/2011,4 star rating,"A friend suggested this place and I was cautious upon entering since every patron was 60+ years old.  But the food was delicous.  I had mussels with saffron as an appetizer and they were darn good.  But the stuffed halibut with Senegal spices was the real star.  Plus really nice, friendly service."
2/9/2013,4 star rating,"I've been to this place a few times, as my parents live close by and like it a lot.  The food is really good--I've never been disappointed.  For their artichoke salad they somehow shave the artichoke, which I've never seen before . The crispy tuna is delicious.  The poulet tangine is so good I have  trouble ordering something else.  The chef always comes out to say hi, and the staff could not be nicer!"
9/11/2014,5 star rating,"I've been here twice with my family, once last year. I don't remember last year's meal all that much, but last night's was great! Service was really awesome, all the food was delicious. The lobster risotto was on special and came with huge chunks of lobster. Scallops dish was really excellent, as was the beef tartar. Apps included the escargots and tuna tartar. Nice blend of African and French cuisine and nice vibe."
1/10/2013,1 star rating,"We are joining the chorus of commenters who are surprised at this restaurant's high ratings. While certain parts of our meals were good enough to show potential, the poor service made the overall experience seriously unpleasant.First, while I realize space is an issue at many restaurants, I don't think it should ever be necessary to slide one's table (not chair - TABLE) to allow other patrons to be seated.  Then, when your waitress arrives for the first time, she should not lead with, ""Do you know what you want yet?""  What's more, when we indicated we did not, she tried to scurry away.  We managed to stop her long enough to ask a couple of questions about the menu and order but she still fled before taking our drink order - she needed to be flagged down for that.  This, by the way, was the last time we saw her until long after the meal was through.As we waited, we realized that other patrons were being made aware of a number of specials - something that might have occurred to our waitress had she not been trying to take our order in less time than Usain Bolt spends on a track.  When our food arrived, some of it was good but there was a major problem with the rice served to my companion.  You may think I am exaggerating but the rice included a lump of starch the size of a roll of quarters that was so hard a fork only penetrated about an eighth of an inch.  Seriously.Had anyone returned to our table to check on our satisfaction, this problem might have been resolved in time to keep this review from being completely negative.  Instead, the rice lump became the centerpiece of the meal, as we waited for water refills (never happened) soft drink refills (never happened), or any level of interest whatsoever (never happened).We flagged down another server to get our check and after an excessive wait (during which we witnessed the other server bring the check and credit card to the attention of our waitress a SECOND time) we saw her for what will certainly be the final time when she brought the receipt.  No food is worth this much frustration."
10/12/2014,5 star rating,"Very cool restaurant.  Food is unique -  can taste the mix of French and African influences.  Service was perfect - not bothersome, but immediately at your table before you needed something.  We had the mussels, the duck breast special, and the veal chop special - - the entrees were awesome.  We hope to be back."
2/28/2014,4 star rating,"The food here is almost always delicious.  Their mussels are great!  As is there lamb.  The food might be a bit slow to come out, but I take that to mean it's being freshly prepared.  Also, the place is usually really busy.  The service is usually pretty good.  Maybe a little understaffed at times.  The chef is lovely and comes out to the dining room to check on people, which I love.  They have an ""early bird special"" if you want to eat dinner at some really early hour.  They are probably the only place in the neighborhood that serves brunch before 11 am, which is great."
4/7/2014,4 star rating,"Booked a reservation for a Friday night through Yelp. Managed to get a table at 6:45 pm. Comfortable, bistro setting, attentive service even though the restaurant became very crowded. Nice menu of happy hour martinis to start the meal. My dinner date and stayed to mostly traditional French dishes, escargot and lobster bisque to start, then lamb shanks and duck for entrees. Finished with some complimentary desert. The snails were decent enough, not too heavy on the garlic but could have been improved with some extra bread. The bisque had some good chunks of lobster meat and was heavy but balanced. The standout dish was the lamb shank which was falling off the bone tender and accompanied by a North African inspired sauce. The duck was perfectly cooked to medium rare, and was served with some pureed sweet potato. All in all a nice meal, a perfect choice for a place to eat prior to a play. The prices were entirely reasonable, even with a few drinks and coffee."
2/7/2010,4 star rating,"Great French/Senegalese food. Tiny, cozy place, very informal, and moderate prices for French food. They have a good wine list, but don't expect many beers. I had the Ponty Salad and the Lamb Shanks. The flavors were nicely balanced but I'm not a big fan of rich, buttery sauces, and the lamb came with a rich wine reduction. Definitely something I'd have only once in a while, but still good."
10/8/2010,2 star rating,Ponty fresh Ginger martini was good.  The service seemed disorganized.  Food prices were not cheap but the portions were big.  Fois gras terrine was a bit hard contrasted with brioche which too soft. The beets in the scallop dish tasted odd.  Desserts weren't that appealing.
11/21/2010,4 star rating,"THE ONLY PARISIAN- AFRICAN FUSED FRENCH RESTAURANT by a SENEGALESE BORN, PARIS-TRAINED CHEF!Affordable, generous portions, authentic, a chef that cares.You will almost miss Ponty Bistro as you walk by that unattractive couple of blocks..I was blown away when I discovered this neighborhood gem. The chef is kind and talks to you--he is of Senegalese descent and a few of the dishes have a nice, unexpected African twist. Apparently he trained at the top Parisian Restaurants and decided to start this restaurant out of a labor of love.The place is small and narrow so I think its great for parties of 2-3 OR rent it out for an event. I only gave this four stars because the wine list needs major improving. the selection is limited and there are not enough French Wines. We did appreciate, though, last time we were there: We asked if one of the special wines they had by the bottle could be served to us by the glass  as an exception, and they happily granted the request since we are regulars.If you are going to go, perhaps inquire as to their corkage policy."
1/3/2012,5 star rating,What is there not to love? The interior is inviting and eclectic and the service was beyond reproach. I had a life changing experience after drinking their Sangria and eating the lobster eggs Benedict. I live in Baltimore and dream about when I will be NY again to enjoy my new favorite place
2/26/2012,2 star rating,"Although the food was pretty good, I have to say I left feeling unsatisfied with the service.  On the evening my friend and I decided to eat here, I had a hectic day at work and was not able to eat a full meal after breakfast so I was HUNGRY.  We sat down and ordered from the waitress based on her recommendations.  20 mins later, another table sat down next to us.  I overheard one of the guys order the same thing I had.  My friend received both of her dishes at the same time (appetizer and entree), and she requested that one of them be taken back until she was ready.  Then she gets her empty plate replaced by the other and the table next to us receive all of their food. I still had not been served anything.  I decided to wait patiently until the waitress noticed, but quickly realized that would not happen.  I walked up to her and mentioned that the other table had sat down after us but was served all of their food already.  She looked at me insulted, and said, ""Oh, ok. Let me see.""  Ten minutes later she directly tells me that she forgot to put my order in and then walks away.I have been a waitress myself, and I try to be reasonable when it comes to situations like this.  Most of the time, the servers know they made a mistake and there's no point in making a scene and the situation worse.  I reasoned with myself that the restaurant would make amends through comping on the check.... that's what we always did.  I finally received my food after waiting well over an hour.  We asked for our check, and noticed that I had been charged full price for my hour and a half late entree and everything else.  To me, this means the restaurant doesn't even acknowledge they F***ed up or care about good service.I like to eat at restaurants where the service matches the quality of food.  In a city like NYC, that's not too much to ask.  Never dining here again."
3/16/2012,3 star rating,"I was in the area, and decided to go here on Yelp's recommendation. It was quite the disappointment. I got the wild mushroom risotto and it was quite salty and cheesy. It had nice texture, but the overall taste is meh. Nice atmosphere, though. I want to try the pre-fix menu next time though- maybe it'll be better?"
4/22/2012,5 star rating,"I love this place! I've passed it by so many times that I couldn't believe it had been flying under my radar for so long.  A friend of mine got a Groupon, rounded up a bunch of friends and we went.  I love French food and so does my sister, and so we were excited for a different French palate.  (We are the type of to throw Provencal herbs into anything to see what comes out).I had lamb, lamb, lamb and some mussels.  My sister had chicken, and she loved her plate also.  The food was incredible.  The best part, though?  The service!  We had an incredibly sweet waitress, and got to meet the chef.  This is the perfect place for friends that enjoy the simple pleasures in life, good food, family and good friends.  What a memorable night!"
10/10/2013,2 star rating,"Priced to titillate those accustomed to pricier neighborhood French restaurants, don't be fooled.  This restaurant is not French.  The leaden Gougere are a dead giveaway.  And sadly using ""Specials"" to sell fish about to go bad is French, but not Senegalese."
9/2/2014,1 star rating,"***This review is for the new Harlem location on W. 139th Street and Adam Clayton Powerll Blvd, but as they do not yet have a Yelp page of their own, I guess this will have to suffice.**** My two friends and I dined for lunch. We sat outside on a very beautiful day. Our waitress off the bat was pleasant but VERY slow. Took ten minutes just to bring us water. She also had no knowledge of the wines or food and was unable to answer any of our questions.In terms of food: I had ordered the Ponty Salad (which consists of shallot vinaigrette, apples and cherry tomatoes) with chicken (which is a $12 salad) and I asked for any type of cheese to be added. My friends ordered the Mushroom omelette and the Kale Salad with Shrimp. We also ordered sides of mashed potatoes and haricot verts. When our food arrived, my salad had mushrooms, carrots, balsamic vinaigrette, chicken and cheese. I DETEST mushrooms and carrots and inquired to the waitress as to what happened. She said that since I wanted chicken and cheese, the chef told her to give me the Chicken Paillard salad ($16). I sent it back because if I wanted the chicken paillard salad I would have ORDERED the chicken paillard salad. Also, the omelette was not delivered with the rest of the food. When we asked the waitress, she acted like she had no idea that an omelette was even ordered. She went back inside, and brought out the lunch menu and asked us to point out where we saw an omelette, which we did. She replied with a confused ""Oh!"" and went back inside.  20 minutes later, she came back out (after we finished the other dishes, including our absurdly buttery and salty mashed potatoes and haricot verts), and told us that our omelette would be out shortly as they ran out of eggs and had to go to the store, but they were ""making it now"". 25 minutes later, the omelette finally arrived (good timing as we were actually waiting for the waitress to come back outside so we could just cancel the darn thing). My friends were less than impressed with the bland dish. We had considered getting dessert but at this point, between the underwhelming food and slow service, we decided to skip it. We asked for the check. When it arrived, our waitress had charged for the Kale Salad with Shrimp TWICE, and charged me for the Chicken Paillard Salad which is $4 more than the salad that I had ordered. We asked her to rectify it, which she did. Due to how confused our waitress seemed throughout our whole dining experience, we did all the necessary math to split our check. We told her to put $31.37 on each of the two cards that we had, and the rest would be in cash (which should have been even change). When she brought us back our cards, she had charged one of them for $31.00 and the other for $37.00. At this point, we were just so over it, we didn't even bother to tell her. To top it all off, I tipped her in cash, not on my card, but when my check closed out in my bank statement, it read as $42.00 meaning the waitress took an extra $5.00 tip on my card for herself.Overall, what we had anticipated on being an hour or so lunch took over 2 hours due to slow service. Our food was bland, buttery and confused and our waitress was a joke. I will never be back here, which is a shame because I live just on the corner of the same intersection. I was so excited to have such a cute place in the neighborhood, and was severely disappointed. I don't recommend this location."
4/24/2014,3 star rating,"The food was tasty but overpriced. I got the Yassa Poisson because a friend had recommended Senegalese food, but $27 for a fillet of fish with white rice.. is a bit too much."
5/15/2010,5 star rating,"I've been to Ponty twice for dinner with a friend who absolutely adores the place.  Both times, I've had a great experience.  The atmosphere is lovely - a casual and comfortable bistro with a menu that offers something for everyone.  I had the chicken tangine for my first meal, and a veal chop special on the most recent visit. Both were delicious. Great sauces, and generous portions thoughtfully prepared and presented.  I've tried a number of their red wines along with these meals - all reasonably priced, nice choices.This is a great, unpretentious restaurant with great prix fixe offerings...if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be there regularly."
12/29/2011,4 star rating,"We happened into Ponty because the place we were heading had an hour wait and there were five of us with a theater time. We wandered in the cold for almost 45 minutes looking for good food and had no idea what to expect. We were more than pleasantly surprised. The staff was polite and accommodating and the space was warm and exceptionally clean. Most important, our meals were expertly prepared and delicious. I had the hangar steak which was moist and flavorful, while my companions enjoyed diverse selections like chicken tangine, seared salmon, and a lamb burger with chipotle sauce. A side of haricot vert was perfectly done. The service was handled by a team and was attentive and friendly. While we did not venture into the more African-influenced dishes, the Ponty delivers a french bistro-style experience where all the meals are nicely cooked and presented."
7/26/2014,2 star rating,"My roommate and I ordered 2 lobster blt's for delivery and we were very disappointed. The sandwich would have been a great blt (without lobster), but there wasn't even enough lobster to cover the roll.  A good blt minus lobster should not be $15 so this place is not worth it. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the delivery came quickly."
5/7/2016,1 star rating,"Good food, non-existent service. It took 8 minutes before we were acknowledged or even given menus. Another 6 minutes before we even had a chance to order drinks and at least 10 more minutes before we even received our drinks. We ordered an old fashioned and a margarita and unfortunately both were poorly and improperly made. The old fashioned had slices of oranges and way too much sugar. The margarita came without salt and with an orange. We received our appetizer before we even received our drinks and our waiter had no idea what he was doing. The lamb shank and the seafood risotto was were amazing, but it's unfortunate that the service was practically non-existent. We literally had to find our server for everything needed from asking for menus, to asking him to take our order, following up to see if our drinks were coming to asking him to remove the finished plates that remained at our table for over 20 min. He never came back to see if we needed another round of drinks throughout the entire time we were there. It seemed that he had never waited tables before and completely oblivious to how terrible his service was. Overall, we won't be coming back."
9/23/2012,5 star rating,"The Ambience:Ponty Bistro has become one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  This is a lovely restaurant -- wonderful ambiance for just eating with friends or family or for a romantic night out.   The Food:The food is amazing -- tasty and cooked with quality, fresh ingredients.  This is not just an African restaurant.  For the most part, the dishes seem to be French dishes prepared with an African twist or spices.  My favorite dish is the Moussels Africana -- I don't even like mussels, but these are so tasty! The entree size is perfect for sharing with others, and you just might find yourself full before your entree comes.  The steak and mushroom risotto are also delicious!  The rack of lamb is tasty and well done -- this dish also comes with sausage, so if you're not a big meat lover, you might want to order something else.Overall: You won't leave unhappy.  The Owner/Head Chef makes all the food himself and still comes out and greets you and your party and makes sure you enjoyed yourself.  I had my birthday dinner here this year, and the Owner showed my friends and I a great time!  We were a party of 15, and there was plenty of room for us to sit comfortably and enjoy ourselves!This place is a gem in NYC -- go and bring your friends with you, you won't be disappointed!"
4/28/2014,5 star rating,"Amazing food!  Ordered the grilled shrimp special, and escargot, both so yummy!  The nearby tables, the muscles looked great too, amd seabass and steak.  French cooking with african spices. Very special!  Make sure get a rez for dinner, they get packed up quickly."
9/12/2014,5 star rating,I went to lunch nd dinner at Ponty Bistrot and it has always been delicious. The staff is very attentive and the owner always there to welcome you. Even the sandwiches are made with a  delicious sauce.(mergues is my favorite). All desserts are made on site and they were delicious!
8/29/2014,2 star rating,"I don't know what everyone's raving about. Food was ok. We had mixed olives for appetizers, my husband had the lamb shank for entree, and I had the lobster ravioli. Everything was so-so, especially for the price. Best part was dessert (tiramisu)."
6/6/2012,5 star rating,"We came here on Saturday night for the second time, and it made us wonder why we don't get over here more often. Waitstaff is really nice, 2 for 1 martinis that are delicious (cucumber and ginger at the top of our list). I had the tuna steak which was cooked to perfection and my bf had the rack of lamb which was beautiful. The meal was so good we were in a state of bliss the whole night. I wish this joint was in my neighborhood!"
6/4/2014,4 star rating,"I got a lunch groupon for ponty. Never tried Senegalese food before so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Boy, am I glad I did!  I had the Mac and cheese which is an appetizer but can easily substiute as a meal for those not too hungry. Entree was the nikolokoba and it was perfection. The pepper sauce is richer than other pepper sauces and Ali (the chef) puts some kind of cilantro seasoning on it that puts it over the top. Definitely need to come back here."
10/24/2009,4 star rating,"Some days, this place is phenomenal, some days it's just okay.  I've come here many times for the dinner prix fixe and realized that when the head chef is in the house (Mornings and Weekends), everything is cooked to perfection and the service is great.  When the head chef is out, the food is still good but just lacks the wow factor in taste, and the service just seems confused (wrong serving plates are used, slow service in bringing things out, etc).  That being said, on the good days, you can take anyone into the restaurant in the most terrible mood and everyone will come out of the restaurant completely satisfied and happy because the food is just that good.  I have taken many friends here and the consensus is that when the head chef is in the house, the food is heaven.  We especially love the dinner prix frixe menu - 3 amazing courses for $20!  I've had just about everything on the dinner prix fixe menu and every dish has been great.This is a must try.  Just come on the weekends for dinner or lunch anytime (when the head chef is in).  For now, I can only give this place a 4.  When it gains consistency in it's food and service, i'd give it a 5 without a second thought."
11/21/2010,5 star rating,"I never write reviews on yelp, but this place is so wonderful I had to say something. I have been there five times, every time I have gotten something different and every time it has been amazing. Last night I had the Branzino fish. It was served as a whole fish, blackened and peppered on both sides, with a delicious caramelized union salsa. I am usually turned off my whole fish meals, but this was fantastic. If you don't like whole fish, their snapper is prepared on a bed of veggies and is also delicious. I finished dinner off with a wonderful banana crepe that had a layer of nutella on the outside and was served with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream.The are not very many tables, so you may want to make a reservation, but it will be worth it and you will probably get to meet the kind and smiling chef, who really is from Africa.Lastly, make sure someone in your party tries their signature dish, which is the mussels. When you do order it, make sure you get some extra bread to scoop up the leftover sauce.Enjoy!!!"
6/5/2011,1 star rating,"I came here hoping that this could be the neighborhood spot to get my lobster benedict fix. At a table nearby, a patron who seems to be a regular, was raving to his friends he brought here about how the lobster benedict is ""to die for"". Awesome, I thought. To my dismay, the lobster benedict ended up to be anything but that. There were only a few lobster pieces in each biscuit. The lobster meat was not fresh, but rather, reheated. The potatoes as the side was sorry looking--drenched with oil, also tasted reheated. Probably the worst potatoes allowed to be served that i've seen for a while. It felt like the only thing that was freshly cooked that morning were the eggs on top. For $15, I'd rather get a fresh lobster roll from Luke's lobster truck. Some of the regular patrons seem to be perfectly content coming here, like the guy at the table a few tables down from us. But for a foodie, this did not cut it. Service was friendly and warm but they need to work on their food. Maybe dinner is better based the mostly positive reviews here, but brunch was definitely a disappointment."
10/13/2011,5 star rating,"On my second visit to Ponty, the food, ambience and service did not disappoint me. The steak was tender, juice and tasty. This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC."
1/17/2012,5 star rating,"This is our FAVORITE neighborhood restaurant! The service is attentive but never overbearing. We had the Terrine de Fois Gras which was phenomenal, followed by the lamb shank and the veal chop (which was a special). The flavor of each were perfect and the meat itself was so tender and lean. We both had martini's and the chocolate lava cake. I don't even like desserts per se, but this was mind blowing. I cannot say enough about Ponty. I have been several times and look forward to my next visit. If you are a new yorker, you know how much that means to each somewhere even twice, nonetheless more and feel like you aren't missing out on anything."
2/18/2012,4 star rating,"I had the LONGLET A L ECHALOTE (Grilled hanger steak with yucca mashed potato, spinach and bordellaise sauce) which was quite good.  I can't remember which wine I had, although I think it was a Malbec. I enjoyed it at any rate. The service was attentive and friendly. The only less than stellar moment was the crème brûlée. I am used to it being served in a shallow porcelain dish so the torch warms the custard a bit when the chef caramelizes the sugar. I know this dessert is normally served cold, but using a deeper dish meant that the custard was quite cold at the bottom, but warm near the top, and the consistency was not as creamy (it had more of a gelatin consistency) as I was expecting. But I definitely enjoyed my steak and will be back to try their other dishes."
10/23/2013,4 star rating,"Randomly stopped in here for a mid week very early lunch. I wasn't sure what to expect as the menu sounded good, but the reviews on here seemed mixed with some questioning cleanliness. Seeing the coveted ""a"" in the window I decided to give it a shot. I was the only one in here as it was 1130am but got great service right away. Their lunch menu is fairly expansive with fair pricing. I decided on the Merguez sandwich. This was African spiced lamb sausage with grilled peppers. I am not that familiar with Senegalese cooking, but I do know that this was some very flavorful sausage. Delicious. Sandwich was nicely constructed with good bread. The peppers were grilled to perfection with nice flavor as well. The mixed green salad had a nice dressing on it as well. I had their cafe francais to finish up my lunch which was ok, but seemed just like a regular American cup of coffee. Maybe I'm missing something here. The chef actually came over to ask how I liked the lunch. Overall a great experience, would like to try their dinner menu."
3/21/2014,5 star rating,Much enjoyed this lovely small restaurant with great food and excellent service. Got my first deal with #haggleapp here.
3/5/2014,3 star rating,"We came here on a week night with a reservation and I was a little underwhelmed by the decoration and atmosphere. It had great reviews and I was excited to try out ""French African"" food. We ended up ordering the Lamb Tagine because it was the Tuesday special, which came with a free class of wine. The house wine was exactly as expected of house wine, a little water down and bland. The Lamb Tagine was definitely a hearty meal but the meat was a little too chewy for my taste."
3/22/2014,5 star rating,I have been coming to this restaurant for years and it NEVER disappoints me.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Sometimes it is difficult to chose because there are too many options in the menu.  I have brought all my friends and they too have become fans of Ponty.  You shouldn't miss this culinary experience.
5/12/2015,4 star rating,yummy and affordable lobster eggs benedict
9/26/2009,5 star rating,"I've only ordered from this place for delivery, so I can't comment on the actual restaurant itself.  Having said that, the food here is consistently amazing.  They have a delicious lamb burger with seasoned fries that I've gotten time and time again.  They also have a very nice mac 'n cheese flavored with truffle."
7/23/2010,4 star rating,"A hidden treasure in a neighborhood with mediocre food at best. Hard to believe that there is such a great place nestled between a bad asian restaurant and a deli. Had a delicious meal of appetizers and perfect gazpacho on a very hot night.  The crispy tuna was a unique combination of traditional asian with a flair, thai chicken spring rolls yummy and smooth Andulazian style gazpacho that is hard to find versus the more common chunky style.  Breadth of options to choose from--salads, fish, steak, chicken--and the specials sounded terrific.  Excellent, attentive service, pleasant decor and music.  Reasonably priced for high quality food.  It's now our favorite neighborhood spot."
9/24/2010,5 star rating,AMAZING FOOD!Great staff and the Chief even came out and spoke with us. He was so friendly and answered all out questions on how he makes such tasty food. i highly recommend this place!! and the LOBSTER BLT- is incredible
11/20/2010,4 star rating,"I'm standing outside the restaurant, peeking inside with my boyfriend and deliberating whether or not we should go in for a drink. The chef comes out and invites us to come in for dinner. We tell him that we've already eaten and that we're just looking for a place to have a quick drink. The chef goes, ""Okay, well, come on in, I will buy you both a drink."" B-friend and I look at each other, decide why not, and head on in.Not only did the chef give us each a free ginger martini (which was really interesting), but the staff treated us really well, despite the fact that they knew we weren't really eating. We got an appetizer out of interest, which was totally delicious: shrimp tabouli with really amazing garlic-black-pepper shrimp. I couldn't tell you all that was in it, but we really enjoyed it. The place was cozy and had great ambiance. Any night where we get two martinis and an appetizer for $15 with tip is a great night."

3/10/2014,5 star rating,"My sister had a wedding reception at Ponty bistro about couple of weeks ago the food was so Exotic, I wanted to try it on a different occasion and I did with couple of friends. They accommodated without a reservation. And the service was just amazing they were so polite and friendly, and as for the food it was just LUSCIOUS. We had couple of dishes and the mussels Africana is to die for. I totally recommend this place. It definitely will not be my last visit."
3/3/2013,4 star rating,love this place! it's easy to walk in & get a table (even for dinner on a saturday!). staff is nice and friendly and the senegalese chicken is absolutely amazing! the mussels africana and chawarma are also decent. as for dessert the apple tart is good while the tiramisu is just ok- not bad but nothing special. will definitely be back!

10/5/2013,5 star rating,"Came here last night with my visiting mother and fiancé. Fun atmosphere, great flavors and had a great time with the owner/chef. This is the third time I've been her and have enjoyed it every time. This time we got the seafood salad, tuna steak, and stuffed flounder. Each dish was impressive and reasonably priced."
7/15/2013,3 star rating,"The wait staff are SUPER DUPER nice.  The food is average though.  We had the mussels with African spices and didn't really taste anything.  The wild mushroom risotto was very tasty.  But the clay pot chicken was too salty.  The Crepe with nutella, bananas & strawberries was FANTASTIC!  So, we will try their brunch one day..."
6/22/2010,3 star rating,"I came here for a work event and was excited to try some French-Senegalese food.  But the first thing I saw on our prix fixe menu was the Thai chicken spring rolls.  I seriously spent some time trying to figure out the connection Thai chicken spring rolls might have to France or Senegal, but frankly, I don't think there is a connection. Nevertheless, they were pretty tasty.  For my entree, I had the Niokolokoba, which is grilled sirloin steak marinated with ""Senegalese spices.""  When the dish came out, my coworkers and I pretty much simultaneously said a loud ""whoa!"" because the steak was BIG!  I ate about half of it and was full.  Unfortunately, they overcooked it a bit so it wasn't as great as it could have been.  To end the meal, I was served creme brulee, but the smooth texture to a truly awesome creme brulee was missing.  My coworkers didn't seem to fancy their tart tartine either.  Overall, this is definitely a middle-of-the-bunch restaurant."
4/5/2012,4 star rating,i went here about a week ago for lunch and the food was really good.I had the chawarma (i hope im spelling it right)with fries.. and my friend had the lobster blt with fries which looked good as well..

5/19/2013,4 star rating,Excellent food.  We had the Chicken Tagine and the hanger steak.  Both really good.  Service was excellent.  We went at 8pm on Thursday and it was a little quiet but that suited us nicely.  Dessert and the South African dessert wine was fabulous.
10/5/2013,5 star rating,Second time at this restaurant. Was not disappointed. The first time I said this is somewhere I could take my 10 year old and she was not disappointed. Loved the service The branzino was out of this world. We also had the lamb and a steak dish.  The desserts were excellent. My go to french in the city.
1/29/2013,3 star rating,"Food was great, very busy when I went there on Saturday. Food gets 5 stars. The reason I gave them only three stars was because I had an expired Living Social voucher that is supposed to be valid for 5 years after purchase, it even says the promotional value was valid til 2017 but the manager refused to take it. When contacting Living Social they wanted me to go back again to try to use it. I already spent money on a meal but now have to go back twice in order to use the money I already paid to Living Social. I would go back for the food but did not want to go back because I want to use the voucher. So bad to Ponty Bistro and bad Living Social trying to extort more money out of it's customers by sending them back and forth just to use one voucher. I've had this problem with Living Social in the past with another establishment so I think they are just trying to put one over on the consumer. BEWARE OF LIVING SOCIAL DEALS."
1/18/2012,3 star rating,"Was on our way to try a french restaurant when my gf and I caught a whiff of some good cooking and sure enough it was Ponty Bistro so we stopped, looked at the menu, looked at one another and said why not? It was later in the evening so the place was close to empty. We were sat at a table and quickly had a very nice and knowledgeable waitress who explained the specials in full detail and actually had us sold on the specials! For an appetizer we had the crabcake which was good, nothing great. She had the artichoke special salad which was tasty and delicious. I had the duck special with sweet potato and spinach and ate up EVERY bite! I wish there was more bc I was still hungry after my entree. One thing I didnt like was the server brought our check and I left cash and did not want change back, but it is courteous and respectful to ask if a paying customer would like some change back?! It wasnt our female waitress, but her male co worker who basically jumped in and took our order after she took a couple of minutes explaining the long list of specials! Hence the 3 stars, otherwise it would have gotten 4!!"

9/27/2010,5 star rating,"Taking a stroll thru NY on an early Friday evening, my boyfriend and I passed by this quant, romantic spot to grab a bite to eat. Though half the restaurant was filled and the other tables had reserve seating... the staff was quickly welcoming to sit us down. Little did we know, what a wonderful palate experience we were in for.... from the most amazing artichoke salad to the seabass and stuffed flounder.. heaven is an understatement. I felt like he and I were back in Paris from the cuisines...the chef came out half way thru the course, enough time for us to grab him and give him our praise. He was extremely kind and gave us time to ask him about the restaurant. I would Definitly recommmend this spot."

2/23/2009,4 star rating,"This is a real find. Exceptional unpretentious French/North African food in a neighborhood place. Beef salad excellent as was the steak with a Senegalese sauce as was chicken paillard etc. The Sri Lankan place that formerly occupied this space was good, too but this is better. Full bar and nice wine list."
4/4/2012,5 star rating,"""Parfait,"" I replied when the chef asked me how my meal was--and it was. My steak-- sizzling outside, pink and juicy  inside--was cooked to perfection. In NYC, 'bistro' is sort of a buzzword for pricey, pretentious francophoniness, but in Paris it's like your corner diner, with a mostly predictable menu, but where they get everything right. Know that in France ""right"" doesn't imply ""well prepared,"" it's when food ascends to a ""miam..."" status, like the sauce at Ponty which I can only describe as transcendent. I could say, ""Add a good Bordeaux to the per-glass list,"" but I'm so thoroughly pleased with (and grateful for) this place I abjure all improvements. It's on the other side of the world from me but I will SO be back. PS Service is impeccable."

6/29/2009,4 star rating,"i loved this place - delightful neighborhood restaurant. i'll have to go back for the early bird prix-fixe. friend was in the mood for steak and instead of dropping tons of money at a steakhouse we found this promising place on a google search. the hanger steak was exactly what he wanted. i had the scallops - really really tasty, and i loved the beet and asparagus accompaniments. also got the spring roll and a sauteed spinach side, and when we said no to dessert, they brought us two complimentary chocolate mousses anyway. good martini specials, too! and the chef came out at the end to say hi and see how our meal was - great service and a delicious meal!"
1/24/2011,2 star rating,"Two stars for food, 4 stars for acommodating, friendly service. For food from a chef who has been much touted, I would definitely say it was disappointing. We ordered the mussels in African spices--a mixture of spices that reminded me a bit of Indian curries, except the fire, and flavor was missing. The mussels were extremely fresh, but the broth was rather bland. Even sopping up the sauce with the extra bread and toast the waitstaff provided didn't provide for a flavor punch. My bf and I also tried the fish and chips. The fish was flounder, tender and moist and fresh, but the hard, crispy coating detracted from the texture and somehow did not complement the fish. My bf had mentioned that he had tried the place a few times before and had always been disappointed. He was motivated to try again because of the friendly chef, who actually had spoken to us one night as we had passed by. Remembering his enthusiasm and how gracious the waitstaff were, this is one place that I wish we had a better meal."
3/24/2013,5 star rating,"Super brunch!!! Delicious eggs benedict with amazing hollandaise sauce. Also terrific  eggs and bruchetta dish. The chef kicks the flavor with all of the dishes. We usually go for dinner which is always amazing, especially the crispy tuna appetizer, an all time favorite. The chefs do a great job here because the cuisine has so much flavor, and the food is consistently terrific, which is not an easy thing to achieve in the restaurant business. Always enjoy the mushroom risotto and the steak and seafood dishes too. We will be going back soon! Highly recommend it for diners who want to try cuisine with delicious flavor and variety....and the cool music always creates a great ambiance. Can't wait to take visiting friends and family to Ponty!"
11/28/2009,5 star rating,"At Ponty Bistro the food is superb --I had the seafood risotto, my friends had dibi--a lamb dish, and the red snapper, very fresh the steaks, which were great, and their drinks are kicking, too. The chefs worked for Daniel Boulud and Jean George V. so no wonder they know their way around a kitchen. They recently added a chef's table, which is a big comfortable booth, and we had nice dinner party there.  The African music and good vibes from thechefs and friendly wait staff make it  special, and very reasonably priced!!!"
9/8/2009,5 star rating,"Really fantastic, flavorful cuisine in generous portions at great prices. The two Senegalese chefs have worked at Daniel Restaurant, Mercer Kitchen, Towne and 60 Thompson among other fabulous spots. The value is terrific, and very nice ambiance, too!"
10/20/2012,4 star rating,"OMG what a delish place.  Everything was amazing and absolutely deserves the high ratings on here. We had the shrimp appetizer and it was broiled and seasoned to perfection.  The martinis are amazing and at a 2 for one price makes them doubly good. I had the lamb dinner and again, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Defiantly a place to check out in the City."
10/16/2012,5 star rating,"All the food was delicious! We had a reservation for 5, but they quickly  accommodated us when we became 7 instead. Some of our party sampled the martinis (which are buy 1 get 1!). Like so many others, our table ordered the Moules Africana and we were dying over the sauce. So yummy. The Mac and Cheese app is also delicious. The lamb shank and seafood risotto were also favorites at the table. We enjoyed chocolate mousse, profiteroles and nutella crepes (with a birthday candle!) for dessert. The chef even came out at the end of our meal to say hello to the birthday girl. We were there for a long time and never felt rushed. The place is a little hole in the wall that could feel cramped when full to capacity, but the food and service is great. all in all it was a great night!"

After going, We went four times in one week and started ordering in from there too. We've tried so many things on the menu and are wowed by everything. The Mac and cheese, mussels and fries are honestly the best I've had in the city in 13 years. And the chicken tangine is incredible. It's also cozy and neighborhoody and the service is good and the owner is great. It's a Total gem in my husband and I's book. Go!"

French Toast was a huge portion with lots of fruit and wet nuts, good sized Caesar with chicken in a tasty but not rich dressing, nice scrambled eggs and grilled toast. We were all satisfied and will definitely be back for dinner. Prices are maybe $2-3 too high per dish but totally worth it when compared to other places in the neighborhood that are not half as good."

Love their lunch, their french toast, scrambled bruschetta and shrimp BLT are so....yummmy! But the best of all, last night, I had a craving for spaghetti Bolognese, and asked them if they could make one(its not on the menu). Told them to make it flavourful, with a hint of truffle oil and mushroom, and they came up with the best-tasting spaghetti bolognese I've ever had! It was plate licking good-I finished everything. Too bad I'm not staying in NYC, will cherish the memory of the food I had here all the way from Singapore...."

I went based on a recommendation, with two other friends.  We shared the Crispy Tuna appetizer and also the chicken spring rolls, both were perfect!  I had the Steak Tartare, it was also perfect...I am picky fan of steak tartare and have had it at many bistro restaurants in the city.  I look forward to going in the next couple of weeks and I will have to order the tartare as an appetizer, just so I can try other dishes.  My fellow diners had a veal chop special, another flawless entree...and also the Steak AuPoivre.  Service was perfect and the atmosphere has also wonderful.  Oh... my friends got the 2-for-1 martini's, they truly enjoyed them.  I look forward to going back very soon!"

The chilean sea bass was melting in my mouth, my friend's whole Branzino was so good I offered her to switch dishes with me. Martinis were just the way I like them, not too sweet and very flavorful AND at a great (two for one) price!!! Atmosphere was so relaxing and friendly we didn't want to leave, great service and cute waiters is to blame as well. And of course we all fell in love with a creator of it all, the chef, as he was the funniest  and friendliest chef I had ever met :)"
8/21/2011,4 star rating,"We went to Ponty Bistro on a Saturday night with a group of 3, no reservation. We were seated quickly and professionally. The space is very small, but the staff really helps create an intimate experience. Every person who interacted with us really focused on our table and was engaged, not distracted. I had the sea bass, hubs had the sirloin with Senegalese spices, friend had the filet mignon, and for dessert, we had the profiteroles and the chocolate fondant. Everyone thought their dishes were an 7-9 out of 10, there was also a decent amount of vegetarian options. We did not try any martinis, although the selection was very inventive. Dessert was only okay - relative to the other food it was nothing special. I would definitely come back here again, and also try PB for lunch or brunch. I will say there is not as much African influence as I'd thought there would be - particularly with the specials, but the food was still delicious. Also, there are only 4 or 5 beers on the menu, all fine, but nothing thrilling."
12/26/2011,5 star rating,"Can't get over our delicious dinner at Ponty Bistro.  Gracious, efficient and conscientious service were complemented by very tasty, well-presented and healthy portions. We shared the Croquette De Crab, which was good and the Poulet Yassa and Stuffed Filet Of Flounder, both of which were excellent, very light, and each with its own distinctive flavors."
3/16/2012,4 star rating,This is a very special place.  Small and crowded (make reservations) but special.  I had a delicious scallop dish that had beets and an orange marmalade sauce.  The sauce was better than it sounds; it had just enough sweetness to match the scallops and beets.  My partner had calamari which she said was the freshest she has had in NY.
4/30/2014,5 star rating,"Ponty's Bistro opened up about 5 1/2 years ago in our neighborhood on Third Avenue between E. 18th and E.19th Street. Since then, we have frequented the Bistro at least once a week for either lunch or dinner.  Two things keep  us coming back to the restaurant - the great, tasty food and the friendly and efficient staff and owners. The two owner-chefs, Cisse and Sheck, make it a point to learn the names and preferences of their regular patrons.  The wait staff also is very attentive and remember your likes and dislikes. There is a good variety of dishes on the menu and each night there are specials. Since Cisse and Sheck are from Senegal, many of the spices are African or with a French flavor.  Service sizes are ample and they accommodate special requests. We frequently bring friends to Ponty's and they have never been disappointed. While we consider this our neighborhood place, we are learning that word has spread and many of the patrons come from all over the city to enjoy a delightful meal."

Lobster benedict that is scrumptious, delicious french toast, stellar breakfast potatoes- we just love this place and feel lucky to be in the neighborhood!"
4/3/2011,4 star rating,"We recently celebrated my fiance's birthday here. The restaurant was very accomodating of our large group and the food was fantastic! It was hard to decide what to get on the menu, such a great selection, and everyone was able to order all different things, all of which were so tasty! Also, the two for one martinis were amazing..yummy but potent, my favorite flavor was the french! Everyone enjoyed the meal and had a great time :)"
3/10/2009,5 star rating,"Okay, I'm a big fan.  So let me get that out right up front.  But I am so pleased to see an ever growing crowd for this restaurant.  Grant C is right that the place is not much to look at, which in my mind gives it its charm.  But try it this Spring when the front windows are open and the crowd is bubbling with quiet conversation.  You've got to try the following dishes:  the Moroccan lamb shank is superb, and I cook this quite often so I know how much goes into getting it right; the simple roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables defines well executed comfort food --- it's not just slapping butter and carbs together; I really enjoy the scallops which are always fresh and perfectly cooked, and sit atop beautifully julienned and firm beets; recently introduced was a bouillabaisse to die for; and the steamed mussels are cooked in an exquisite stock --- I wanted to lick my plate.  As I am a regular, and don't drink, the chef made me a virgin ginger martini --- OMG.  Honestly, I find myself swirling food, and now drink, around my mouth trying to figure out what the flavors are.    Still LOVE the place."
2/16/2009,5 star rating,"Talking to the Chef, who recently got a rave review in a local rag, I learned a bit more about what makes the meals here so superb.  He trained under Bolud and Jeans George.  And it shows.  The execution is classic French, but the tastes are a subtle mingling of flavors of the Mediterranean and Africa....I have been there often and have never been disappointed....."
12/18/2008,5 star rating,"This is a gem on 3rd Avenue between 18th and 19th St.  The menu is an excellent combination of French, Mediterranean and African tastes.  But the execution is what makes this cozy little spot such a find.  I highly recommend the calabash soup with its hint of coconut as well as the lamb shanks which literally fall off the bone.  In addition to superbly prepared fare, Bistro Ponty has a nice homey feel.   Always interesting music, as background and not blasting away.  And the wait staff is attentive and pleasant.  I think I have a new favorite place!!!!!"
1/13/2012,2 star rating,"this  place  need  a  real change,   the  night  we  were there  they  seem  understaff,  no  hostesss,  one  server\bartender and  2  busboys,  being  from  france  and  africa myself i  think  this place  beside  adding  some plantains  in  the  plate has  nothing  african nor  french.  the  food  is  ok but  expensive  for  the  quality. i  will  give  a  try  just  for  the  2  for  one  martini."
8/28/2009,4 star rating,"My wife and I have dropped in at Ponty Bistro on 3 occasions now (twice with a mostly well behaved child), and we have been very impressed by the consistency of ingredient quality, professional service, talented preparation, and just the overall dollar value.  With each visit we were greeted and treated warmly (our boy was welcomed with joy) by a delightful waitstaff of 2 or 3, and we appreciated the genuinely gracious face time with the talented chef (owner?).  I understand he previously worked for super-chef Daniel Bolud; but in any case, we've truly been impressed with everything that's come to the table; each dish offering a little flair of unexpected excellence.  We've ordered (Moules Africana, Caeser salad, fried calamari, salmon, croque monsieur, ponty burger, Hangar steak , hand cut fries, lobster club) , AND several terrifically prepared cocktails. I would gladly pay more for this accessibly exotic stuff, yet we hope the friendly pricing stays the same. This little place certainly deserves to survive/ thrive.  Thankfully, the unwelcome TV's from previous visits have been turned off."
