6/12/2022,5 star rating,UPDATED REVIEW June 2022WOW what a difference.  Thankfully they have returned to their former glory.Shrimp have been cooked correctly.  I'm back in love. Now you can be sure that your fish and shrimp will be as expected.  Well worth the wait and price.  Thank you for getting back to regular
7/7/2020,2 star rating,"For the first time in a million years of coming to Famous, I was very disappointed.  Spent $30.00 on way over cooked shrimp.  I think the ""fry guy"" is new and has over estimated the time to cook the shrimp.  He must have cooked the shrimp as long as he cooked the fish,  Big mistake.  Nothing good about them overcooked nuggets that used to be shrimp.  Somebody show him how it is supposed to be done.  Arrived at 7:00 pm and after waiting 50 min til 7:50 they called my number.  Got in the car to head back to the Bronx, and grabbed a shrimp.  Very sad. Look at the photo of the shrimp in the post dated 5/20/20 and the picture of the shrimp in the photo 6/29/20.  The May shrimp is the way it should be.  The June picture i see now, are the ""overcooked"" little nuggets. Come on Famous, we depend on you to get it right."
4/27/2022,4 star rating,Great Place For Fried Seafood. Visit at least 2 times a month more in the summer time. Great place to pick up fried seafood. Wait times can be long depending on day and time of your visit but quality does not suffer.
1/8/2022,4 star rating,"Although it was a freezing day, I got off the subway at 145th St. and saw a few people on the line at the famous fishmarket at 11:45 AM on Saturday. I went over and realized that they were opening in 15 minutes, so I decided to wait. I asked the person in front of me, is it worth the wait? She said yes so I got in line despite the freezing cold. I ended up being the third person when they opened. This is definitely one of the important institutions in the neighborhood. I tried the fish, shrimp's, clam combo and was not disappointed. I'm sure I'll be back."
2/11/2022,5 star rating,"Great food for a great price.  Well worth the wait on line!  Tasty, light, and not overly greasy at all!  I love the shrimp and fish platter!!"
2/12/2022,3 star rating,"I don't come here often, but I do come here a few times a year. The food is great, no complaints for the food quality or anything. My only gripe is the wait time. Be prepared to stabf outside for at least 30 minutes waiting on your food. One time i was waiting for over an hour, of course i was late to work that day, which isn't a good practice.  Needless to say that I don't come if it's raining, snowing, cold, too hot, etc. I don't particularly care to comment on the customer service as I don't find a comment relevant for this type of establishment. Just be prepared for extremely long wait times.  If you can get passed the wait times, then you will most likely enjoy your meal."
6/29/2020,4 star rating,This is my place to go for fried shrimp in the neighborhood. Their shrimp and chips are amazing. Don't know what is the secret but the shrimp have a sweet taste that is just great. Always fried to order. Each order includes 2 slices of whole wheat bread. Absolutely recommend it.
3/11/2022,1 star rating,They sell frozen fish better off going to Devins fish and chips where the fish is actually fresh
1/13/2022,4 star rating,While I love the fish here and have for many years ...the wait is ridiculous.  Don't come starving bc You will pass out before you get your food.  But....if you can hold out.... it is definitely worth the wait!
2/26/2021,2 star rating,"DoorDash/Seamless receives precedence over orders made from Harlemites that have supported the business since its inception. That's a major issue. You can expect to wait over 2hrs in the cold for your order on a Friday evening while they prioritize DoorDash orders whose transporters haven't yet arrived. I strongly encourage the establishment to formulate a system that doesn't neglect the same community that has been here before the existence of DoorDash ""gentrifiers"". Perhaps a system where the DoorDash orders aren't made until their transporters arrive so that those who've placed orders in-person can be on their way and back to support them again another day. DoorDash/Seamless should also offer their transporters a bonus for accepting orders at this establishment for the additional time it will demand. I strongly dislike having to rank a business that I love to support so low because I do enjoy the food. However, their approach to satisfying orders requires necessary reform and they must know that since vocalizing it to them alone, isn't enough."
4/20/2021,2 star rating,So I have been going to this spot since I was a child and have loved their food. However I ordered fish and shrimp last week and it was not as good as it was in the past. I was really disappointed. I will not order from here again. Plus the food was already prepeared and not cooked in front of you as they used to do in the past. If they continue to do this they will lose customers.
8/1/2021,5 star rating,Been coming here for years. Like 10 years. Fried fish and shrimp is my favorite thing ever and I've never been disappointed. Seasoned and fried perfectly. The line outside speaks to the opinions of many. Love it!
5/20/2020,5 star rating,"Good whiting in Harlem, they do not serve catfish. I repeat, no catfish!The whiting is very thick and is incased in a light batter but the batter has no seasoning what so ever. Their fries are not good. They have no salt, no taste and aren't crispy. It's not fish and chips, it's fish and sogs so just stick with all fish or all anything without fries."
6/9/2021,4 star rating,"Must stop every time I'm in Harlem, for the past 15+ years. Small inside, line down the block sometimes."
5/20/2021,4 star rating,"Great fried fish spot in Harlem. I've noticed that the longest wait for food tends to be during standard dinner time so I try to avoid going there then. But if my craving is strong enough I will go anyway because the food is worth it. On a recent visit, I noticed that something was different about seasoning of the shrimp. Since I've been going there for years, I pretty much know what to expect as far as taste goes and it tasted like something was missing. Maybe it was just that day. I normally get fish, shrimp, and chips which comes with a free drink, or I'll get fish and chips. I love that they add two slices of bread because I can make a fish sandwich. They're generous with the condiments and the food portions. One of my favorite places to eat from in the city."
9/28/2020,3 star rating,"Currently not taking call in orders 9/2020. If you don't have time to wait more than 30mins, then you won't want to go here. Took 45mins to receive my order (shrimp, fish, clam and fries combo abt $19). The shrimp and clams were tasty but I do not care much for their fish or oiled down unsalted fries."
12/16/2019,5 star rating,"Pretty much my Go-To Harlem (or any place else) fried fish spot. Have traveled from the ends of the island and all points in between JUST for this fresh, fried bite of seafood heaven. ALWAYS fresh! I can count on them and measure other spots accordingly. Not too many others make the cut so we keep coming back.The lines are long FOR a REASON! Don't be discouraged. Also, have had a number of parking tickets cause it is sparse. Part of being a NYer. Been going OVER 20 years and it has remained constant! No frills just goodness. Staples are Whiting & Shrimp with Fries. Side of Tarter, Ketchup & hot sauce. Always get the bread, it is basic but soft and needed for a Fried Whiting sandwich."
5/18/2021,5 star rating,Ive always come here for their food. This was my first time ordering thru Yelp to order. When i got there it was a bit of a wait and confusion. The apologized profusely and gave me extra fish. Other than that this place is consistent when it comes to their food. Never disappoints. One of the few places for fried fish or shrimp and dont need any type of condiments
4/24/2021,5 star rating,This place is always busy. Be ready for a bit of a wait but the food is worth it. Always good. Never disappoints. Rely on the same great taste every time
11/3/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food very good made how i like and the shrimp didn't taste as if it was dipped in breadcrumb so amazing i recommend
1/5/2020,4 star rating,"No frills take out only spot for some of the best seafood in the neighborhood!Prices are very reasonable for the food quality and portions. So far, I've tried the fish and chips and fried clams and chips. I love that both are made to order and freshly fried. By the time I sit down to eat, my food is still hot and fresh! Tartar sauce, hot sauce and ketchup are on the counter to serve yourself. LOVE tartar sauce so this is great for me. Staff is nice and food comes quick. Can't wait to come again!"
9/8/2021,1 star rating,Horrible customer service from the old lady in the front. This is a money hungry establishment and their food isn't even as good as it was years ago.
3/13/2021,3 star rating,Fish is slamming but they are extremely slow and that's why they get 3 stars. Shouldn't take 45 minutes to get a fish sandwich. Get an extra fryer or something!!!
2/20/2020,4 star rating,I love this go to spot for some fish. Coming from the south and moving up to New York it is hard to find a good piece of fried fish. But this location has it down packed its very flavorful and crispy. They also keep it old school but adding bread to it which is the perfect touch for me. When there isn't a line wrapped around the door  it doesn't take long to get your food . The guys that fry the fish are funny so catch a good laugh if you have to wait.
5/2/2017,4 star rating,"If you've never been here then you're stup...err, I mean you're missing out. But maybe it's better that way because nobody needs you taking up space on a usually very long line. The beautiful part is that the line actually moves along pretty quickly, especially when you consider the type of demand that this literal hole in the wall handles.  Use your waiting time to decide on your order and be careful going down the steps.Your menu choices are pretty much limited to a variation of fish, shrimp, fries, seafood sandwiches and whatever else is on the menu because this is what I always order.  Service is amicable and to the point.  Food arrives hot and flavorful, but don't forget to ask for whatever sauces on (or on the side) that you'd like.Cash is king here so dont bring your cards. Takeout is the name of the game; place is clean but lacks a restroom (minus the star).  Beware coming after the church crowds arrive because they order in clumps. Whatever the wait, you will leave happy with a seafood bag of treasure to have."
1/30/2019,3 star rating,"The fish here is just decent, nothing out of this world about it but somehow they always have a line out the door. Then again there's only enough space for about 5 people to stand in there anyways so a ""line out the door"" is pretty much a given if they have loyal customers...which they definitely do. The fish here is fried with a light batter which I like but I do think they need to use more seasoning. I didn't really taste much except a little salt and pepper but I appreciate how everything is fried fresh. The chips were not crispy so they definitely should have fried those longer than they were.If you just happen to be in the area and don't mind the wait, try it out but otherwise there are definitely better options for fish and chips."
3/1/2019,3 star rating,"The service here gets worse each time I come now. If the fish wasn't so good, I wouldn't come back. Don't let another fish spot open up...I'm out!This has to be the best fish joint and Hamilton Heights. The finish is always fried to perfection and takes the same every time you order it. The old man that owns the joint reminds me of the soup Nazi. He is mild manneredAnd not over nice. But damn is the fish so good.::"

11/30/2020,4 star rating,"Fresh food and made to order. They are definitely following all of the protocols for Covid, as only one person is allowed to go inside to place your order and then you wait outside to pick up. I ordered the shrimp, fish and chips combo. The shrimp were great but the fish really didn't have much seasoning on it. I was underwhelmed by that. Overall it was OK, but I don't think this is someplace I will be running back to."
2/27/2019,4 star rating,"The fish is freshly fried and always tasty. The staff are pleasant. Place is good to grab something and go. I usually get the fish and chips, and I'm never disappointed.Pro:  pleasant staff, reasonable prices, clean Con: long line( but that just means the food is good), small waiting area, no seatingI'm a regular at this place definitely recommend it, just be prepared to wait."
7/7/2021,3 star rating,Surprisingly good and cheap fish and chips at this tiny hole in the wall. There's a reason it's outlasted a lot of the other fish and chips shops around it.
8/29/2019,5 star rating,"My fellow foodie John S. scheduled a New York food tour for me and two other buddies.  Famous Fish Market was our first stop.  John had brought me here on our last trip to NY and I was happy to be headed there again.  Famous Fish Market is take out only and I would say about six people can fit inside the building comfortably.  It's NY so finding a parking spot may be a little difficult but John showed me how double parking is done.  My last visit I had clams, fish and shrimp with french fries and it was delicious.  This visit I ordered shrimp and fries because I knew we had more stops ahead.  The shrimp was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly the french fries were the tasty seasoned ones.  The platter had plenty of shrimp and they were a nice size.  I tasted a piece of fish from my buddies platter and it was delicious.  Famous Fish Market you have a new fan!"
2/28/2019,4 star rating,"It's literally a hole in the wall and takeout only (no place to sit and the space can only fit about 8 people at a time). However, it's some of the best fish I've ever had in Harlem. When it's warm out expect the line to be out the door and stretched down the street. Even on a cold day you might have to wait outside the door until someone inside has their food and exited. Be patient as the food is truly worth it. I've never had a bad experience with any of the employees there unlike some of the reviewers have stated here. I was greeted everytime I ordered and also was greeted after I left. Always have cash on you because sometimes their card machine isn't working. Black owned so definitely support!"
10/19/2019,5 star rating,"Back in Harlem again,& had to stop at my favorite fish joint. Had the All-Fish, which comes with 2 slices of whole wheat bread. The 2 slices don't stand a chance against all that fish. You literally can get 2 maybe 2 1/2 fish sandwiches out of The All Fish.my wife decided to have the Fish and Chips she could only finish half of her order, kept asking me to eat some of these fries...I couldn't help her ,I'm trying to finish mine. As usual it was all so delicious and well seasoned. We also had a cup of SWEET TEA & LEMONADE. When I say SWEET,I mean SWEET. If you're a diabetic,I advise you to govern yourself accordingly. You can't go wrong with any of the food here. Now, one more thing there is no parking area just Street parking,however  cars were double and even triple parking,and Today I saw New York's Finest rolling up in their MARKED CARS & were writing tickets to occupied  vehicles and putting them on the windshield of said vehicle,I saw one lady coming out with her order and the officer handed her a ticket. So if you're going to order leave an adult in the vehicle (preferably a license driver). I was told by the officer he was just looking for unoccupied vehicles double parked today. So heed the warning."
9/3/2019,5 star rating,"I haven't been to this place in 8 years, the fish still fresh and delicious. Located on St. Nicholas ave and 145st. The fish is made to order so it's piping hot.Now they have 1 person who takes the order and money,and the other end of the counter  someone else prepares your order. This joint has been a fixture in Harlem for years. No tables,no benches no chairs. Just order, pickup and get out. They also have sweet tea & lemonade, not forgetting the various sodas. If you drive bring someone to sit in car, The Transit police double and sometimes triple park. So there's hardly any parking spots if any. Also saw traffic enforcement booting cars. So it a hassle to get this seafood,but well worth it."
7/20/2019,5 star rating,"This is well run machine of a place with friggin awesome food periodt!  First of all kudos to their great, respectful & helpful staff.  Secondly omg yummy grub!  The fish, shrimp, clams and chips were seasoned so well but so lightly because I'm assuming they understand some people can't have overly salty foods.  The shrimp has a tad bit of sweetness to it too, so good.  They give you everything you need on the counter like lemon juice, salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, tartar sauce, hot sauce plus to go sized condiments.  You can't eat inside but who cares, take your food to the car or home and go in like a savage.  They do accept most or all credit/debit cards and please bring a few dollars to put in their tip jar because they will earn it.  I can't wait to go back!"
8/5/2020,4 star rating,"I got lucky on a weekday afternoon - no line!  Ordered fried shrimp, which came with two slices of wheat bread which was nice and soft.  Very good shrimp!  Will return to try the fried clams or whiting.  No catfish!"
9/2/2018,4 star rating,"This place was pleasantly good. Probably will come back if craving fried fish. Literally looking like a hole in the wall, this lil joint is a good bang for its buck. 7 dollar fish n chips. (This ain't no British style fish n chip)With a little tartar sauce and hot sauce, this brought me home. The food:Cons:-fries could have been crispier. (It's those fake fries with the potato flavor. But the good potato flavor...)-wish there was at least a bar to stand and eat (maybe outside? Three def isn't any space inside...)Pros:- Hot. Fresh fried. Fish. Batter wasn't too overwhelming. Fish wasn't too fishy. Good overall balance.Other:Cons:- looks like they need to upgrade to a bigger space. People were confused about ordering and waiting. But they seem to generally get things rolling without a problem.Pros:- simple menu- they stick to what they know and what they're good at"

6/8/2020,1 star rating,I was told dood things about this place and was excited to try the food. I found the fish and shrimp to be tasteless. I had to practically beg to get tartar sauce. Lastly the cashier and the guy putting the food together was very rude.  Note: I visited this establishment in February before the pandemic began.
10/1/2020,5 star rating,I went to this establishment because co workers was deciding what to eat so it's a plus this is a black owned establishment The food is excellent fresh and very well potions Staff took the order and was very friendly and welcoming I will be coming back more often
5/30/2018,5 star rating,This place was just how it was described as small but straight to the point!!made fresh right in front of you and you get lots of it ..my daughter and I got to fish and shrimp with fries combo it was too much for us to eat I wish we would've shared one because I hate to waste food staff is nice and friendly and is very accommodating to get you out quick with your good crispy tasty shrimp/fish comes w/tarter sauce and hot sauce this place is a TRUE gem in Harlem !
3/17/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious every single time. I always get the fish and shrimp with extra tartar sauce. There's always a long line but it's worth the wait.
3/1/2021,3 star rating,"The food is great , but the wait is awful. They says 30 mins, which usually mean an hour or more."
8/17/2018,4 star rating,Long wait.Big portion of fish and fries though especially for the cost. Generous condiments + bread.
3/27/2018,4 star rating,"There is often a line out the door, but with good reason. The fried fish is very good, so are the fries. I had the shrimp once, prefer the fish. Luckily they have combos so you can try a bit of everything! YAY!!!!! This is a take-out place. So walk south past 141st to St. Nicholas park to enjoy your  fried seafood picnic!"
6/16/2019,5 star rating,I would eat this everyday if I didn't think of the 30lbs I'd put on. I love this place!!!!- Cheap - ALOT of food - Wait can tend get a little long but it's worth itI usually get the fish & shrimp with fries & it does not disappoint. Highly recommend getting it with the hot & tartar sauce. They need to open location in Brooklyn.
6/30/2020,5 star rating,I miss this place so much! Their fish is so good and well seasoned! During my undergrad years at City College I would always get a fish and chips meal before getting on the subway!
5/1/2017,5 star rating,"There will be a line and it will be, perhaps inexplicably slow (like really if you pretty much make one thing, just keep making it as long as there's a line, everyone is just going to get more less the same thing), but at the end of that line will be some of the finest fried fish you've ever had. I got the fish sandwich and whatever combo of spices they use, they need to keep it a secret because if someone could make it faster they'd be printing money.The fish sandwich is really stuffed to the gills (heh) with fish and isn't a bad deal. Next time I'll try the shrimp/clam strips."
12/28/2019,1 star rating,Let me first day I've been coming to this family run business since 1980.. when whom I recalled was the wonderful woman who made and sold the fried fish with her familyThe food here now is very very differentFirst it's not fresh fish.. it's from frozen whiting blocks.. no vendor in New York will sell a filet of fish that is not cut flat and straight so when you cook it you get a flat piece of fish ;if you notice when you eat at this place the fish is always curved that happened in the thawing process from being frozen in blocks wrapped around each other if there's nothing more this is the biggest proof that this fish is not fresh but comes from a frozen situation. that being said it's thick it's spongy sometimes it's just not a good filet if you're old enough to remember what a fillet looks like.. you cannot go to the fish store and find the filet of fish uncooked that is not flat . if you want the original epic Harlem fried fish I suggest you walked a few blocks uptown to a place named devlin's fish on saint Nicholas avenue
12/12/2020,3 star rating,they give you a lot of fish and its seasoned well.  the only thing with me is I'm big on customer service and depending on who you are dealing with its a hit or miss on attitude.  this would never stop me from going back though if I'm in the mood.
12/9/2019,5 star rating,The food is excellent I had the fried fish and Mac and cheese nice portion too and friendly
9/9/2019,1 star rating,"Don't waste your money. The fish is a mix of whatever, overcooked, and dripping with oil that is a bad taste. I have no clue why there is ever a line other than these people have never tasted what fish and chips SHOULD be."
9/13/2015,1 star rating,I love a good fish and chip spot. This is not one of them. Everything is way too oily and most of the mixed fish tastes horrible. I have no idea why there is a line at any given time other than it proves many Americans have zero taste. Anytime you have to drench your food with that much sauce it can't be good and definitely isn't healthy.
8/26/2019,4 star rating,"Food was on point. They have a great cycle going regarding the order/pickup line. Food portions are abundant. The only snub was when the server took away the added piece of fish because he was unsure if I was a Giants fan. Heck no, bird gang all day!"
9/17/2016,5 star rating,"From my days walking from Columbia University to this fish spot not a thing has changed. They continue to have the best succulent, freshly fried fish. On my most recent visit I pondered and asked myself what is the secret? To begin they must really have a good company who supplies fresh daily fish. This fish is on par and ever better than places I have been to in Cape cod... Well you know the rest. As I watched them prepare my fish ( I like all fish so I can devour it on my ride back over the Brooklyn bridge) it occurred to me it's in the spices. FYI you have to try the counter spices.. Why cause my taste buds said soEnjoy"
11/13/2019,2 star rating,I kept hearing about this fish place. Just moved to Harlem from Brooklyn and this is not nothing to brag home about. Small place smells so good inside. Was praying it would taste as good as it smelled but it didn't.
11/3/2020,5 star rating,"never a disappointment!!! fresh ,well seasoned nice crispy texture and decently priced worth evey penny!!! staff is extremely friendly!!!"
6/9/2020,1 star rating,"I grew up down the hill from this place and I've always loved their food and even their service. However today the service was absolutely deplorable and I traveled from another borough to come here. There was a short darker skinned women with outrageous eyelashes taking the orders. We both have masks on and are clearly having a hard time hearing one another. When I had to change a portion of my order she became irate and hufand puffed loudly. She said ""that's why I asked you that before and now I have to erase it"" I had no idea it was that difficult to erase or make a change for which I apologized for. When she turned around to make my drinks she said to her co worker ""I need to go for a fucking walk before I slap the shit out of somebody"" I didn't respond because during this obvious tough time for black people I don't want to add to any unnecessary black divide. I've never been treated so poorly at this restaurant and I hope that management pays attention to this poor customer service. The incident started on Tuesday June 9, 2020 at 5:45 PM."
8/5/2019,5 star rating,I absolutely loooooove this place. Every time I go to visit every single time I go to Harlem to see my granny. Never disappoints!!!!
8/6/2019,5 star rating,Been coming here for over 15 years. The fish is always fresh and fried to perfection. People are always nice. A smile goes along way.The prices are reasonable. This is the best fried shrimp and fish spot in Harlem.  In the summer time the line is always down the block. But nevertheless it's always worth the wait.
9/30/2020,2 star rating,Can not Order over phone super long lines just doesn't make sense good food when you can get it just no accommodations
5/3/2020,2 star rating,Im going to get right to the point. This place Get worse and worse everytime I go. Fish is flavorless and you already know the Mac and Cheese has no flavor at all. The Greens and String Bean was good. I will most likely never go here again its just a waste of calories.
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Been coming here since I was a kid. I think its the best fish and chips in town. The food is delicious and their service is consistent. On certain days there can be a long wait...sometimes the line is out the door and down the block, but trust me its worth the wait."
9/18/2020,4 star rating,"This is my number two spot for fish/shrimp combo they have been around forever, they know what they are doing.  Worth the wait and the money delicious!!!"
11/2/2020,4 star rating,"The seafood at this little spot is amazing. The fish and shrimp are seasoned to perfection. The portions were once larger but you still get enough. I rate the seafood a 5. The 4 score is due to the service TODAY. I say TODAY because Maybe  because of Covid,  the service was inconsiderate and lacking.  I had 3 separate orders and paid for 3 separate orders--simple right? Nah. What happens next is a joke without a punchline. After placing my orders and receiving 3 separate receipts, I went outside to wait and listen for my numbers to be called.  I heard them call my first order. I entered and told them that i also have 2 additional orders. They looked puzzled as if it one person had never placed 3 separate orders before. So they tell me that I will have to wait because of the ""clams"". So i stepped back outside to wait. Now from my little vantage point, I watched the cook open a little bag of pre-battered clams and dropped them in hot oil--3 min tops. However 15 min later they call all three orders. I re-enter and they ask for my receipts and then hand me three bags. Wtf. I asked what was in each bag and they shrugged their shoulders. I had to open and unwrap each order to ensure that I would deliver it to the correct recipient. I explained to them that they should consider that the purpose of placing 3 separate orders is because each order could be for a different person and going to 3 different locations. Do you know what was the response? The guy said, ""maybe you should just pick up each order when they are called"". (I didn't want to remind him that he only called me once before the final time.) I checked for the hot sauce and tartar sauce and after unwrapping and then re- wrapping the orders i drove home. When I  finally opened my bag, I found no hot sauce and tartar sauce. I guess that while doing my check at the store, I didn't spot the missing condiments in MY bag. I was going to leave it alone but then no, it's best to tell a business when things don't go right. When i called to tell them about my experience the woman who answered the phone seemed unbothered. In the midst of my explaining the matter she was talking with people. She then returned her attention to me and asked if i wanted to come back and get the condiments. Again, WTF. No. I live wayyyy down town. I was in the area for a wake. I don't want to come back to get it, i want y'all to pay attention and give it to me before I leave your business. Yes  i know i know, mistakes happen but how about better customer service? How about better communication between the cashier and the runner/order taker or whoever it is that is telling the cook and the person wrapping up the food. The place is tiny. Y'all are practically standing side by side. Why can't the cashier just say, orders 2,3 and 4 are for one person, 3 separate bags and place each order ticket in each bag. Periodt. Yes. Great tasting fish. I would certainly return. However, i will NOT confuse them again. 1 order only."

10/6/2017,5 star rating,"NO FRILLS!  GREAT FOOD!  They keep it simple here, fish, shrimp & fries.  There's usually a line out the door and down the street at dinner time but it's worth the wait. You step in and move to the right and step forward to the counter and place your order. They prepare your food and put it in front of you for DIY seasoning (salt & pepper) and sauces (hot sauce, lemon juice, tartar, ketchup).  Once your done, they wrap it up and you pay and your out the door to enjoy your golden fried goodness."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,"I have been coming to this place for 6 plus years and never have I been disappointed. I live in Long Island, NY and when I get a craving for this spot I make that trek to Harlem with no regrets. The shrimp and fish SMOTHERED in that tartar sauce they have .. PURE BLISS. P.s. please open another location, preferably in Queens so I can eat there everyday :)"
7/25/2019,5 star rating,"Some of the best seafood I've ever had, this is a high compliment bc I'm from the coastal south and we KNOW seafood. I try to come whenever I'm in town. Also they move quickly, I like that."
9/22/2017,3 star rating,"Hole in the wall, neighborhood fried seafood spot. I ordered the fried shrimp as I never been here before and I thought it would be a good starter item. Dude behind the counter had mad attitude, but he's probably used to dealing with bums all day. The shrimp were fried well. I like the light batter. I just wish they added some Old Bay or something. There was like no seasoning."
9/14/2019,5 star rating,"Grest fried fish and reasonably priced. I also like the fried chicken, mac and cheese, and potato salad. I'm never disappointed here."
2/23/2019,2 star rating,"I had a craving for fried shrimp and after searching online for the best spot, I traveled from NJ to satisfy my craving.  Well I have to say that the meal was a big disappointment!  The shrimp were small and almost looked and tasted like popcorn shrimp (cheap). It you are looking for big, juicy full-sized shrimp this is NOT the place.  Also the shrimp were bland with no taste or seasoning.  The fries were oily and limp. On a good note, the staff was very friendly and polite.  However, for me the food left much to be desired."
1/24/2019,5 star rating,"This is the best fried fish and shrimp in town! It's all in the batter, which they have perfected. I usually get the fish and shrimp combo (with fries) and I think it's very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. There is usually a long line (typically out the door), but that's a good thing right?! If you're ever in Harlem and have the taste for fish and chips, Famous is your place!"
7/4/2020,5 star rating,Hey Famous Fish is open and serving up the fish and shrimps until 10:00 PM July 4.  The fish is great come on down and try some
7/22/2019,5 star rating,Excellent food recommend it to anyone fish and chips combo with shrimp is my favorite
7/18/2019,5 star rating,Best fried fish in Harlem been coming here for over a decade. I've never been disappointed it's truly worth the long line and travel time it takes me to get there and back home to the BX. I really wish there was more than one location but I understand why the owner chose quality over quantity. Franchises aren't always easy to control and if not done right can truly ruin your brand.
5/22/2019,5 star rating,"Food is great, and there is a bit of a wait, but its worth it. If you're in the area and need good real seafood (aka not in the mood for the regular fast food) then look for this place. Im not even the biggest seafood fan and I still crave the food from this place when I'm not in the area."
5/19/2017,2 star rating,"The service was very nice but I was disappointed with the fish and chips.  It was nothing like we get in London.  The fish was not light and delicate.  The colour was not a lovely golden as it should be.  It was, however, only describable as khaki (that of khaki pants).I write this review so that if you go don't expect a proper fish and chips experience."
11/29/2018,5 star rating,The best fish spot in Harlem. Period. I'm forced to type more so that I can actually publish this lol
12/18/2019,5 star rating,Really nice staff. Always welcoming. They give you samples when you walk in the door and the food is always good. You really can't go wrong with this Harlem staple.
9/10/2018,1 star rating,"Customer service at this place is horrible. The lady that serves the food barely makes eye contact with you. She threw two pieces of wheat bread on top of my shrimps, wrapped it up and never looked up, like she did me a favor. Fresh fish should not smell funny after a few hours in the refrigerator. You better eat the fish as soon as it's done because it's not that fresh. If you try to save some for later you'll notice it has a foul smell and taste to it when you go back to eat some later. That should not happen with fresh food, especially seafood. The seasoning is bland and flavorless. I found this place back in the early 1990's when it was a real hole in the wall and the fish tasted much better back then. It's still a hole in the wall, just slightly more organized than back then. You can get better fish and better customer service from a lot of other places in Harlem."
7/7/2017,3 star rating,"So, before I begin, a little background on myself. I am a Midwesterner who had been raised on freshwater fried fish all my life. So maybe I'm being biased when I say that I believe catfish, bluegill, and bass are generally superior to several varieties of saltwater fish. Now the fish they fry up at this place is whitefish, and they leave the skin on. This gives the fish a rather super fishy taste. It just doesn't have the clean taste that I look for in fish. However, I still have a hard time complaining since it was so cheap, and the fries were good. It truly is a hole in the wall, but it's hard to beat on a night when you can't be bothered to go anywhere after a hard day. I like that they let you put sauce on your food yourself before packaging it. The workers there are nice, and they get the food out at a fairly quick pace. I would go here again if I was in a pinch."
3/9/2019,4 star rating,Fish & shrimp is amazing  definitely worth 6-8 dollars. The market itself is so small so usually you'll be having to wait outside until you're next in line to order your food but it's worth the wait. Food is so good there's always a long line but I definitely recommend this place
8/2/2018,1 star rating,Traveled all the way uptown to a place that closed 30 mins before the time that was posted. Totally false advertisement and lack of customer service in the community. So sad.. there were several people waiting outside while refusing service to those who are a big part in keeping you business afloat. ‍
12/21/2013,4 star rating,"Famous Fish is a place that is tucked away so well that you would probably pass right by it if there wasn't a line coming out of its inconspicuous door.The experience is simple: Southern US style fried seafood and fries done right. No frills. No themes. No seats.You wait on line, you come in, you order, you pay, you wait. The food is up and staring you down on the counter, you add your condiments, you nod, they wrap it up, and you are out the door. Lost once you get in? Don't worry, someone is bound to tell you what you're supposed to do. It's actually a little reminiscent of the Soup Nazi.. but with nice people behind the counter. They won't yell ""No fish for you!"" if you get it wrong.The fish and shrimp combo is deal breaker here: Freshly battered catfish and large, cleaned shrimp. The fries as an add on is so cheap, it would be a waste not to do it. The entire order, flanked between whole bread slices is enough to feed you for hours to come."
8/6/2014,4 star rating,"Definitely a fan! I usually go for the fish and chips or all fish. They give you whole wheat bread with either order and there are plenty of condiments (either you can put them on their or they have small containers to bring with you). I usually put hot sauce and tartar sauce on my fish-yum!The place is tiny and can get pretty uncomfortable if there are a lot of people waiting. If there is a line that touches the door I opt out of going. It can take awhile if they don't have any more fish fried-  so be prepared to wait a good amount of the times you go. Usually the servers are friendly and put pride into what they do. Only one time didI have someone doing a little too much flirting for my liking. Made me not want to go back for awhile. Overall, it's a good spot!"
4/4/2016,5 star rating,The best fish and shrimp I've ever had outside of my grandmothers. So fresh. So delicious. I'm craving this like a fat kid craves cake. Big portions for a great price. You'll probably have to wait 10/15 minutes but it's so worth it.
8/10/2016,5 star rating,Love this place good fish not saturated and oil and extra seasoning like other soulGood spots in the area plus this been around for a minute can't go wrong
7/29/2014,4 star rating,"I'm definitely a fan of the food! Fish, Chips and the Shrimp are absolutely delicious! I remember when I lived right down the street from this place. Rain or shine, sleet or snow there was always a line packed with their loyal customers me included. The only downfall of this place is that it's literally a tiny hole in the wall and doesn't hold many people so good luck if you have a stroller or a wheelchair!"
4/29/2014,3 star rating,"So I walk in and boy is the place small. But it's a hole in the wall that serves pretty good food. The cashiers were very nice. One young man packing the food while the young girl handled the cashier. I got the fish and chips $7. The fish was pretty good. It had a very strong taste of black pepper. And To be precise, the fish was 85% crispy. The fries were a little soggy and cold :(.. Which deducted a star. Oh And you get two slices of brown bread. Oh btw I don't think I would  recommend the all shrimp, it's $9.75 and you only get a small hand full. ONE MORE THING!! If you get it to go, check your bag if there is tartar sauce. Because that's a fried fish's best friend!! I GOT NO TARTAR SAUCE :'( even though I specified I wanted all the sauces... Instead I got the non spicy! sour! Supposedly hot sauce and packs of ketchup....no bueno and that's why they are getting a star deducted!!"
12/24/2015,1 star rating,"This review is based on the customer service I received from an employee named B (or D) , I was so disgusted with what I experienced that I didn't even get to try the food!It was Christmas Eve and I happened to be in the Harlem area, so I was calling around to see if any seafood stores were open. I had a couple people answer the phone just to tell me they were closed. So when I called FAMOUS FISH MARKET I politely asked ""are you open?"" And the response I got from B was ""of course"" in a disgusting attitude. I then went to ask ""till when are you open?"" And she hung up on me! It was highly unprofessional and it represents the business in a negative light!And just because of that experience I will never try FAMOUS FISH MARKET! I work with customers on an everyday basis and I understand the importance of good customer service. Your products or services may be amazing but if your customer service is not up to par then it does not matter."
8/3/2018,5 star rating,This place has excellent food and great customer service. I would say that it hasn't changed since my first experience.  But it has....and in a great way. They have completed some renovations and changed the overall shack look. The screen door is gone honey!!!!!
8/28/2017,1 star rating,"One day i stopped by to get an order of fish and saw someone delivering boxes of fish and on the outside it said fish from china big as day on the box , i also noticed the change in the taste of the fish from tge way it used to be when it was fresh fish , my last visit there gave me suspicions that it wasnt fresh fish because the fish had soft spots as if it was spoiled so i just threw it all away . im so disappointed because this was once a great place to eat until they started purchasing fish from china . so i will not return until that fresh fish returns i would like to live a little longer by knowing my intake of foods helps ."
8/22/2015,4 star rating,"I came here in the pouring rain. The fish and shrimp combo was great. I was scared because the space was so small and cramped, but everything was very organized for such a small space.If you're in Harlem and want fish, this is the place to be."
7/28/2015,4 star rating,"Famous Fish Market will set you right.  There is nothing better than some good/fresh fried fish, shrimp, chips (fries) with a side of white bread on a Summer Sunday afternoon.  Located near on St Nicholas & 145th this location can be very easily missed, so here's the skinny:There will be a line of people waiting, which are usually patrons whom have already ordered waiting for their items to come up.Order at the counter and wait outside because this place is really small and it is basically a counter pick up.Listen carefully as you might miss your order, so this is why many are standing near the entrance way.Eat and repeat."
7/26/2018,4 star rating,"This place is a hole in the wall, but very good. If you like fried fish, shrimp, clams and fries this is your spot. I went out of my way twice to come here in one week. A friend of mine told me about it, but I remember it when I was growing up and visiting Harlem."
9/2/2015,4 star rating,"Ah, the Famous Fish Market of Harlem. I enjoyed this spot on many occasions while I was studying in CCNY a few blocks away. FFM is perhaps, in my opinion, the best fish and chips spot in Harlem. This place is LITERALLY a hole-in-the-wall. You'll never believe how often we used to walk by this place before actually discovering it for what it was worth. But this place is a no frills,  no games place and I like that. They only offer three things. Fish. Shrimp. Or both. That's it. Straight and to the point. This is one of those places that doesn't act like they have 50 dishes that they get right. There is barely any standing room, so place your order and if you get claustrophobic easily, wait outside.If you're not ordering the combo, your meal will come with french fries and, if you agree to it, bread (not Arnold's or Pepperidge Farm but some low quality bread which is still fitting in a sense for where Harlem used to be just a few years back - it just works). The tartar sauce is quite remarkable and when you pair it with hot sauce, you need nothing else. They have a bunch of other stuff sitting on the counter like lemon juice, salt, pepper, the whole nine yards to sprinkle and shake stuff onto your meal prior to eating.-1 star because without all the food additions like tartar sauce, etc. the batter of the fish and shrimp isn't memorable. Au contrair, the meal is quite fishy without everything. Which leads me to believe that FFM can improve in one spot and that is adding some flavor to the batter itself to help reduce the fishy smell/taste of the meat in case someone wants to taste it for what it's worth before drizzling it with tartar and other sauces.Overall, this spot is a must try. This place has been here for years and there is no secret as to why. If a hole-in-the-wall can survive years of Manhattan-priced rent, you know business is good. And if it's a restaurant, you know the food MUST be good."
9/8/2018,5 star rating,The fish and shrimp was good. The fish is seasoned with pepper before frying. I put hot sauce and tartar on my fish. I just put tartar on my shrimp. The place looks very clean and there was no line. I went on a Thursday in the summer time. I will say this place is way better then Devin's down the block if you are going to Devin's run back to this place. I would rate Devin's as a 1.

7/26/2019,4 star rating,"While I love this establishment, they need to be more mindful of cleanliness.

I loved the place then, still love the place now. Their fried fish & shrimp are fried perfectly every time. They have a select menu of items they make, and make them extremely well. Come here for fish & chips, or fill up on a combo, just know that you won't be disappointed. Note their 1/2 &1/2 lemonade ice tea is VERY sweet lol"
6/16/2015,4 star rating,"Perhaps the best fried fish I've ever had, which is probably why there are sometimes lines out the door and tons of double parked cars outside.  Strictly speaking, they don't seem to know how to make proper french fries but who cares.  The wonderful fried fish more than makes up for it.  I haven't had the shrimp yet but they smelled and looked amazing so I will very soon."

6/3/2014,4 star rating,"It's tiny. There are no seats. Just be cool and stand outside and eat your food on the corner, like you're in a badass movie about NYC. Then, you'd hop on the ABCD train and have a ""night on the town"" montage, one that possibly includes popping out the roof of a stretch limo you somehow aquired for free and going, ""WOOOO!"" as you ride through Times Square. At least that's what I pretend I'm doing when I'm slamming down fried seafood on a street corner. Forreal though, it's pretty good."

11/10/2014,5 star rating,"Really excellent, simple, tasty fried seafood. The staff is very nice and the establishment is very clean. I just happen to stumble on this place coming out of the A train on 145th Street. Come here if you're around for unpretentious fried seafood. One of the nice young ladies tending the cashier was very sweet and considerate. I mentioned I needed some time to look over the menu since it was my first time. She was so nice and gave me free samples of the fried fish and shrimp. Now that, is true customer service that you can hardly find anymore. Brava to her and the whole crew!"
4/25/2017,2 star rating,"So I waited forever to get this famous fish market fish. Total waste of my time, as much as we paid for the food you would think at the very least it would be seasoned. Nope not a drop of any kind of seasoning. Had I known I would've grabbed my can of old bay and brought it over on my visit. So I posted the pic of the  line being put the door and from first glance your thinking damn the food must be GREAT there. Wrong the only reason the line is out the door is bc the fish market is literally the size of a small child's closet. With no standing room in front as you place your order I'd hate to see what goes on behind the window where your food is being prepared at. Not to mention its in the basement. I'm sorry but if you like eating unseasoned fish from a tiny closet in someone's basement come here. Otherwise take your money and go elsewhere. I hate giving bad reviews but they really need to step it up a few notches (Literally &figuratively speaking)."

5/30/2019,1 star rating,"If there was a 0 star I would rate that. I have ate at this restaurant for years and never received terrible customer serious until today. Clearly there is new staffing there and they need tons of training on customer service. Not to mention I called in my order an hour before I got there and they seemed to forget about it because I was waiting along with walk ins. A young lady that had some diamond studs in the middle of her forehead and a head wrap was extremely combative and you would have thought she was not at work the way she spoke to me. Along with a fair skin gentlemen whom I corrected politely ( something he could not do in return) since he started giving me the wrong order. Not once did I get an apology for the inconvenience of having to wait. Although I called in my order and gave more than enough time for them to make it, I got pure rudeness and confrontation. I try my best to support black businesses, however, due to this type of behavior I see why we can not move forward as people. Whom ever the owner is, I must say, you will lose business if you do not observe the type of individuals you are hiring. I work in customer service myself so I know how you are suppose to treat customers who are giving you business. It saddens me to know we are bitter towards one another! After the hostility and long wait they expected me to still take the food. Instead I got a refund. My self dignity is worth way more than a plate of food from rude people who prepared it. Therefore if you want to get treated like crap and spend your hard earned dollars on a business that doesn't appreciate their clients,go here. I will no longer be supporting this business."

3/22/2012,4 star rating,"Thanks to my loving boyfriend's craving for fried fish one day, Famous Fish Market (a hidden gem) was found. Famous is literally a hole on the wall fish shack. When we arrived there around 1pm on a Sunday, the line was out the door. Service was quick though, so the line soon diminished. Famous only accepts cash only, so no credit card.Surprisingly, a bum was persistently asking everyone on the line to buy him a fish sandwich (instead of asking for change). This makes one ponder that Famous was probably really delicious if it can motivate a bum  to choose this (fish sandwich) over money. Nonetheless, we were so excited to try Famous's concoctions. We ordered 3 items: 1) Fried Fish, Shrimp and Chips, 2) Fried Shrimp, 3) Fried Fish Sandwich. The breading on the shrimp and fish was excellent! It was not too oily, and has a nice panko like texture. The fried shrimp was our most favorite from Famous. We both thought that the fried fish (whitening) was alright, and that the chips (french fries) was a bit disappointing. The Fried Fish Sandwich (2 slices of wheat bread & possibly 3-4 pieces of whitening) was good, but not the best. We ate the fish sandwich without the condiments (at first) and it didn't taste that great. Once we put the condiments (tartar sauce, ketchup, hot sauce) on the sandwich, it tasted better. If we come back here in the near future, we would just order the fried shrimp, and maybe the fish sandwich. Service was alright. The female server was nice and seemed friendly. The guy, on the other hand, was not that friendly, seemed very miserable and looked like he hated his job."

7/27/2016,2 star rating,"Customer service- Cashier and cook were nonchalant and borderline unpleasant. I waited in the doorway and once I saw patrons that arrived after me receiving their food, I inquired about my food. I was met with "" I called your food out"" . Considering it was not crowded at all, I should have been alerted or asked what I had been waiting on. Food- I ordered the fried shrimp and it was not good. The batter tasted old and unseasoned. It could have been an off day because I hear so many great things. I ended up throwing majority of the shrimp away as I walked home. Overall, the only way I would try this again would be if someone else purchased something for me. I would definitely NOT stand in a line and wait on this food or service."
10/30/2014,4 star rating,"A friend recommended this spot so I decided to try it. Had the Fish & Chips, with tartar sauce and hot sauce with two slice of bread on top. I wish the fish was a little more crispier but other than that, it was really good. On service, the staff was nice and attentive, quick, even being late in the evening (9-10pm) and there was a line too. Location, I almost missed it when I was looking for it. It under some scaffolding so it isn't very visible, small spot, no seating, just grab & go. But I like it because it makes it different and the focus is on the food and not the decoration or the place itself. Definitely coming back to try the other meals."
5/31/2017,4 star rating,"The service isn't the best at all and neither is the parking, but it's all worth it for that shrimp and half and half iced tea! I never go to New York without stopping by here at least once or twice. Try to go as soon as they open so you won't have such a long wait."
4/1/2014,5 star rating,I have not bern to NYC in years and wanted some good fish.  I went to Famous fish snd was very happy I went. My fish and chips were hot and good after a 12 block walk. ...Excellent!
5/5/2018,1 star rating,Horrible experience hair in tartar sauce and long hair in bag the food was not great the fries were soggy and fish weird consistency.
2/18/2011,5 star rating,"Wow, this is our favorite fish counter in all of NYC.We usually go with the fish and shrimp combo, it can't be beat.Comes with a handful or two of shrimp and a couple of fish pieces, tons of fries and one or two pieces of bread. They offer tartar sauce, ketchupWhat's great about this place is that the fry is not too salty, it's just right. And they fry everything to a perfect consistency...never soggy or too crunchy. I wish they had hush puppies, that would put this place over the top!The platters are really huge, one is enough to share with two people. The wait is never too long and the prices are more than reasonable. This is definitely a must visit!"
4/10/2012,5 star rating,"Yelpers never steer me wrong.Best fish place in NYC.Tender, crispy,flaky fresh, fries cooked to perfection. And all for an affordable price! (I don't remember the exact price)I used to frequent this place when I lived in Harlem as I lived right on St. Nicholas at one point.  I am sure its not too healthy for you but it taste great lolIf I was ever in Harlem and in the mood for fish I would definitely head back."
6/6/2014,4 star rating,"Gotta say this whole in the wall is pretty good. There is always a long line when I walk place this place. There are no seats this is strictly a take out place. I always go late so most of the time they run out of things. So far I have have the shrimps, fish, and clams. My favorite is the clams. I look forward to trying the scallops next when I finally make it early enough where they still have it."
5/20/2016,5 star rating,"Lines are usually long but goes by quick. Food is being fried every minute, so it will always be fresh. My favorite is the all fish and shrimp with wheat bread. You can make a fish sandwich and still have leftovers. Huge portions."
5/27/2014,4 star rating,"Definitely a fan!  ...and thank you yelp!  Would never have known what this is if it weren't for the reviews.  I've seen this so many days getting on/off the subway, but just had no clue.The line (that when I finally went started 2 people outside the door), went quickly and efficiently, even with some of the chatty locals taking their time.  Usually, I'm more of a British Fish n Chips fan, but this style was quite tasty.  Much less greasy (though just a touch more fishy than I usually prefer) and still warm and ready after the 5 blocks I ventured home."

4/18/2018,3 star rating,I really wanted to like this place but... what I received really wasn't great. Felt more like I got a bag of fried fish skin than actual fish.
9/9/2016,5 star rating,I eat here like once a week. I love the fried shrimp basket. It's very small and I recommend ordering for pick-up. It's great for a last minute dinner or lunch.
7/11/2014,4 star rating,"We had low expectations for a small hole-in-the-wall type of place....It blew our mind, the staff was friendly and talkative, the food was delicious and reasonably priced.

The stairs are steep; you'll be too busy admiring your fish sandwich and the next thing you know you'll fall into the arms of a stranger coming to order."

8/10/2015,3 star rating,"So today a friend and I decided to venture up to Harlem to try this place. No wait at all because it's Monday so that was great! I decided on the Fish & Shrimp combo. $13.75 excellent price nice and hot and quick. The food looked amazing however it lacked taste. I don't like to use a lot of hot sauce it takes away from the original flavor. In this case I had no choice very, very bland!"
10/26/2012,4 star rating,"Price: $14.50Highlight: The fish and shrimpI was surprised. In these next couple lines I will explain the order in which the surprises hit me.Surprise 1: You get alot of food and it could last you 2-3 servings. Surprise 2: It tastes really good Surprise 3: *It tastes really good coldSurprise 4: If you have extra bread, rice or salad ingredients you could make other meals. Luckily I went during the day so I had a line-free experience. Look for the black awning  by the 145th street train stop on the A,B,C,D. You step down into the tiny space, go to the window, say hi, speak your order, step to the side, *watch for your order to be ready and pray you that you can leave without your hair and clothes smelling of all things fried. Choices are simple: fish, shrimp, chips and then you can mix and match these in any way.A fish sandwich is about $6.50, the combo of fish, shrimp and chips is $14 - the combo also comes with 2 slices of whole wheat bread.P.S. When the order is freshly placed on the counter in a box - this is your opportunity to dress it with lime, hot sauce tartar sauce etc before they brown bag package it. *I am a grazer and prefer to eat small amounts of food in time increments of... well however the hell much time I feel like. *Watch for your order meaning watch the food cooking in the oil. The cook batters and fries the food right there."

Where's the professionalism? I was enraged. I hate to say it but I don't think I'm ever going back."
2/15/2015,2 star rating,Place a little bit small cramped.The fish wasn't really good I didn't like the  taste the fish had it didn't taste fresh. Maybe they should try using a better fish or different coating. The shrimps were ok need a little bit more season. The fries are pretty still decent they had a little bit of crisp till after I got home.
5/28/2016,4 star rating,"Definitely worth the visit and the wait at this hole in the wall fish joint. If you're looking for tasty, inexpensive fish and chips, this place can't be beat.. Whenever I'm in town, I always make it a point to visit."
3/27/2015,1 star rating,"Back in the 80s & 90s, ""Subway Fish"" was IT!!!! I fell in love with whiting because of them, and went there 30-40 Saturday's a year. Every time it was an order of at least 10 fish sandwiches. Fast forward to my recent visit. Times have changed. I went to relive the mouth watering deliciousness of the past, because I knew I'd be in the area. I didn't really eat breakfast, and went in for an early lunch. I ordered the fish & chips, and couldn't wait to get on the train to dig in. Talk about bland/disgusting:-( Unfortunately I ate every piece, in hopes that one bite would be good. Fish, had no seasoning, fries were meh, the best part of it was the wheat bread. I will probably never patronize ""Subway Fish"" again. At least I have memories of what it used to be"

I just happen to stumble on this place coming out of the A train on 145th Street. Come here if you're around for unpretentious fried seafood. One of the nice young ladies tending the cashier was very sweet and considerate. I mentioned I needed some time to look over the menu since it was my first time. She was so nice and gave me free samples of the fried fish and shrimp. Now that, is true customer service that you can hardly find anymore. Brava to her and the whole crew!"
10/30/2014,4 star rating,"A friend recommended this spot so I decided to try it. Had the Fish & Chips, with tartar sauce and hot sauce with two slice of bread on top. I wish the fish was a little more crispier but other than that, it was really good. On service, the staff was nice and attentive, quick, even being late in the evening (9-10pm) and there was a line too. Location, I almost missed it when I was looking for it.

8/16/2015,4 star rating,"Great little hole in the wall if you're craving fried seafood. Not many choices (fried fish, fried shrimp, fried clams and french fries) is what the menu consists of. I think it's good because they use fresh soybean cooking oil. I saw the oil was very clean that they used in the fryers. There are no tables or chairs...take out only. Worth stopping here if you're in the area."

Each one, crackly crispy-skinned on the outside, beautifully seasoned, wrapping some nicely firm and flaky white fish, clean with flavor. Soft bread assists each chew and swallow while creamy tartar sauce bright with finally chopped pickles added the appropriate amount of spark for my tongue's enjoyment...."
5/31/2012,3 star rating,"This is another fine example of great food wrapped and put in a paper bag to steam itself into mush by the time you get home.I had the fish, shrimp, and chips. It came with a couple pieces of wheat bread that made for a couple good mini sandwiches. But the fish was good enough on its own. The tarter sauce was so-so and the shrimp was tastless. And as for the fries, bring some salt.Overall, a good cheap full belly. I'm stuffed, but there are many other places in the neighborhood to get a good bag of whitting without having to stand in line 20 minutes."
4/3/2015,4 star rating,"My goodness!!! I love it when I find a late night jackpot.. 1 am and I'm getting fish, shrimp and Mac...Perfect!!! The seafood was flavored well. They just need to puncture the Styrofoam so the fried food doesn't lose its crispy goodness.  Also, this spot is super clean because it is take out. Staff are nice. They have a fish market which is open during early hours. And they take credit cards!!! I wish them nothing but success because they are a great addition to the neighborhood."

One young man packing the food while the young girl handled the cashier. I got the fish and chips $7. The fish was pretty good. It had a very strong taste of black pepper. And To be precise, the fish was 85% crispy. The fries were a little soggy and cold :(.. Which deducted a star. Oh And you get two slices of brown bread. Oh btw I don't think I would  recommend the all shrimp, it's $9.75 and you only get a small hand full. ONE MORE THING!! If you get it to go, check your bag if there is tartar sauce. Because that's a fried fish's best friend!! I GOT NO TARTAR SAUCE :'( even though I specified I wanted all the sauces... Instead I got the non spicy! sour! Supposedly hot sauce and packs of ketchup....no bueno and that's why they are getting a star deducted!!"

12/21/2013,4 star rating,"Famous Fish is a place that is tucked away so well that you would probably pass right by it if there wasn't a line coming out of its inconspicuous door.The experience is simple: Southern US style fried seafood and fries done right. No frills. No themes. No seats.You wait on line, you come in, you order, you pay, you wait. The food is up and staring you down on the counter, you add your condiments, you nod, they wrap it up, and you are out the door. Lost once you get in? Don't worry, someone is bound to tell you what you're supposed to do. It's actually a little reminiscent of the Soup Nazi.. but with nice people behind the counter. They won't yell ""No fish for you!"" if you get it wrong.The fish and shrimp combo is deal breaker here: Freshly battered catfish and large, cleaned shrimp. The fries as an add on is so cheap, it would be a waste not to do it. The entire order, flanked between whole bread slices is enough to feed you for hours to come."

4/25/2012,4 star rating,"After hearing my friend RAVE about this place for so long, I finally made the trek up there this past Saturday. My best friend & I arrived early, 11:30am, and decided to explore the neighborhood. We wandered down to 145th & St. Nicholas to the beautiful Park (I believe it is called St. Nicholas Park) and chatted. We decided to order our platter, and come back to the park to eat.We ordered a fish+shrimp+chips combo to share (those were instructions from my friend), which was $14, and 2 bottles of water, $1 each. While waiting, we saw them assembling someone else's order and our eyes literally popped out of our head. The fish & chips were piled so high, we weren't sure how we'd transport our platter to the park!Luckily, they wrapped ours in paper, put it in a bag, and gave us napkins, and containers of hot sauce, tartar sauce, and packets of ketchup. Very efficient packaging.We found a spot to chow down in the park, another friend met us with his platter of fish & chips and came equipped with paper plates. This is the way to go, especially since everything is so piled up.OMG, the fish & shrimp were fried and seasoned to perfection! They're everything I want in fried fish & shrimp. The chips weren't anything to write home about, but I still enjoyed them. The tartar sauce is some of the best I've ever had... IN LIFE! I dipped everything in it, including the fries. We couldn't even finish our food, there were a few shrimp left over and small pieces of fish, that we donated to Louie. See the next paragraph about this guy.If you decide to eat in the park, which I highly recommend when the weather permits, watch out for Louie (my friend named him, I had something else in mind that isn't quite fit for this site...) and/or his cousins. This squirrel pulled out all of his tricks to try & steal our food! I cursed him every chance I could get, stomped my foot, clapped hands, only to find him on the fence peering over my shoulder to get a better look at my food. SMH!But. it was worth it :-D"

It was so good you want to slap somebody!The fried shrimp were also good. The fries were not, but who cares! You will be so full from your fish it wont matter.Line is long, but you can call ahead.If you are in Harlem, definitely worth stopping by.

(They should rethink the price)The fish had no taste and had way too much flour and black pepper, and the shrimp had a weird sweet taste not to mention the French fries tasted like old oil. For that price I would have expected more food with better seasoning."
1/29/2016,5 star rating,Read these reviews and you get exactly what you see here. The food is absolutely amazing. The wait time sucks--especially when it's cold outside. But you'll definitely find yourself craving this fish and the price they sell it for.
6/25/2016,2 star rating,"When will this place ever start serving fresh fish?  I haven't been there in a year or more and was so disappointed then because after waiting on a long line the fish had a strong fishy taste - a sure sign that the fish was not fresh. So I went again today, stood in a long line again and sadly the fish still tastes fishy!  Even after putting a gob of hot sauce on it.  Totally unacceptable.  I can't believe people are actually writing reviews that say this fish taste delicious.  Unless they have never ate FRESH fried whiting. Or perhaps they're reviewing the shrimp, which I have never ordered.   Oh well, guess no place will replace Majestic's fried whiting."

6/24/2012,1 star rating,"Meh...As relatively new transplants to the neighborhood, we were excited to try Famous Fish Market.  Plus the reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere are pretty good.We got a fish+shrimp combo and a shrimp combo.The good:1.  The breading on both the shrimp and fish is very good.  The shrimp have a crispy, batter-like coating that keeps it's crisp even after being transported; the fish have a seasoned breading that is light and tasty2.  Not too oily!  Was pleasantly surprised at how light and un-oily the fish and shrimp were.  3.  The condiments are surprisingly good - GREAT hot sauce and pretty good tartar sauce (not too mayonnaise-y, good amount of tang)The bad:1.  The fish fillets are fried and served with the skin on, and because the skin is on, the blood line is often there as well.  All of which makes for VERY fishy fish.  Removing the skin, which was time consuming, made a huge difference to the flavor.  I would never get the sandwich precisely for this reason.  2.  The shrimp were, for the most part, not de-veined, and since they're relatively modest in size, you can really taste the difference.  Terrible shame, too, because when I did come across the one or two that had been properly cleaned, they were SO delicious.  3.  The fries - don't waste your time on them.  Not worth the calories and really only serve as a convenient mop to soak up any potential oil that may be left over on the shrimp or fish.  Handy (see #2 under good), but that's about it.So, overall, I'm glad we went, but was ultimately disappointed (and before people write me off as a picky eater, let me just say that I'm not.  In fact, I'm a very adventurous eater).  Like so many places around here, has the potential to be terrific, but is held back by it's own mediocrity.  It would not be that much more difficult to devein the shrimp or clean the fish properly.  I know people will read this and say ""oh, that's the way it's always been done""; and sure, that's probably true, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's no room for improvement.  This place could could be really GREAT.  Let's hope they catch on to that soon, before it's too late."
1/16/2013,5 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS!!! OHHH MAN you are ever in harlem i highly suggest you head over to 145th and get some fish and chips. its a little spot right next to the subway station. the line can get super long because of the small space they have inside so its you order and keep it moving. Fish and chips are great i love it, i reccomend this place to anyone who is in and around harlem. GO HERE!!"
5/22/2007,4 star rating,"It's already been said but if you happen to be up near Sugar Hill/CCNY and you have a craving for fish, this is the place to go if you have time to stand on the line.  I have seen the line snake down the block and personally stood on it impatiently for over half an hour.  The place is not appealing in any sense in terms of ""ambiance"" but the fish and shrimp pulled hot out of the grease is where the charm lies.  There is lively music blasting from the radio and a constant banter between the people who work there.  Occasionally someone from the neighborhood will come in and provide some comic relief and other times the tight confines and waiting will push someone over the edge and there will be a quick heated exchange of words.  Then they will get their hot basket of seafood and that will end that.   As someone already noted, dress your food with hot sauce and they also offer tartar.  Personally, I like some lemon juice with a bit of hot sauce."

7/8/2012,5 star rating,"Ever walk or drive past the corner of 145th &St. Nicholas avenue and wonder what that long line is for well the answer is Famous Fish Market! I don't care how long I have to wait, it has always been worth it. Nothing is better than their fried fish and chip or the fried shrimp. Throw some hot sauce or Tartar sauce on there and it is finger licking good. I love their friendly service and their get in and get out style."
1/19/2016,4 star rating,The fish and shrimp is outstanding. Most definitely a place you must go to if ur in Harlem
10/27/2010,5 star rating,"This is my go to fish spot. The options are limited but it is what it is. The name of the place gives you a clear description of what it's all about. It could be rain or snow and there's lines out the door. The fish and the fries are very fresh. If the fish or fries are sitting out past 5 minutes they throw it out and make a fresh batch. They give so much food that I can share it and eat some for the next day. Lastly, my Dad that's not even from Harlem has to stop there before he treks back to Jersey."
2/20/2012,5 star rating,Low price Fish for great quality.  Best fish and shrimp I had in NYC yet!
12/30/2005,5 star rating,"Lines around the block almost every night of the week for this historic Harlem fish fry. The best fried fish in NYC for sure...not to mention great fried shrimp! No where to really sit, although I think recently they opened up a small dingy dining area. This place is definitely a take-out joint. So head up there on a nice summer day and then take your fish to the nearby park benches or better yet, to St. Nick's pub and sit in their back courtyard and enjoy your fry with a cocktail or beer. If you live in any one of the five boroughs, you're not a real New Yorker until you've stood in line for Famous Fish...nope, you're not!"
9/15/2012,5 star rating,"Good God Almighty has graced this place with his permanent blessing. Get the fish sandwich, load it with their hot sauce, and your belly will thank you (so will your wallet--it's only $6). The fish is always fresh out of the fryer and PERFECTLY seasoned/breaded (I'm originally from the south, so I know a thing or two about fried foods). On more than one occasion I have nommed one of these on some poor neighbor's stoop because the five-block walk home was too long to wait. This is just a walk-in joint, so don't come here expecting to sit, but please, PLEASE don't let that stop you. This is one of my favorite meals in Harlem."
1/13/2013,4 star rating,Famous is one of the best fish places in Harlem. Yes it is small and you have to wait on line but it is certainly worth it. I usually get the all fish or fish / chips. I introduced a couple of my out of town friends to famous and they loved it.  Reasonably priced and tasty just up my alley. Best of all they are located 2 blocks from my house.
2/4/2014,2 star rating,"Fries were tasty as was the tartar sauce. Portions are pretty decent. But the most important part, the fish, was not. It was fishy. Yuck. If I can bring myself to, I'll need to try it once more then update my review but for now I'm not impressed. Hopefully just an off day."
5/9/2010,5 star rating,Lemon and hotsauce if you like it! You will never be disappointed!! Gotta love a place that SPECIALIZES in something. Why sell anything more than fish shrimp and chips w wheat bread if you have a line out the door. We all know what we came for!!!
8/17/2009,5 star rating,"My friend put me on to Famous about 7 years ago and I haven't looked back.  Let's be clear. . . .  This is not the place for the fanatical gym rat rocking the heart monitor and pedometer who calculates his BMI after every meal.  Famous is about tasty, simple comfort food -  el fish and chips.  Yes, it's all deep fried in vats of oil and coated with a tasty breading that absorbs all of it.  Delish in moderation (I will not be held responsible for climbing cholesterol levels and resultant high blood pressure once you become addicted)!  This is the perfect spot for a hearty (portions are generous), inexpensive ($5-8 depending on order) and immensely satisfying meal after a late night of partying or a quick afternoon snack in the summertime.  Lines can be long especially in the summer but worth it.  NYC southerners don't fret - the rawkus crew of cats on line are not interested in you or your purse.  They just want to eat.  Besides, one of them is probably a DT from across the street because they love Famous too.  Cramped and hot without tables this place is strictly take out (but a quick stroll down the avenue and you can park yourself in St. Nicholas Park which has been lovingly re-landscaped).  Believe the hype that Famous is the best and most authentic fish and chips spot in NYC.  Enjoy!"
7/28/2009,4 star rating,"There aren't too many places to eat in Sugar Hill, so to have something like this place is a godsend. Unfortunately, because it is deep fried food, I can't have it too often. It it delicious nonetheless. I normally opt for the combo with fries with the bread and split it with another person. Very filling and delicious!"
8/31/2009,3 star rating,I don't get it. The french fries were pretty disappointing and soggy and the fish was just ok.
7/31/2011,5 star rating,Cheap good fish.. I'm nota fish lover but this place deserves thes five stars
6/2/2010,5 star rating,SO GOOD ! right next to my subway... i love it. definitely try this place out- there's always a line out the door!
4/11/2012,3 star rating,"Best fish place in NYC?  I don't know maybe, but I'm a Marylander and I haven't been too impressed by NYC's seafood spots.  The batter isn't really that flavorful to me which makes a big difference.  I will say that get the spirit of soul food right, no skimpy platters here like you may find at a few other ""soul food"" spots in Harlem.  The service is fine.  Nothing superlative here, but nothing terrible in my opinion."
1/31/2011,4 star rating,"Its basically a fried seafood counter but that just means they've put all the effort into making awesome food. The fish is as good as fried fish as I've had, crispy on the outside, super juicy in the middle. It just tastes fresh. I had the fish sandwich and it was a lot of fried fish in two pieces of bread. The bread is nothing to speak of but I guess the focus is the fish. will definitely be back."
7/27/2014,5 star rating,"Great food and friendly service. It quickly gets crowded, but it is well worth having to wait in a line to experience it."
10/15/2010,5 star rating,I just want to personally thank everyone for the review good or bad it just let us know what we slacking on and what we need to change too bad we cant do anything about the size of the store but we working it out lol... we are expanding very soon next year ... thanks again and please come by get there before the line
1/16/2013,5 star rating,"i once waited a half an hour in the cold to get a fish and shrimp and chips platter. i was not disappointed. another time i drove from midtown en route to the bronx and waited 15 minutes. was not disappointed. once i was in harlem, and drove with a friend just to prove to him he would not be disappointed. he was not disappointed. fresh, flavorful, friendly, even saw a celebrity or two ordering food. pay attention, if you dont know what youre looking for, you could easily drive right past this place!"
3/26/2011,1 star rating,"New to the nabe and was psyched to try this after reading the reviews but don't have to go there again.  Fish was thinly coated and crisp but quite fishy, maybe from the skin being left on?  Fries were underdone and soggy.  Shrimp was the best of the bunch but not memorable.  Portions were adequate.  FYI, if you're looking for English-style fish and chips this definitely isn't it; if you're looking for southern-style fried fish, i'd look elsewhere."
1/6/2013,2 star rating,"I ordered the all-fish dish. The fish is not fried to order--it's sitting under heat lamps. The fish was dried up and chewy rather than flaky, and it tasted like it had been fried in overused oil. I asked for some lemon, and the counterperson looked like he had never heard of putting lemon on fish before. They do have tartar sauce and ketchup on squeeze bottles. I do not plan to return."
4/26/2011,4 star rating,"Some of the best peppery fried whiting in Harlem! Take the train b/c parking is ridiculous. You will wait but its worth it. Prices are typical and menu is limited to fried: whiting, shrimp, and fries."
3/8/2011,1 star rating,"This place is overpriced. The portion was smaller than I expected from reading reviews here, and it was only average in taste."
10/10/2010,5 star rating,Had a hankering for some fish since trying the amazing Wash DC place Horace & Dickie's in the down down downtown area. I have always been looking for a fish and chips place in NYC other than the typical Chinese fake fish and chips markets now I found it. The place is TIIINNNYY with sometimes long lines but the fish is a close second to Horace & Dickie's. Even the tartar sauce is not the typical blend but their own recipe. Cash only. Only negative pertaining to the food would be the high price and small portion of the only shrimp basket even though they are outstanding as well. Long lines are to be expected because they are constantly cooking up fresh batches. DO WATCH OUT FOR BONES.
