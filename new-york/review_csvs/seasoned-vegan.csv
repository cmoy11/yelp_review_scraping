5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."
7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited  the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes.

I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."
7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited  the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."

12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.

3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."

I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat.

3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wasn't thrilled with the ""chopped burger"" that I ordered because I'm a burger aficionado and it was very different than I expected.

This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."

11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood.

3/29/2022,5 star rating,"Omg... the sweet potato soufflé is to die for or go all the way to Harlem for!!  I had the vegan ""fish"" with sweet potatoes that melt in your mouth, and rice with peas. I added a side of spinach that was perfectly done, not cooked to death and tasted great!  Amazing place. Nowhere to eat outside so take home is the only way to enjoy it for now. Great job!!"

9/30/2021,4 star rating,"I liked it a lot but they have a very limited menu right now due to covid. And even with their limited menu, they didn't have everything. We liked what we had, including the amazing cookies that I swear don't taste like they are missing anything. I wasn't thrilled with the ""chopped burger"" that I ordered because I'm a burger aficionado and it was very different than I expected. It was good but not the same.  I liked my daughter's dish better (A po'boy sandwich). It took a little longer than expected but in general it was good. Id definitely go back."

Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"

3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."

Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood.

12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."
7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited  the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.

We liked what we had, including the amazing cookies that I swear don't taste like they are missing anything. I wasn't thrilled with the ""chopped burger"" that I ordered because I'm a burger aficionado and it was very different than I expected. It was good but not the same.  I liked my daughter's dish better (A po'boy sandwich). It took a little longer than expected but in general it was good. Id definitely go back."

It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."

12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."

I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."

5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
3/29/2022,5 star rating,"Omg... the sweet potato soufflé is to die for or go all the way to Harlem for!!  I had the vegan ""fish"" with sweet potatoes that melt in your mouth, and rice with peas. I added a side of spinach that was perfectly done, not cooked to death and tasted great!  Amazing place. Nowhere to eat outside so take home is the only way to enjoy it for now. Great job!!"
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
1/30/2022,5 star rating,"Love ordering from here- food always arrives hot and fresh. Everything tastes great and I am trying not to order so much, but it's soooo good!!!! Mac n cheese, yams, greens, tuna steak are my go tos."
12/6/2021,4 star rating,"I ordered a chopped cheese, mac & cheese and a salted pecan cookie. Everything was good!"
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
10/25/2021,5 star rating,This place has the best vegan soul food. I eat there often and even throughout the pandemic I was ordering from them.
9/30/2021,4 star rating,"I liked it a lot but they have a very limited menu right now due to covid. And even with their limited menu, they didn't have everything. We liked what we had, including the amazing cookies that I swear don't taste like they are missing anything. I wasn't thrilled with the ""chopped burger"" that I ordered because I'm a burger aficionado and it was very different than I expected. It was good but not the same.  I liked my daughter's dish better (A po'boy sandwich). It took a little longer than expected but in general it was good. Id definitely go back."

The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park.

(IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."

It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."

3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.

3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
11/25/2014,5 star rating,"Warm, cozy atmosphere exceeding expectations with delicious vegan cuisine. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. We happily devoured chicken nuggets, spicy chicken with yams, green beans and a dessert of filo dough with praline ice cream and warm rum infused bananas. Can't wait to go back."
6/5/2022,3 star rating,"Called ahead to see if they were ""open"" - but never occurred to me to ask for a table as the lady told me on the phone ""we are not busy"" - I drive 20 mins and park nearby (no easy feat in Harlem.....and when I get to the restaurant a ittle hand written note on the door says ""take out only"" - so I'm disappointed- most unimpressed that any establishment can't update their social media profile....."
12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."
7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited  the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."

12/6/2021,5 star rating,"Seasoned Vegan is the perfect place to go if you are new to vegan food! The staff are super friendly and can walk you through the different menu items. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, riblets, crawfish, black beans and rice and capers. It was all so delicious. The riblets and crawfish tasted just like real meat and the sauce on both was finger licking good! Ten/ten would recommend this spot."
9/23/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly? SO good. Came with a vegan friend since we've both heard of Sensational Vegan and wanted to try it out. This place is one of a kind, and made a meat-eater like me consider going vegan if I would be able to eat food from here all. the. time! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Brunch on a Sunday here was very enjoyable, not packed, and just a short walk from Central Park. Felt like a family business, with workers who enjoyed working here. Would absolutely come to Harlem to grab vegan food at Sensational Vegan again."
7/20/2021,4 star rating,"Sunday... July 18th (evening)...We visited  the one and only Seasoned Vegan. I wish I had taken a picture of my friend's mealShe ordered a Harlem Philly Cheese steak or (chopped cheese)  I forgot but  we both order a side of Mac and cheese. I added double extra fried chicken. (IT WAS my first time eating a vegan meal, very thankful it was this place)Let me get to it... We were hoping to dine it but I guess seating was closed off. We were able to use the bathroom which was good. The cashier.... Definitely professional and friendly...aka THE EMPLOYEE you want to have on your team. The Mac and cheese in honestly felt like it was fucking MISSING (like a missing ingredient it was ducking bothering me all day)something! But then I literally devoured it right outside of SEASONED VEGAN!...This was my second ever Vegan dish I've eaten and I must say... I would love to thank my best friend for convincing me to go here for take out.Please support the locals!..... !!"
1/10/2021,3 star rating,"Once again we took the travel from Jersey to come to Harlem for Seasoned Vegan. I love my bbq crawfish - so yummy and it had been probably about a year since I've had it so I was really looking forward to it. We called ahead of time as there's no dining in. I was told by the guy who answered that I should go through the Door Dash app or Postmates app to order. I advised I was from New Jersey and coming into town to pick up food but he said I could go through the apps for pick up. I asked if I could just call back but he told me if I were to call back and order through him, there was no guarantee he could take my order if he was busy with customers (thumbs down)I went on the app but was concerned about paying a fee for ordering plus they didn't have a lot of food options on the Postmates or Door Dash menu we've been used to previously, especially my chocolate chip cookie which I love so much so I called back. Luckily a lady answered the phone and took my order with no issues. I asked about the sautéed portobello mushroom entree option and my chocolate chip cookie - no and no. Turns out the menu has been consolidated due to Covid :-( We were advised food preparations would take about 35 minutes. After 35 mins we went and got our food and ate in the car while the food was still warm. The food was packed properly and it was absolutely delicious!Customer Service: Was 2 stars but increased to 4 after speaking with the lady. Food: 5 stars - delicious!Menu; 2 stars (since they took away my chocolate chip cookie)Yup! I'll be back."
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"I've been to SV several times over the past 2 years. I'm really disappointed because the last time and this time that I had a meal here, the meal was literally luke warm. time, the sweet potato soufflé was ice cold (and I'm not exaggerating). It's like they took it out of the refrigerator and placed it in front of me. :-(Seasoned Vegan is a very small ""hole-in-the-Wall"" establishment. I usually order the bbq crawfish (AMAZING) with Mac & cheese and the sweet potato soufflé. Their food is seasoned to perfection - delicious! But there's plenty of room for improvements in other areas. Aside from the food being cold, the portion size is very small. A child would still be hungry after eating their meal. Most of their food is made of soy. For those that avoid soy, there's not very many other choices. You'll sit elbow to elbow with your neighbor as you eat. Not really a big deal since the food is so tasty but I do hope they recognize there are problems and make changes to rectify those issues."
5/19/2022,5 star rating,This gem was giving all of the flavor and essence that make eating Vegan so rewarding.    They are a bit pricey and the portions are smaller than expected for the price but I honestly would eat there again.  Just not as frequently due to the cost.
3/27/2022,5 star rating,"Everything I ordered was delicious (ribs, shrimp po boy, Mac and cheese, sweet potato soufflé), great texture and flavors. Best vegan shrimp I've had to date. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and hopefully the dining room will reopen soon (but the take out was ready fast)"
3/28/2021,4 star rating,Food was delicious! Ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the Mac and cheese. They have a QR code when you walk in to see the menu and you can place your order at the door. I'm giving them a 4 star rating because they're portion size is too small! Mac & Cheese was $7.50 fo a tiny container that probably hold less than a cup of Mac & cheese. The sandwich was life but wish it was a slightly bigger portion. Wish we had more Vegan options in the area! Problem with many vegan places is they're over priced with small portions.
8/11/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered via DoorDash. Food came on time, packaged nicely and was nice and warm. The Mac & cheese has so much flavor. I added spinach to mine, which was just some plain barely cooked spinach in the bottom, but it still tastes good. Next time I would just order plain mac&cheese though. I didn't taste any lemon (or lemon seasoning) on the nuggets and they were a little tough, but I'm still kind of new to vegan meats. I throughly enjoyed this meal and would order again."
5/15/2022,5 star rating,"It's take out only these days, which was great for me after a long walk in Central Park. I had the fried ""crawfish"" with sweet potato mash and mac and ""cheese"" sides. Everything was scrumptious. It was fast and the folks behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. Will definitely return."
