1/23/2022,5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place in New York while visiting and it was by far one of our favorite meals! The jerk chicken is incredibly moist and delicious, the mac & cheese was amazing as well with the perfect amount of spice. Boubie is so nice and also made the whole experience incredible. The food here is so good we came back three times, we couldn't get enough!"
5/29/2022,2 star rating,"There are some restaurants you go to where you immediately know it will become a go-to for you; where the food is flavorful and the service is prompt and friendly. From the first bite, I knew this wasn't it. I ordered the oxtail and jerk chicken meals for take out. The order was ready when it was promised and the food was at least hot, but it was also very bland. The jerk chicken lacked spice (Which is a mystery to me with jerk) and the oxtail stew was the most unflavorful I've ever had. The chicken drumstick also had a few feathers at the base still. I can't figure out if the meat just wasn't marinaded long enough or if the spices were just lacking overall but everything went in the bin. The other issue I have is that the takeout prices through grughub are a bit higher than the dine in prices. I can only assume whatever fees are being charged to the merchant have just been added to that option so it's cheaper to go in and takeout than placing an order online. If you're looking to stop up gas and are on your last, the food with stop a gap. But if you're looking for the taste of home, go elsewhere to avoid serious disappointment."
2/6/2022,3 star rating,"I want to love this spot more but I feel a bit disappointed in the flavors here. The jerk chicken looks like it's got good char and it's tender and moist but oddly bland. The jerk sauce that was poured on was pretty one-note and didn't add much. Maybe I should've asked for extra hot sauce? I've just had so much better jerk chicken elsewhere that I can't really say this spot with fulfill a craving for jerk.Mac and cheese is VERY cheesy. It's rich and pretty good, but nothing particularly special. They were pretty generous with the portion of mac and cheese that I got. Staff are nice and quick.Pineapple salsa is great! It was nice to have a bit of that sweetness in the meal.It's definitely Chelsea Market prices, without the huge portions out in Brooklyn."
5/30/2022,3 star rating,Pricy but outstanding jerk chicken.  Other fixings are good when fresh. Price makes this a difficult choice except when you really want Jerk chicken!
3/14/2022,2 star rating,Satisfactory Jamaican food. It's a alright find within Chelsea market but you can find better within the city.
5/29/2022,1 star rating,$17 for this ? Maybe since it was ubereats they just send you scraps. Smh. Didn't even include the pineapple salsa it's suppose to come with. I would of rather starved than waste my money on this.
6/22/2021,5 star rating,It was excellent.Well seasoned.The chicken is juicy and moist.The pineapple sauce works beautifully.The prices are fair.The customer service was excellent.We'll be back.
11/24/2021,5 star rating,"I'm so glad that I was able to swing by and try this spot at chelsea market. The chicken was super flavorful and the portion was generous. I enjoyed the pineapple salad and the beef pattie as well. The worker was such a kind, jolly man. He joked around with everyone that stopped by to order. It made the entire experience so much better! If you're craving jamaican food and you're in the area - I definitely recommend stopping by and supporting this gem!"
5/27/2022,3 star rating,"I stumbled upon this place looking for somewhere to eat. I had the jerk chicken with peas and rice with oxtail gravy, the chicken leg wasn't bad, it had a good jerk flavor. The oxtail gravy was flavorful on my rice. I just have a problem paying the price but I understand considering the area ( high rent)."
10/30/2021,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this little shop in Chelsea Market. While it's a little pricey for counter service, the portions are massive. My mom and I shared the jerk chicken plate and it was more than enough food for two people. The chicken was so tender and perfectly spiced. The rice and peas phenomenal. The guy at the counter was super sweet and kind enough to cut our chicken in half to make it easier to share.Wheelchair access: accessible through Chelsea Market. While the main entrance is down steps, there is an alternate path in the main part of the market. You may need maintenance or security to unlock the access if it's limited to badge access the day you are there."
5/26/2022,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! As someone who goes to Jamaica often, this is the next best thing! Stop by and get some amazing bff jerk chicken and beef patties!"
12/9/2020,3 star rating,"*Take-out/Pick-up during COVID-19 review*Do you know how excited I was to find out there was a Jamaican restaurant in Chelsea Market?? Literally blocks from my home base. I grew up in Chelsea and over the past 20+ years the only noteworthy Jamaican restaurant in Chelsea was Negril on 23rd Street and 9th ave, which sadly closed years ago. So after that drought when I saw this establishment pop-up it gave me joy.Now, I write this review with the most thoughtfulness but must state the facts. As I passed all the other restaurants on Chelsea Market row I noticed the strong popularity of the Taco joints and wondered about all the hype.Once I got to the Jamaican restaurant window we followed directions and placed a call to make our order. Oxtail is a must when trying out a new Jamaican restaurant.  Honestly, to me it is the gold medal winner for Jamaican dishes in my opinion....Oxtail a di bes!So of course we ordered the Oxtail and some Beef Patties. You usually can't go wrong with Beef patties although there are some basic requirements.  Now when I opened the Oxtail order I felt gipped. Lets me real, most Caribbean restaurants give you at least a little garnish of some kind, usually in the form of shredded cabbage and carrots or what we call cabbage slaw but this order had no veggies at all!Next, the rice and peas although tasty and with the right amount of gravy, was very skimpy. There should have been at least another cup full of rice in my container. Finally, the Oxtail was also well flavoredl. The pimento and tyme with the other seasonings were right. But once again, I counted my Oxtail bones and felt at least two more chunks should have been in the box. Call me picky, but let's just be honest. Oxtail is not cheap and I know Chelsea Market rent is not cheap either but if you want people to keep coming back you gotta give them more to work with."
7/8/2021,4 star rating,"I would rate this place 4.5 stars. Everything was really good! The jerk sauce in the rice was probably my favorite part though. The sauce is really unique and I loved that it came with pineapple salsa as well. While the chicken tasted amazing, I will say it was a bit hard to eat because it was on the bone, and I felt like I wasted a lot that I couldn't get off the bone.Their fresh juices were sold out when we went at 2pm, but sounded really good! I'll definitely be back to try them, but probably earlier in the day, so they won't have sold out!"
5/11/2022,5 star rating,"Got me coming to 14th street every other week at least. Chicken is tremendous, salmon unreal but takes time. Oxtail unbelievable when fresh out."
8/24/2021,2 star rating,"Bro theres no way y'all are paying THIS much for oxtail when it has no flavor... and the wildest part is it looks like it's about to slap.. and then... it's so mid my wallet still hurts knowing I spent that much and I tipped 20% just so they can forget my beef patty in a slow day which... $5... for a beef patty... cmon mannn that's a lil much but nah.. I'll bite. Regrets.I left and had to walk allllll the way back and ask for it because well - I paid 5 bodega empanadas for one Jamaican beef patty. I get there 20 mins after I left, place is empty - still slow. AND THIS GIRL doesn't even remember my face so when I ask for my beef patty SHES like ??? But finally gives me it- allSo it could be mid. Literally wish I was kidding when I say I could get this at 7/11 because EW but we've all been there IG. Anywayyyys. So mid. Not at all worth the price."
1/13/2022,3 star rating,"I ordered delivery and The curry goat doesn't Look like the picture, the greens are not greens they're cabbage and they weren't the greatest. There are no carrots or potatoes in the goat and They put a huge piece a bone on my plate. The goat is tender and the flavor is OK."
7/8/2021,5 star rating,"I love this food!!!!!!!! Highly recommend. The two times I have come here (with 2 different people), we were all so impressed and happy. The portion sizes are also huge. We got the mac and cheese and jerk chicken and LOVED them both and were so satisfied afterwards. My friend and I split one order and were full and could not eat anymore, so we got a great deal. The people who work here also consistently are very kind and happy and have great energy. I love this place!!!!!!!!!!! It is also fun to walk around Chelsea Market after before/eating."
12/27/2020,4 star rating,"I got the ital stew with a side of rice and peas and a veggie patty. The patty was great. A lot of flavor! The ital stew was kinda bland, not a huge fan. I think it could have been more spicy too. But the jerk chicken looked super good so I'd come back and get that next time."
6/19/2021,4 star rating,"While sampling various dishes at Chelsea, we had to try this famous Jamaican Jerk chicken as well. It was overall fairly good. I enjoyed the level of spice, not too overwhelming but definitely present. The seasoning on the outside of the chicken was flavorful and the chicken was very soft. I've had jerk chicken with slightly crispier skin on the outside, which I really enjoy, and this was definitely soggier and very saucy. Since I personally prefer the texture and flavor of that crunchy skin, I wouldn't say this was my favorite jerk chicken ever but it definitely deserves an honorable mention."
8/19/2021,5 star rating,If you can't tolerate spicy food this isn't for you. It was right at my limit and I loved it. The pineapple salsa was the perfect contrast with the chicken. The workers were so nice and helpful too.
10/27/2021,1 star rating,No cabbage or plantains was a major red flag but still gave it a chance. BIG MISTAKE. Oxtails is not authentic. May look like it but does not taste like it. Again no cabbage or plantains. That should say it all.
12/17/2021,4 star rating,Not the best jerk chicken ever but still very good. It may look a bit price but the portions are huge.
6/18/2021,5 star rating,My company catered here for Juneteenth and everyone in the office was raving about the food. The owner sean was great to work with and the best part is they delivered on time. Best food best service!!
10/6/2019,4 star rating,"We stopped in here after the World Cup parade. Excellent jerk chicken and rice and peas. The oxtails could use a bit more seasoning but they were very tender. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. They have counter seating directly in front of the food, so after you eat you'll probably by some takeout.  I definitely will go back when I'm in Chelsea Market."

5/22/2019,3 star rating,"I tried the Goat Curry, Jerk Chicken, Ox Tail Stew and side of mac and cheese with my friends. The curry and ox tail stew were good, but the jerk chicken and mac and cheese was pretty unmemorable. Everything didn't quite have the spicy kick I would expect from Jamaican food. They did provide hot sauce on the side, that makes up for it, but I would have liked to try the food with a base level of complementary spiciness instead of dousing everything in the hot sauce."
11/1/2019,5 star rating,"Sooooo ya Girl was hungry getting off a work. Looked up some places on Yelp and realized Chelsea Market was within walking distance so I figured why not, always heard good things about the place? I decided to walk through the whole market and wow everything smelled so gooooood. After circling the place I decided to go with the Jerk Chicken combo at Tings with a Nutella Strawberry Banana Crepe Delma Suzette's. Everything was delicious!!! Chicken so juicy and crepe so sweet. Treat yourself next time you're in the area. Thankfully they're right next to one another!"
5/3/2019,5 star rating,"I always come here for the jerk chicken and the rice and beans. That's it. Everything else is hit or miss and gets three stars, but that chicken and rice and beans?Five stars!!!!!!!"
8/8/2021,5 star rating,"The food here was fantastic. I got the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Oxtail, rice and beans, and pineapple salsa. I would recommend it to anyone. The guy that owned it was there and he was very kind. This was recommended to me by an employee of a different store in Chelsea Market."
6/14/2021,5 star rating,Best jerk chicken that I've ever had in my life. So juicy and spicy. Even the Caribbean music playing while I waited was wavy. All around great restaurant.
6/29/2019,1 star rating,"Disappointed and disappointing!! I saw psyched to try this place.  I ordered the jerk chicken which came with peas and rice plus a side of greens !! Total $18.00! The portion was large but the chicken was extremely dry !! The peas and rice tasted stale from two weeks ago.Obviously, only catering to tired and hungry tourist !! #mytwpcents"
5/28/2020,1 star rating,"Are they kidding me? Absolutely, by far the worst version of Jamaican food I've ever had the displeasure of eating. I AM A JAMAICAN. PERIOD..You can't fool me. I had the worst stomach ache after eating this food. I didn't, couldn't finish it. I ordered one dollar and some change shy of $50 worth of food... curry goat, jerk chicken, side of mac &cheese and two Ting. I was starved and looked forward to enjoying this meal  The first thing I noticed when I opened the container is the smell. The food smelled sour. Next the presentation, sloppy and then the taste, well, let's just say they didn't even try to be a little authentic. I don't know who they have cooking in the kitchen but they should be fired. The rice was so soggy I felt like I was eating rice porridge. The curry goat was not curry but stewed goat. There was no curry on it. If there was curry on it I certainly didn't see or taste any. The jerk chicken had some other sweet sauce on it with a hint and I emphasize HINT of jerk seasoning. The seasoning overall was NOT JAMAICAN SEASONING. The only reason I gave one star is bc there is no zero star option.  I was very hungry and very disappointed have spent so much money for garbage. I had to order from another restaurant bc I was still hungry. The Mac & Cheese was nasty. They sent me the cheese off the top with a few pieces of pasta attached. Smdh. Granted, Jamaicans aren't know for Mac n cheese, this could have been done better. Look at the pic I posted do you see the pieces of potato in it. If this curry was good that potato would have been yellow. Trust me. I can and do cook. Listen restaurants out there, y'all don't wanna mess with worried broke people's money okay. If you want our support the pandemic is no excuse serving nasty  food. I have the worst gas now. Ugh"
6/19/2020,5 star rating,"Had the best food and experience today! Ordered the mac and cheese, veggie stew and cool hibiscus drink. All highly recommended! The food came quick and it was packaged well too- which is important given this COVID-19 time. Happy to support a black-owned business!"
6/30/2019,2 star rating,"Just...ok.Jerk chicken was over cooked and dry, but had decent flavor. Rice was bland, dry, and inedible. Sadly it was the largest portion of food provided. Pineapple salsa was good, but only about a spoonful was included. Overall, I would not recommend this place. While there was a decent amount of chicken and rice, the rice was inedible, making the portion of edible food not worth the price."
5/9/2021,5 star rating,The service was great and the chicken w rice was so good. Would come here again and the food was spot on.
1/11/2020,5 star rating,Considering all of the options at the market I was glad to of made this choice! The jerk chicken was delicious and came with rice and a pineapple salsa. If I'm ever back I would love to try the vegetable stew as it was sitting in front of us while we ate tempting me!
5/19/2019,4 star rating,"We ordered Tings via seamless.Goat Curry - our favorite.  So flavorful.  Reasonable amount of meat.Jerk Chicken - delicious, excellent.  Chicken was moist, and not too spicy.  Also a decent amount of meat.  And we liked the pineapple mango little bits on the side.Oxtail - this didn't hit it with us.  Was it missing some salt??  Reasonable amount of meat, but it was lacking some flavor.Prices are alright, not cheap but super expensive.Delivery was prompt.  This will be a regular restaurant on our seamless rotation :)"
9/21/2019,4 star rating,"Jerk Chicken combo was very tasty  but could have been spicier. The proprietor of this establishment was very personable, customer service was excellent. Definitely a must stop if you're craving Caribbean cuisine."
6/7/2020,5 star rating,"This was delicious! They delivered so quickly, as well. We had the jerk chicken, a side of macaroni and cheese, and a beef patty. The spice on the patty was warming but not too intense, the pineapple salsa was so great, and the chicken was so tender. Thank you!"
9/22/2019,4 star rating,"If you're looking for Jamaican cooking in manhattan this is a sure ting ;) The jerk chicken falls off the bone, the mac n cheese is cheesy, and the rice and peas hit the spot. I would have liked a bit more heat in the jerk but a little extra jerk sauce did the trick."
7/10/2019,3 star rating,"I've always wanted to try Jamaican jerk chicken so I tried this place and it was ok, good. The mac & cheese was delicious!!! I'd order it again. The greens were too salty for my liking though."
5/2/2019,5 star rating,"I'm not going to lie, when I first saw a Jamaican food option in Chelsea Market I unfortunately had low expectations. Let me tell you, I was 100% wrong with that horrible assessment. Tings is equally as good as a home cooked meal from a grandma. Everything about this place was A1 and I HIGHLY recommend for anyone in the area craving Caribbean food. I've only had their oxtail (which was phenomenal) but I'm assured to try their Jerk Salmon next"
8/13/2019,5 star rating,"My boyfriend (who is Jamaican and very picky about Jamaican food) and I stopped here for lunch while visiting Chelsea Market. We were both very impressed with the food. The two guys working behind the counter were very friendly and let us sample a few items. I ordered the jerk salmon with rice and peas and pineapple salsa. It was delicious! A nice change from jerk chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Ital vegetarian stew with rice and peas and greens. This was our favorite! We could have eaten another portion. The sauce was so creamy, tender vegetables, and the rice had the perfect amount of seasoning. It had that authentic Jamaican cuisine taste! It was nice to see my boyfriend so pleased. I wish we lived here so we could eat here often. We made sure to give them compliments before heading out."
12/16/2020,5 star rating,I love the food. The food is not too spicy it's just right on point with a perfect kick after every bite.
1/27/2021,2 star rating,they're starting to skimp out on the mac n cheese same price for half the amount now is ridiculous
11/5/2019,5 star rating,"This place is awesome. The jerk chicken is incredible; falling off the bone tender, intense flavors and delicious sides. The goat and oxtail stews are outstanding.  The place is tucked away in a remote corner so you need to seek it out...worth the effort. Great food to take home."
2/4/2020,4 star rating,"The jerk chicken was super moist and flavourful......pretty decent value, and gluten free which is great"
11/15/2019,5 star rating,"Customer service was wonderful, but chicken was even better. The portions are crazy big here. I will definitively be back."
5/15/2019,3 star rating,"Bland.  I've had much better at Golden Crust.  I guess is that they need to water down the spice a bit with the customer base that comes in and out of Chelsea Market. I found it to be very inauthentic, and not to say Golden Crust is so much authentic, but it's much closer to the real thing.  The ""veggies"" were spinach I think and were bland. Usually ""veggies"" are steamed or stewed cabbage. All I had was the jerk chicken, but if you're going to judge a Jamaican spot by its food, it's gotta be that.  Make better food, make it taste better, or better yet, give it taste."
5/27/2019,4 star rating,"I'm giving four because it's EXPENSIVE. And so I can't be as excited cuz... Brooklyn. But, for a stranded Manhattanite this definitely works. Best $5 ($5!!) beef patty ever. Authentically spiced - meaning it's actually spicy, with some scotch bonnet flavor- and flaky crust. I wasn't as much of a fan of the Mac and cheese, only because it also was spicy and was a little dry but oily at the same time. Jerk chicken was delish."
9/20/2019,3 star rating,"The jerk wasn't spicy nor did it have a grilled flavor, but the flavor was good. The beans and rice, also had a decent flavor. The mac'n cheese appeared over cooked, so I didn't try it."
6/15/2020,1 star rating,"food was awful, there was nothing about that food that was jamaican. my stomach was in pain after the few bites i did eat. meat was so hard not good at all."
12/30/2019,3 star rating,We had the oxtail and jerk chicken with rice peas and greens the ox tasted good but the jerk and rice was not that great if your looking for authentic Jamaican this is just not it . The Jerk was not Hot But the service was Great the guy from El Salvador was really nice
8/21/2019,1 star rating,"It wasn't real authentic Carribean food, highly disappointed. I didn't even get the pineapple salad that was suppose to come with the meal. Should have went to golden crust 2 blocks away."
5/13/2019,1 star rating,ordered the goat curry and got basically all bones no meat. Orders the jerked chicken my first visit here and was served the smallest chick thigh .  Flavors are decent but you leave hungry
11/13/2019,2 star rating,"Not worth the money, small portions. When you order the Jerk Chicken, they cut a leg/thigh piece which is cut up and however you they do not give you all pieces. So you get a leg and half a thigh. If you order oxtails, you only get 5. I waited 15-20 minutes for oxtails to be ready and I didnt even get an extra 1. If you want to waste your money for subpar food at high prices, come here."
4/23/2019,5 star rating,"One of the BEST carribean spots within a 100 block radius. The Beef and Vegtable patties are freshly made each day with a nice flakey crust. The Oxtail and rice and peas platter are seasoned to the bone just like grandma's. They accept digital payment, cash, and card. There is a small bench area to pull-up and have a quick bite while you enjoy some tunes. So far I'm averaging 3 visits a week for the last 4 weeks. Great stop on your way to work, or after work on your way home."
5/14/2019,3 star rating,I dont know  i just didnt like it the taste was okay  price was little high  portion sjze was small
7/26/2019,5 star rating,"Great Jamaican food and at a good price too.   The jerk chicken had very good flavor and a hint of spicy. Also there soda called ""Ting"" was delicious.  Sparkling grapefruit soda that tastes exactly like squirt if not better.  Great friendly and fast service.  Would definitely come back"
9/6/2019,5 star rating,"Yard food inna Chelsea Market. Jerk Chicken & Patties were excellent and plenty of it. Friendly people run it, highly recommend it! Bigup Tings!"
7/14/2019,4 star rating,"Curried goat was incredible, portions were generous, and the service was nice. The macaroni and cheese was.....""off"" to put it politely, I scraped off the top cheese layer and tossed the rest."
5/14/2019,5 star rating,"Best Curry Goat I had in ages! Soft, juicy, fall off the bone and melt in your mouth goat served with rice and peas with a citrusy zest. Chef Sean serves a Gourmet Jamaican Menu to go."
8/3/2019,4 star rating,Tings serves large portions of yummy Jamaican food at a reasonable price point. Was it the best jerk chicken that I've ever had? No. But my friend and I (two hungry girls) split one huge bowl of jerk chicken for dinner and were satisfied. That's two dinners for $13.00! The only complaint that I have is that there was no where for us to sit; we had to walk around the market and eventually just use a standing table in order to eat.
8/13/2019,5 star rating,Wow! Just freakin WOW! You guys have got it! I'm carribean. I'm not one of these young liberal hipsters who pretends to know Jamaican food because I did a 4 day all inclusive in Montego Bay once. I know island food. This easily rose to top 3 best jerk chicken I've ever had. That good. Really it's that good.
2/12/2020,3 star rating,The beef patty was so good! The jerk chicken however was underwhelming and the rice and peas were tasteless. I was very disappointed.
2/20/2020,2 star rating,"Alright considering Caribbean food in the city is horrible. There was no kind of season in my oxtail, not a green pepper, red pepper, onion, thyme, nothing!!!! It's crazy how overpriced jamaican food is in the city but is not cooked authentically. Really getting over on people here."
9/11/2019,5 star rating,"what a pleasant surprise...! after giving up waiting in a long line to the taco joint, my friend and i decided to try this one... we ordered jerk chicken, beef pattie, side of greens and sorrel hibiscus drink... first of all the portion of the jerk chicken was quite generous that was plenty to share between two of us... the chicken was tender and juicy, falling off the bones and the rice was absolutely flavorful and moist... also the pineapple chutney certainly brightened up the whole dish very nicely... the greens were tasty with a perfect note of bitterness and the beef patty was delicious as well... at first i thought the drink was quite pricey for such a small portion but it was superbly well balanced and packed with flavors... will definitely go back to check out their ox tail stew soon...!"
9/21/2019,5 star rating,Really really good. Tried the lamb plus some greens and was surprised how tasty it all was. Great people working there as well
11/16/2019,4 star rating,"My friends and I ate at the Tings Jamaican Jerk Chicken today. The food was very delicious. We had oxtail, curry chicken, rice and peas and curry goat.  The two gentlemen who served us were very excellent hosts. Oliver who was the DJ, played some nice Jamaican music He played Busy Signal Stay So .  They were very accommodating and I would recommend that restaurant to someone. Thanks guys!!!"
4/29/2019,5 star rating,I had a craving for Caribbean while in the office. Did a quick google search and found this nearby. Took a chance and ordered thru a delivery service. I am blown away by the flavors. Just what I wanted. I will order from here again. I had the Jerk Salmon and greens. Yum
