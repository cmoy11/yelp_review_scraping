6/5/2022,5 star rating,"This was one delicious dinner we had at Melba's. I had no complaints maybe my bestie for not having rice and peas. Yo they even gave us oxtail gravy on the side and it was a lot. The fried chicken breast was juicy and flavorful. I loved the greens had a bit of sweetness. I loved their homemade hot sauce. The catfish was fried perfectly. Didn't care too much for the sauce that came with. The spring rolls were good it was made with cheese, collards, rice, and black eyed peas. I'll be back soon. There is also another room when you ener which I didn't get to film with a small bar. Their portions are big and filling."
6/3/2022,3 star rating,"Food:Mashed potatoes were cold. Both the sautéed spinach and the collard greens were extremely salty. The mac & cheese was also quite salty but would be tolerable if not accompanied by even saltier sides. A$AP yams were cloyingly sweet and not ""sticky"" at all, despite the description. Chicken and catfish were both great!Water is served in plastic cups, while cocktails were served in glasses. Why?Service:The manager was very friendly.  Everything else was a bit of a mess.  One server came to take our orders within a couple minutes of sitting down, before we had a chance to make decisions, and no one came back for about half an hour. After putting in our orders (different server), the drinks came out within a reasonable time but we waited another 40 minutes for the food to arrive. As a vegetarian, I won't be back, but Melba's is a Harlem institution and I'll continue to recommend it to non-veg friends."
5/17/2022,5 star rating,"Let me tell you something. I mean what I say and I say what I mean. Best soul food RESTAURANT in New York City. Hands down. No question. Find me a better one and we'll battle. Not a take out spot, not a mom & pop spot ( love them all btw) but if we're talking RESTAURANTS then Melba's takes the cake.You need a reservation here unless you don't mind waiting 30mins-1hr for a table. ESPECIALLY on a weekend. Black folks don't play bout our dining here so a reservation is HIGHLY recommended.Speaking of recommendations you can close your eyes and order blind and you'll enjoy everything. I've had the catfish, chicken, Mac & cheese, candied yams, collards, and a whole bunch of other sides I can't think of right now BUT LEMME ASSURE YOU ITS DAMN GOOD. Like, the servers almost don't have to check on you after the food is delivered. The table has syrup and hot sauce ready for you and the food is just made to perfection so once you have it, bliss mode activated.Just dine here, that's all I gotta say. Do it, enjoy it, love it."
6/4/2022,5 star rating,"I'm always watching The Food Network Channel. One time I was watching and Melba was one of the food judges. It showed her restaurant in Harlem N.Y. I knew instantly I wanted to visited her restaurant. So, glad I had the pleasure of visiting on last week. The staff was organized and very attentive. Small space with an outside patio. Nice music and energy flowing. Our server was nice. She had a nice Harlem Accent. I ordered the  2pc catfish fillet with greens and mac and cheese. Let me just say this is how soul food is cooked with perfection and good seasoning. We all ordered the Roc Berry LemonadeCocktail. There was no compliant at our table. This is another one of my favorite places to dine and eat in New York. If your ever in N.Y I highly recommend you stop by Melba's Restaurant. A small fun fact. I also have an aunt named Melba."
5/1/2022,4 star rating,"Can I have born, bred and buttered engraved on my resume please?Despite not having a reservation in the middle of lunch hour, we were seated pretty quickly. Ordered the signature chicken and waffles with sides of yams, collard greens, and mac and cheese. I won't lie, it did take a bit for our food to arrive but, I also think that's just a pandemic product (understaffing and whatnot). Our waitresses were trying their best!The food itself, was yummy. The waffles were soft and sweet, the chicken fried and well seasoned. The strawberry butter, wasn't too crazy about. Too much of it had like a strawberry candy sweetness to it. The yams were sugary, and the collard greens were nice bitter break from the richness.The mac and cheese though. Omg, probably one of the best mac and cheeses I have ever had. Cheesy with a considerable crust on top, and flavorful, most importantly. Honestly, I would just go back for a plate of that!"
5/26/2022,5 star rating,This is my second time dining at Melba's in four weeks. The food is still great y'all! I could not wait to order these sides again and I opted to order a different protein (fried wings). My first visit I ordered the same sides with short ribs (I salivate every time that I think about them)!  The Turkey meatloaf was gigantic and quite tasty too. I am a forever fan and will continue to patronize Melba's whenever I visit Harlem.
4/18/2022,4 star rating,"Came to NY for my bday weekend and my mother recommended Melba's. We went for lunch. It was not crowded which was nice, so we were seated right away. We had the spring rolls which were yummy. Not as flavorful without the sauce but definitely good. For lunch we had oxtails with rice and peas and macaroni and cheese, and the dry rub wings with collards, yams and spinach and cheese empanadas. I was a bit surprised to see empanadas on the menu. They tasted fine, no different from any other empanada. Everything was good! However, I was a little perplexed that my Mac was touching my oxtails, but they put the rice in its own bowl. I think it should have been the other way around. I am one of those people who hates their food to touch so it threw me off a bit. I still ate it though. I was not as excited about the Mac mainly because it had quite a bit of cheese. I love Mac and cheese (together and separately - LOL) but I was worried about how my stomach would react to so much cheese at once. Thankfully I was fine.  All the food was very flavorful and I would recommend trying any of it. I also had a glass of rum punch which gave me a nice buzz. Very tasty too!Lastly we had some pineapple coconut cake for dessert. Delicious! Definitely recommend, but don't come here if you are in a rush. Service was a bit slow. It seemed like they didn't have enough wait staff so lots of people in our section had to keep asking the busboys for someone to come to their tables. Our waitress was wonderful but you could tell she was overwhelmed. She had just about every table in our section except the two the bartender took on, and some tables outside. So bring patience and your appetite!"
6/12/2022,5 star rating,Really great fried chicken. Service was so pleasant and helpful. Sat outside on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed people watching.
5/6/2022,5 star rating,"Now THIS is southern comfort in NYC! The best placeFor chicken and waffles. I'm a big sides girl so I had the Mac, the greens and a waffle on the side of myChicken. The food was delicious. We even got to meet Melba! She was so kind and took a photo with us. We felt so grateful that she took time out of her day to chat and take photos! You will definitely see celebrities here. The food is just AMAZING!"
3/3/2022,4 star rating,"Went to Melbas on a couples trip last weekend. I had a great time. The host was very sweet and upbeat. We sat down quickly and ordered. I got the dry wings which were old bay. I'm from MD, they were actually really good. But 5 wings is not enough for the price. I ordered fish and chips the fries seem as though they were fried in old oil, but the fish was delicious. My BF got the wings, mac and yams. He loved it mainly the yams, and said that it was big portions. Our server was sweet but kind of rushing not as attentive. But we saw she was working the bar as well so I know how that goes. Overall I will definitely be back. We were kind of sad the food was so short to get back to us. It's a nice vibe."
5/18/2022,5 star rating,I mean... I think the photos say it all. One of the best restaurants I've been to in NYC so far. The cheese in the Mac n cheese is so fresh and the candied yams or ASAP YAMS were also delicious! The ambiance also gives Sunday Brunch vibes and the place is very very clean. I also recommend their homemade lemonade
1/29/2022,4 star rating,"I finally ventured out to Harlem after several trips to NYC, and I was so happy that I did! Definitely got to see another side of Manhattan, and experience Soul food in the big Apple city as a Southern boy.We were glad to have been able to reserve a table at Melba's for brunch on the day of! The server and hostess were just very nice and welcoming, just like what you'd experience in the South.For food, we ordered the Crab cake as our server recommended it as one of the bestsellers. However, I had to disagree, maybe because I am very particular and had my best crab cake version that I like imprinted in my mind already. But my SO did not like the crab cake here either. We could see the crab, but we felt it was more of a Tuna cake feel instead. For entrees, I had the Fried chicken and Eggnog waffle - and it was DA BOMB! The chicken was crispy and piping hot, and the waffle had a crispy touch as well. Well done! My SO had the Fried chicken and collard greens as his sides. He was disappointed that his chicken was not crispy/crunchy at all (which was shocking since mine was!). The collard greens was on the sweeter seasoning, which he did not like but I LOVED - so just be aware.For drinks, I had the Sangria, which was definitely too sweet for me, and my SO had the lemonade. Tl;dr: Overall, I really enjoyed the hospitality and the Fried chicken & waffle dish. I do feel overwhelmed by the sugar level of the drink and food by the end though."
4/11/2022,2 star rating,"If only I had not gone to the bathroom! The bathroom was so filthy that I couldn't erase it from my mind during dinner. Trash can overflowing, paper on the floor, and just disgusting!  I felt like I was eating in someone's nasty house.Ok, so let's talk about the food:. My mother had the oxtails, mash potatoes and spinach.  The oxtails were seasoned well, but the numerous tiny bones made it undesirable.  The spinach had no seasoning. I had the beef short ribs and they were seasoned    well.  The short ribs and oxtails appeared to be seasoned in the same gravy.  I had collard greens and mac and cheese.  The greens were really sweet and the people at the table next to us made the same comment.  Personally, I don't want my veggies to be my dessert too.  The mac and cheese was very thick and dry.Since it was my mom's birthday they presented her with a cake and the presentation from the staff included Stevie Wonder's song!  Their presentation was Awesome and greatly appreciated!!!!!  Now, the cake was extremely dry and we had two different cakes with icing.Overall, I would say that Melba's has the potential to be so much more, but has a high-end carryout feel to me."
4/7/2022,5 star rating,"Lawd have mercy on my soul as I wrote this review. If you're looking for some hearty and warming soul food. This is the place. I also just want to say that I've had Sylvia's awhile ago and that place is also good. And after asking our server Shaquana which is better she said they're all a family and they're both good which just made me fall in love with them even more. I truly felt the Southern hospitality upon arrival here. The food made me speechless. I had got the catfish plate with the Mac n cheese, greens and a side of the yams. BOY I TELL YA! Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was a hit. The catfish came with the chipotle dipping sauce but it didn't even need it for real. I don't even like my Mac and cheese creamy like that but man I have zero complaints about it because it was stillGooey and stringy just how I like it. I also love to drown my greens in hot sauce but honestly these greens didn't even need nor deserved to be be drowned in them (but I couldn't help myself lol). Lastly, the yams were not overwhelming sweet but you can tell they were slow cooked to absorb all the flavored needed to make them candied enough. Taking a bit of the yams, greens and Mac and cheese together is a must, trust me!!! Honestly I'm craving it right now so I need to stop writing because I'm getting sad."
6/5/2022,5 star rating,"Melba's is an all time favorite of mine! The best soul food in the area! I personally love the catfish, collard greens and candied yams! The vibes are always dope! Want to shout out Awa and Amani for their amazing service and hospitality"
3/30/2022,4 star rating,Atmosphere was cozy and sort of family style. Small place where everyone is kind of close together. They play good music. I had a margarita which I felt wasn't strong.... I also had the catfish with Mac n cheese and collard green. Everything tasted good and was seasoned well. The only complaint was my collard greens. They were slimy..... I told the waiter about it he reheated my collards and the slimy texture subsided.
5/20/2022,2 star rating,"Got here ready to eat, easy to make reservations online. Visited on a Friday night for two. The ambiance was loud, and joyful. Got seated right away in a small corner. We ordered the dark fried chicken, and country catfish along with chili onion rings, potato salad, collard greens, Mac and cheese. The collard greens were really good, enjoyed the potato salad with the catfish, and the onions rings were just okay, the Mac and cheese was cheesy but a little dry, enjoyed the crispy cheese on it. Partner was surprised there was only one thigh + wing. Everything was a little too over salted for my taste. Not sure I would crave this again. Service was fine."
11/14/2021,4 star rating,I have been wanted to try this restaurant for a while. I made reservations for me and the girls for 1pm. When we arrived I found parking close by. We walked in and the restaurant is pretty small. I gave the hostess my name and seen they didn't update the table from 4 to 5 people so they had to squeeze us at a table. Malice was our server and she was so nice and attentive. For my first drink I went with the rum punch which was too sweet for me. So I changed it to the red sangria which was better. For my meal I got the eggnog waffles and fried catfish. The girls ordered different things that I tasted. My meal was very good. The waffles were so soft and fluffy. I tasted the oxtail and chicken and that was so good as well. Let's just say the food here was nothing short of amazingly good minus the collard greens. I did not care for the greens because the juices it was in was thick and had a weird taste. One thing is the food is made fresh so it took a bit to bring everyone's out. When we got the check a 20% gratuity was added already and it came to a little over $54. All in all we all had a good time and I would return.
3/18/2022,5 star rating,Decided to come here after a few drinks for some southern comfort food and it did not disappoint!  Ordered the chicken and waffles which apparently went up against Bobby Flay and it was a pretty solid choice!  Chicken was fried/ cooked perfectly and the waffel with strawberry butter was a winner!  Definitely recommend if you're in the area!

2/10/2022,2 star rating,I came here because of the Wendy show and Sherrie Shepard (home girl in my head) said it's on the list of things to do while visiting BUT HEEENNY let me tell you.  Melba's is not what it's made out to be like Sherrie said! The bathroom is diiiirrrty.  They extended their restaurant so they no long have corn bread.  What kind of soul food place doesn't keep corn bread on the menu?! Melba if your reading this. Clean ur bathroom and find a way to bring back the corn bread ok love.  Ur servers are nice and are 10/10 but u need to repair the oven ASAP because it's affecting the quality of the Mac and cheese.  It's gooey instead of crisp.  I flew all the way from Hawaii to eat here and I'm so disappointed.  All the fried fish items are not crispy. The chicken was okay. The greens to sweet idk what made it sweet. I personally liked the yams.  What I did like was the waffle that was great and the drinks were super strong! Mac and cheese was 3/5 for it not being crispy on top but that's just cuz I like cheesy but still wanted what I expected from the photos.
3/21/2022,3 star rating,"I liked it, but I didn't love it. Our group of 6 waited well over an hour for Sunday brunch and the food didn't really have that ""wow factor"" once we got it. The Mac and Cheese and eggnog waffle were excellent, but everything else was mediocre: catfish wasn't as well seasoned as I would've liked; the sweet potatoes were too sweet and the ox tails were just ok."
2/12/2022,5 star rating,"Melba's is a gem! We had a 7pm reservation on a Friday evening. As soon as we entered, we were greeted with the sounds of music and laughter. We submitted our information to the maitre d who immediately seated us.The area was well lit and diners nearby were clearly enjoying their meals. On the way to the restroom I ran into Melba!Melba is warm and endearing! She makes you feel as though you are at home celebrating with extended family! I was further touched by the warm, respectful, yet nurturing way she interacted with her staff. We ordered Melba's spring rolls, fried chicken, spinach, peas and rice and for dessert carrot cake and sweet potato pie.We were amazed at the light, crispy fresh delectable taste of the spring rolls that crunched to the bite and melted in your mouth! The catfish was well fried yet moist and flaky to the touch. The peas and rice was grainy, well seasoned and plentiful. Well, the fried chicken continued in pretty much the same fashion; well seasoned,golden brown and ample! By then, we were getting quite full but could not stop ourselves from eating and we did not even have dessert yet!Oh, by the way did I mention the drinks? How could I neglect to tell you of this! We ordered rum punch and Melba's iced tea. The drinks did not disappoint! They were awesome! My fiancé admitted to Rich; the bartender that this was the BEST rum punch he had ever had! That said, my fiancé is from St.Lucia and knows a good rum punch.We will DEFINITELY be regulars at Melba's! We had an amazing evening with excellent food and wonderful people!"
9/29/2021,5 star rating,"I forgot to check in when we came here for dinner on 9/19. The service is friendly and does a nice job of checking and giving updates as all the tables were occupied and there would be a wait. Everything on the menu sounded great but we decided on catfish with the side of yams and collard greens and I had the sauteed shrimp entree with the sides of collard greens and rice and beans. The food was fabulous! The collard greens definitely had smokey, rich flavor and were nice and tender. The rice and beans ... simple, straightforward and a nice balance with the garlickly shrimp and smokey greens. Of course we had to order a slice of sweet potato pie to end the meal. Great establishment, wonderful service and delicious home cooking. Don't miss out!"
12/11/2021,3 star rating,"I was recommended this place by a friend; so for this random trip I decided to try it out. We made reservations and the place was pretty full upon our arrival. We started with the Buffalo wings which came as all flats (hallelujah) and they were crispy! So those were delicious. Our entrees...we got the country catfish with macaroni and cheese, and spinach. The fish was HOT out the grease, the macaroni and cheese was not good and the spinach was VERY salty. Our server was very sweet, but I think they may have had her running around very busy, we only saw her twice during our dining. Overall, the place was nice and cozy, but I think I expected more than what was received."
10/25/2021,5 star rating,"I love good food and equally love good staff. Melba's give both. First time, walked in and was sat at an outdoor table. The menu has something for every foodie. We covered our table with catfish appetizer, sautéed spinach, chili onion rings, Mac'n cheese, chicken and waffles. Catfish strips were lightly battered and fried. I've never had them like this but I liked it. Spinach was good. Onion rings fried perfectly but I did not taste chili. Mac n Cheese tasty. Chicken ( white meat) perfectly fried and seasoned.  Waffles served with strawberry butter and syrup. We had a great time.!! Our server was attentive and patient. The manager checked on us a few times. Overall, excellent service. We laughed with other customers, staff and sing  Happy birthday 3 times. Note: Reservation required for indoor seating."
9/17/2021,5 star rating,"Melba's is a NYC gem. It was my first time dining here and won't be my last. I tried the chicken and waffle, which was absolutely delicious. Perfect fluffy waffle and crispy fried chicken was absolutely what I needed that night. And I'll be thinking of the strawberry butter for a long time to come. I also got a Mac n cheese, which was good but I only tried like a forkful before I was completely stuffed and decided to take it home for next day lunch. The only thing I didn't think was great was the ""sexy sangria,"" which was too sweet and lacked fruit. Our waiter Tequan had a great vibe and everyone else working here is really friendly too. I asked to sit in one of the covered booths outside and was accommodated with a smile.Wheelchair access: I didn't go inside but there are no steps"
4/30/2022,1 star rating,"This review is based on the establishment, not the food.Extremely disrespectful wait time for a take out order. The ""hostess"" stated that we had to wait for a server to be free to place an order. That was pretty confusing, what is her purpose if not to also help place to go orders? I waited 30 mins just to place an 2 entree dinner order. There is no understanding of how orders are handled. I actually ended up waiting 2 hours before I couldn't wait any longer. The ""manager"" couldn't give an estimate of when the take out orders would come up, on top of that she was snarky. A couple that came in after me, sat down for dinner and were actually FINISHED, walking out the door before my to-go was produced?!? I had to request a refund. And waited another 10 mins. The whole staff, with the exception of the male server, could take a refresher course on professionalism and customer service."

4/14/2022,5 star rating,"Believe the hype y'all!!! My friends & I had a few hours to kill before we had to catch our flight back to Cali & decided to stop in at Melba's for a quick bite! We'd heard the food was great and couldn't wait to see what all the hype was about! We arrived & were seated right away. Our waiter, who was very personable, gave us menus, took our drink orders, joked with us, and left us to decide on our meal. Everything on the menu looked so good that the waiter had to come to the table twice before we finally decided! But I chose the oxtails,(been craving them) Mac n cheese, & mashed potatoes!(2 starches...I know! Lol) My friends chose fried shrimp, short ribs, sautéed spinach, & yams. Our drinks came & surprisingly our food arrived shortly after! That's when our eyes got big & the table fell silent! Everything looked amazing & they did NOT skimp on the portions!! We started eating & not a word was uttered for at least 5 minutes! After we came up for air...all we could talk about in between bites was how goooood our food was! The fried shrimp were large lightly battered & huge & the short ribs plentiful!  My oxtails were tender and seasoned just right! They were a little small but they gave you enough to make up for it! Mac n cheese was slap yo momma good & the mashed potatoes just right(but who could mess up mashed potatoes )for my oxtail gravy! Everything was so flavorful that no extra seasoning was needed!(I love that!)Can I tell y'all that I cleaned my plate!! I usually stop eating when I'm full but this food was so good that I ate it all! Talk about stuffed! I looked at my friends plates & we all laughed! Theirs were clean as well!! I swear if I lived here...Melba's would see my face often!! I will definitely be back every time I visit & will tell all my folks that this place is a must when visiting New York!Pros: Flavorful foodStrong (alcohol)drinksLarge portionsFriendly staffFast serviceCons:Lemonade needed more lemon ""flavor"""
1/23/2022,5 star rating,"I can't wait to come back, will be there in about two weeks. This is honestly one of the best brunch spots I have  been to. THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WITH STRAWBERRY BUTTER.... I could not get enough. The ASAP yams...ORDER THEM! Not only that but their greens, and the mac and cheese hit the spot. This is one place that I need to make sure not to order the menu and as a picky eater, thats rare. The staff was really friendly and surprisingly there was no wait on this Saturday afternoon. The music was great as well. I highly recommend"
1/25/2022,4 star rating,"Ok. I'll be honest our waitress at first seemed to have a little attitude but it was really busy. Maybe she was just having a bad day at first... b/c she brightened up a little later.The FOOD...man. It was so damn good. I mean great!!! Everything was great! The eggnog waffle with the strawberry butter... who taught them that?! Went so good together.The only thing they were slipping on to me... was the dessert. I got red velvet and it literally taste like orange. I bake so I assume they put too much orange zest in it, not that I think red velvet needs orange zest...idk. And the sweet potato pie. I had store brought that was better.FYI. I thought the greens were good but old couple next to us said it was that good...lmaoOther than the desserts I DEFINITELY recommend eating there.

I appreciated their adherence to covid guidelines (unlike some other places) and it was very easy getting checked in and seated in a timely manner. The restaurant itself is lovely and there are so many enticing options in the menu. We had a pretty decent variety and enjoyed all of it. My favorite was the catfish waffles. And the mac and cheese, as well as the greens, got thumbs up from a particularly picky soul food critic in our group. The service was great and I would absolutely go again."

1/17/2022,5 star rating,"Recently moved to Brooklyn and was told about this restaurant by my mother who had heard so many good things about it. Wellll she wasn't wrong! Met up with some friends in Harlem and when you walk in you are immediately greeted! The music choices of the night were lovely, and I was singing the whole night. A lot of birthdays that night so we sung Happy Birthday to others, Harlem Style of course, and everyone was just overall very friendly and welcoming. Now the food was exceptional! I started the night with a Rum Punch (not pictured) and it was really good, strong but still tasty! I got the Southern Fried Chicken and you have the choice of dark meat, white meat, or wings. I opted in for the wings. Crispy, well seasoned and perfect paired with some hot sauce. Now the Mac was probably the highlight of the meal. Very creamy and cheesy, and tasty!! I've never had anything like it. Greens were good, just how my mom makes them. Overall Melba's is a great spot to receive a nice southern home cooked meal, with great vibes and a fun time!"

6/6/2022,5 star rating,Waited a very long time to come here and they did not disappoint!! My family and I came here for Mothers Day! And Thank God we had reservations. The place was packed... music was jumping... vibes was NICE! And the Mothers were looking LOVELY! We had a big party of 11 people and we had no complaints whatsoever. The Host did his best to get us in right away and he did a good job and the waiter Brian took it from there. The 2 of them made sure everything went as smooth as possible. Ok... now let's talk about this FOOD!! Real good southern food. The Collard Greens was packed with flavor Mac n Cheese had a Smokey cheesy taste to it! My mouth is watering just writing this. We had so much food and ALL OF IT WAS GOOD! And the drinks!! The drinks were on point. I will be back here again... I recommend making reservations but trust me it is worth it. All I can say is you gotta go and try this place out if you haven't already. Thank you Melba's for a great time... see you all soon.

I'm a big man so the table was a little cramped for me, but I quickly forgot about that once the grub started coming out. We got wings and short rib sliders. Yo man. Steam for the esteemed. Short rib sliders are genius to begin with, and they execute like a championship team on these. For my main I had fried chicken and it was what you would expect from an official soul food restaurant. I'll keep coming back."
6/5/2022,2 star rating,"I went for a party in the backroom.I wouldn't suggest doing a party there where they serve the food family style. The amount of food per person is not worth it for the price. I got wayyy less food if i ordered it just regular. My party asked for more mac since the amount we got was so little and they gave us another side but in a rush and they didnt bake it. The egg rolls were great. The fried chicken they gave for family style (13 people) was mostly white meat which I didnt like it wasnt a good mix of white and dark meat . The hostess was a bit rude when we told her the bathrooms were dirty saying ""I just cleaned it with an attitude"". The salmon and rice& peas were really dry. Overall I may try again ordering just a normal plate but I didnt enjoy the family style party dinner food. The red velvet cake was sooo good the best cake ever"
4/4/2022,2 star rating,"The host on Saturday night has an attitude. Maybe she's overwhelmed, who knows. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating. She definitely got that 20% tip. The ambiance nice. Good upbeat music. The place had a at home dining room look. There was a line going into this place. Reservations is a must if you want to eat here. The collard greens was sweet and spicy 5/10. I've had better. The Mac and cheese was seasoned, gluey, and too a la dente as someone said 4/10. The fried chicken was partially cold, dry, not that flavorful. It was a breast with an attached wing but I've had juicier pieces of white meat before 0/10. To be honest I can't trust restaurants who always advertising their establishments on tv."
6/15/2021,3 star rating,I love the food but it was so chaotic doing take-out. I waited over 20 minutes and no one knew where my order was. Come to find out it was sitting to the side.This was on a Sunday and it was very crowded. Music was blasting from outside. I think they need to tighten up the customer service portion. Everyone was nice and polite. I will be back definitely but not on the weekends.
2/5/2018,4 star rating,"Looking for places to eat. Put soul food into Yelp and the first one that caught my eye was Melbas. When we walked in the owner was at the doir and that's when i realized who the owner was. She was on Beat Bobby Flay and won. She was also on CNBC while she was building her restaurant and writing a book. Now I was pumped! The food was great. Hostess was attentive. Our waiter...... not so much. Food: Grilled salmon with mac n cheese and collards. Oxtails with peas and rice and collards.Fish and chips - which is catfish.The salmon was seasoned perfectly. Cooked perfectly. Made me want to steal the recipe. The mac n cheese was delicious. My cousin had the oxtails and he is really picky about what he eats and he loved it. It looked meaty and you get a decent amount for the price. The fried catfish looked good. You get two large pieces and a complete plate of fries. Way too much fries. Lol!CONS: Our waiter. Not sure if he was just nervous because he was waiting on our table and the owners' table but he needed to be reminded several times to bring the tea. On a cold N.Y. night that's the first thing we wanted and we didnt get it until we had our food. Size: the place can get a little tight if crowded. I would definitely return if and when I come back to N.Y.  I suggest everyone try this spot, but be warned, if you try it early in your trip you will definitely come back every night!"
11/22/2021,4 star rating,"Melba's is an establishment that serves Soul Food in Harlem, NY.  I have heard so many great things about Melba's from a friend who has been there multiple times. This same friend and I decided to meet there on a Saturday night for dinner. Based on my experience, I am giving Melba's 4 Stars and I honestly would have given them 5 stars if it were not for the issues that occurred. Overall, it was a pleasant-enough experience. Melba's is accessible via the A or C train stop to either 116th Street or to Cathedral Parkway and then walking a couple of blocks to the restaurant. I made the reservation for 4:30pm and I got there at 4:45pm within the grace period. CONS -There was a line when I got to the front door. People were waiting to be greeted by the front entrance staffperson and no one was stationed at the front door. Aftet waiting and seeing that no one was coming to greet anyone, other patrons + I took it upon ourselves to go inside. I walked to my friend who was already seated at a table. 30 minutes after directing myself and seating myself at the table and after the server asked me for my Vaccine Card + Identification Card, the Front Entrance Greeter come and asks me to show my Vaccine Card and Identification Card again. I explained to her that I already presented this information to the server and she proceeded to ask again. I told her that she can verify that it was shown to the server already and she proceeded to give me a difficult time regarding the issue. I informed her that she nor anyone else was there when I arrived so no one asked to verify anything at that time, i expressed my frustration around waiting at the front and no one arriving to seat me and having to seat myself, etc. She made a quick commemt and walked away while I was talking which was a bit rude +  unprofessional. I understand that it was a Saturday Evening and that it appeared to be busy during that time, however Melba's has to have the Greeter be at the front door instead of having them elsewhere in the establishment. Also, my friend stated that when she walked in earlier than me, the same individual that was supposed to be at the front entrance was present but did not ask her for her Vaccine Card. So, there is some disconnect  between not asking her for her card and then asking me for my card multiple times. My friend had a separate to-go order and it took quite some time for them to bring that order in a to-go bag. They also forgot to pack my slice of Carrot Cake and we had to remind them so they remedied the situation. PROS - (I like to end on a positive note) Melba's food is good and the ambience is cool.  Staff got all of us patrons to sing ""Happy Birthday"" two seoarate times to customers after they brought out their special birthday cake slices. It was really nice. Melba's has an upbeat, energetic vibe. The restaurant has simple decor on one side + decor that includes a colorful artsy vibe on the other side. They play fantastic music including Hip, Hop and R+B, etc. Anytime I can hear great tunes from artists that include 50 Cent, 702, etc. and dance in my seat while eating great food is always wonderful. Speaking of the food....I ordered BBQ Turkey Meatloaf w/ Collard Greens + Macaroni and Cheese. I also ordered nn Eggnog Waffle w/ Strawberry Butter. My friend ordered Chicken + Waffles. Ok....Everything was tasty, flavorful and absolutely delicious.  Such well-Seasoned food and pur Strawberry Hennessey Cocktails were prepared well. I was also tempted to get a to-go.order however entress are so well-proportioned that I became full.and took the rest of my Eggnog Waffle home.(Boy, was it good the next morning for breakfast-lol). Melba's Website- melbasrestaurant.comMelba's Instagram- @melbasharlemYes, I will be back because although there were issues the food was that awesome! Hopefully I will not encounter any problematic situations and I look forward to having another Eggnog Waffle..."
5/30/2022,3 star rating,"Melba's has delicious soul food options. The smothered chicken is fresh and perfectly seasoned. The macaroni and cheese is top notch, definitely up there with the elite soul food restaurants in Harlem. The one issue I had was with the service. I think they may overbook reservations, because we had a strange encounter with a served during our last visit. Prior to sitting us, she told us that we had ""sixty minutes or less"" to eat. When I expressed that we might leave as a result, she explained that the restaurant was expecting a huge party who would be sitting where we were placed. When I asked if we could be sat elsewhere, she said moving would not change the fact that we had to pretty much be in and out of the restaurant in under an hour.Very strange. They need to do better. The food is great, but great food and poor service can cause a patron to reconsider return visits."
11/30/2021,4 star rating,"Finally tried this Harlem soul food staple after having it on my list since last summer! First, my friend and I were really taken aback by how nice and glossy the interior was - given that it's known for chicken and waffles, we weren't expecting a sleek seating area and bar with dressed-up folks inside. To enjoy indoor seating, you should definitely make a reservation. My friend and I sat outside rather than wait half an hour for indoor seating.We ordered two of the same: fried chicken (dark meat) and a waffle. The chicken lives up to the hype - the dark meat was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The waffles I'm less keen on. It was very plain compared to the chicken, and I don't feel like it added anything noteworthy to the fried chicken. The strawberry butter that they put in the waffle is great on its own, but the flavor clashes once you spread it on the waffle and eat it with the chicken. If I were to order here again (which I definitely want to do in the future!) I'd probably go straight for their fried chicken (or some of their other tempting-looking fried entrees) and skip the waffle."

2/11/2022,5 star rating,"From perfectly cooked catfish to crab cakes and lemon honey chicken tenders the family recipes run deep here! The ""Tres Mac and Cheese"" oozes three amazing blends of cheese together and their short ribs and beef peel away right into the deep flavors drowning in sauces.There's a true family feel to the place, staff is amazing and the hustle of Harlem is wrapped up in this staple of the neighborhood. Thank me later, follow me now, stay eatin' bruh!"
12/29/2021,4 star rating,"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Our party of three lined up before opening time and we ended up being 7th in line on the waitlist. It was cold so we wanted indoor seating, but ended up waiting about an hour and a  half for a table. We powered through, but I highly recommend getting a reservation for indoor seating.Had the Fried Chicken & Eggnog Waffles w/ Dark Meat and an Arnold Palmer. The chicken was juicy, flavorful, and had a really light crispy skin. The waffles were good, especially with the strawberry butter, but it didn't really go well with the chicken and I just ended up eating them separately. As a whole, the dish was tasty, albeit a bit underwhelming compared to other chicken & waffles I've had in the city. Arnold Palmer was fine. One of my friends got the Country Catfish w/ either spinach or collard greens (I don't remember which) and he said that it was really salty.Will visit again to try the Braised Short Ribs and other items!"
4/26/2022,1 star rating,"This review is very hard for me to write because I was really looking forward to good food and service as I have read and heard good reviews about this restaurants.  I heard about melba's by watching the food segment on the Wendy Williams show hosted by Sherri Shepherd.  Since I was going to be in the New York area, I made space on my calendar to visit Melba's.  So on April 16th, my sister, my niece, my great nephew and myself made our way to Melba's before I flew back home to Georgia the following morning.   To start, my sister and I stood on a long line for 20 minutes to be told at the hostess station that if  we did not have a reservation we would have to find my own table outside the restaurant.  I was surprised that they did not seat the guest regardless as to whether seating was inside or outside the building.  A very nice older gentleman cleaned off the table that my sister and I found.   The waitress came right away and took our orders.   My sister ordered Smothered Southern Chicken, ASAP Yams and Mac N Cheese.  Her beverage of choice was Sweet tea.  Let's start with the good, contrary to other negative reviews of the mac N cheese found on yelp for this restaurant we actually enjoyed it.  We love cheesy Mac N Cheese therefore we were very pleased with this side.  Now the problem:  Smothered southern chicken was fried chicken with gravy which looks like broth in a bowl on the side.  We where expecting the chicken to be cooked in the gravy vs poured over the chicken table side.  The ASAP Yams was not candied yams as described on the menu and the sweet tea was not a true sweet tea.  When this was brought to the attention of the waitress she responded by saying she put a lot of sugar in the tea and that it should be sweet.  I don't think they understand that sweet tea and ice tea with sugar added are too different beverages.  My sister requested lemonade in lieu of the supposedly sweet tea.My niece ordered Jamaican Oxtails, peas and rice, Mac n Cheese.   My niece stated the Jamaican Oxtails were good, but the peas and rice were all rice and very little peas.I ordered the jumbo lump crab cakes, spinach, mac n cheese.  The name (jumbo lump crab cakes) would implied that it is prepared with lumps of real crabmeat.  But instead it consisted of mostly filler.  It did not look appealing nor was it palatable.  My spinach was served in a bowl with a whole garlic clove in the center.Our food was served with no utensils.  We waited patiently at our table for utensils as our food were getting cold.  After approximately 15 minutes I got up from the table and went into the restaurant to inquire about utensils and my sister's lemonade.  The hostess was very apologetic and followed me back to our table with items in hand addressing everyone at the table.Based on my experience Melba's restaurant needs a quality control person.  There were too many inconsistencies between what is listed on the menu versus what actually came out of the kitchen.Customer service in the outdoor seating area was subpar.  There were two birthdays that night and the wait staff did an excellent job at singing Happy Birthday, Stevie Wonder version to the individuals and getting everyone in the vicinity involved.Unfortunately.... I would never go back to Melba's."
3/14/2022,5 star rating,"First things first, the food was delicious as advertised and communicated by friends and family.  Eating out, for me, is an experience that includes 3 important factors... food, ambiance and service!  Well at Melba's the food and ambiance were really good.  But, the service, provided by our waiter Brian (hoping I got his name right) was exceptional.  The young brother ripped through the choices and answered all of our questions without hesitation.  He was welcoming, checked on us regularly and responded quickly... even after we had been there for an hour and basically were done with our meals!   We enjoyed our visit completely."
10/29/2021,5 star rating,"I LOVED everything about Melba's! The food was delicious and the service stellar. We had  reservations for 4 for lunch at 2, when we gave our name the nice gentleman made sure he greeted the person who made the reservation by name with a proper welcome.We selected Melba's because we saw on TV that the Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry dined here, loved Melba and her fight to stay afloat and keep her employees during the pandemic. The Royals made a $25,000.00 donation to Melba; in turn, she divided ALL of the money to her staff. This is a worthy place to visit.Now for the food: 3 of us had the southern fried catfish with choice of 2 sides so we shared and had collard greens cooked w/Turkey (absolutely to die for!), Mommas potato salad, Mac and cheese and lastly the best candies yams.Now, all I can say is if you live in New York and have not put your feet under Melba's table, you need to go right now! For those of us visiting the Big Apple, this is a MUST! I will never be in NYC and not visit Melba's!The wait staff is wonderful! I am loving this experience. Thank you Miss Melba! It'll"
10/18/2021,5 star rating,"I haven't been to Melba's in about 10 years and it still is by far the best soul food I've had in the city. I came here with my boyfriend's family who were visiting from out of town and they raved about the food the entire time. Everything was a literal vibe. From our excellent and expedient server, to the 90s r&b playlist, to the artwork...it just set the tone for a wonderful Sunday afternoon."
3/23/2021,5 star rating,"Delicious southern soul food and one of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The restaurant itself is large with a lot of outdoor dining space and would be a lovely spot for brunch. My friends and I came here on a random weekday for lunch and were seated instantly. I got the signature chicken and eggnog waffle dish that was on Beat Bobby Flay. It was absolutely spectacular from the chicken to the waffle to the strawberry butter. The chicken was perfectly crispy, juicy and tender with the perfect amount of seasoning. The eggnog waffle is so unique and surprisingly delicious. I'm not a huge fan of eggnog but this waffle is on another level, I highly recommend it and especially with the strawberry butter. Overall great spot and super friendly staff, I definitely recommend it if you're in the area!"
4/2/2022,5 star rating,"This place is amazing.Came right when they opened on a Saturday for brunch with a friend, and the service was stellar. Our server recommended the crab cakes, which we got as an appetizer and were delicious.But the main event!! The chicken skin was so crispy and flavorful, and the meat itself was juicy. The waffle was real fluffy, and the strawberry butter was perfect.I'm from California, so I always just get chicken & waffles at Roscoe's. This was 100x better, can't even compare!"
9/9/2021,4 star rating,"I visited Melba's on a Tuesday afternoon with my sister and we both enjoyed our meals. Despite the potato salad,  everything else was pretty good! I had the catfish, mac and cheese, and potato salad but opted for the spinach once because the potato salad didn't do what needed to be done (LOL!) My sister had the chicken with mac and yams and I heard no complaints from her. The service was also pretty good and fast! We waited no longer than 20 minutes for our entrees."
5/4/2022,1 star rating,"I'm so disappointed in this restaurant , the Mac and cheese had no flavor and the macaroni was under cooked, the rice was spoiled and hard. The oxtails was salty , the candy yams was ok, the potato salad was watery , the greens was too sweet so was the chicken. I really thought I was in for a treat being that melba was a judge on the soul food cook off but I was wrong. I spent 110 dollars which was a complete waste of money , My mother and sister also purchased food and called me at the same time complaining about the food."
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"What a fantastic restaurant in Harlem went for a business meeting will go again for pleasure. Spring rolls the best, oxtail cooked perfectly falling off the bone spinach with garlic and rice and beans instead of taking an Uber back to the hotel in Times Square, I decided to walk through Central Park and burn off this meal hahaha"
4/26/2022,4 star rating,"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great music. Crowded and small entry space to check to be seated/reserve table.  Had an EXTREMELY LONG wait for food after ordering. Waiter may not have heard me over music or misunderstood when ordered, wanted a small side salad for starters before entree meal. Large (ceasar) salad ordered came with entree meal ordered. Salad had too much lettuce and only one ramiken of dressing. Biggest issue was LONG WAIT for food. Also think waiter was preoccupied handling another section that had a b'day party. Food is always great yet and still, portions could be larger though. Would recommend. One of best in Harlem."
3/11/2022,5 star rating,"Once again Melbas is a top restaurant to go to. Amazing customer services. I loved the salmon with the Mac and cheese and onion rings. It was delicious. Melba's is the place to go and enjoy your time with family, friends, co-workers, or even a date. I love seating on the booth is more comfortable but because it is busy days it's hard to get the booth."
9/11/2021,5 star rating,Lovely place and neighborhood. I went for a late lunch meeting with my friends and it was amazing. I enjoyed my time. Great customer service. I loved the onion rings they do omg the best onion rings ever. They were so fresh and delicious.I will like to come back to try new drinks and food.
7/27/2021,3 star rating,"Not worth the hype unfortunately. Came here for Sunday lunch, as my last meal in NYC and I was disappointed. The place was crowded and there is little to no sound insulation so it was loud. So loud my brother and I opted to just not speak cause neither of us felt like shouting. The place was hot and there bugs flying around. The service was minimal while we were order and eating but they were quick to get us the bill and pay. The food was pretty average too. I got the chicken and waffles and they were good but not spectacular and the homemade lemonade is definitely powdered drink and not fresh squeezed. Nothing about my time here makes me want to return unfortunately."

5/22/2022,1 star rating,Not a good experience .Very very very long wait. We were stated 1.5 hours it ended up being 3. We were visiting and meeting  family there from out of town had a pretty good experience last year so we continued to wait. Please see the other 1 star review from Gia N today. Unprofessional Rude Management. Wait staff was cordial however very disorganized. Mice seen on site. By the time the food came our appetites were  just was not the same.
10/11/2021,4 star rating,"So this was my first time coming here. After reading reviews and looking at pictures I had high expectations.  There were some things that were "" issues to me: So cons- no outside heatersNo Corn bread( that alone is the worst!)How do you have a soul food restaurant with no corn bread?????!!!!!!My appetizer that i ordered with my lemonade came when the bill came But I will admit..the food was really good. I got the smothered chicken ( dark meat) greens with smoked turkey,  mac n cheese and yams.The chicken was very flavorful, good amount of gravy. The mac n cheese was very cheesey wasn't dry. The yams were good. They didn't taste store bought. I enjoyed it very much. Even the lemonade was really good. I admit I would come back when I'm in New York again."
5/15/2022,1 star rating,"5/15/22 picked up an order for lunch for 4 of us. Drove from upstate NY. This is the macaroni. It is INEDIBLE! I have never tasted mac so bad. I'm baffled at how this is possible at such a well-renowned establishment. The cheese is in thick clumps. There is no reason I should have to throw all of our mac away! I love Melba's so I even tried to eat it, in the same bite with other foods but it was awful!"
1/17/2022,4 star rating,"Nice vibe, walked right in and was greeted by the hostess very friendly.  Got our seats, attended to right away.  Took my mother there for her bday, they came out with the slice of carrot cake for 5 ppl with a candle and sang happy birthday Stevie style!  I had the fried chicken (dark meat) with ASAP yams and Mac n cheese which was really good.  My parents enjoyed their plates as well...cat fish and the fried chicken with egg nog waffle that was real good.   Good soul food spot in the heart of Harlem.   It was a little chilly inside tho and the lemonade is really sweet.  I had to take a few sips of it and pour my whole water inside to thin it out."
6/5/2022,5 star rating,I was there 06/05/22 food is awesome the service is great the food is so good I assume that's why the people outside is singing many blessings to Melba's restaurant and her staff.

8/15/2021,3 star rating,"Whenever I travel, I'm always excited to find the best soul food restaurant in town. My friend has been living in New York for a few months now and he'd heard a lot about this restaurant so we decided to give it a try. The staff was great, one staff member even went out of her way to make sure there was a table for us even though online reservations were booked up. Unfortunately the food didn't meet my expectations. I tried the beef ribs, Mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. As a baked Mac and cheese connoisseur, this Mac and cheese was a hard NO for me. I didn't like the flavor at all. The beef ribs were okay but not something I would ever get again. And the mashed potatoes had a weird taste that I didn't like. The best thing about my meal was the homemade lemonade which was delicious! I will add that my best friend got the oxtails and he said they were amazing."
3/5/2022,5 star rating,"Visiting from Raleigh, NC... The spring rolls, catfish, fried chicken, greens, yams, carrot cake, white sangrias...You name it.. Baybeh, ALL DEEELISH!!!

4/13/2022,3 star rating,"After a lifetime of hearing about chicken and waffles, I finally ordered it at Melba's. After all; their recipe beat Bobby Flay. So I figured if ever there was a time to tuck into the dish...Melba's was it. It was exactly what it said: a nicely fried piece of chicken (I requested breast/wing) sitting atop a round waffle, and a side of strawberry blended butter. The waffle is apparently made with eggnog but I couldn't tell the difference between Melba's waffle and other good waffles I've had. The strawberry butter was nice. But in the end I just don't get the appeal of the chicken and waffle combo. I was envious of my dining companion's meatloaf, which he said was good. We went for lunch on a Friday and it was extremely loud. The service was prompt and efficient. Major ding for them not having unsweetened iced tea prepared--such a common item, but props to the bartender who brewed a pot of hot tea and served it over ice...so it was like lukewarm tea. Overall I felt the experience and food were fine, but nothing truly special."
7/14/2021,5 star rating,Had a fabulous lunch at Melbas... Sampled her chicken and waffles which she beat Bobby Flay with on throw down... Also tried her mac & cheese - out of this world! And a delightfully crunchy spring roll filled with rice and beans and collard greens. A+ friendly service with a smile Close to the subway
8/8/2021,4 star rating,"So of course i come to soul food resturant on a Sunday so i expected it to be a bit chaotic and crowded, which makes sense. We reserved only only had to wait 10 minutes passed our time which was not bad at all. I got the BBQ Turkey Meatloaf, Candied Yams, and mama's potatoe salad. The bbq on the turkey meatloaf was fantatic. It was savory and spiced just right. The turkey meatloaf felt like it was missing something. Its hard to place just what it might be... maybe some cumin or perhaps some red pepper flakes... i just don't know what... overall the meatloaf was moist and tender. The edges had the delicious crispness to it. The candied yams were fantastic you could really taste the brown sugar, a little of cinnamon, and a hint of the pineapple!!! Whoever made them put their foot in it! Same goes for the potatoe salad. It was tangy and savory with decent chucks of potatoes! The portions were a perfect amount. The staff was friendly and service was fast for it being a Sunday evening. Make sure you make reservations because if you dont it might be challenging to get a table. Next time i have to try the eggnog waffles."
2/12/2022,5 star rating,Parking was a bit tough on a Sunday afternoon but well worth the drive. Once parked we were seated right away. We had the option to sit indoors or out and we decided outdoors. There was live entertainment singing old classics. The catfish tenders and wings were great. Came out hot. The oxtails was full of flavors and the Mac and cheese was excellent. On to dessert....AMAZING red velvet cake. A Harlem staple
12/11/2020,4 star rating,"I got here off of the recommendation of a good friend who was a huge fan of the restaurant from the pre-covid days. And while the food was indeed delicious, I think some of the presentation (resulting from the necessity of remaining compliant with the current covid regulations) was diminished to say the least.That said, we were quickly seated, the staff was super friendly and attentive, and our food came out in a timely manner. We had fired chicken (dark meat gang over here), collard greens, mac and cheese, and sweet potatoes. Drinks too, all pictured. While everything was really authentic and tasty I can't help but imagine (as my friend also assured me) that the normal restaurant experience was far superior. Obviously I can't and won't hold that against them here and eagerly await the moment where things are normal again and I can enjoy the full experience. And you should too.Go here fam."
7/31/2021,5 star rating,"We saw Melba's on F*** That's Delicious and couldn't stop thinking about it - the food 100% lived up to/exceeded our expectations. The eggnog waffle was fluffy and delicious, and the strawberry spread was incredible. The fried chicken was excellent - the breading/skin was crispy and perfect. The catfish was excellent and came with two sides - which were actually my favorite part. The mac and cheese was quite possibly my favorite of all time, and the collard greens were outstanding - perfectly seasoned! I fully recommend dining here!"
11/6/2020,3 star rating,How can I say this nicely... overrated. I had heard all about Melba's on tv but damn this place is all hype and no substance.  They are known for their chicken and waffles and that dish was not good. Here are the details:They have 2 different options for the chicken and waffles. One had white meat and the other had dark meat. I went with the white meat chicken and waffle for $18.95. The chicken did not taste freshly made and I knew it because it came out a few minutes after ordering.  I know that freshly fried chicken takes a little while to fry properly. Learned that on DDD.  The breading wasn't crunchy and the meat was dried out.  No good. The waffle wasn't bad and had a nice texture to it so that was positive. I liked the strawberry butter that comes with it.  It is a small portion for $18.95 and no one likes small portions. My friend ordered the salmon and said it was just ok. The salmon was $25 for small piece of salmon. I could get one of those at whole foods warm section for $10 and probably would have been better. The mac and cheese wasn't great either. It had a layer of cheese on top that was offputting and it tasted bland. I don't know what happened at Melba's but they have to relook at some of their signature dishes. I have had fried chicken all over and that was not in the top 50.  This place is all hype and it falls flat. 3 stars is a generous score.
5/22/2021,4 star rating,Yum! ordered takeout around 2pm on a Sunday and ate in the park nearby. Original plan was to eat in but the wait was over an hour (Fyi! make a reservation). Ordered the classic chicken and waffles. strawberry butter is soooo good. The mac and cheese was also delicious and extra cheesy. Fish and chips came with seasoned waffle fries and i was so excited to eat them. will be back when i'm in the neighborhood!

5/29/2022,4 star rating,Each time I visited the restaurant the food has been excellent.  My only concern is the length of time it takes for the food to be served.  The staff look like they are being overworked and doing a lot.  There is a need for more staff and reorganization  of how the staff is being utilized so the flow of service can be less chaotic but more efficient.
1/26/2022,5 star rating,"The food was awesome! I had the country catfish dinner, 2 crab cakes on the side, and a rum punch. You will have to wait before being seated, depending on which day you go, but it's worth it. The drinks, the food and the wall art are wonderful. I have been here twice and I will be going back! There will be a wait before getting food depending on the time you go. You can sit inside or outside."

5/30/2022,1 star rating,"I went to Melba's with too high of expectations. My mom and I treated my aunt for her birthday along with her husband, however the treat became a trick. The seating inside is way cramped, after being seated we immediately scanned the menu codes so we could order as soon as possible, member's of my party are all diabetics. We ordered wings and crab cakes for appetizers along with drinks and food not wasting time. The appetizers and the food came at the same time 50 minutes later during this time our server never came to check on us never  even made eye contact. The appetizers wings were fried dry the lump crab looked like a lump of coal! The oxtails and potato salad were ok the grilled chicken was grilled to a dry rubber crisp, the sautéed spinach was very bland the yams were good , rice and beans were just okay. The salmon was over cooked and the beef short ribs were cold. Overall Completely Disappointed!!! Don't believe the hype!!!"
5/12/2021,5 star rating,"My bestfriend was in the mood for soul food so we came here ! Took us a while to find Parking. So if you live far I would Uber it . I will next time. The inside is ok. You can tell they might be renovating and adjusting to COVID-19 regulations . There is tons of PPE. As well as temperature checks on arrival. They also have outdoor seating .The 15 minute wait on a Tuesday Night let me know I would be in for some good eats. We Both Had peach margaritas to start. I would rate it average compared to other margaritas. I've had . I also had to crab cakes as an appetizer. Worth it ! I would definitely order it again . FULL of crab meat and well seasoned. For dinner we both had the catfish dinner I had greens and Mac . She had yams and Mac . I really enjoyed the greens and the catfish was perfect . The Mac and cheese was on the creamy side, I did enjoy it as well.But the highlight of my night was the Service !!!Megan was a star. I enjoyed her energy as soon as she walked over to our table . She's definitely the reason why I would visit again. Would I come back ? Yes !! Should you ? Absolutely and get the crab cakes"
11/4/2021,1 star rating,Ten years later (after my last update) and these guys STILL have a C for their restaurant grade from NYC. Ugh! Gross! Get it together Melba's! Southern fried mouse droppings is not tasty!
12/10/2011,1 star rating,"What a shame to have to update this review. It used to be a great option for some delicious food and good service, but on my recent trip I noticed there was no grade posted (not even a ""grade pending""), which I've found typically means bad news that the owner is trying to hide. I looked them up on the NYC Health Grades website, and sure enough...they have a ""C""! No thanks!!! Get your grade back up to an ""A"" and I'll come back for more!"
2/20/2022,1 star rating,Ordered to go. I was truly disappointed. Chicken and waffles wasn't up to par. Taste like frozen waffles the chicken was so so done but bland. Never again.
10/12/2020,3 star rating,"I came here to have a Sunday Southern dinner for two and was a bit underwhelmed. Keep in mind that some of my less than positive remarks might be due to modifications in food preparation and service because of COVID-19 I ordered the catfish with a side of tres mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, and collard green. Unfortunately, everything, with the exception of the collard greens, tasted pretty plain Jane. I do not know, it seemed like fish and the mashed potatoes had no seasoning or flavor. Our waitress did inform us that the food would come in to-go containers in order to prevent cross-contamination. My partner and I were kind of confused because many restaurants in Harlem (and NYC) have been using real plates and utensils. What I thought was going to be a nice Sunday dinner ended up feeling more like a picnic. If the food was going to come in plastic containers in a brown paper bag, we should have just ordered delivery from Melba's . . . at least we could have used plates and silverware. Perhaps, Melba's was having an off day so I will not write off the restaurant, especially since it has great reviews on Yelp."
11/20/2021,5 star rating,"Got to see the amazing woman behind this amazing restaurant, as she was being interviewed! My brunch companion had to cancel so I ordered takeout because I really love their food! The trains caused me to be delayed over 30 minutes! I was stressing but when I arrived my order was ready and one of the awesome staff recognized me and greeted me with such warmth!! It is worth any ""MTA obstacle course"" to get to Melba's!! The customer service here is above any restaurant!! Everyone is treated like you're the best customer there!! In these times, that is so appreciated! This is hands down my favorite spot for brunch!!"

5/27/2021,4 star rating,"I've had good and okay experiences here at Melba's. There's no denying their food is delish. There's days there chicken and waffles are great and days that I've had it when it wasn't. Mac and cheese is always consistent and tasty. Oxtails from here are fire , but the rice and peas I've had were dry. Waiters are nice. I suggest everyone to visit on the weekday or super early on the weekend because It's super busy and packed for Saturday-Sunday brunch !Check out my food blog & cocktail bar IG: Briannascravings"
12/11/2021,3 star rating,"Melba's is one of the most iconic restaurants in Harlem and definitely worth trying at least once. That being said - I think it's far from being one of the top restaurants in the area.I have been to Melba's 3 times, and all 3 times have been greeted by great service and tasty side dishes. However, their famous fried chicken has always been so dry it makes me want to ask it what type of umbrella it's using. This might be controversial, but I'd stick with the meatloaf (endgame good) instead of the chicken. You can also get the waffles with the strawberry butter as a side dish.The drinks are good and up until recently Melba's had live music every weekend. Visiting this place is definitely and experience and there is usually a YouTube/celebrity eating there (saw Dapper Dan a few months ago here!). At the end of the day though, I can't help but to think that Melba's might have become too popular too quickly and gone in the way of the tourist trap."
1/10/2022,5 star rating,The chicken and waffles were super good. Drinks were cool. The inside was nice and service was great. The vibe was all the way up.
1/26/2022,5 star rating,First off AMAZING service. I went for lunch and got fried chicken with Mac n cheese and potatoe salad it was so delicious. Definitely recommend coming here!
5/30/2021,5 star rating,"Came to Harlem on a Sunday morning and had a wonderful brunch. The food was very good!! We ordered Shrimp and Grits, Chicken and Eggnog Waffle,  Pancakes, Salmon Omelet, and the Mango Mimosas!! I recommend coming early because it gets very busy for brunch. Nice atmosphere as well. And worth the Uber drive to Harlem."
1/23/2022,4 star rating,"I definitely would recommend this place! The food is seasoned to perfection. I had the oxtails. Although drinks are a bit pricey, you can taste the spirits! Yams were not toooo sweet, just yummy."
5/19/2021,2 star rating,"I enjoyed the ambiance overall because I am a sucker for the cultural uniqueness of Harlem. This place does not disappoint in that aspect.However the food is a different story. My family and I came here for dinner and left very underwhelmed. I selected the catfish with 2 sides (Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes). Although the catfish was pretty flavorful, the sides were not as enjoyable as I'd hope especially considering only 1 piece of fish was served. Mashed potatoes had a texture of slop and just was off putting. I took two ""bites"" and pushed it to the side. The Mac and cheese, biggest disappointment. The texture of the Mac was gritty as if the roux for the cheese sauce was undone and could still taste the flour and it's texture. Also the noodles were a bit too al dente. I'm willing to try Melba's again for brunch, but I will not go out of my way to do so since time spent in NYC is limited."
6/6/2021,4 star rating,"Loved loved loved my meal at Melba's. Grabbed takeout in the heart of COVID winter, and took my meal to a park bench nearby to enjoy. The fried chicken was amazing and I'm still thinking about the sweet potatoes. Will definitely be going back to Melba's and hopefully for some indoor seating in the near future!"
3/19/2022,4 star rating,"Fried chicken with mac & cheese were marvelous! My friend had ox tails which were also awesome! Only issue is that it was super crowded, it's a little bit hard to hear anybody speak but perhaps it was because I want during Saturday lunchtime. Will write another review With a dinner experience"
6/4/2021,5 star rating,We loved Melba's and will be back soon.Food and drinks were great.We even was so very happy to meet Melba
3/19/2022,3 star rating,"Pros: I was seated pretty quickly when the hostess actually spoke and made eye contact with me. The hostess seems incredibly ""over"" busy and it's a little chaotic when you walk in. Might be a relative. Surely a family vibe in there. Pros: The people bussing the tables WORK HARD! They are bringing you water fast, your drinks, clearing tables, they are the hardest working people! Always respect those cleaning your tables! I left them tips. Because they were BUSSIN BUSSIN! Melba should be thankful for them. Ok. Our server  tried her best to be nice but you know the vibe lol. Frozen cat fish $18.99 shame shame shame. I can't even get into the frozen fried catfish. It tastes so fraudulent. I mean the breading is really tasty - but you know that frozen fish taste. Wow. I think they might save the fresh fish for the Celebs Bobby Flays and local congressmen . I guess when you're from L.A you are spoiled by the fresh fish markets. Anyway, I'll move on. My husband enjoyed his oxtails. The smothered chicken our other guest had was somewhat enjoyed. The Mac and cheese they gave me. Just look at the picture - it was a glob of cheese ball covered in noodles. This was kinda disrespectful. Laughable. The greens were kinda tasty, it's clear that sugar is added to them. I never put sugar in my greens - it might be a thing. But they were ok. If you're in Harlem and looking for a snack - this place is an option for soul food. I can't do the frozen fish ever again. But this is not a place to get your money's worth or get full. To be fair though - after the pandemic is anyone really giving 100% we do need a restructuring moment and once they start offering decent catfish - I might return."
4/6/2021,5 star rating,"It's honestly a must to update my review, Melba's is like my go to brunch spot now. Addicted to the chicken and waffles and recently tried the catfish and waffles def a must try the chipotle sauce it's paired with makes it a powerhouse of flavor. Ambiance is still good vibes, nice date or family outting.For drinks I stand by the Harlem Iced Tea, 32 oz will have you in your feelings at 2 pm, lol in a good way. Definitely a vibe!I had to add that one more star due to service, the hospitality is on point. Recently, I had an issue with my uber eats order and uber eats didn't really help so I called the restaurant directly and spoke to Megan who apologized for the error. She even offered me to come in and pick up the two sides they forgot as well as added a whole entree on the house and gave me a drink my fave Harlem Iced Tea on the house. Thank you for the great service, will continue supporting black owned businesses Melba's my number 1 fave!"
10/1/2018,4 star rating,"I went out on a date here and had a wonderful experience last Friday. Perfect date spot I suggest you make reservations because the restaurant is pretty small and popular. But definitely worth a try Ambiance: Harlem vibes w/ a twist of southern hospitality. I loved the oldies they played. Definitely a great date spot on a Friday.Food:The signature eggnog waffles with strawberry butter and chicken was so yummy! My date got the wings with collard greens and baked Mac and cheese he enjoyed every bite.We shared the catfish appetizer it was okay nothing special Service:The service was on point I loved the servers suggestions for food and my cup was continuously filled with water. The host was nice he was about to seat me but asked the owner Melba first and she said I couldn't be seated...just was a little disappointed I had to wait till my date arrived to be seated...it was only a party of 2 this made no sense to me. Despite the wait Melba was very professional and active helping the host and making sure everything was running smooth with a big smile.Will definitely be back, overall we had a good experience"
11/21/2020,5 star rating,Spent some time at Melba's today and it was another awesome experience. I absolutely love Melba's eggnog waffle with strawberry butter and the fried catfish and shrimp are delicious. The ASAP yams are always on point and the Mac and Cheese is consistently a hit. The service is also great; the servers are quick and attentive. When in Harlem stop at Melbas
10/25/2020,3 star rating,"CONS1. Baked Mac n Cheese was BLAND it needed more Flavor...2. Jamaican Oxtails was Tender but BLAND. Desperately needed Flavor and a Distant Hot Kick if it's going to Compete with Golden Krust on Flavor. Honestly, the Price of $28.00 needs to be DROPPED to $15.00. So not worth the price. I think keeping it Soul Food Style Oxtails would be Best unless you going to Stand Out as The Best Jamaican Oxtails with Extra Flavor and Hot Kick. Other than that the Cut Size of the oxtails are good.PROS1. Collard Greens was Well Cleaned and SUPER Flavor with a Distant Hot Kick. (Very Addicting.) That Distant Hot Kick is what the Jamaican Style Oxtails need.... Don't be afraid of Scotch Bonnet Peppper People. No Hot Sauce on my food either. I want The Hot Peppers to Marinate and make love to all the flavors within that pot just like your Collard Greens.2. Sweet Tea Cocktail was Strong and Delicious.3. Rum Punch was Strong and Delicious.4.Smothered Fried Chicken needs more Flavor but the Gravy SAVED that dish...5. Jamaican Style Rice and Peas was Well Cooked but needed more Coconut Milk Flavor. 6. Friendly Staff.7. Nice and Cozy Interior and Exterior."
5/22/2022,1 star rating,"Lol. I've been here a couple times before and the service was nice and the ambiance was okay. However, this most recent time I went with my family that was visiting NYC for my graduation, just shows that I'll NEVER be coming back EVER. We followed every single correct precaution to get our fair service and still got treated like TRASH. First of all, the staff picks and chooses when they want to pick up the phone to even make reservations or reply to emails. So we showed up to Melba's to make a reservation and were told it was going to be an hour and 15 minute wait however after an hour and 40 minutes we never received a single text, call, email, or any form of communication! So we decided to just show up and ask about our reservation ourselves and not surprising enough there were a ton of other groups still waiting to even be seated or served. When we finally get a waitresses attention she tells us there's a table outside that will be cleaned and ready for us soon. However we're waiting for that and they STILL haven't even cleaned the damn table ! So at this point we've waited a good 3 HOURS and are getting antsy and irritated! Then when we sit at the outside table, there's no waitress for us but then another waitress tells us they are preparing a table inside for us so we don't get rained on. So we have a little hope for our experience until we go back in and the manager, who I believe had one of the worst attitudes and unprofessionalism I think I've ever seen, tells us that there's actually no table inside for us. So there's obviously a miscommunication problem between her and the staff. She then continues to single out the waitress and chastise her in front of all the customers which was so unprofessional and embarrassing to see. We also saw that there were 3 different parties of non POCs that came AFTER us that got seated way before us. It was so obvious that the manager was prioritizing their feelings and experiences over customers who fairly waited their turn. It's absolutely disgusting and I want them to know that we SAW it. Anyways we are told to go back outside AGAIN! While sitting outside we got better service from the literal rats scurrying around than the actual staff I'm so serious. We were seated right by the trash so we decided to change tables ourselves and end up sitting next to a celebrity. After changing spots next to them, we immediately noticed that were were finally getting served! It felt like they only cared when someone with high status was in vicinity. Listen I don't even like dragging Black owned businesses, however this poor service is giving black businesses a bad name it's so disappointing to see. Definitely don't waste your time coming here. You can find better soul food and service elsewhere in the city. Stop treating your staff and customers like shit period."
7/22/2020,5 star rating,"Melba's is giving life to Harlem before, during  and hopefully after this pandemic.   Fresh ingredients, delicious food, prompt and top notch service all get 5 stars from me.  While the dining location was nice, takeout orders and al fresco dining have not changed the fare one bit.I legitimately did not have to give the grace that  eating out during a pandemic requires because Melbas is on point.  I've had their creamy, flavorful tres mac and cheese which was worth having as a side or if particularly ravenous, as an entree. Definitely do try it.  I seldom do not order without getting the classic caesar salad. I don't know what their secret ingredient is but I love it.The chicken is delicious and that goes without saying. Whether you get the southern fried chicken, the dry spiced wings or anything smothered in gravy or sauteed.  I can't really think of anything that I do not like about Melbas so make your selections and bring plenty of funds. While delicious, Melbas is not cheap so plan accordingly!! Enjoy!"
8/17/2021,5 star rating,I had the Southern Fried Chicken & Eggnog Waffles With Strawberry Butter and Maple Syrup. The waffles were so soft and buttery almost feels like it melts in your mouth. Top it off with the strawberry butter and maple syrup your eye will roll in pleasure. The chicken was crisp to a perfection and seasoned well. I will be returning to try other dishes. This has a mixed atmosphere. You can go here for a date or out with your friend. I definitely recommend this!!!!

2/16/2022,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I took a chance on this spot for Valentine's Day and EVERYTHING WE ORDERED (which was a lot) WAS GIVING HONEY!! From the fried chicken( DROOLING) , to the crab cakes, to the shrimp (YUM) , to the greens (UNLEASHED FLAVOR), to the Mac (Pretty Good) , to the short ribs.. just everything. I even topped the already long bill off with a dessert (The Pound Cake) and some tea. It was all just very delicious. The ambiance was nice as well, it's a bit tight in there but when the vibe & food  is right you don't notice much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
3/5/2022,3 star rating,"Love Melba's but today was a miss. So much so that a review is necessary. We were excited to come back and enjoy a meal, made a reservation almost a week advance only to arrive and be told we had a 60min time limit because of someone else's large party reservation. It's in poor taste to rush customers and to no fault of our own- we were a party of two that made a reservation. We may return but with hesitation because of this. Customers shouldn't be rushed because a restaurant overbooked."
1/28/2021,2 star rating,"First time at Melbas.  It's coronavirus, it happens to be Thursday night of Restaurant Week.  I get it, life is different.  But this place is not taking proper precautions.  Super disorganized and way too many people inside.  Tons of packaged food on the bar counter but no one handing them out, so when I walked in there were 5 patrons waiting for food / trying to order.  By the time I left, there were close to 15!  BTW, the guy in the kitchen had his mask only over his mouth, not over his nose.I don't feel great about this entire experience, and will not be returning as I do not feel they are taking adequate precautions.  It's sad, I've been trying to support local businesses, and really wanted to like Melbas.  At this point, it doesn't even matter what the food tastes like cause it's not worth getting coronavirus for."

I will never ever eat here again the macaroni were slimy in my mouth
3/5/2022,5 star rating,YOU GUYS !! this is probably the best soul food restaurant I've been to very long time. I live in Atlanta which is known for soul food and I have to say this is fucking the best place I've ever been. I also had incredible service from a bartender/server called Rich. I ordered the short ribs with mac & cheese and collard greens which were also pork free which is great. We also got the catfish strips with the dry rub wings and I must say this was incredible
7/19/2020,4 star rating,"I love this place. Sometimes the food can be a little inconsistent (for example mashed potato consistency varies each time), but I really do love the flavor put into the food. I really feel like I am eating southern home cooking. The collard greens aren't as good as at Amy Ruth's but they're not bad. The Mac and cheese is my favorite and I always pair it with some mashed potatoes. I love how they leave some skin in to give it that unprocessed taste and texture. It's very cool that they give you the option to order just one wing. Sometimes you want just one more! I'll continue to eat at this lovely Harlem spot."
9/10/2021,5 star rating,5/5. Amazing food and vibes. If you're looking for some good food in the heart Harlem Melba's is the place to go. The catfish is to die for and mashed potatoes outstanding. Oh and the A$AP Yams.....

1/25/2021,4 star rating,"Online order was easy but required 30 min wait.  Smothered chicken with collard green and onion rings.  It came with just one piece of chicken and the portion is quite small.  It was quite tasty.  The collard green is a bit salty for me and I could taste a hint of a kick.  The onion rings came with 3 large rings and it was quite good.  The highlight was the carrot cake.  The portion was generous slice of cake, moist, dense and sweet with nuts and raisin.  Definitely will come back for this."

The customer service made me feel right at home. From the time we walked in, to after we left, everyone was so friendly toward us. The food was amazing. I had the tres Mac and cheese with spinach and collard greens. So tasty!! Seasoned very well. The only downside were the amount of flies in the restaurant. Nonetheless, I can't wait to return."
12/21/2021,5 star rating,"First of all I have lived in Harlem since 2003. This is my first time at Melba's. Now that I have been to Melba's  I have to ask myself- WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG?!? The food is ah-maze-ing... soooo good! I was going to take pictures of the Catfish dinner (comes with 2 sides you choose from the sides menu): I took one bite of the collards and did not stop until my plate was cleaned... I brought 2 people with me who were from out of town and they raved about the Shrimp, the sweet potatoes, the macaroni AND chili onion rings! THE drinks were superb too! Try the Strawberry Hennessy... MUAH! Also excellent Margaritas. I will be back for certain."
5/16/2020,2 star rating,"I really, really wanted to have the most poetic set of words to describe my experience at Melba's today, but I was let down.Will start with saying thank you for accepting orders over the phone. I placed two orders: 1) beef ribs with sides of Mac & candied yams then 2) fried catfish with sides of potato salad & sautéed spinach. We also got a red velvet cake for dessert.It might be the Jamaican in me but I did not know that sautéed spinach was going to be collard greens with neck bones. I could've cried! Literally! The only meat I eat is seafood so seeing the big ol' bone in the greens made my soul hurt deep down. Now let me explain how I felt when I saw the one likkle piece ah catfish inna me plate! It was like when a kid wakes to use the bathroom and sees their parents putting the gifts under the Xmas tree. My potato salad was the one thing I was a huge fan of.  It was sweet and veggies pickled just right.My sister wasn't a fan of her ribs. She described them as lackluster. The Mac didn't really have much salt in it. She enjoyed the candied yams though.The red velvet cake was okay. Enjoyable enough to add the finishing touch to a basic meal. The icing wasn't too sweet.Melba's, I feel like if you're going to charge $19.50 for a catfish meal, there should be more than just 1 skinny piece of fish in the big ol' plastic container. I felt robbed because I was looking all around the bag to see if something fell out. I wanted to give Amy Ruth's a break since their phones were hella busy, but y'all let me down, Melba's!"
1/22/2022,5 star rating,"Wonderful atmosphere! The art, the music and the service are emblematic of the best of Harlem. Our server Brian was absolutely fantastic. He was kind, gregarious, and light hearted while still being professional. The short rib sliders and collard greens = superb! The very sexy sangria = heaven! I understand the raves. Thanks for creating this space!"
1/1/2022,5 star rating,"I Love Melba's! And I Love Melba! If you don't know, Melba beat Bobby Flay on a Throwdown. She is known as the Queen of Comfort Food. I have tried almost everything on Melba's menu and nothing has ever disappointed. Her fried chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection. The Mac & Cheese is the best that I've had in the city. You must try or you will be missing out! I've also had the fried catfish, both as an appetizer and entree. The yams, mashed potatoes, collard greens, spinach, salmon are all great choices too. I still need to try the waffle which is one of the favorites. Aside from bringing amazing comfort food to Harlem, Melba has a heart of gold and donates much of her time to helping her community and supporting healthcare workers. I also forgot to mention that they have beautiful artwork displayed as well as the most fire playlist you can ask for. It's ALWAYS a party at Melba's. So don't just sit there and wait, get up now and experience the Harlem Gem where Prince Harry had his first chicken and waffle introduction! You can thank me later."
4/18/2022,5 star rating,I have been there many times.  Never had a bad meal.  Would recommend this place to everyone looking for some good soul food.
10/20/2020,3 star rating,"Disappointed, because up to my most recent visit, I would have recommended Melba's. The soul food they offer is decent, it isn't pricey, and the service is usually on point. However, my recent experience will give me pause to return. I called Melba's to reserve a party of 7 with indoor dining and was told this was a go. I later received a Yelp email that showed a reservation for 4. I called again to make sure 7 was ok and the person over the phone said it was fine and confirmed my party number and indoor dining. During the pandemic, I've been very cautious with making reservations and have been asking important questions because of the guidelines. Lo and behold, when I arrive with my group, the manager states that the reservation is in fact a party of 4 with outdoor dining. I informed the manager several times that I called twice to confirm the opposite, but he wasn't budging at all. In my opinion, his tone and demeanor were very indifferent...as if I were making up my claim. He offered to seat us at a table of 4 with two chairs added, no way would that have worked. Again, I really feel like he made no attempts to make this right. This soured my party's mood and we decided to dine elsewhere. I'm not certain where the miscommunication happened. If indeed my original request was an impossible ask, I should have been informed. It's Harlem, so I was easily able to find a restaurant that would take care of us. But I wanted to eat here because I've had great times prior to this incident...unfortunate."

I had the signature waffle and fried chicken with strawberry flavored butter.It such as tasty meal and that butter is so unique, I am astonished at how well it went with the waffle.Seating and food service was excellent. Adequate spacing and  plexiglass between tables."

Live texting , while here and haven't seen a drink or food in about 20 minutes !!  Ask about a bottle of Prosecco, a glass , 40 minutes later haven seen a drink !!  Cheap champagne made it's way to the table , that is falling apart as we lay our phones !! But we move it from the table , since the table failed . We have been asked about appetizers 5 times already ."

1/17/2021,5 star rating,"Soul food done right! We ordered thru UberEats and it took longer than we had hoped, but I understand because I'm sure their restaurant had hella traffic. The food is fantastic here!My favorite has to be the smothered chicken. Reminds me of the friend chicken and gravy we'd eat back home in the Philippines. Though I was craving rice, the sides were a fantastic substitute! The collard greens quickly became my favorite, closely followed by the Mac and cheese. Both had great balance of flavor and texture and went perfectly with the flavors of the two proteins we ordered. My only low is that I wish the catfish was crunchier. It's also a bit on the price-y side (around $30 per person via delivery, then drinks on top of that) and my boyfriend and I sadly didn't have any leftovers, but I'd come back (with a bigger group! This food is asking for family style eating) in a heartbeat."
6/5/2021,3 star rating,"The food was OK, a bit overpriced. The service started off good and went downhill quickly. Our food took a long time to come out, our server asked if our food was out and clearly the table was empty. 10 minutes after that, our food came out. We asked for extra utensils because our table was wobbly and they fell off, we were given plastics to replace actual silverware. When after being there for more than hour, we asked for our check and a box. We had to go look for our server because we had been waiting to ask for our check.  We waited 20 minutes for our check. We never got checked on, even when we were waiting to order more drinks. Do not recommend on the weekends (Saturday)."
3/3/2020,5 star rating,I really do love this place. The atmosphere and decor is very calm and light feel good music played. I came here for brunch twice. The most recent tome for my birthday with my family. I didn't wanna choose too much of a party brunch spot since my parents were with me but still wanted some music and good vibes. This place was perfect. Food is great. Drinks are great. Service is excellent. A friend and I order strawberry henny drinks. Which were great but didn't quite taste the henny (haha). He graciously got use a shot each to pour into our drinks. Very lovely and accommodating. But mindful to just order yourself an additional shot for that drink if you want it to be a tad more stronger. I now know moving forward. It does get busy and packed. So be prepared to wait a tad try to come before 1pm. Or you'll wait about 30 mins. Not bad. And all worth it. I'll be back for sure. Love this black owned spot. Support and GO FOR IT!
10/31/2021,4 star rating,"Once again other Sunday brunch, we decided to head to Harlem to Melba's which offers outdoor dining for none vaccinated ppl and indoor dining if you have proof of vaccination. Upon arriving it was a 45 minutes to a hour wait it was very busy, this restaurant is very popular which means the food is good,the staffs was pleasant and friendly. I decided to go with my favorite brunch meal chicken and waffles which I enjoyed alot the chicken tasted fresh and delicious, waffles was nice and fluffy besides the food take sometime I enjoyed every bite I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
4/7/2021,4 star rating,"We got takeout the other night, so I can't speak to the restaurant experience. I ordered the catfish plate with potato salad and yams. The catfish was one medium size filet, pan fried, but not cornmeal crusted like I was expecting/is what I've come to know as ""fried"" catfish. I was a bit surprised at the size of the filet given the price, but I suppose the servings on the sides made up for it. The yams were good, but the potato salad was a bit of a miss for me personally- more mashed up than I like and involving a lot of mustard. Overall good, but now that I know what their fried catfish is like I may see what other joints have to offer before coming here again. I do have to mention- roommate is enamored with their Mac and cheese- and it did look really good."
5/19/2021,1 star rating,The outdoor seating had some shade today in the beautiful but hot weather. The issue is the restroom was filthy. The service wasn't the best. There were only 6 tables occupied with about 4 servers. I really raved about this place and drove here today from Westchester county to eat some soul food. My mind was set on this place since yesterday. It was terrible. Salty. Everything was salty. The waitress really tried to lead us to decide what to choose. Not suggesting- but pushing us like a car salesman. I really got agitated with her behavior; it's only lunch time girl. I looked over at some elderly folks sticking their forks in the Mac and cheese and cringed.
6/14/2021,4 star rating,"Very good establishment. Tip though; Make a reservation. They get very busy and packed fast . Rightfully so. My friend and I tried our luck with walking in and luckily were sat in about 15 minutes. But the food was definitely worth the wait. The fried chicken was literally mouth watering. The Mac & cheese was nice and cheesy, not too greasy . The potato salad tasted just like mom makes . The ambiance of it was on point . It felt like we were eating after being in church for 5 hrs lol. I took a star away because the staff could do a little better as far as directing traffic in and out of the restaurant. Other than that, 10/10. Will definitely be returning"
4/29/2021,4 star rating,"I actually heard a lot about this place but I never had a chance to visit. I recently attended a open house lottery being held by my sons new charter school here. The place is rather small , however it's feels rich with the history of Harlem attached to it. I definitely plan to visit on a more relaxed note in the near future."
1/11/2020,4 star rating,"tl:dr: The food is tasty. Just like mama used to make.We came here before Ta-Nehisi Coates' *Between the World and Me* at the Apollo on a Saturday night hoping for cocktails and some good home cooking. We weren't disappointed.We were a little daunted by the line out the door, but everyone was congenial and polite, and our reservations got us seated right away. And once we were at our table, it seemed like there was plenty of space for those waiting. IOW, the line went fast, but reservations are still a good idea.We got fried chicken (of course!) and fried catfish (what else?). Each of these main dishes came with two sides, which we shared: collard greens, mashed potatoes, candied yams, and mac & cheese. Everything was really tasty. Really tasty. Our only complaint? and we both felt this way: The main portions were skimpy, especially for the price ($18 and $19). One chicken leg. One piece of catfish. You'll be filling up on sides, doncha know.Service was efficient, if not warm. It feels like a diner. We were in the auxiliary room, so maybe the main room is warmer? Even so, the place pulsed with good chatter and laughter."
4/3/2021,5 star rating,"This is a really nice place. My first time here n everything was so good. We made a reservation for seating, but there were plenty of people (door dash) doing take out. The service is excellent, which is always a plus. Everyone seems so happy to be at work. I didn't get our waiters name but he was the best. I had the fried chicken, mac n cheese n yams. Their fried chicken is sooooo good, crispy on the outside juicy on the inside. The mac n cheese is just right. The yams were definitely better at Amy Ruth, however they were still very good. They don't serve cornbread or biscuits... kinda weird for a souls food spot.  The food makes up for it ... by the tine you finish eating you realize you don't need it. Don't sleep on the pineapple lemonade... omgooooodness, that was so bomb . My son had the short ribs, they were meaty n falling off the bone. We ordered desert to go, haven't even tried it yet but it looks good. I'll have to update after I eat tomorrow. I will definitely be returning to Melba's. Ohk... had to come back n edit for my desert choice. Their pineapple coconut cake is a 10. I was a little skeptical ( just very picky about deserts) I was pleasantly surprised by how moist n dense my slice was. I'm also a fan of frosting n most places miss the mark with me ... not Melba's this frosting was everything"
11/21/2019,4 star rating,"Brunnnnnnnching in Harlem!!!Mellllllllba's... I'm calling out your name because this food is on point. There is really no place to wait, unless you want to wait at the bar. The manager/guy at the front door, tall gentleman, was extremely nice.  His customer service was top notch.  We waited a bit for a seat, but he never hesitated to keep us updated on when we would be seated.  I really appreciated that. It reminded me of the Southern Hospitality that I am used to.The music was a nice vibe and kept me in the eating brunch mood... lol. Seriously, I appreciated the tunes, it set the mood.Nowwwww for the big reveal:  THE FOOD!!!I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and the first dish came out a bit cold, slightly under lukewarm, which does not do the dish justice. The Grits were cooked all the way, which you dont always find in some dishes.  I was excited about that.  Additionally,  the shrimp was really good.  It was not the miniature shrimp, but nice large shrimp cooked to perfection.  However, I would recommend that the restaurant use bowls for this dish and not beveled plates.  It is almost like an optical illusion in that it appears that you get more than what you really get (in terms of portion size).  Then dish is tasty,  could use a spicy component (or the ability to order it spicy- maybe I didn't ask if that option existed), and would need to be slightly larger in portion size.  Needless to say, this dish wasnt that filling, maybe I am just used to everything being ""bigger in Texas.""I also tasted the waffles and the strawberry butter... OMG, they were excellent.   The waffle was nice and fluffy.  It was not crusty like most places and the strawberry butter just set it off right! In essence, I enjoyed my experience at Melba's, the hospitality was on point, and I'll try something new next time I'm there.  #staytuned"

Our waitress from the first night came over to say hi the second night. We can't wait to go back."

5/31/2021,5 star rating,"Walked into the restaurant and asked about seating. We were told it would be 30 mins. I asked what about if there are open tables outside. We were told we could sit at one of the open tables but not the outdoor constructed booth because that's for guests with 5+ people. Unfortunately the only table available outside was on the corner and leaned over. We took that table but noticed it took awhile to get a menu. They only have one person taking orders and that was Tara! So we ordered appetizers, calamari and dry rub wings well done. Drinks, margarita and one pineapple margarita. Starters and drinks were great. Wings & calamari were freshly made. We were able to switch our table to an open booth. Thank you to that gentleman that allowed us to switch. Food was catfish, collard greens & Mac n cheese for me. My friend had catfish, collard greens with rice n beans. And we ordered 2 more margaritas. The entrees took a little longer to get to the table but it was well worth it. Catfish was seasoned well and fresh, collard greens & Mac n cheese tasted like someone's grandma made it. Everything was sooooo good! P.S. Ms. Tara needs a raise!! This young lady was taking care of all the orders with a smile and grace! Had to give a great tip...it was well deserved. The bus gentleman was fast when it came to delivering the food to the table, Sanitizing the tables afterwards, etc. Ms. Melba, you have staff! I highly recommend this place & will be back again, again, again!"

Fish was seasoned and freshly prepared. Cheese grits was delicious, just added a little black pepper for my liking.Not a mimosa fan, so I ordered a lemonade. Lemonade was very sweet, had to pour my water in the glass. But overall, was a great experience. Coming back for more. See ya next time."

No separate checks and 20% gratuity.  They have a full bar and a variety of specialty drinks. Atmosphere was very nice with music in the background and very nice and creative art pieces on the walls.  For a large party,  food came out in good timing.  The collard greens were my favorite dish as well as the spring rolls.Friendly service, great atmosphere for groups, a date or a drink at the bar. Weekend visit reservations are good for a large party.  Some parking located on the street."
11/19/2020,4 star rating,"Inside seats only if you make a reservation! We ended up sitting outside because we didn't make a reservation and it was pretty chilly haha but wasn't too bad. They had lots of seats outside so we didn't wait at all. They had the QR code's for the menu which I always appreciate. They also brought out our food on disposable take out containers, I know not the best for the environment but the circumstances... so I was okay with that.I came with 3 other friends and we ordered 4 dishes and decided to share amongst the four of us.Southern fried chicken dark, white + eggnog wafflesThey advertise that this won against Bobby flay on throwdown! And I can definitely see why. The chicken meat is so juicy and tender. Even the white meat, so good. The strawberry butter is delicious on top of the eggnog waffles that just melt in your mouth, they're so fluffy. I haven't eaten too many chicken and waffles so I'm not too experienced but this was deliciousCountry catfish + eggnog wafflesSame waffles but with fish and a tartar sauce that comes out. This was also really good. A little different to the chicken but overall the catfish was seasoned well and weirdly, it paired well with the waffle too.Mac and cheese Possibly my favorite. So happy we went with the Mac and cheese because it definitely topped the southern comfort feel meal we had. It was so cheesy and and warm, perfect side to the waffles. Definitely recommend the Mac and cheese.Would totally come again if I was in the area for breakfast! They don't have coffee though so just stop by next door at the Dunkin' Donuts!"
3/26/2021,5 star rating,"My sister and I dropped in after visiting a nearby popup shop. There was no wait for a table for two on a Sunday evening. They take your temperature at the door & your info for contact tracing purposes. They also have plexiglass between the tables, so it felt very safe. Curtis, our waiter was so friendly & helpful. He gave great drink & food suggestions. My sister got the strawberry Henny, which she enjoyed & I got the Harlem iced tea, which packed a punch (just as Curtis said it would!). For starters we got the Catfish Strips, they were lightly  battered & seasoned well. I was torn between the Smothered Chicken & Chicken & Waffles so Curtis suggested I get the chicken n waffles with gravy on the side...genius! The chicken was moist on the inside & crispy on the outside, the waffles come with a homemade strawberry butter that is delish! I also got a side of mac n cheese because why not...it was creamy & really cheesy. My sister had the smothered chicken with collards & mac n cheese; she thoroughly enjoyed her meal. I would definitely come back if I'm in Harlem, hell I'd come to Harlem just to have this food again! Awesome service & great food."
3/15/2021,2 star rating,"Saw Melba's written up on a list of 45 great spots for outdoor dining, so decided to give it a try. They did have outdoor seating, with gas heaters. You order at the bar, and they bring the food out to you.  What we didn't know is that this ""service"" meant them just dropping a paper bag of take out on your table. So, no service, they just basically give you a spot to eat your take out. As for the food: the chicken was dry, and the waffle tasted like the waffle you make yourself at a Hampton Inn. Not coming back anytime soon. Service: nonexistentFood: mediocreGas heaters: warm"

Friends have told me how good this place was and the Fn  confirmed it.We went in one late Saturday afternoon on an empty stomach.  Trust me, this is a prerequisite to come here!!We had a friendly waitress.. Place is definitely cozy for a date night.  I had chicken, mac.n cheese and greens.  Lemme tell you, I very picky when it comes to mac, and greens and this place gets my stamp of approval.  Mac and cheese tastes homemade and definitely no hints that it came from the box.  Greens were good but a little to overcooked. Chicken was love! Hot flavorful and  fresh.My friend had chicken, and waffles. Tasty tasty!!!  Next trip: well their brunch and ribs!!This place is definitely a must!!"
10/31/2021,1 star rating,The Buffalo chicken wings had to be sent back because they came out cold. They were okay but not HOT when they came out the second time. I didn't enjoy the Mac n cheese because it was too liquidy and creamy. The collards were too salty. And that about sums up my visit.

8/31/2021,5 star rating,"I can't express how much I love Melba's restaurant. I haven't been there in awhile especially since the pandeezy (Pandemic) hit. My usual trips to NY cut out for the year. I was happy to return back this summer and I feel like it was better than before! How is that even possible!!?? LOL Well as always I was not disappointed with my order. I've reviewed Melba's before on here but man oh man this place is truly a stable. I ordered the catfish, greens and Mac & cheese. Everything was delicious and flavorful as always but baby that catfish is out of this world. I don't know what they do back there but this is the only place where the catfish doesn't have that fishy taste. Yes I know catfish is fish so it should taste fishy but if you've had it before you know exactly what I'm talking about. ALSO the fish is fully boneless I'm talking no bones what so ever. Out of the many times I've been here for the catfish I never had a small piece or anything inside. No lie my mouth is watering as I type this review. I also enjoyed the outdoor option, it felt more spacious and it was pretty nice enjoying a delicious meal in the NY summer night. I would HIGHLY recommend Melba's and especially the catfish, oh and that sauce that comes on the side too! If you're visiting NY you must stop by before you leave."
10/30/2017,5 star rating,Another successful trip to Melba's! This is my fourth time coming here and I will continue. The food was delicious and flavorful.

7/28/2020,5 star rating,"Every thing was amazing except the macaroni which wasn't disgusting but not my taste. It had an extra seasoning that I couldn't pinpoint but it wasn't my preferred flavor! 1.) sea bass- cooked perfectly and the crunch on top was perfect! This was a HIT!2.) greens-sweet yet savory at the same time3.) yams-sweet but nothing over sweet to the point where you are eating a dessert. The yams still taste like yams and they were fresh and bomb!4.) short ribs- amazing! Tender and seasoned well.5.) waffle-very good! I love the strawberry butter!5.) fried chicken- I didn't care for the huge size wings BUT the flavor was good and the meat wasn't tough!! Those frank hot sauce packets are bomb!! 6.) crab cakes! They actually had lots of crab and little filler! The only thing that was missing was a homemade sauce. They gave us tartar packets which was surprising but could be due toCovid. Overall, I'll be back next time I visit NY! It was THAT good! Oh and one last thing, the strawberry henney and mixed sangria (red and white) were bomb as well!! lol"

The picture says it all..... will not be adding a pic of the crab cakes. This rating is a waste of my time! They're lucky they even get 1 star from me! Let alone a RATING! I almost forgot why I should never eat from here again. This has definitely burned a horrible image for sure. I will never order from here AGAIN! I really don't know how they're even open."
9/16/2021,3 star rating,"My date ordered the chicken and waffles, both of which were excellent, though the strawberry butter was a bit too sweet for the waffles & seemed like it was trying to be remarkable rather than good. I was excited to see what such a well-regarded place would do with wild salmon (which seemed a bit out of place), so I ordered it, and got something that was obviously farmed. Very disappointed; there was no good reason to lie on the menu. Farmed salmon is a perfectly reasonable thing to offer, and in that case I'd have tried the oxtail or short ribs instead, which I expect are good. But I have a one-strike policy for straight-up lying about the food, in print, on the menu."
11/25/2021,1 star rating,"My family was looking forward to eating Thanksgiving dinner prepared by Melba's. At first I called to ask when to place the order since we were picking it up to dine in. I was instructed to call back a day later to place the order. When I called back to place the order, I was told that I didn't need to place an order in advance and merely needed to come in on Thanksgiving day to place the order and get the food. Today, Thanksgiving, we showed up at 12:50pm (they opened at 12:30pm) to Melba's. We were informed that they were no longer accepting orders for take out. The pathetic explanation offered was they had too many take out orders and couldn't handle anymore. What? Furious doesn't aptly express my disappointment and disgust. My family was livid. Not only couldn't we get food from Melba's, it was too late to order from any other decent place in Harlem that serves similar cuisine. What a crappy way to treat customers and run a restaurant! We won't ever be back!"

9/9/2019,4 star rating,"I came here on two occasions.The first time, I came for dinner and had the Jumbo Shrimp with Mac n' cheese and French fries. I do not recommend the fries, they were just okay.  The Mac n' cheese was amazing! It was heavy, creamy, and oozing in sauce-y, warm, cheesy goodness!Ordering the shrimp was a wrong move for me. I mean they were okay but it felt like a small or light portion somehow.My friend had come and had the ribs... I just had a few bites but her ribs were to die for! The portion size was huge and they were flavorful and full of meat on the bone. I really need to come back and get them. I'd also like to come back to try the mashed potatoes and gravy and collared greens as sides. I like how the entrees come with 2 sides included. The second time, I came for brunch and had the Smothered fried chicken, slab bacon, and home fries. The smothered fried chicken was delicious; the gravy really hit the spot. I had white meat which was $1 more. The slab bacon was nice as a concept for heavier bacon but I would not want to do it again necessarily. Overall, I enjoyed both experiences but think I like the dinner menu a bit more in terms of the options personally. I really need to go back and order the ribs!"

Upon sitting we noticed there were gnats and flies  in the restaurant in our section. Yuck! Waiter seemed attentive at first. Ordered appetizers and with entrees, everything came out together. The collard greens were extremely salty, my mom and daughter couldn't continue to eat theirs. One small piece of catfish which was ridiculous. Mac & Cheese here is very, very overrated. Waiter checked on us once and totally forgot about us. Had to inquire about dessert from the busboy. I also had to track down another employee to receive my bill and paid it upfront. Sucky experience, having to dodge flies and deal with non existent customer service, along with salty food!"
9/12/2021,2 star rating,"COVID HEADQUARTERSNo rules whatsoever based on who is the host or hostess. Tried two days in a row and the outside crowd on a Sunday kept going in the restaurant with no masks.  The hostess on Friday and Saturday nights asked only one person from our party if we were vaccinated to sit inside and asked NO ONE from a group of guys for proof of vaccination and sat them inside.Don't complain when your staff and patrons fall ill if you don't want to abide by the law. And they KNOW those patrons have all kinds of preexisting conditions. If they are this lax, imagine how dirty the kitchen must be.Food was below average at that. Collards were salty. Fish was chewy.  Waffle was hard. Drinks were stale. The waitress was extremely nice and that is why this establishment is getting 2 stars.Go elsewhere!"
8/16/2021,2 star rating,"The food was really good. But the staff and poor service this past Sunday ruined the whole experience for me. I gave two stars because a young lady who ended up trying to help out offered free dessert for all the mess. I waited almost over  an hour for chicken and waffles and a burger. The burger did actually come out an hour later. The waiter promised to comp the burger, I receive my bill after over 2 hours of being there and the total was fine. Once I hand my waiter my card and signed receipt back, he hands me a recipe charging my card an extra $30! Idk wtf they are trying to pull in there. But I'm not buying it. They couldn't even produce me a refund receipt for the erroneous charge. But thank God I have Chase and they always give you back your money. You guys need more staff for something. Idk why I was sat down at 3:45 and left at almost 6 ........ for a burger and waffles and chicken ..... smh"

Amazing as usual. My friend ordered the oxtail which was also tasty. Finished it all off with red velvet cake...YUM! Staff is amazing!! Good vibes!"

8/8/2021,2 star rating,"We absolutely love Melba's and we have been coming since 2015 and have noticed a decline in the quality of food. This review is a cry for help in an effort to bring Melbas food back to where it was.  We ask that someone tastes the food before it is served.  In addition, we would like to thank Amani for trying to salvage our experience. Let's make Melba great again!  Please do not sell out to the gentry."
12/15/2021,5 star rating,"We ordered catfish, collard greens, yams, macaroni & cheese, eggnog waffle, sliders & potato salad. Everything was delicious. The service was outstanding! Our waitress' name was ""Olay"". (That's not the correct spelling, but it is the correct pronunciation). She was the absolute best! Very charming, efficient and knowledgeable of the menu. We can't wait to go back!"
5/23/2021,4 star rating,"I've been hearing good things about this place for a while so I wanted to see if it was deserving of the hype. I ordered the short ribs with sides of A$AP Yams and collard greens, my mom ordered the fried chicken with Mac & cheese and potato salad. We also asked for the fried shrimp appetizer. The food was delicious and I recommend EVERYTHING except the fried shrimp and the Mac and cheese. Here's why.The fried shrimp came right after our entrees were delivered, but it was supposed to be an appetizer. So that's a negative. Our server, Kim, explained that the apps come out with everything because of the increased volume. Also, there were only 4 small shrimp but it cost $14. Not even jumbo shrimp or Tiger shrimp. Four shrimp, for that price? No thanks. The gross Mac and cheese couldn't be explained, so it was replaced with another side. I use the word gross because it looks like what would happen if you take boxed Kraft Mac and cheese, and tried to bake it with a slice of Velveeta on top. The taste didn't prove to be better.Manager Armani was very accommodating and offered to remove the appetizer from bill. Our server was great! She was incredibly helpful and kind. Also very attentive, as our glasses remained full. Taking a look around, I noticed that Kim was everywhere -- at many tables, service bar and handling takeout orders. She did the damn thing without attitude or rudeness and I know that's not easy. Overall, good food, gracious staff. I'd come back but not on the weekend."

9/15/2021,4 star rating,"The customer service was good. The food was average. Being from the South my expectations are high. A friend had the fried chicken and said it was excellent. I had the crab cakes and they  weren't very good. My husband had the short ribs and enjoyed it. The portions are huge, so please share if possible."
7/25/2021,5 star rating,"Went with a party of 5 and quickly got seated in a booth outside. Food was *superb*. We ordered the turkey meat loaf, wine braised beef ribs, collard greens, Mac and cheese, the potato salad etc. everything was cooked to perfection. Staff made us feel very welcome and we were greeted by Jesse- the legend herself. JESSE WE LOVE YOU"
7/3/2020,4 star rating,"For outdoor dining, they had plenty of tables outside with lots of shade. Melba's is doing such a great job to make the dining experience as convenient as possible. Our water and Arnold palmers came in to-go containers. Our food was also delivered to us in a bag like a to-go order. We initially felt bad about the environmental impact of this, but thought this was probably safer and less of a hassle for the employees and restaurant.Our server and the food were amazing. We all enjoyed our food. Two of us got the fried chicken and waffles, which they absolutely loved. I got the waffle as well as I remembered how much I loved it with the strawberry butter and syrup, but I opted for the fried fish. The fish was on point! My other friend got the oxtail stew that was also very highly praised and thoroughly enjoyed with the sides!Come and support them! This was definitely a great outdoor dining experience."
11/3/2018,4 star rating,"As much as I wanted to try something else, I thought my first meal at Melba's should be their award-winning chicken and waffle with the strawberry butter. The strawberry butter was amazing. Without it, I would've probably given this place a 3 Star. I felt that the waffle was better than Amy Ruth's, but still did not leave me wanting to come back for more."
7/30/2019,3 star rating,"I came here on a Friday evening with my family around 10 & even though they were closing at 11 we were still able to be seated. For entree's my sister & I both had the Country Catfish with yams & mac & cheese. My sister felt the catfish could've been seasoned better & I thought it was just ok. My sisters fiancé had the bbq turkey meatloaf with rice  ( I can't recall the other side ) & thought it was odd they drizzled bbq sauce on top vs cooking it with the bbq sauce. My other sister had the wine braised short ribs, which we all thought were good & it came right off the bone. My mother had wings & said they were fine. For a beverage I had the Harlem Ice Tea, which was potent & good & my sister had the Malibu Melba & said it was good. Overall if I come here again, I would probably just do drinks & apps. Melba's is conveniently located & it's a decent space size. The waiter was good & the food came out quickly too."
7/8/2021,5 star rating,"Went on a date and we were quickly seated, which I appreciated greatly. Food quality and service was excellent overall. I feel like it's a bit pricier compared to other soul food restaurants but still great nonetheless."

2/24/2022,5 star rating,"What a great meal!  The eggnog waffle with strawberry butter was to die for!  We had crab cakes, mac-and-cheese, meatloaf, and the sea bass and all was extremely delicious.  The pound cake for dessert also hit the spot.  Nice drinks and most attentive service (Curtis).  We'll definitely go back!"
11/6/2021,4 star rating,"Food was delicious and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. TIP: be sure to make reservations prior to your visit, 1 1/2 waiting time."
9/4/2021,5 star rating,I can see why Melba's beat Bobby Flay. Chicken was flavorful but not overloaded with spice. Eggnog Waffle with strawberry butter was amazing. Collard greens were perfect with a hint of spice and the Mac n Cheese alone would be worth the trip. Even the homemade lemonade hot just right. Service was super friendly. 10/10!
10/16/2021,4 star rating,Came to Melba's for a weekend brunch. The food was awesome and our server was absolutely amazing! The only downfall is that it took an hour and ten mins from the time we sat down to receive our food.
7/11/2021,1 star rating,"I used to come here a lot pre-pandemic since I live on their block and love their brunch, but now that they are blasting night-club-volume music for hours on the weekends (often with expletives in the lyrics) and ruining everyone's Sunday family dinner, I just can't support them. In my apartment I can't watch TV or listen to music or talk on the phone because they are so loud. Totally excessive for outdoor dining, I have no idea who likes or wants music that loud at a restaurant. I'm really not sure why they have the music outside instead of inside so that it would be for their customers instead of bothering everyone on the block... but that's the choice they've made."
11/16/2021,4 star rating,"The first time I went was a few months ago with family for a congratulations dinner and I loved it. I went again recently with my boyfriend and I can still say, I would recommend however, the entrance is very small and the staff coats are at the front of the store which makes me worry about the staff property, space for guest to come in and ambiance. Other than that, highly recommend, amazing music, dim lights and friendly staff. The food was amazing. Although the cornbread was removed from the menu, which makes me sad but the food is still good! Place is good for date nights, friends and adult outings."
2/12/2022,5 star rating,"Celebrating a birthday for a good friend who loves oxtails and the raves about Melba's oxtails had him excited. Prior experiences weren't great for me (service), but today erased the past. It was exceptional and truly made up for it. Service was top tier. Our waiter, Rich M- who was also the bartender- handled Melba's like a boss. He was attentive, professional, welcoming and approachable and he made entire restaurant sing happy birthday Stevie Wonder style. Food was excellent and orders were placed to take home. Drinks were a bit amongst the table and overall, a very delightful experience. Oh, I forgot, the music and ambience were everything. Super busy, but the entire staff handled it all effortlessly and made it seem like a calm day. I always give chances and so glad I did because it exceeded expectations and gained a customer again. I will be back again and look forward to many more awesome experiences!P.S.- waffles and strawberry butter as a side is a winner to go along with your other dishes- worth it"
8/28/2021,5 star rating,I was in Harlem USA and was looking for some good soul food and I made my way to Harlem staple Melba's. I had the famous chicken & waffles with a side of yams. I not only loved the food but I loved the price for the quality.
1/28/2021,5 star rating,"We ordered takeout from Melbas for NYC's pandemic edition of Restaurant Week, and everything was sooooo good! The catfish was flaky yet crispy and came with a wonderful sauce, the Mac and Cheese was extremely delicious. We also absolutely loved the moist coconut/pineapple cake that came with our order. This was our first time trying our Melbas and we look forward to coming back again!"
1/8/2021,2 star rating,"Customer service is great. But I must tell you I didn't enjoy the food at all. I'm not sure if they was having a recycle day in the kitchen but the oil they used to fry the chicken was a day (if not a few days) old. I am cook baybeh, so any cook would know the difference. The Mac and cheese is super bland and had absolutely NO soul to it. Just extra cheesy with no taste. I don't think I would ever come here to eat again. Respectfully."
6/11/2019,5 star rating,"Visited Melba's for brunch on a Saturday with a friend and we were seated right Way. We shared an order of chicken and waffles, plus grits and home fries. Everything was delicious and service was great. Next time: I'd definitely return for dinner, as I want to try the short ribs and oxtail."
8/2/2019,4 star rating,"Early Saturday for brunch, this longstanding restaurant only had a few patrons inside. Was quickly able to sit down and order food as staff was ramping up for the morning.Though there are a lot of appealing options to try, absolutely had to get the Fried Chicken and Eggnog Waffles ($17 + $1 for white meat) and an Iced Coffee ($5). Dish comes out after ten minutes - two pieces of white meat chicken on a fluffy waffle with strawberry whipped butter to the side. Waffle is fantastic, not too dense but still able to hold some syrup. Chicken is breaded nicely; could use some more seasoning (helped by the hot sauce).While the service is quick, I wish I knew there was an extra charge on the white meat when they asked me. Also no prices listed for coffee/non-alcoholic beverages. Do want to try some of the other stuff, so will be back."
6/18/2020,4 star rating,"I tend to eat pretty healthy, so this was a splurge meal for me.  I ordered delivery and don't think this is the most portable food - my mistake.  The chocolate cake and pineapple coconut cake were delicious!  Very moist and yummy - get them both!  I tried the beef sliders and chicken waffle - and they were a bit dry.  Waffle was yummy but came cold.  Waffle fries were good.  Mac and cheese was really rich and flavorful.  Spring rolls were yummy.  I can totally see why others would love this restaurant, but I personally prefer my healthier options."

Jessica took care of us and accommodated us at 2 beautiful, comfortable outdoor tables. We enjoyed the food, the service (by Olé) , and the company! It was perfect! Jessica and Ole made our experience AMAZING! We recommend the short ribs, spring rolls and the strawberry Hennessy drinks! Thank you for taking care of us and we are ensuring we all had a good time! Can't wait to return!"
2/21/2022,5 star rating,We chose Melbas  to celebrate  my girls 48th bday and it was definitely worth it. I haven't tasted soul food like my grandmother's cooking inside a restaurant until now. I just told everyone I knew if they haven't been they need to because your food is so delicious I didn't want to leave. I'll be back soon with some more of my friends. Thank you for such an amazing atmosphere. It was truly my best experience
7/26/2021,1 star rating,"A Sunday brunch with family from out of town was deeply disappointing. The food was very salty and the service was rushed. Too much plastic is in us, drinks wee served in plastic cups and delivered with plastic straws. Mo bread basket is provide. I expected at least a basket of cornbread for the table. For the price I expected more than 1 piece of fried chicken.The staff was friendly and attentive"

Crispy on the outside and juicy meat on the inside on top of a large soft waffle with a side of STRAWBERRY butter!!!Next I had the catfish which was equally as delicious and was made perfectly to the point that it just falls apart in your mouth Match that with the mac&cheese, which was soo good, and the mashed potatoes that had a little skin (just the way I like it) this was an amazing meal.Lastly we took the waitress recommendation and tried the Strawberry Henny and she wouldn't leave until we took a sip It was well worth it and even before getting our meal we knew this place was a form of heaven.MELBA I need the recipes!!"
7/3/2021,2 star rating,"Been going here for years. Not sure whether it was the ""dark lightening"" that lit the skies when we picked up our take out but: the calamari was rubbery and the breading on that and the chicken tasteless. The greens were over spiced (salt/ pepper/vinegar). Our beloved egg rolls just didn't taste right, probably the same greens as described above. The Mac and Cheese - tasteless rubber. 1 star for rice and peas (thank God). 1 star for getting the take out right."
3/26/2020,5 star rating,"finally got to try melbas!! Since we have been quarantined we have been cooking a lot and freaking out and doing frequent grocery runs ---- but we were both craving soul food so we caved.We each had a delicious spread!!We ordered thru grubhub and got their candied yams, spinach, onion rings, mac and cheese, and the smothered chicken. We were silent the whole time and practically inhale everything.Thank you Melbas for expanding your delivery zone to get to my apartment, the effort you put forth to update Yelp, social media doesn't go unnoticed! can't wait to come into the actual location once this clears up... Thank you Melbas!!!"

3/10/2019,4 star rating,"When I arrived for my reservation five minutes early, I was told to come back they don't open until 10. When I arrived exactly at 10 other customers were seated. What happened here? Other than crumbs probably from yesterday on the bench I sat on that's the only negative. Everything else was up from there! Decent decor with a very attractive bar area, clean bathrooms, spacious seating, extensive menu and professional service.As for the food the eggnog waffle lives up to the hype however, I think the utensils may have been crossed during preparation. There was residue and other flavors at a few spots on the waffle. It appears they had a big catering job so who knows? It was a slight hiccup that I could move past. The young man who was the server was very helpful and attentive. It's clear management takes effort with having and teaching high standards when it comes to service. The service, was friendly, helpful, engaging and prompt. My food arrived in a timely manner with fair portions based on the price. If you like meaty bacon try the slab bacon. The was a very good experience. Next time I'll try dinner!"
7/21/2021,5 star rating,We had a fantastic group meal here. The staff was extremely nice and talkative (especially Jessie!) we ordered half the menu but the show stopper was the chicken and waffles.

He was excited to see and directed us to the hostess, who was also happy to see us and we received a warm welcome.Rich was our waiter and did an excellent job of making us feel at home and offering great food suggestions.We had the best Collard Greens ever.The Fried Chicken & Waffle and Sea Bass were fabulous too.Jessie, one of the Manager's made sure that we tried some of the house specialties....Mac & Cheese, Ox Tail, and Carrot Cake.

I appreciate good service when in New York, because that isn't normal here- but the food was the BEST! We have ate at several different places looking for the soul food taste and couldn't find it.... STOP AT MELBA's and ask for Bryan!!!!!"
1/21/2022,1 star rating,We made reservations today for dinner for a bday and  upon making this reservation I spoke to the hostess regarding a menu item. During this conversation she has ample time to inform me that they had no heat on a Friday night when the temp outside was in its 20's and the windchill was even colder. We arrive and are literally sitting there trying to figure out if we should stay or leave because it was so cold. We knew if we left the chances of finding another place with room to take us would be hard. So we stayed. When the food arrived my food was cold. Which wasn't hard to believe since it was freezing in there. They should have offered a discount on the meal TO EVERYONE THERE since we literally had to eat with our coats and gloves on.  For $134 I expect to eat in warmer temps when sitting inside. NEVER AGAIN!  Melba's didn't used to be like this.
7/16/2021,5 star rating,"My last meal before heading back to LA was at Melba's.  Hands down the best meal I've had in a long time in NYC.  The manager Jessie was so helpful when it was time to order.  I had the catfish, yams and tres mac and cheese all wonderful.  I also tried the ox-tails, meatloaf, collard greens and fried chicken & waffles from my family's plate.  My favorite was the ox-tails so tender and rich.  For dessert I had delicious carrot cake.  Every single thing was AMAZING.  My taste buds were dancing.  I can't wait to go back."
9/30/2021,5 star rating,This was our second time yesterday attempting to dine at MELBA'S which was worth the wait because our original advance reservation on a prior Sunday got chaotic and we left.It's less crowded during the weekday which made it easier to honor the reservation with myself and wife.The food and service was great as well the art deco surrounding. Looking forward to visiting again.

5/10/2021,2 star rating,"I hesitate to post this review because I love Melba's Restaurant. However, i am compelled to post this review in all fairness to the customers.  I was very disappointed with my food. We ordered smothered chicken, wine braised short ribs, collard greens, rice and peas, potato salad, spring rolls and sweet potato pie.  The spring rolls, rice and pie were pretty good. The chicken was just fair and I'd actually never seen a 2"" chicken leg before in my life. The greens were sticky sweet; potato salad was mushy and sweet and I wish the short ribs weren't swimming in grease. I must assume that the chef had a rough day."
6/28/2021,5 star rating,"Honestly soooo delicious and worth every penny. You definitely are getting the bang for your buck. I had the chicken and waffles, greens, yams and mac and cheese. Quintessential soulfood that cures that craving when you miss home. The food did take a while to get out but respectively they were slammed. So given how many people were there the food came out at an okay time. This is going to be my go to spot."
3/8/2020,5 star rating,"Food- 9.5/10Atmosphere-8/10Service-8/10Value- 9.5/10TDLR- Hands down the best chicken I've ever had. Run, don't walk to Melba's. MEAL (APPETIZER)- We had the catfish strips and the crab cakes for appetizers and the signature chicken and waffles for the entree. The crab cakes were really good- you get a decent serving of actual crab (sometimes restaurants can fill up crab cakes with bread crumbs and extra stuffing and you're left wanting more crab!) The catfish strips were alright- I just wanted to try it bc I've never had catfish. MEAL (ENTREE)- Now to the MAIN PART of this meal: the chicken and waffles. The chicken was sumptuous- crispy, tasty, absolutely delicious. The waffle was so fluffy and rich. My only comment, which is kind of an odd one, is that the syrup on the table was lite syrup which meant I had to dump a lot into my waffle to taste anything. (I'm already eating fried chicken, I don't need lite syrup to try to balance it out and be healthy, just give me to good ole thick syrup haha). SERVICE and ATMOSPHERE- Service was good, as you'd expect for a proper restaurant. The atmosphere was chic, friendly, and warm. VALUE (def: is the price of the restaurant comparable to the overall experience of dining there)- 100%! It isn't overly priced, the food is fantastic, and I would definitely dine there again."

You can tell they might be renovating and adjusting to COVID-19 regulations . There is tons of PPE. As well as temperature checks on arrival. They also have outdoor seating .The 15 minute wait on a Tuesday Night let me know I would be in for some good eats. We Both Had peach margaritas to start. I would rate it average compared to other margaritas. I've had . I also had to crab cakes as an appetizer. Worth it ! I would definitely order it again . FULL of crab meat and well seasoned. For dinner we both had the catfish dinner I had greens and Mac . She had yams and Mac . I really enjoyed the greens and the catfish was perfect . The Mac and cheese was on the creamy side, I did enjoy it as well.But the highlight of my night was the Service !!!Megan was a star. I enjoyed her energy as soon as she walked over to our table .

5/3/2021,2 star rating,"I went to Melbas this Saturday for my birthday dinner. While I understand things are hectic because of COVID, so much more could've been better. We waited 30 mins past our reservation time after we agreed to our reservation being pushed up because the previous party wasn't done. They said they could accommodate 10 people but the space was tight. There were several things my party and I wasn't happy with and as we voiced our opinions, the owner Melba heard us. Instead of asking how things could be better/fixed, Melba snapped at one of my best friends with such a nasty reply. Our waiter, Brian saved the night and made our experience worth it. He was funny, and sweet. He made sure we were well taken care of. The food was amazing and so were the drinks."
12/14/2019,3 star rating,"3.5 starsHad this place book marked for quite some time and glad I visited! I""m a food enthusiast so I like to sample many menu items bc I'm not sure if I would return for second visit. So I try things to see if anything will pop out and encourage me to return.I'm gonna try not to jump around so much with this review ok!STARTERS:Very cool vibe and ambiance, very jazz lounge feeling, Afrocentric, dimly lit, patrons casual/classy dressed, clean, friendly greetingSERVICE:Our waiter was good, they work well as a team, someone else made sure my water was filled, the others cleared the plates, others served the foodFOOD:Not so impressedHowever, I will say that the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES were FANTASTIC!!! The waffle was extra fluffy and flavorful and the strawberry butter added just the right touch. The wings were cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.Also had the turkey meatloaf with collards and Mac, huge serving but the taste was nothing spectacular to me, wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, but just didn't wow me. The appetizers I tried were the crabcakes and the short rib sliders, neither left a big impression.Almost forgot about the drinks! The strawberry Henny was good, LIIT was just ok, there was this place in Va that made THE BEST LIIT, i have yet to find the equivalent.Overall, glad that I finally made it here.Will I return? Maybe. For the chicken and waffles! If i'm in the area, but not out of my way."
2/5/2019,4 star rating,"It was my birthday. I told my husband that I wanted to do something other than our traditional steak dinner - I wanted ""soul food"". We always head from DC to NYC for my birthday. I'd been seeing a good friend of mine post on social media about Melba's. I did a search for soul food and looked at the reviews. Then I searched to see how far we were staying. We decided to catch the train and be a bit adventurous from Manhattan to Harlem.We were greeted at the door by a nice guy who welcomed us. After being seated another nice young lady came by and told us about the menu.I had the beef ribs, macaroni and cheese & greens. My husband had salmon, potato salad & macaroni and cheese.The food was good. Dessert (pound cake) was excellent. They sang happy birthday to me. I'd definitely go back again."

Olleigh made sure the experience was great and made amazing recommendations, chicken and waffles with strawberries butter, ox tail and braised ribs as well as the crab cakes. All the dishes and sides were great! Stop by"
11/18/2018,3 star rating,"I know there is this constant quest for the best Fried Chicken in Harlem but I am not quite sure where Melba falls for me. I thought their fried chicken was underwhelming. Their sides are on point though! The tres and cheese; candied yams; the spring rolls; peas & rices are all marvelous. My gf loved the waffle as well, she called different from traditional chicken and waffle recipes (its a bit softer whereas I like crispy waffles.) The staff was extremely pleasant and gave fantastic suggestions. In my opinion I prefer Sylvia or Amy Ruth which a hair cheaper as well. But definitely give it a shot especially if you love soul food sides."
3/13/2021,1 star rating,This place  is a very overated hole in the wall with mediocre food at best they are in total violation of the Covid  19 policy of 35 percent  capacity. This place has no real  uniform standards  you dont know who works here. The decor is horrible and outdated.. customer service was extremely  poor food portion were small in comparison to  prices
12/21/2019,5 star rating,"I was looking for a nice spot in Harlem for Brunch date and I searched Yelp and Melby popped out. The picture  reviews intrigued  me. I was confused I needed a table for two. I thought I needed a reservation.  I called and you dont need a reservation  unless  you have a party of six. I was so happy but you have to wait a while for table well worth it I was seated and greeted by Olay ( love that name) where she broke down the menu. I got the eggnog  waffles and dark meat fried chicken. My companion  had the Salmon omelette  and Homefries. The food was and is really  good. I have to go back and try other things on the menu. The spot is cozy  and the music selection  was wonderful. Like I'm with Grandma and Great Aunts. I love how the General Manager  is so involved  with the guest. Concerned  about  what we feeling and really  making sure we enjoy yourselfMy new favorite  restaurant  ABSOLUTELY.  I need the grits and shrimp now lol Go Go Go Go eat here Its worth every  dime,  penny and time"
3/31/2021,1 star rating,"I was very disappointed with the service but being understanding I will give them another chance, it was late and busy. I ordered a takeout, a  quite expensive one and was given the wrong order. I called and left my number but no response. I really believe in supporting our neighborhood restaurants but just a little organization will be great."
9/10/2020,5 star rating,"I wish the food had not been as delicious because we did not stop ourselves to take pictures :P The food was amazing, the delivery packaging was great (e.g., fried chicken and waffle each came individually wrapped so that one would not spoil the other), and the delivery was timely.We ordered the Fried Chicken and Eggnog waffle and the wine braised short ribs with Tres mac and cheese and collard greens. The chicken was so flavorful and tender, and the ribs were to die for. We just moved to the area, but after such a fantastic meal I anticipate that we will be regulars.Thank you Melba's for such a fantastic meal!"
12/22/2019,5 star rating,"Wow we ended up coming here due to a last minute change and I'm soooo glad. The food was phenomenal. I ordered the eggnog waffle with dark fried chicken which came with strawberry butter. I paired it with a Hendricks martini which was made just right. The waffle came with catfish by accident. When I told the waitress, she said I can keep it and she'll bring out the chicken separately. It was perfect because I wanted to try the catfish as well. The waffle seemed like a regular waffle (I couldn't taste the eggnog) but that strawberry butter was delicious and we asked for more. The catfish was nice which had a hit of curry on it but the chicken was even better. It was all a lot of food so I took home at least half of it and it was even better the next day heated up in the oven. I can't wait to come back to enjoy the food, drink and service!"
8/24/2020,4 star rating,"After hearing rave reviews about this place it was only right that I come check it out. I came here on a Saturday with two friends and it was first come first serve in regards to seating. I love the fact that they're taking COVID-19 outdoor dining precautions seriously. IE; getting the menu from your smartphone, hand sanitizer placed throughout the restaurant, outdoor dining spacing with protected glass between each table. Service was great and our server was awesome! Now onto that strawberry henny drink! If you drink a few of those you will be feeling nice. It was refreshing and the strawberry puree they use in the mix is deelish! I ended up getting the famous eggnog waffles with fried chicken. I'm a big chicken and waffles fan and that egg nog waffle WAS EVERYTHING. It's flavored to perfection. However... the loss of one star goes to that DRY piece of chicken I had. It had little to no flavor and your girl grabbed her cup of water so fast when trying to swallow it. #issanoformedawgBUT HUNNTIE I'll definitely be back to try something else off the menu and get me more of that strawberry henny drink!"

4/12/2021,5 star rating,"My friends & I came here from upstate NY for my friend's birthday. They were extremely busy. Inside & outside was full plus the to go line was out the door. So if you choose to go here I suggest making reservations. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated (not bad for how busy it was) because the delightful Imani was taking care of seating & to go order's. She didn't miss a beat. She was very friendly. Once seated we waited a little bit for our waiter but once we met Brian our server it was an amazing experience. He was handling about 7 tables and did it like it was nothing. My table alone was a little demanding and Brian never looked flustered at all. We got sure, no problem & I got you the whole time. He was great with suggesting things for us. The food was great, the drinks were great & the service was excellent. We will definitely come back."
9/13/2019,1 star rating,"I ordered 3 jumbo lump crab cakes for $24.95 through Seamless. I received my order with only 2 crab cakes, that were burnt and also NOT jumbo lump crab meat. I called the restaurant immediately, 2x, to only a recorded message. There is no way they should be charging $25 on their best day for their lackluster burnt af crab cakes. The flavor isn't even good. I will never order from this restaurant again. Trash crab cakes and trash service"

She's an absolute hero to the community. After we finished voting, we sat at the outdoor tables at Melba's and enjoyed a delicious lunch. We are so lucky to have this place in our neighborhood and we will always support Black and female-owned local businesses, especially ones that give back."

Place was packed and that is always a good sign.  i have been dreaming of trying the chicken and waffles here and they were FANTASTIC!!!  the chicken was juicy and the flavor was great.  The waffle was fluffy and buttery, the strawberry butter i loved.  I also had the shrimp as an appetizer and i could not get enough, best shrimp ever!  For dessert i ordered the Peach Melba, such a wonderful  treat!  Warm and comforting.  Great  place for comfort food definately, worth the drive from Queens!"
2/14/2021,1 star rating,so I was excited to order from here because you really cant find oxtails in Uber eats. so I ordered oxtails and Mac and cheese with rice and beans and Charleston shrimp idk if they was closing but 4 shrimp and about 3 oxtails with a bunch of gravy and little ends of the pot. I couldn't even get a hold of anyone on the phone when I called and I can't even get my money back because I had already put in for the shrimp the oxtails was $29 and the shrimp was $17 the price for the amount is ridiculous the food is great but when you get the end of the pot that as a business is unacceptable and for the price is nasty.
4/24/2021,5 star rating,"The was a wonderful experience. We were visiting from DC and it lived up to the hype. We made a reservation and they were ready for us. We ordered chicken and waffles and it was so delicious. The chicken was crispy, seasoned, and flavorful and the waffle was tender and strawberry butter made it extra special. I also tried the Melba Spring rolls and I was a little skeptical with greens, peas, rice and cheese but it too was delicious. My table makes had calamari and there were no complaints. The service was friendly and attentive. Next time we are in NY we'll make this a stop in our trip. Thanks Brian and we wish you much success."

9/13/2021,2 star rating,"I was not impressed. I ordered Jumbo lump crabcakes for an appetizer.  When I looked at them, they looked burnt.  I sent them back and I received another order. I tasted them and I was not impressed.  The seasoning was bland and not appetizing.  The  crabmeat tasted as if it was from a frozen box and not fresh tasting. The sauce for the crabcakes looked terrible.  The collard greens had too many stalks. The BBQ wings were hard and too chewy. The smothered chicken was also bland and not seasoned properly. Although the ASAP yams were cut too big they tasted ok. The Country Catfish was ok too. Too many flies flying around. We ate indoors. The best thing was the artwork on the walls. The potato salad was not tasty and the presentation was a turn off."
12/13/2021,5 star rating,Excellent Sunday brunch! The manager Jessie is awesome! She suggested that my husband try the oxtails (we're Jamaican) and the meal didn't disappoint. I tried them as well and would order that entree next time. My chicken and waffles were delicious. All of our selections were very good. Kid-friendly restaurant. We sat outside in the summer with our party of seven which was very nice. Great live music later in the afternoon performed by a wonderful band. So glad this restaurant is thriving. Go check out Melba's!

9/26/2020,3 star rating,"Food is solid comfort food. The Mac n cheese is awesome and super cheesy! The outdoor seating is nice and spread out but the service was pretty slow.

Overall a solid lunch spot but nothing out of the ordinary."

8/8/2019,3 star rating,"Came here for brunch with friends after a day at central park. The fried chicken here is very good, but that was the only thing on the menu worth getting in my opinion. We came here on Saturday at around 12pm and it was not crowded. We ordered the following items and shared it:-Catfish with waffles-The catfish was surprisingly pretty good. The waffles was okay.-Fried chicken with pancakes-We ordered chicken wings for this fried chicken dish and it was very good. I highly recommend getting the chicken. The pancakes were okay as well.-Fried chicken with french toast-For this dish we got the dark meat and it was tasty as well. The french toast was good and was probably the best carb combination (dare I say). Would highly recommend getting this combination.-Spinach omelette with onions and cheese grits-This was very average. Would not recommend getting this. The omelette was also quite pricey for what it was. Additionally, the cheese grits was way too salty. Overall, the food was okay, I think the fried chicken is the best thing to get from this restaurant. I don't think I will be visiting here again."
9/13/2021,5 star rating,"Wow. I really never give 5 stars for a restaurant review because no one is perfect. Well that is what I thought before I visited Melba's-in Harlem. My family and I traveled from California to drop my son off at college. We decided to take the 55.00 Ride share to Harlem. I had read the reviews and saw that some reviews stated that Melba's had the best greens they'd ever had. Well I had to try them. When I tell you them greens were soooo good. They were actually the best greens I've ever had besides my granny's.My mom and I shared the Salmon dinner that came with 2 sides. One of my sons had the chicken and waffles. My other son had the Mac n cheese. We also tried the notorious greens, black eyed peas , rice, and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious. The Salmon was fresh and seasoned just right! We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere and sunny weather. There was a family celebrating a birthday next to us that was very sweet. We had the best waitress. I wish I could include her  name in this review, but I forgot it. I want to say it was Ollie?? She was pleasant and had a nice energy . Melba was nice enough to take a picture with my mom and son. She told him she was proud of him for attending college and I thought that was wonderful.The food was quality and definitely made with love and SOUL. I live in Cali, but will definitely be visiting Melba's again! Thank you to Melba and staff (especially the waitress)for taking such good care of my family and I."

8/20/2021,1 star rating,"So me and my kids decided to go to melbas today. First off all they are already doing the no vaccine no dine in thing. Fine we opt out for outside dinning, I called them the girl on the phone said come at 6:15 or 6:30 for a table of four, I get there at 6:45 and the sameGirl tells me there is a 40 minute wait because it's full and she told me she said this to me on the phone (which she didn't) so 40 minutes pass I come back and she's looking for seats, there's this lonely spot by two garbage bins and flies everywhere and she decides to sit us there, literally smelled horrible sitting there. It was smelling like spoiled milk and dog poop, the flies were everywhere. This other girl must have seen how uncomfortable we were and she sits us in an outside booth that smelled just the same as sitting next to the garbage. The waitress takes our order leaves comes back 10 minutes later and says oh it's a full house tonight so you guys order will be ready in about 30 to 49 minutes okay fine. After waiting about 45 minutes she forgets the drinks and the chicken was so dry and no flavor the Mac and cheese was so spectacular and the collard greens were very very sweet and too much gravy like sauce on them. Margaritas barely had liquor and the burger were dry and burned. The yams taste like regular can yams. Idk if it's the location or we went in at the wrong time but this was definitely it a good experience at all."

I never paid so much for fried chicken! Well l was totally disappointed. The chicken was left over, not freshly made, i couldnt eat it. The mac and cheese was tangy. The greens and yams were  just ok. Will not be returning to Melba, l feel l wasted my money!"

6/21/2018,4 star rating,"Those waffles tho.And the oxtail.The only con is the nyc prices.I found this version of soul to be a bit salty in nature. The collard greens and the oxtail specifically. So then I turned to my sweet tea which i wasn't expecting to be sweet (just ordered an iced tea). Make sure you specify, otherwise you're getting the southern version of iced tea...loaded with syrup.I love oxtail and they do a good job of making it flavorful. The chicken and waffle is good also but it requires deconstruction to properly eat. Chili onion rings are really just ""chili dusted"" and large rings that are breaded. It's a pretty big space and opens up more by the use of mirrors. Smart design. They were playing R&B from the early 2000 to now when I dined. It's semi loud and a bit difficult to hear if you aren't a loud talker. Seems like a good spot to go with friends for a comforting dinner."

8/14/2021,1 star rating,Came back for another Go. Maybe the kitchen standards would be better. Im not gonna lie. The food was AMAZING. Got the waffle and catfish. Excellent flavors. Strawberry henny was literally strawberry juice and henny. Nothing exciting. I would have honestly given this place an updated 4 or 5 star rating but I saw something so disgusting happen on my way to the restroom. I saw a waiter comb his hair over with his hand then use the same hand to bare hand touch/adjust someones food on a plate!!! That is beyond nasty im sorry. I literally will never come back. I thought I was pretty harsh the first time around but this nastiness is the last straw sorry
7/21/2020,1 star rating,"Got sick eating here. Called twice with no response. Snooty owner Melba is too busy crying on the blogs everyday with her friend Andrew to even care about her customers. Been her 4 times to eat prior and NEVER saw her there. But if u leave it to her she is ""very involved"". Will report her to the state"
9/26/2021,1 star rating,"So disappointed.  Had reservations for 7:30 on a Sunday night and arrived to total chaos of a street concert/party happening right in front of the restaurant and apparently sponsored by Melba's.  Could not find a way in.  Could not find a hostess or anyone to check in with.  The street concert with local artist would have been fun if we were there for that - but we weren't.  We were there for dinner and the concert was literally in the outdoor dining patio and was blaring so loud I had to repeatedly yell at a bartender trying to figure out how we even checked in.  We were ignored by the female bartender (with gorgeous short blonde curls) for over 20"".  When we finally got her to acknowledge us she told us to look for someone with an iPad.  The ""iPad girl"" with sparkly eye shadow was very nice and apparently she was the hostess.  She told us she would try to get us in and to have a drink- we asked her HOW we were supposed to do that as the bartender refused to acknowledge us- she said, ""at the bar!  You're good!"" When 2 other women walked up and were immediately greeted my friend finally asked what the deal was and we were told to get in line.  This was after standing there being ignored for 25"".  A male bartender saw our frustration and quickly offered to help- I don't know what the issue was  with the other bartender but we were persistently ignored which is not how you want to feel.  When we were finally seated we sat there for another 20"" before fetching our own menus (music still blaring so loudly we couldn't scream a conversation at each other) and it took another 15"" for a very kind and apologetic waitress to come snd tell us if we actually wanted food it would be a ""48"" wait.""  We left.  There is no food good enough for that treatment.  We came solely to support Melba as she was an icon during the pandemic and we are nurses who appreciate the effort.  But this was really the worst treatment I've ever had in my dining life and certainly not what I've come to expect when I eat in Harlem  Ruined my last night in NYC which, for the record, was my first vacation since the pandemic began."

7/12/2020,4 star rating,I ordered from Melbas last night thru Ubereats. From the menu price it seem a bit pricey but since not much choices left at that time so I gave them a try. My boyfriend order Fish&Chips $15.95 (1 pc of Fish) and I got southern chicken with eggnog waffle ( 1 tight of chicken). Yes it is a pricey pleace but taste good. Everything good. I will order from them again but maybe once in the blue moon.

Service was quick - our order was taken when we were clearly ready and we received our food within 20 minutes.The food was AMAZING! I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was juicy and crispy while the waffle was light and fluffy - making the two the perfect compliments. We also got the fried catfish, which was cooked very well and crisped to perfection. The Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens as sides were also delicious.I had an excellent experience and will be returning again!"

8/20/2019,3 star rating,"This was my first time at Melba's after hearing many great things I decided to come. I ordered the Chicken and Eggnog Waffle to eat and the Harlem Ice Tea to drink. I'll start with the drink - it tasted exactly like what I was expecting it was sour with a strong vodka after taste. Going to the food the waffle was great - it was fluffy, warm, and just the right kind of sweet. When we come to the chicken the skin was great but the actual chicken meat lacked real flavor compared to other fried chicken spots I have eaten at in Harlem such as the spot on 116th. I will come back and try some of the other dishes - cause those looked like they tasted great!"
11/5/2021,4 star rating,"My faves: Beef Short Rib Sliders or Entree, Fried Chicken Wings for $3 each, Yams & Collard Greens.

I also had white meat chicken breast pretty darn good & non greasy. I also ordered the 3 cheese baked Mac oh soooooo good!!! My husband had the turkey meatloaf it was wonderful he, also had the potato salad which equally as great. Food: great!

We waited 30 mins past our reservation time after we agreed to our reservation being pushed up because the previous party wasn't done. They said they could accommodate 10 people but the space was tight. There were several things my party and I wasn't happy with and as we voiced our opinions, the owner Melba heard us. Instead of asking how things could be better/fixed, Melba snapped at one of my best friends with such a nasty reply. Our waiter, Brian saved the night and made our experience worth it. He was funny, and sweet. He made sure we were well taken care of. The food was amazing and so were the drinks."
1/25/2021,1 star rating,"Poor service.  Waited 45 minutes in line outside in the cold so we could eat in one of the heated booths.  They do not have a check in system to be placed on a wait.  When we sat down, the heat didn't work which was a shame since we waited for that,  but they did try twice to fix it.  Placed our food and drink order, never got the drinks or the food after an additional 45 of waiting in the cold booth.  Others that's came after got their food before us.  Couldn't tell you if the food (or drinks) were good, but certainly service lacked.  Hope your experience is better."
7/24/2021,1 star rating,Terrible service. Staff seemed confused as to what goes where for carryouts. Food is mediocre tasted bland could use more seasoning. I'm from the south and this is NOt soul food.
4/20/2019,5 star rating,"Our go-to soul food restaurant in Harlem for the following reasons:1. Not just black-owned, it's owned by a black woman chef, Melba. (Unlike Amy Ruth's)2. The crispy, spicy crust on their fried chicken is amazing.3. It's not impossible to get a seat (unlike Sylvia's or Red Rooster).4. They take reservations (highly suggested for Sunday afternoons).5. It's not overly frequented or over hyped by tourists.6. The whipped butter on their waffles.7. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice without the exhorbitant prices.8. They have healthy salad options.The best thing to get here is their mouth-watering fried chicken and waffles. The fried fish is good, but not as memorable as the chicken.So why wait in line for two hours for Red Rooster when you could be already seated and eating at Melba's?Did I mention the chicken?"
7/22/2020,2 star rating,"So the menus at the establishment is not the current menu so look online.. I went here with my friend for my birthday. LETS JUST SAY WE WONT BE BACK. We get there and seat in the booth but was told that our party was not big enough to be there so we moved to the front.  (Remember this part) I ordered the short ribs,Mac & cheese, and collared   greens. The food comes out and I noticed they only give you 4 ribs (This meal cost almost $30 so to only get what's pictures is surprising) I taste the ribs. It was dry with little seasoning. The Mac and cheese was okay.. it was creamy but that's not what I expected when I thought of Southern American food. I was expecting baked Mac and cheese but the menu definitely says creamy. (I didn't even notice that )The collard greens were spicy and still had the greens flavor. (You know when you don't cook it long enough to get the flavor out of the turkey flavor out) Only thing I finished was the Mac and cheese. It helped cover the taste of the other food plus the salt helped with the ribs. As you know the seating is only outside so don't sit by the windows. I saw a waterbug out side crawling on the window. I tried to show the buser (man cleaning the table and serving water) but he didn't see what I was pointing to plus it was fairly busy and I didn't want to cause a scene but the lady at the table near by saw what I saw. So don't seat by the windows ..As  my friend and I are eating I look back and see a couple sitting in a booth. They were eating and enjoying their meal but there were only 2 of them. Now that's none of my business but when I was told I couldn't sit there because my party was not big enough the lady should have been told the same thing. My friend enjoyed her chicken and waffle with strawberry butter. I wish I would have just gotten that because that meal was not it. I'm not into wasting food and shorting people on their tip so we tipped 20% although the service is not as hands on as it would have been if the restaurant was opening. The drinks come in 2 sizes. Our waiter never asked us what size would be like. I only found out because I went on yelp to see the prices and stumbled on a 32oz drink. I will not be going back... The owner showed up to the establishment. She was speaking with her staff and made sure the lids that fell from another customers table were picked up. She never asked customers how their dinning experience was going. I really wanted to tell her to try that food from the kitchen because it was not it."
8/3/2021,4 star rating,"Food is excellent! Chicken waffles are on point. I wish I had a real drink but my Arnold Palmer was very refreshing. I just wish it was in a bigger cup. Make sure you have a reservation because the host is all over the place trying to keep things order. It seemed like one guy had to keep reminding people of their job duties. My waitress was nice. Overall, good food but trying to get a table was a disaster."

10/13/2021,4 star rating,1st time the food was cooked to perfection. 2nd time the salmon was over cooked. Each time the vegetables were on point. I will give them a 3rd try.
7/25/2021,5 star rating,"My husband and I have been here three times in the last two weeks!  The macaroni and cheese is to die for. Also loved the fried catfish and greens. My husband had the catfish and waffles which were delicious!  Today, they were kind enough to seat us without a reservation, despite having full day of reservations. I know where I'll be ordering my Thanksgiving sides!"
7/25/2021,5 star rating,The food was good and there was live music outside. Jessie worked with us to accommodate our large party without a reservation. You should try this place.
5/20/2018,5 star rating,"I am well aware the menu here is southern / soul food. I enjoyed dinner here. It was delicious and comforting. Nothing was heavy and I felt great eating everything - even all the fried items!Started with the must-have appetizers: Charleston Jumbo Shrimp and the Fried Catfish Strips with Chipotle MayoAlso had to try the famous Southern Fried Chicken & Eggnog Waffles with Strawberry Butter and Maple SyrupWhile everything so far was very good, my favorite was the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass - the sea bass was so light yet flavorful. For sides. Opted for Low Country Collard Greens Seasoned with Smoked Turkey and the Candied Yams. The yams were very (maybe a little too) sweet. The collard greens were tasty. Even better was the extra side dish of Trés Macaroni & Cheese, a delicious blend of Pepper Jack, Mozzarella and Cheddar CheeseFor dessert, couldn't decide between the chocolate and the red velvet cake so of course got both with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Great way to end the wonderful meal.Having an excellent waiter was a bonus too - great service here!"
12/28/2019,5 star rating,"We were a party of nine people. We made reservations but had to change the count various times, the management were very accommodating. The Drinks were on point the strawberry  mango  mimosa was on point. The food was delicious it was all well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Brian our waiter was very professional and courteous. If we were not happy with something he was quick to come up with an alternative option, which was perfect."
7/25/2021,5 star rating,"3 words... JESSIE THE LEGEND!!! My family and I were so attracted to the live music being played at Melba's that we decided to dine there. Seating was limited but, Jessie The Legend made a way. She was incredible and so was the food! If you're ever in NYC,  you'd be crazy not to eat at Melba's."
6/4/2021,1 star rating,"I don't know what happened and where is Melba but she's needs to come back and oversee the food. It was not good.  I always like the atmosphere , the customer service was exceptional As always but it was raining and all I could smell was a wet dog. Not good.  The cost was way too expensive for the food yo taste so bad.  I regret putting up this review but I hope the owner sees it."

3/20/2021,4 star rating,"After Neely's closed, we've been searching for THE chicken and waffles place. Been everywhere in Manhattan including Amy Ruth's. Melba's is the go to place for us going forward. Chicken and waffle is delicious. Only down side is that it comes with 1 piece of chicken instead of 2 which I think is more appropriately sized for the amount of waffles."
2/11/2021,5 star rating,Best smothered chicken in Harlem! Add that potato salad and collard greens on the side  and babyyyyyyy!! So delicious.
11/19/2017,5 star rating,"A couple of friends and I decided to go to Melba's last night for a girls night out. I was super late and thankfully we still were seated before it got crowded. As we waited for a table Melba walked in and she was so nice, greeted everyone in the dining room with a big smile. The dining room was a good size and from what I understand there was another side that I didn't see where other diners were seated. We decided on the strawberry Hennessy drink that came highly recommended. It was good so we had two rounds. For appetizers we had the jumbo shrimp (fried) and the crabcakes. The crabcakes were just ok but I'm the shrimp were delicious!  I would recommend getting those. 4 shrimp per order. For entrees we all went with the fried chicken with two sides. All very good. The Mac and cheese is super cheesy and yummy. The potato salad also good was plentiful.The service was attentive and everyone was helpful. The only thing that slightly annoyed me was my unbalanced table. I had to stop things from sliding off. No wasting my Henny drink!  We definitely left full and happy. We will be back."
2/22/2019,4 star rating,"On my trip to New York with my family I had the pleasure of eating at Melba's. After living in New York City for 26 years, I went to Melba's once prior to this visit for a sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving.This recent visit to Melba's was perfect for our family dinner. We were looking for authentic soul food and we found it at Melba's. Our visit happened on a quiet Sunday night due to the super bowl. The restaurant had a very relaxing atmosphere and a nice bar which is center stage of the restaurant. Melba's has a nice drink menu and my Cosmo has me feeling right for the night lol! For starters, we had the buffalo wings and the lemon and honey chicken tenders. Out of the two, I enjoyed the buffalo wings while the children that accompanied us liked the lemon honey chicken tenders more. For our entrees, my mother-in-law ordered the oxtail and I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. The oxtail was fall of the bone tender and full of so much flavor. The salmon was cooked to perfection and had the perfect crust but was not dry at all but the star of my meal was the tres mac and cheese! I don't even know where to begin. The macaroni was not overcooked and mushy like I've found at other soul food establishments I've visited and the cheese gave the dish the perfect balance of sharpness and cheesiness all at the same time.Melba's is a nice restaurant to go to whether you're looking for a spot to go out on a date with your significant other or a family spot for for children."
4/1/2021,4 star rating,"I love Melba's. I am thinking about having my 60th birthday dinner party there. The food was good as expected. The ambiance was on point! Myself and three guest were celebrating a birthday. The only downside was that our server ""Olay"" was having a difference of opinion with another co-worker and she expressed her anger across the dining room over our heads (we were sitting right next to the server station). Very unprofessional. We were there on Saturday, March 27 at 2:30pm."

I have yet to find a soul food place that gets it right and they did THAT!What else to say with 800+ reviews?"
2/27/2019,4 star rating,"Totally did not realize I did not finish my review at the time that I wrote this. This is a very popular soul food resturant in Harlem that I always hear a lot of people talk about. This was probably my 2nd time trying the food and although I liked it very much, I thought it was ""ok"". From what I can remember, I had the baked chicken with macaroni and cheese along with string beans which was pretty good.The atmosphere was comfortable, not too big of an establishment but not too small. From what I can remember, the waitress took quite some time to take our orders. I remember we were sitting there waiting to be served and the length of time between placing our orders and getting our food. The one last thing that I remember very well is the parking- there is literally NO PARKING in this area. We had to drive around several times, park down the street and around the corner just to come to this resturant. Overall, the food was pretty good and I would recommend this resturant although I would probably take an Uber or a taxi next time rather then drive."
8/22/2020,5 star rating,"I can't say enough great things about Melbas! Firstly the owner, Melba is so nice and cares about her patrons. I've been coming for a few years now and the service and food never disappoints. Yesterday I had the pleasure of doing some outside dining. They have a cute set up. I had the catfish with Mac and cheese and yams and it was so flavorful delicious! Everything is served in to go containers. Will be returning very soon! IG: alexandra_andco #EatWithAlexandra"
6/19/2021,1 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place after reading all the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed. The place is completely unsanitary. There were flies everywhere! I saw flies in the kitchen. The place was completely chaotic and unorganized. I didn't understand how so many people could see so many flies around the kitchen and not be concerned. The waiters and host are inattentive. The fly problem was so bad I couldn't eat my food. I'm disgusted and I'm reporting this establishment to the health department. To make matters worse the staff was completely overwhelmed, and rather than help out the owner was socializing the entire time. I hated writing this review. However, this is a health and safety violation and I feel people should be warned."
3/23/2021,5 star rating,"10/10!! The food, the service, the drinks, I will definitely recommend going here. Get the chicken wings and waffles with the strawberry butter!"
1/25/2018,3 star rating,"Just okay soul food restaurant, I'm sure you can find better. I had the crab cakes for starters, just okay. They were weakness fine, but definitely not a standout dish. I also had the catfish, mac and cheese and greens. Catfish was also okay, could have have been breaded and seasoned better and a bit more crispy. The mac and cheese was good, an 8/10, definitely the best thing I had. The collard greens were decent, reasonable flavor. I guess my disappoint lies with these things not being standout dishes. I you specialize in soul food your greens and fried fish should be out of this world. They were not. I finished with the red velvet cake, my only feedback here is skip dessert. The cake was off, tasted like lemon, couldn't taste the cream cheese in the frosting. The drinks were great tho. I had the strawberry henny and it was delicious. The drinks are the only reason I have three stars."
4/21/2019,3 star rating,"Their brunch is not bottomless! Keep reading if you care about anything else.Our waitress was very accommodating so she took this review from 2 stars to 3 stars.There is nothing special about the food. The same brunch food as all the other places in Harlem. There are a plethora of children that come to this establishment. The space, in general, is very small. There are about 12 inches between the bar and the first table. Melba's is one of the most talked about restaurants in Harlem. You can come just to try it but you will be underwhelmed."
7/3/2021,5 star rating,The best chicken and waffles in nyc. The greens and Mac n cheese are good too. The drinks are STRONG
3/2/2019,3 star rating,"Food is ""meh"". Went here twice with my aunt, for dinner. Both times the sweet potatoes were watery and not palatable (they tasted like water soaked sweet potatoes sprinkled with syrup and cinnamon powder: cue in baby food purée tasting flashback of when you're at a baby shower). Onion rings were hard saucers of non flavored crispy mix and multiple onions slices per ring. Short rib was wayyyyy to salty. On the bright side, their Mac and cheese was good and the waitress was nice. Not sure if you'll catch me on another visit."
9/25/2017,3 star rating,"This past Friday on my first trip ever to NYC, I had the opportunity to visit Melba's. After watching her thru the years on various shows including Food network, I was excited to visit the restaurant, even more than Sylvia's a NYC popular soul food restaurant. When visiting Melba's, I found a contemporary yet comfortable decorated space, with a lively bar and good ambiance. The water came quickly and we knew what we wanted from viewing the website, so we ordered and waited. The music was good and the energetic atmosphere was refreshing on a Friday night. My friend ordered the crab cakes, which came with 3 crab cakes and 2 sides and everything was good. Nothing was salty, over seasoned or over cooked. I ordered catfish, and it was hot and fresh and once again was not over seasoned. I was subtly surprised it was not a cornmeal breading and more like a fried chicken coating (flour based batter) but it tasted fine which is what mattered. The greens were fine. Actually very good, not overly salty, not heavy with oil, their wasn't much on the plate but it was good. The mac n cheese was good and I was a little surprised by the subtle nutmeg taste of the Mac n cheese. I didn't know if that was on purpose or if someone accidentally put some in the mac. It wasn't a big enough turn off for me not to eat it, it just tasted like when you get some of the syrup off the candied yams/sweet potatoes mixed in with a spoonful of mac n cheese.  So why the 3 stars you are wondering when I have done nothing but said positive things about the food, restaurant environment and the customer service? For the price of the dinner, I was expecting 2 Catfish fillets, not one. But that wasn't the only reason for 3 stars. I ordered the pound cake to go since I only flew there for the day and wanted to wrap it up and take it back home to Chicago. I was not expecting the accompanying ice cream or any plating techniques obviously because I was taking it to go. So I was brought a chunk of pound cake and my bill. Now my issue was the fact that a simple, un-iced, not plated slice of pound cake was $7.00. I don't care how expensive NYC is, a naked piece of pound cake shouldn't be $7. And it wasn't that good where it made the $7 worth it. I get some fancy layer cake, where layered are baked, filled, frosted and decorated up to look pretty. Lots of labor involved. But sorry I have baked many pound cakes and this is about mixing ingredients and baking. That's it. The ingredients are basic, the labor is minimal compared to other desserts, therefore a $7 price tag for a piece of pound cake to go doesn't make sense. Also my $53 bill was fine despite the overpriced pound cake. Until I tried to pay cash for it. Now I traveled with cash to NYC thinking I would be fine and could monitor my spending more, so when I gave the server $100 bill for my check, do you know he came back to the table and claimed there was NO CHANGE in the restaurant?!?? A bar full of loud lively people and a more than half full restaurant and you are telling me you don't have $47 in the restaurant to give me change?!? Yeah that was a ball faced lie. I was PISSED! For one I didn't want to swipe and was trying to save the business a credit card fee by paying cash but I literally was told they couldn't give me change. That sent me over the edge. I can understand if I was spending $5 or $10 and trying to break a $100 but over half of it was going toward the bill! And I would have given the server a tip meaning even more of the money would have went back to the restaurant. So the moral of this story is to bring small tiny bills like a kid to Melba's or swipe your debit or credit card. The high priced poundcake and the inability to pay cash for my meal is the reason why I give this 3 stars. It ruined my experience."

Didn't care to much for the price of the oxtail and its small portion size, But very tasteful and delicious. Male  Customer service over the phone could use a little work, He was a bit rude.. Social distance could also use some work, everyone is still to close to each other.  Would not sit and eat, But will definitely order and pick up again.."

12/24/2018,5 star rating,I've been to Melba's twice before today and I've had good experiences but on Friday my dining experience at Melba's was great. Our waiter was pleasant and super attentive.Our food came out FAST and hot. I ordered the Wine Braised Short Ribs with Mac N Cheese & Sautéed Spanish (the spinach was kinda bland to my liking) but everything else was delicious and highly recommended.Our time at Melba's was quick but memorable. I appreciate the timeliness of the whole experience. Hopefully Melba's will paint the walls and update the decor a little bit.I know sometimes service can be a little slow but on this particular night it wasn't which really shifted my view of the restaurant.
5/10/2020,3 star rating,We were really excited to see what all the hype was about. Service was a little slow but we enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was average and lacked flavor - guess we are spoiled to good home cooking in Texas. This was nothing to write home about.
3/14/2020,5 star rating,"After a long day of drinking and eating mediocre meals my gf and I headed to Harlem for some soul food- we were told that Melba's was the spot to go to and we are so glad we listened. We ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and A$AP yams and we loved every bit of it! The chicken was crispy, flavorful, and absolutely delicious! The Mac and cheese had such a cheesy flavor and not watery at all, and the yams were sweet and tender and perfect. Honestly we cleaned our plates so fast that we were bummed we didn't get our own. But all and all the meal and service was exceptional and absolutely worth coming back to the next time we're on the east coast! Stop by, you won't regret it!"
12/1/2020,5 star rating,"Melbas is my GO TO & favorite soul food spot. Their food never disappoints. I've been ordering from this place my whole pregnancy and even post and I fall in love every time. They're consistent w/ their food quality as well as packaging. I love their tres Mac, the chicken and waffles is BY FAR THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. So perfectly seasoned and cooked. My only complaint is I wished they added non- alcoholic beverages to their menu on seamless. Other then that I LOVE THIS PLACE."
2/2/2021,2 star rating,"This is my 3rd visit and the food is flavored enough but I do have a few suggestions.  First, please clean the crab meat.  This is the 2nd time I've ordered the lump crab cakes and again I have bitten into SHELL! Not good at all. What if I had choked? Next, the beef short ribs sliders.  Very tasty but does the cook look at or clean the meat? Who wants to eat FAT from the meat on a sandwich where I'm biting into???? Disgusting!!! Last but not my least, please ensure that your cakes and pie is FRESH. I'm from Maryland and grew up eating crabs and crab cakes and never bit into SHELL. I wanna go back to ensure that you've gotten it right and in these times and ALL TIMES, I want to support you! Please don't take offense to this review I am telling you about my experience at your establishment. Hopefully I can refer friends and family but at this time based on my three visits to your restaurant,  I simply cannot. Simply,Sent with respect"

10/5/2017,3 star rating,"I can't help but compare my chicken and waffles to Amy Ruth's. I prefer Amy Ruth. Melba's sits on the corner of 114th and 8th and opens at 5 for dinner M - F to a waiting crowd. There were 12 people waiting when we arrived at 4:55pm. The hostess was pleasant yet seemed overwhelmed when we all entered at once and she had to sit everyone. Melba's like many of the eateries in Harlem is cozy and is packed on the weekend. The bar sits 8 and yes they have happy hour; $5 drink specials and $5. food items like wings and shrimp. If you are coming for happy hour get there when they open. We opted for the dining room. The server was nice and the food came out promptly. We had the chicken and waffles. Not sure why the waffles are advertised as egg nog. There is a hint of vanilla but definitely not an egg nog taste. The 1/4 white chicken that accompanied the freshly made waffle was seasoned well and cooked to order. 3 wings and a waffle would have cost $2.00 more. We should have went with the wings; the couple next to us had it and it was definitely more chicken than the small breast and wing we had. The strawberry butter is great if you like strawberries. I would have preferred honey butter and fresh strawberries. We had a side of mac and cheese and while looking around at other patrons we ordered a side of collards and yams. Skip them if you go. The greens were good but about 1/2 cup worth arrived and the yams were cold and really not sweet. The macaroni and cheese was very good. They did remove the cold yams from our bill. Amy Ruth's portions are much more generous. $53 for 2 orders a of chicken and waffles, greens and Mac and cheese. Glad we went since it was bookmarked. I would go back only if the line at Amy Ruth's was too long."

And Alisha and I talk about relationships, our children, careers...just good times. The food is absolutely amazing! Good ol' southern goodness. My favs are the catfish and waffles, the catfish strips w/the chipotle sauce, the salmon with 3 cheese mac & collard greens...smack ya momma good, you betta tell somebody. They also have an amazing open mic night, I believe it's Tuesday (or Thursday...check to make sure) the band is incredible. Come here you won't Regret it.

Had the french toast, eggs w/ chz, and turkey sausages. All were very good...worthy of a second, third, etc visit. The biscuit they serve while you wait for your entree is delicious. For dinner, I've always had the salmon...it's really good, it leaves me satisfied. For apps, I've tried the spinach & chz empanadas, catfish strips, crab cakes, and Melba's spring rolls, all were good, but my favorite is the catfish strips. The ceasar salad is ok, it could be better. The drinks are PERFECT.Never had dessert...too full by the end of the entrees. Oh..I almost forgot, sides- mac n cheese= hot damn! :-) Collard greens, candied yams, and rice...all good  sides. Mashed potatoes...were just ""ok"". Tuesday nights they have live music, but make sure to reserve a tbl..as it fills up pretty quickly."
7/31/2020,4 star rating,"Very good. I've been here countless times! During COVID times this obviously is not the same as the dine-in experience (everything was served to go and eating this amazingness with plastic forks doesn't quite feel right). Nevertheless, still recommend (but don't let the outdoor experience be your first/last time)."
6/9/2020,5 star rating,"I was born and raised in New Orleans. I recently moved to Harlem. When I am homesick, I order food from Melba's. They get soul food. It's authentic deliciousness. They have the best collard greens in Harlem. I HIGHLY recommend ordering from Melba's!!! Also, the coconut cake will literally orally transport you to your childhood going to family gatherings eating coconut pineapple cake on the porch with your cousins. I love this place"

11/21/2016,2 star rating,"So me and one of my besties were so excited to come here and get our grub on, we were starving and wanted to soul food to stick to our bones.I am not sure because we got there at 9:15 and they closed at 11pm we got the bottom of the barrel food.Cocktails-We got the French Martini which was Vodka, Chambord, and pineapple juice. I asked the waiter what kind of Vodka is the drink made with and he said whatever kind you like. We both had it with Cirroc. So I am picky because I must admit I make killer cocktails, but this drink was so unbalanced, so strong. I think some places try to make a strong drink versus a good craft cocktails, that would be the case here. If the ingredients were more balanced and the ratio was better it would have been great. When we got the bill the cocktail was $2.00 more than the menu said, when I asked our server Luis he said it was because we got it with Cirroc, I let him know he didn't say it would be an upcharge, he said whatever Vodka you like. He removed it kindly.FoodShort Rib Sliders-Sooo dry it made me so sad, most of the pictures showed 3 sliders however we were served two and Luia said that is how they come. It really was like the last short rib had been sitting out all day and they scraped together two sliders.Chicken and waffle-The chicken was juicy and fried nicely, the waffle was cold and you can tell it had been sitting out. Not impressed just really hungry and expected more.We told Luis we wanted to see a dessert menu and he came back with our check instead, so I guess they were ready to close and get us out of there.Not the best experience, however I would come back earlier in the day to see if it is any better."
7/6/2020,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's on Sunday, July 7, the first time I had dined there.  The pandemic was at this time so customers were treated to outdoor dining.I ordered ox-tails with gravy besides rice and peas.  Only complaint I have is when given the plastic utensils to eat with there was no spoon.  The utensils were enclosed in plastic wrapping, fork, knife, and napkin.  I was not able to scoop my gravy onto my rice and peas.  I asked the staff more than once, could I please have a plastic spoon.  They told me they did not have one.  Normally, I am used to having a spoon, fork, and knife to eat with.Please could this be corrected?   Thank you BTW I did enjoy the ox-tails."
11/10/2016,2 star rating,"I was able to make a reservation for brunch on a Saturday which was a definite plus, as a lot of brunch spots in NYC don't offer that option. Our reservation was at 1PM and we had to wait a little bit because I wanted to sit in the corner booth which was still occupied at the time of our arrival. Once we were seated, it was nice and cozy and gave us a full view of the small and homey space.It took awhile for our waitress to take our order and she actually took the order of a couple of tables that were seated AFTER us. The busboy was very polite and accommodating though and it almost felt like he was more of our waiter than the actual waitress. The waitress finally came so that we could order, but then the food didn't come until over 45 minutes later. We came at 1PM and were not served until after 2:30PM. The reason we were given was that the kitchen had a large order for a group, but I have been to restaurants twice or three times the size of Melba's and those places have never taken that long to prepare the meal. I ordered the eggnog waffle and Southern fried chicken entree because it is their specialty and I wanted to try it out for myself. I admit the fried chicken was very delicious- Incredibly crispy, well seasoned, flavorful, moist and tender, but the waffle was just okay. I was able to taste the eggnog, but for me, it wasn't quite strong enough. If you are going to call something ""EGGNOG WAFFLE,"" you better back it up with tons of eggnog flavor. I also thought the waffle was too soggy. My friend got the egg white omelet with cheese grits and a side of sausage. Overall, she found the omelet to be bland and the overall meal to be mediocre. It was difficult to get the waitress's attention throughout the time we were there. Then, after we were finished with our meals, it took the waitress awhile to get the check to us. However, I will say that the hostess was both lovely and sweet, as was the bus boy. I really wanted to like this place a lot more than I did, but I was disappointed by my experience here. I will not be coming back."

3/2/2020,5 star rating,"TL;DR: What on earth do you need to know other than fried chicken, fried catfish and waffles? I mean Melba greeted us at the door AND THEN FED US!I've been on a vendetta to support more black owned restaurants and my husband bribed me to consider stepping outside of the apartment for once, with Sunday brunch... and he knows nothing makes me move faster than the idea of fried chicken. He's a good man & he knows how to play me. It's why I married him.  The second we step in: it's cozy, there's an amazing array of art on the walls, you can hear the gentle murmur of a local favorite for sure, there's a bottle of hot sauce and a bottle of syrup on the tables... you know you're in the right place.  Our waitress, Alicea I think, was super sweet and really responsive. She was also super cute when she heard my Scottish husband's accent and told us about her plans to take her daughter to see Peppa Pig World in the UK. I got the mango mimosa which was good, but I was kind of hoping it would be a bit thicker with mango juice. Still hit the spot though! But let's be real, I'm here because of the FRIED CHICKEN. I had the chicken and eggnog waffles, my husband got the smothered version. BOTH were excellent. You guys, I absolutely CLEANED my plate. If I didn't have a strict rule about crying while eating, I would have been sobbing with ecstatic joy while I stuffed my face. I mixed that hot sauce with my chicken and soaked my waffles in the syrup - frickin' taste explosion! The yummy butter they use on the waffle... I just can't. We decided to make absolute sure we take visiting friends to Melba's - you just can't get this kind of deeply delicious American comfort food anywhere outside of the US. You just can't."
9/9/2016,5 star rating,"I gave this place 5 stars and I loved everything about it from the food to the ambiance to the service.  Now I am a firm believer soul food is something prepared at home with love, and not duplicated in a restaurant.  Anywho I had a friend in town that wanted some good soul food.  There are a couple of soul food establishments in Harlem that I have tried and regretted.  Melba's proved me wrong and they gained a new customer!We went on a Thursday night and I called ahead of time to make a reservation for a party of 2 because based upon the reviews I thought it would be packed.  When we got there another friend joined us and the staff was very accommodating.  Melba's isn't a large space with maybe 20 tabletops, but at no point did it feel congested.  They also have an inviting bar that can probably seat 8-10 people as well.Everything on the menu looked so good and make the decision difficult for dinner.  The good thing about this type of situation it is great because it gives me a reason to come back.  For appetizers we started with Melba's Spring Roll and Southern Crab Cakes.  What I will say about the Crab Cakes were they were definitely meaty but on the small side.  I wasn't too crazy about.  But lets talk about the Spring Rolls!  The idea of black eye peas and green did not sound like it would be appetizing but my sister ordered them and I thought I would at least it give it a try.  THEY WERE SO GOOD! For dinner I ordered the fried shrimp with a side of greens and mac n cheese.  The shrimp was perfectly seasoned, the mac n cheese taste like my momma made it, and the greens were pretty tasty.Overall I enjoyed my time at Melba's it is perfect for small parties but if you would like to bring a large party call ahead.  I will be adding Melba's to my favs on my Harlem list."

I'm use to food that has more specialized seasonings. Being a Chef that teaches Culinary at a community college where I live. I specialize in teaching each Cohort of students Flavor Profiles for many types of cusine , knife skills, nutrition etc. Brian our server was very attentive and personable! With the exception, of the young lady with the long blonde braids. Who at the time that I was trying to get her attention. Acknowledged that she heard me when I said excuse me twice. Not only that the young lady looked at me like I was craaazy, I DID NOT APPRECIATE IT AT ALL!!! Also, the resturants decor and layout is beautiful and clean!! I can say I would go back to Melba's if I'm in the area..Nice meeting you Michael General manager is all about business.Chef Ramona"
5/10/2020,3 star rating,We were really excited to see what all the hype was about. Service was a little slow but we enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was average and lacked flavor - guess we are spoiled to good home cooking in Texas. This was nothing to write home about.
4/29/2020,5 star rating,I believe this is my 2nd time ordering the same dish in 4 days.  It is phenomenal.  I had the Jamaican Oxtail and it did not disappoint.  Ive sat in store for a couple of meals and always  had the chicken and waffles (which are to die for btw).  Overall damn good restaurant.  Cant wait till outside is legal again so I can sit inside!

Since we have been quarantined we have been cooking a lot and freaking out and doing frequent grocery runs ---- but we were both craving soul food so we caved.We each had a delicious spread!!We ordered thru grubhub and got their candied yams, spinach, onion rings, mac and cheese, and the smothered chicken. We were silent the whole time and practically inhale everything.Thank you Melbas for expanding your delivery zone to get to my apartment, the effort you put forth to update Yelp, social media doesn't go unnoticed! can't wait to come into the actual location once this clears up... Thank you Melbas!!!"

The delicious catfish, mac and cheese, spinach and sweet potato pie reminds me that we can still create a joyous, peaceful space in our own home...even in a chaotic world. I would attach a photo...but I ate everything! YUM!"

I feel greedy as my mind does a brain freeze....though I know what is on the menu....trying to decide what to order first. Just know, I have to talk myself out of ordering the sweet potato pie first...the food is fresh and lovingly prepared and I highly recommend to all...especially if you are celebrating a birthday....and you may be able to meet the wonderful legendary owner Melba Wilson!

3/14/2020,5 star rating,"After a long day of drinking and eating mediocre meals my gf and I headed to Harlem for some soul food- we were told that Melba's was the spot to go to and we are so glad we listened. We ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and A$AP yams and we loved every bit of it! The chicken was crispy, flavorful, and absolutely delicious! The Mac and cheese had such a cheesy flavor and not watery at all, and the yams were sweet and tender and perfect. Honestly we cleaned our plates so fast that we were bummed we didn't get our own. But all and all the meal and service was exceptional and absolutely worth coming back to the next time we're on the east coast! Stop by, you won't regret it!"
3/8/2020,5 star rating,"Food- 9.5/10Atmosphere-8/10Service-8/10Value- 9.5/10TDLR- Hands down the best chicken I've ever had. Run, don't walk to Melba's. MEAL (APPETIZER)- We had the catfish strips and the crab cakes for appetizers and the signature chicken and waffles for the entree. The crab cakes were really good- you get a decent serving of actual crab (sometimes restaurants can fill up crab cakes with bread crumbs and extra stuffing and you're left wanting more crab!) The catfish strips were alright- I just wanted to try it bc I've never had catfish. MEAL (ENTREE)- Now to the MAIN PART of this meal: the chicken and waffles. The chicken was sumptuous- crispy, tasty, absolutely delicious. The waffle was so fluffy and rich. My only comment, which is kind of an odd one, is that the syrup on the table was lite syrup which meant I had to dump a lot into my waffle to taste anything. (I'm already eating fried chicken, I don't need lite syrup to try to balance it out and be healthy, just give me to good ole thick syrup haha). SERVICE and ATMOSPHERE- Service was good, as you'd expect for a proper restaurant. The atmosphere was chic, friendly, and warm. VALUE (def: is the price of the restaurant comparable to the overall experience of dining there)- 100%! It isn't overly priced, the food is fantastic, and I would definitely dine there again."

2/1/2021,4 star rating,"I came in on Saturday night. Ordered my meal around 6:30pm and was told that it would be ready at 7. I arrive on time, and my meal wasn't ready. It was packed with a bunch of Ubereats, DoorDash and Grubhub people waiting on their order for pickup. Last week was restaurant week so They clearly were busy. They told everyone that there would be a hour wait for their food. Luckily for me, I ordered online beforehand. Mind you, I made sure to order at a decent time cause I needed to be home at 8. I wind up getting my food at like 7:20. I checked it and seen that they threw in slice of sweet potato pie.. NICE! Prior to coming into melbas I was the grocery store on 116 looking for dessert and said to myself. ""I want PIE!"" I get home, and literally turn my key in my home at 7:55 pm to catch my movie. The food... was GOOD. First time ordering the Smothered chicken and it didn't disappoint. Everything was still moderately warm, and I was good with that. The Mac and cheese was flavorful, her potato salad was good, and that pie... that pie is what I asked for and what I needed. They were late but the food made up for it."
9/19/2019,4 star rating,"Found out about this place thanks to infatuation! We came here on Saturday for brunch -- at around 1:30 (they close at 2pm) and the place wasn't too packed which was nice! I'd say for brunch you have to get anything with chicken. If you get something else you are missing out/not worth getting. I got the chicken and egg nog waffles and man it was so so good! Best chicken and waffles i've ever had! I recommend getting the dark meat chicken (more juicy) only thing i was sad about was that there wasn't a good chicken to waffle ratio, a lot more waffle than chicken. Service here was great 10/10 our waitress was very personable!"
8/30/2019,5 star rating,"Came here for brunch with the family and so glad I gave this place a try. Great food, drinks, and customer service. We all sampled the menu with chicken and waffles, shrimp n grits, catfish, salmon croquettes. Just wish they had some Macon cheese on the brunch menu but enjoyed nonetheless."
1/26/2020,5 star rating,I'm going to give them all 5 stars just because I arrived at 2:50 ish and still was able to get a seat after being told I wouldn't be able to when I checked at 2:35p. Once seated it took about 10 mins to be seen by a waitress but once we ordered everything came out quickly. The food was amazing but the mimosas were slacking otherwise the entire meal was amazing. It was loud so was hard to hear the person I was with and your close to people but that's nyc for you right. I will be back of course.

I sent a message on Yelp when I made my reservation on Yelp and when we got to the door my husband asked to use the restroom and the hostess said ""we got your message for the birthday!"" It was perfectly done and husband had no clue. They sang the Stevie Wonder version of happy birthday... it was great and he was surprised the entire restaurant joined in! Love the ambiance... the only thing i disliked is having to locate my waitress during our dinner.. other than that... food was good... I definitely suggest this place and the fried chicken!"
9/23/2020,3 star rating,"Came here on Sunday with my Wife and Son. Been here before but it's been a few years since then so we came back just to change up from our usual go to spots. The service was ok. One waitress for about 7/8 tables so she was busy running around accommodating everyone. We ordered a carafe of Strawberry Mimosa which was pretty good, but not the best that we've had. We ordered Calamari and Catfish strips that didn't come until after our entrees were given to us. I asked to cancel the order since we were already eating our main plates but my Wife asked her to bring it out anyway since they said it was ready. The food was ok, but not great as it's been in previous visits. Not a bad spot but not as good as other spots in the vicinity."
8/8/2020,1 star rating,"We ordered from them and 30 minutes later, we received a notification from Grubhub that someone is picking up our order. Then we received an another notification from Grubhub saying the restaurant cancelled our order because they were out of a menu item. We would understand if it was right after we placed the order. That's no acceptable."
3/27/2021,4 star rating,"I went here a couple of weeks ago with my husband for dinner. It was a Saturday late afternoon and the place was busy. We had a 4:30 reservation and had to wait an additional 15 to 20 minutes.  As for social distancing it's fine when you are seated. They have the tables spaced out and plastic dividers up. But if you are standing and waiting for your seat it's a different story. The service was ok the main bartender was also our waiter.  He tried to be attentive but he was making drinks for the whole restaurant we didn't stress it. Just glad to be out. Now to the food.  I had the oxtails with yams, and greens hubby had the sea bass with spinach and potato salad. Everything was good the oxtail were delicious taste like I made them lol. Hubby enjoyed his food too but the size of the sea bass was the same size as an index finger he was not happy. Now to the drinks and dessert the drinks were a no for me. I wasn't sure what I wanted so I ordered a St. Germain and Prosecco that's was ok I should've stuck with that. Then I had a mixed drink it was terrible. Dessert was in 1 word disgusting. We ordered it to go. Coconut cake and I can't remember the other but it was so bad we threw it away. All in all I would go back just would order straight liquor and no dessert."

There was a nice size crowd so I was hoping that was good sign. It definitely was. We had excellent customer service. Our waiter came and greeted us and gave us some of his suggestions. We got our drinks promptly and appetizers on time. We never had to wait for everything. We tried the signature drinks on the menu and the bartender was not cheap with the alcohol. I was pleased. Our food was amazing!!! I had the catfish dinner- it came with 2 sides. I got the Mac and Cheese and collard greens. I added an extra side of a waffle. Everything was so good and had a lot of flavor. I haven't had good soul food in a while especially greens and they were Perfect!!!! My boyfriend doesn't eat pork and was happy when they had beef ribs on the menu. They were very good and the meat was so tender it was falling off the bone. He was so pleased with the food he got a turkey meatloaf  to go and he was so mad that he didn't get two orders. I will definitely come back and recommend to others. Thank you for the experience."

Clearly it was microwaved and not made fresh. The customer next to me ordered oxtails, mac and cheese and greens. Her food looked delicious! Perhaps I should have ordered that. The person I was with ordered the rib sliders and shrimp appetizer and was pleased."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"I've been on this catfish thing all month; so when I saw fried catfish and eggnog flavored waffles on their menu, I looked at nothing else. I ordered the ""Gin-uine"" (gin, aperol, sour, lime, muddled cherries) off of their specialty cocktail menu which was the perfect distraction, in addition to some great conversation, while I waited for my entree. The catfish and waffles were amazing. Amazing! I can't wait to go back to do everything over again like a scene from Groundhog Day. Everything was perfect. It was maybe 11:30 am when we got there, which was the perfect time to avoid any rush. The restaurant was just starting to fill up as we were leaving at 1:00 pm. Can't wait to go back."

I would recommend this restaurant to celebrate , for family night , and even friends night out. I enjoyed myself will come back"

10/14/2020,5 star rating,"Ive been going to Melba's since 2016...In General: I love going to Melba's the food is always amazing. My go to is the Country Fried Catfish with collard green and yams. Also, make sure you grab yourself one of their delicious cocktails, I always go for the Strawberry Henny, it definitely has a kick and it tastes delicious.Service is always great, but one time I remember on server who was amazing in personality and how she carried herself  professionally. She made great recommendations and was so accommodating.COVID Dining: The outdoor seating is nicely spread out on the corner. I did not have an issue with distancing or anyone not following public health protocol. My food was brought to my table fully packed in to go containers with napkins and utensils."

1/5/2020,2 star rating,Went to Melba's for brunch. I'm confused. Why is everyone saying it's so good. The butter tasted like it had been in the refrigerator. I was expecting the butter to melt over the waffles. It was cold. Too expensive for basic breakfast/brunch. My son was none too pleased as well. Do better.
10/17/2018,4 star rating,"This was a random surprise. I was at an event a few doors down, and we thought why not soul food in Harlem. There was a wait -- we rolled in around 8:30 on a Saturday night with no reservation. We enjoyed drinks at the bar while we waited for a table. I had a lovely South African Sauvignon Blanc. We were so hungry, it smelled like cornbread in the air but it was really waffles. Our server was polite and attentive. We saw the portions were large so we opted against appetizers. I got the oxtails, Mac and cheese and sautéed spinach. The latter was awful - no seasoning. But the oxtails were so tender and well seasoned. Unlike many restaurant Mac and cheese dishes it was AMAZING. The prices were reasonable, considering you could share. The decor wasn't particularly lovely BUT I would not hesitate to return."

8/16/2020,5 star rating,"Melba's food is great but the portion size not so much. Their mac and cheese is one of the best, probably the best in Harlem. Their fried fish is well seasoned and their drinks are delicious. The dining area is small but comfortable depending on how many people are there ( this review is based on pre-COVID dining.) The prices are a little high but when you're getting quality food expect a price to reflect the same. One time I came here I saw ASAP-Ferg dining so I guess you can say this favorite to celebrities as well."

2/17/2018,4 star rating,"Went here with co-workers NNN and DMJ. We are part of a secret ""food crew"" at the office that rotates through fine NYC eating establishments every month. First up was my choice: duh, KEENS. Second was NNN, MELBA's.MELBA's is a more upscale (yet still casual) spinoff from Silvia's, the famous Harlem restaurant staple that is always busy and something of a cliche political campaign stop for anybody stumping in the neighborhood. You know, like how they stop at a cheesesteak place whenever they are in Philly, or visit some cow farm in Iowa. Zzz...MELBA's was pretty great. I had the chicken and waffles and shared an oxtail, plus something else I don't remember. DMJ had a fish and reported it was good. NNN had fried chicken but the gravy was overly salted. MELBA's was good enough to take it back and give her something without gravy, but then it just wasn't the same dish. Too many places are just going mad with the salt and not simply using it as a baseline ingredient to seal flavor. SMH.Nice touch to see owner herself here!"
3/14/2021,3 star rating,"Food was good. Had the fried chx and waffle fries and mashed pots. Wife had the fried shrimp with greens and onion rings. The fried food were cooked very well to taste. Waffle fries and mashed pots were good. Greens were good. Onion rings were ok. Too much batter...way too much. The service was good. Our server, I forget his name, was very much on top of it. Busy for a Covid Saturday night. Only thing is, they need more menus. Either have everyone scan their phone on a barcode for the menu or have enough menus for ever customer. The female server who I asked for another menu basically made me seem like a crazy person for asking for another menu so my wife and I didn't have to break our necks looking at one practically sideways. Then making it known she went alllllllll the way outside in the cold to get me said menu. She needs better customer service skills. Overall good spot to try. A box checker...Just need more menus and not the attitude when asking for another one. Again, just have us all scan a barcode for the menu. Be better surrounding that. Oh one last thing...drinks are WAAAAAYYYY over priced. $21 for a Manhattan drink. Ummmmm no!"
12/31/2015,4 star rating,"So glad I got the chance to enjoy Melba's! The place is quite smaller than I expected but there was a steady flow. The service was great and very attentive. Samantha seated us and Raquain waited on us. Both were attentive and pleasant. Everything was delicious. Each of us ordered a different dish: The fish strips, the chicken and Eggnog waffle and the Fried chicken with rice and beans with spinach.For dessert,  we shared the Coconut Cake and the Red Velvet Cake. Both were equally yummy and satisfying.I look forward  to going back!"
9/10/2019,4 star rating,"Nice server , the host is pleasant and the atmosphere is comfortable the food was like home made cooking . I enjoyed the Short Ribs , MAC & Cheese and Collard Greens . I recommend this place for brunch which ends at a certain time check their website for accurate times for brunch . I believe there is a two hour wait after brunch ends then dinner begins Check first !"
3/17/2016,4 star rating,"After hearing about Melba's a bunch of times from my friend. Finally, he took us here for brunch. There seemed to be a wait, but 5 of us got seated right away. This is my first time trying chicken and waffle. I kinda have mixed feeling about it. You mean, you pour syrup on Chicken and eat it along with waffle? Oh hell, I'll give it a try anyway. After we ordered, we were served with scones to go with our coffee. Three of us got the fried chicken with waffle. I ordered mine with dark meat. It was pretty good with or without the waffle. One of my friends got collard green omelette. It was actually good and healthy. Make sure you get Bloody Mary!"
4/11/2021,4 star rating,"My friends and I went to Melba's, after a year of being quarantined and not having in restaurant dining. After receiving the vaccine, we decided to go out to celebrate our friends birthday and I am so glad we chose Melba's. The restaurant was set up with all the social distancing requirements, which we were all happy to see. However, it was our server Brian, who made our experience memorable. He was accommodating, professional, and most importantly patient and friendly while managing multiple tables. Brian, made our experience truly memorable and we are forever grateful. Thank you Brian for being a class-act:;-)"
9/19/2020,5 star rating,Food was amazing! Ordered the catfish strips with collard greens and mashed potatoes. Also ordered a second meal which was the eggnog waffle with southern fried chicken. Both meals were great and the service from our waiter Brandon was great as well especially considering what we are currently dealing with (covid/outdoor dining) this was my second time at this establishment and I will DEFINITELY be returning!
8/13/2019,5 star rating,"By far the best oxtails I have ever had in my life!!!  I recommend that you make a reservation.  Was seated quickly, service was good.  Really nice soul food menu.  I thought their collard greens were ok (surprised that they were a bit on the sweet side) and the same for the yams, they were ok, but not sweet enough.  I think next time, I will try different sides.  Friends, had their spinach and cheese empanada app and that was really good. Desert, red velvet cake and sweet potato pie, just can't express in words, how good they both were. If in NYC, Melba's should be on your list."
1/27/2020,5 star rating,I was in NYC for a weekend and was recommended this spot by a friend. I ordered the catfish and waffle and it was AMAZING! I had stellar service and can't wait to go back. I went at 11 AM on a Sunday for brunch and was immediately sat but when I was leaving the front was filled with people waiting for tables. Melbas is a little small on the inside but it is delicious! It's a must try.
10/24/2018,5 star rating,"I used to not understand how people can eat friend chicken or fish with waffles... until I went to Melbas. I ordered the Fried Catfish with Waffles and it was amazing. The waffle was slightly savory to compliment the fish and it was even better with the chipotle dip. Overall, delicious Brunch spot with a decent wait time and good atmosphere!"
12/28/2020,5 star rating,"Ms. Melba's restaurant, as usual, for me, came through, especially now during the pandemic.  I wish there was a way that I could leave updated reviews on Google, FB, etc., but since it has never dawned on me to leave a review on YELP until now, here I am leaving one here.  Ms. Melba's restaurant has been my go-to for the past, I think, since 2014.  I've either visited with my girls, have had a small anniversary shindig at her restaurant, and requested catering.  EACH time, I've experienced nothing but professionalism, friendliness, kindness, and GREAT food and beverages!  I've had the pleasure of meeting at Ms. Melba in 2014 or 2015 at her restaurant for my anniversary, and what a pleasant Hostess she was.  My second encounter was in 2016 at the Essence Circle of Sisters.  That is also when I've had another pleasure of not only meeting with Ms. Melba, but taking a picture with her and buying her cookbook, lol.  I've been a frequent customer of hers when she's not been present at her restaurant too.  Now, let's get to THIS year, 2020:  needed 35-36 take-away dinners with desserts and got above and beyond.  Ms. Melba, Mr. Reginald Warren, and her crew came through!!  I hear how difficult it has been for Black Owned Businesses and/or MWBs (Minority & Women Owned Business) during the pandemic.  I hope you stay open, Ms. Melba.  My friends, family and I simply love your food and I am thanking you to time indefinite!  God willing, next year, if the virus is eliminated or more under control to the point when restaurants will be able to have indoor customers, I'll be among the first to request a table for 30! ;)"
4/21/2015,5 star rating,"Where do I begin? From the very beginning...So I wanted to have my 3rd wedding anniversary party which was a surprise for my hubby.  Mr. Jonathan, the catering manager, I will say, has been most gracious from the time I sent the first email to him about setting time and dates aside. Ms. Melba was one of the most gracious, lovely,  and accommodating and professional ladies I've ever encountered.  I would go to her establishment over and over. Great service, great team, great food, great everything!  I'd give you 10 stars if I could :D"

And, the waffles are made with eggnog mix and comes with some kind of delicious flavored butter. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere, too. A+!"

8/31/2018,3 star rating,"It was an honor to have had eaten at this black own business and I would have given 5 stars, except:* No technology used for walk-ins to notify when their table is available. Only suggested due to the popularity of the restaurant and no waiting area. * Although waffles seems to be apart of their signature dish it was very dry. * One sever for a whole section, seating more than 20 guests combined with parties averaging 4 or more.  The food I had was fantastic, catfish and chicken was flavorful and went well with the spinach omelet. Our server Reyna was like Superwoman, despite how busy it was she very attentive and pleasant. If I return I will try the French toast instead."
6/26/2020,5 star rating,"Fried chicken and waffles -- I order this whenever I see it on a menu. Melba's can not be beat. The fried chicken is not a big portion but the waffle is amazing, this is an outstanding version of a tried and true classic."

4/22/2019,4 star rating,"Melba's, is one of the best soul food restaurants in New York, let alone Harlem. Each time I visit Melba's, I have a great experience. I recently took my mom and aunt there and they throughly enjoyed their meal, drinks, and dessert. Melba's offer a great vibe, good music, and amazing food. The Crab Cakes, Catfish, and bbq meatloaf are my top 3 favorites on the menu. Their cabbage, greens, and candy yams are very good as well. Also, please try the peach cobbler! It's sooo good!!"
8/23/2019,4 star rating,First time at Melba's and the food didn't disappoint. We ordered several appetizers and sides. My favorite was the slider. The meat was so tender and succulent. I also enjoyed the catfish. We ordered so much I couldn't finish my food. This will make a great snack for later.  I couldn't give five stars as the restroom was hot and unkept at the time of my utilizing it.
12/28/2019,5 star rating,I had an awesome time at Melba's this evening.  Brian R was our host and he did an exceptional job.  Definitely will come back Thanks Brian R.
3/21/2021,5 star rating,First dinner out in order a year. Was a bit hectic. Had to wait despite reservation but because I chose to sit inside. Was WELL worth the wait. 4 of us and everything we ordered was delicious. Our waiter Rich M was a magician. As busy and hectic as it was he did not miss a beat. Very attentive and got everything right. Will be back and will ask for Rich as our waiter. Real southern comfort food
10/19/2019,5 star rating,"Brunch today (with Olleigh as our wonderful waitress) was out of this world!  Chicken and waffles (with an extra piece of chicken, naturally) and shrimp and grits were the best of all time. And we went through half a bottle of their delicious hot sauce. Will make another special trip back sooner than later."
8/24/2019,3 star rating,We traveled uptown to 114th street from Mid-town for this restaurant and I wish I could say it was worth it. The food was ok but not seasoned well and the restaurant was very loud. They might have been under staffed this night but our server was really busy. There are a dozen better choices in Harlem for soul food and next time we'll choose wisely.
9/19/2019,3 star rating,"Wanted to love my meal but it was okay...  Customer service was excellent! I love this area of Harlem. I will return for another meal option. I was expecting more flavor. I know folks who live and die by this place.i ordered th e smothered chicken because they had no smothered pork chops . Mac and cheese, greens and potato salad"
2/14/2021,4 star rating,"We did Restaurant Week To Go here, and so glad we did!  Friendly staff, tasty food - everything was good, but the sautéed spinach was kind of magic.  Have I ever had better spinach?  Maybe, but can't think when.  The famous carrot cake is more of a spice cake, imho, but very delicious.  There was only one piece of catfish, so a little stingy there, but the mac and cheese was very generous!  I want to come back and dine in - it's a lovely space.  We love eating in Harlem!"
1/19/2020,5 star rating,"This place is a home run. Food is delicioys, I love their shirt ribs and their fried chicken with waffles with the strawberry butter....extra butter please!!! Won't be upset at all. I only wish they opened earlier so I can have lunch here. Lol."
7/11/2018,4 star rating,So far so good..came here because Amy's is closed for renovations...quick seating quick service.Short ribs deliciously tender. Candied yams just right. No one can match my mom's Mac & Cheese but this is a close second.The all butter pound cake took a while to come out but I think they just made it. All n all..I'll be back.

10/12/2015,5 star rating,"A few friends and I were hanging out in this neighborhood on Saturday. We were trying to decide where we were going to eat dinner. I pulled out my phone and went to my favorite source......Yelp of course to search for restaurants. Several restaurants popped up in the vicinity but I noticed that Melba's had at least 474 reviews and after reading a few reviews, I suggested that we give it a try. Upon arriving at Melba's, I noticed that it wasn't that large in size but it was just right.....leaning more towards an intimate setting. There is a bar section with about seven to eight bar stools.When we arrived it was fully occupied with few seats available at the bar. The host Michael came to greet me and was very nice. What I love is we came at the right time and didn't have a long wait to be seated because we only had a party of four. Upon being seated, our server Trent came over and introduced himself and welcomed us to Melba's. He was also very friendly and nice. He also was very attentive to each of his customers needs. Now about the food.....oh my goodness! We all enjoyed each of our selections from the menu. I really enjoyed my chicken and waffle. The chicken was seasoned just right and fried to perfection. The eggnog waffle was the best waffle that I've ever tasted. The strawberry butter was amazing that I almost wanted to ask to take some home with me lol. I truly enjoyed dining at Melba's and will definitely be back in the near future."
9/8/2019,5 star rating,"I FREAK'N LOVE THIS PLACE! It's so good I first came to Melba's for a late birthday dinner with my mom and aunt and I've been hooked ever since. The catfish is FIRE (amazing, excellent, superb). My go-to dish that I have become an addicted too, it's sinful.Today I brought my friend, it was his first soul food experience. Our waitress Olay is what I believer her name was. She was SO nice and helpful. She was bright and bubbly and over-all nice girl. Now my friend and I left in a food coma but it's worth it, perfect cheat meal."
10/4/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant has been recommended to me for YEARS by my Primo Antonio & tonight was the magical night to finally visit! My girlfriend and I were able to quickly get a table during the dinner rush and have the best server Olleigh, who made us first timers feel at home! She was super welcoming and had wonderful menu suggestions that made me think she read my mind moments after the introduction!Thanks to her, we were able to start off with the appetizers: Crab Cakes, Spring Rolls with the Strawberry Henny / Fruit Punch drinks! Then we received our main entrees, which were: signature southern fried chicken (dark meat) with eggnog waffles and marinated chicken cutlet with 2 sides of Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens. All food orders arrived at our table quickly and efficiently looking gorgeous as ever! We finished off the night with dessert being the savory goodness that was the Peach Cobbler with Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream and the Sweet Potato Pie that felt like a warm cozy hug from Grandma herself!Melba's has a warm living room atmosphere that invites all cultures and ethnicities into its doors with kindness and genuine smiles all around. We came in hungry and left completely satisfied! Thank you so much for the authenticity (especially when someone had a birthday and had everyone help sing the Stevie Wonder rendition) I cannot wait to visit this wonderful establishment in the future with more friends and family!Written by Joy"
5/4/2019,3 star rating,"Came here for brunch with my sister. I was underwhelmed. Our waitress was nice, and was helpful; cheery disposition. I purchased the southern fried chicken with the eggnog waffle. It states on their menu that it was showcased on the Food Network. The waffle was good, but I got no hints of eggnog, like at all. The chicken was greasy and it tasted of Old Bay (the seafood seasoning). It was hard for me to enjoy because I kept thinking that I should be eating shrimp with this seasoning.The Arnold Palmer was decent. Tasted more like tea than the combination of both. The decor was nice. Although seating is limited. We were also seated in the back of the restaurant in a really tight corner although it wasn't busy. My sister noticed that every seat had pillows, but ours. I think they thought we were young so didn't treat us as thoughtful as they would normal (adult) customers. My sister had southern fried chicken & pancakes. The pancakes were crispy & saturated in butter. It tasted like she was eating butter. I tasted it as well. She felt the chicken tasted like seafood as well. She LOVED their music (90's R&B)!"
7/23/2020,5 star rating,"Melba's is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. The best Mac & Cheese, the best waffles. I could go on and on."
3/10/2018,3 star rating,"I came here for happy hour and I really wanted to give this establishment 5 stars but I couldn't find it in myself to do it. They put a brand new bartender (Jessica) behind the bar by herself on a Friday of all days and, although she was sweet as pie, she couldn't manage whatsoever. She could barely remember orders and it took her about 20 minutes just to pour me a glass of wine. The mixed drinks were absolutely horrible. It was really busy so she was just rushing and mixing. They get 3 stars because the catfish strips and spring rolls saved them. They were absolutely DELISH!"
2/12/2020,1 star rating,Overpriced. Small portions. I placed a delivery order for the chicken dinner. I got ONE piece of chicken and 2 sides for $18!!! How sway??? I could've went to Popeyes for a fraction of the cost AND the same level taste. The food is ok. I called the restaurant 3 times no answer. Grubhub called them to no answer. Horrible service all around.
9/5/2020,3 star rating,Drinks were good. Service was good. Only thing I disliked was the fried chicken. It tasted bland and unseasoned as if they just threw unseasoned chicken in the fryer. However the waffle & strawberry butter was good. The fried catfish was good and the Mac & cheese and collard greens were good. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.
11/17/2019,5 star rating,The food and service is amazing. I had the chicken and eggnog waffles. My husband had the veggie burger. My husband and I have found our new spot!!!!
8/31/2020,2 star rating,"My family and I came around 5:50pm-6pm (was told no reservation was needed prior to coming) and not only did we have to wait between 45 min-1 hr. one of my family members had to write his name on a waiting list (On a Sunday) to be seated.  First, The crab cake meal I received was bland and include some shell bits, the mini hamburgers my nephew ordered was not edible and over cooked, the waiter/ress took too long to serve our meals while we saw other parties who came after us being severed theirs...The side spinach was okay, no flavor really....I think most of us agreed that the only thing good were the drinks and I mean good not great....Really disappointing experience for us and not to mention too pricey for what's being served but maybe for others, their experience won't be as disappointing..."
8/15/2019,5 star rating,Visited Melba's for the first time 2 Saturdays ago. I ate at the bar. I has two Mellini's along with an order of shrimp and grits and chicken wings. Food was delicious! Was happy to taste good soul food outside of my family's home cooking. Alicia was very nice and attentive even though it was quite busy. Awesome experience and I'd definitely come back! Thank you
7/27/2019,5 star rating,Came here after an event nearby. Originally planned to go to BLVD bistro up the block but I've always heard good things about Melbas. We were seated pretty quickly for a Saturday evening. It took a little while for our waiter to get to us which was a bit annoying but I think the quality of the food mad me forget about that. The catfish melted in your mouth the collards and Mac and cheese was the perfect pair. Overall great home cooked southern meal. Planning to come back very soon
3/30/2019,5 star rating,"My experience at Melba's was truly amazing,from the ambiance,the art work,food,drinks,and music.My family and I came to Melba's for my birthday brunch.

8/11/2019,4 star rating,"Still dreaming about the catfish!I went to Melba's for the first time despite living in East Harlem for years! Food was excellent!!!We had spring rolls, crab cakes, Mac n Cheese, eggnog waffle, and catfish strips!! All were good. I didn't love the Mac n Cheese, crab cakes were full of fresh crab but a bit heavy on the mayo. It needed a lemon wedge. My friends loved the spring roll. It had a prefect thin crispy crust. But it wasn't my fave.Catfish Strips were OMG!! So fresh so perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. They. Were. The. Best. And I loved the waffle!!! The texture was great soft moist. I just wished it had a crispier crust.Catfish is a must there!! Drinks were inventive and well made but I didn't love mine ... I should have asked for non-well alcohol!Bonus is it's also on a strip of other cute restaurants. Several w outdoor seating and even a Paint and Pour paint your own painting and wine place!"
2/27/2021,5 star rating,Melba's gets a five for the service but a 4 for the food.  I've had better soul food other places but they treat you like royalty.
1/21/2018,3 star rating,"Melba's has a nice ambiance and perfect for an intimate date night.  The host and server were very gracious and friendly.  The food however, was on the salty side.  My oxtail was room temperature but my bf's chicken was right out of the fryer.  Other similar southern soul food places in Harlem in comparison are cheaper and have better food but if you're looking for a more upscale experience, Melba fits the bill."
8/16/2015,5 star rating,There are more pros than cons. It is a small really small restaurant but if you want to eat there go early. The host and waiting staff was so off the hook respectful. The Harlem Iced Tea was on point and not short of flavor but let's get to the real deal the meal. Ordered the country catfish with sautéed spinach and Mac and cheese. Sautéed spinach needed a little flavor but I had some of my fiancé collard greens and off the hook. The Macaroni and cheese was very moist and delicious. The catfish was well seasoned and very delicious. Inexpensive and very nice environment to have dinner there just needs to be bigger. Best to go there as restaurant is opening not later or make a reservation the day before. I definitely would return here again
6/19/2017,4 star rating,"After losing out on a foodie event, my friends and I stopped by Melba's for some good ole' country cooking and happy hour drinks. One of my friends swore by this place, so I was anxious to try it out. We were greeted kindly at the door and seated immediately. After we sat down, got comfy, and prepared our happy hour choices from a menu given to us, the waitress informed us that the happy hour deals are ONLY at the bar. Why are you giving us the menu then? Big waste of time and the drinks otherwise are expensive and small, so prepare yourself. Secondly, we ordered our meal with no issues. I opted for the Fried Chicken entree with potato salad and sautéed spinach. All 3 of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles dish and we split a side of mac n' cheese. I really enjoyed my meal, it was appetizing both to the eyes and belly. However, I expected a bit more flavor or seasoning. The chicken had some good flavor and moistness to it but I feel like it lacked something in the seasoning, perhaps salt or paprika. The spinach was sautéed perfectly but it also lacked salt, garlic, butter, something to let me know it was more than bland. To save all of that, the potato salad rescued my meal! The potatoes were nice and soft, the seasoning was perfect, and it was served cold. I wish I had taken a side order home. It reminded me of the tasty potato salad you get at a BBQ which perfectly compliments the barbecue chicken on your paper plate. My friends loved their meals and cleaned their plate. As mentioned previously, we ordered sides of mac n' cheese, which was also very delicious.Other than the food, the service was good. We had not issues and the waitress was very attentive and personable. I would definitely return as I am curious about brunch. However, I don't see this as a place I would run back to. It wasn't that memorable in comparison to what I had heard and expected. I would only return if it was my last choice but I do recommend it to others."
6/8/2015,5 star rating,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. We were able to be seated right away, and the service from the start was excellent. Our waitress especially was very nice and we never had to look for her- she seemed to always know exactly when we needed her! The atmosphere inside is very hip, and it is very clean and classy. We decided to get one appetizer,  one side, and one entree, and that was the perfect amount of food. For the side, we got the mac and cheese ($5). It had the perfect amount of cheesiness, and you could tell that they used real cheese. The catfish ($8.95) was the star of the meal. It was so lightly fried, and the fish was ao juicy and perfect. It comes with this amazing chipotle dipling sauce that you'll be tempted to just eat even after you are out of fish. Finally, we got the Southern fried chicken with eggnog waffles ($14.95) because in the menu it was advertised as the winner of Throwdown with Bobby Flay! The chicken was amazing. We got dark meat so it was very juicy. It was barely greasy too, which was impressive. The eggnog waffles in my opinion qere just okay- they came with this amazing strawberry butter, and I think I would have liked it a lot more if there was more butter!Overall, a fantastic meal. Oh, amd the food came out so quickly that it was almost like fast food- it only took less than 10 minutes! We left full and happy. Give it a try!"
7/29/2017,3 star rating,"I want to give Melba's a higher rating because it's such a Harlem staple, and the food is very good. But recently, this restaurant has gone downhill. I've gone maybe 3 or 4 times in the last month or so, and each time there's been an issue with the kitchen. I believe there's a ventilation problem and the entire restaurant becomes smoked out. So much that they have to shut the restaurant down. In the middle of the afternoon - on a Sunday, probably the biggest day of the week for the fresh out of church brunch crowd. I'm not sure what the issue is, but they need to fix it fast. I'd hate to see Harlem lose a great place. On a brighter note- the staff is still very nice and the food is still awesome. On my most recent visit, I got the catfish and waffles with a side of eggs and my friend got the catfish and French toast with a side of home fries. Both a home run."
11/9/2020,1 star rating,"Tough tasteless and dry, that's how I describe the braised beef short ribs delivered to us. If the ribs were braised in a wine sauce,  then hogs speak French.  We may be talking about yesterday's leftovers frozen and thawed. It was just this side of edible and we were totally starving so we didn't call the restaurant or grubhub to complain.  The spinach was under cooked and the rice and peas and were dry;  and  both were unseasoned  as far as we could tell. Don't get me wrong. Melbas at the top of its game is the best soul food in town....almost. But they have a serious, fatal problem with quality control and this is been going on for decades.  The food delivered to us from Melbas was a hate letter delivered to loyal customers for decades. Nov 6, 2020,  at dinner time was when this travesty occurred."
7/24/2019,5 star rating,"My second trip to Melbas was just as great as the first. The atmosphere is ol'skool Harlem. From the time you walk in to the time you leave, you will be jamming to old school r&b jams. The staff is so friendly.The food is Amazing. It is classic soul food. I had the Fried Catfish and Waffles.Every time I go to Harlem, I will be sure to stop by Melbas!"
2/16/2019,3 star rating,"The food was just OK. The fried chicken was overdone. The grits were yummy. My friend had catfish which was good, but the ""home fries"" although flavorful, were soggy. They have bloody Marys on the menu but no celery or olives - wouldn't have made a difference because the drink was watery and tasteless. The mango mimosa was 3/4 mango and 1/4 champagne. We watched the ""bartender"" make a carafe of mimosa and he put MAYBE a single glass of champagne in it. The waitress overcharged and then spent 20 minutes trying to correct the error. The manager came over and had trouble fixing it as well. With so many great brunch spots in Harlem, they're gonna need to step it up to compete. The ladies seated next to us weren't fans of the food either. Been there, done that. Won't do it again."
11/4/2020,1 star rating,If I could I would rate them with less than 1 star. I ordered on Uber eats. I ordered chicken and waffles and didn't get the waffles. I called be restaurant to see if they could fix my order. They said that I had to figure it out or come to the restaurant and pick up my missing items. The manager was extremely rude and blamed me for the issue. Be careful when ordering from them via Delivery services.
3/8/2015,3 star rating,"My Sunday Experience: I called ahead for reservations. I was told I didnt need a reservation for two on a Sunday night...Sundays are not busy unless I was coming for brunch. The lie detector determined...that was a lie! If we had arrived another 10 mins later, there was no way we would've been seated right away. Not to mention the table next to me was reserved for a party of 4...The Food: everything was great, spring rolls were tasty. Smothered southern chicken was delish, however; the gravy was too salty for my liking. I took some of the skin off and WA-LA, perfection. I didn't like the presentation of the chicken...looked more like a hug dinosaur egg fresh out a t-rex's *****. My friend had the catfish which was a.m.a.z.i.n.g! Not everyone can cook catfish, Melbas got it right. Sangria was great...no complaints.The Set Up: I didt like it at all. It's a very tight squeeze. We sat in the middle and while we dined, those who had to wait kept giving people the eye. The eye as in, aren't you done yet? Can't you talk on your way out? Can't you take the bone with you? When exactly DO you plan on paying??? No, I can't...They have different hours...brunch hrs (I believe 10am-3pm) then they close then reopen at 5pm. When we arrived, people were waiting outside to make sure they had a seat. Once we were in, things didn't seem orderly. We were seated but the staff seemed rushed, I felt rushed and my waiter (Trent) was absent most of the time. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I knew for sure it wasn't crowded & my patience were not the size of a grain of salt."
5/26/2019,3 star rating,Came here for some soul food but not that impressed. I usually write details review but there's nothing to much to write. The crab cakes wasn't good. I've had better ones from Costco frozen crab cakes. The spring rolls? Not sure what it's all about but I wouldn't order it. Oxtails was okay. If you want oxtails go to Versailles in Miami and you can thank me later. The only redeeming quality is the fried chicken and waffles. Chicken was crunchy but not as juicy. Didn't care much for the eggnog waffles. Best chicken I've had is Mike's chicken in Dallas if anyone wondering.
5/3/2018,5 star rating,"For a Tuesday evening, I loved everything about Melba's. The only fault which I could think of was perhaps that I couldn't really eat their chicken and waffles through no fault of their own but rather my wisdom tooth growing in. We arrived around dinner time (7ish) and the place was just starting to fill, but there was no wait. My tooth and I ended up ordering their 3 cheese Mac n Cheese entree with two sides - mashed potatoes and rice and beans. I have no regrets! The portion of their Mac n Cheese was large (we ended up talking half home) and the sides, for being sides, were great too. They serve the kind of mashed potato that melts in your mouth and rice and beans that make you want for more. My boyfriend unsurprisingly ordered their signature chicken and waffles. He devoured an incredibly soft waffle and crispy chicken in minutes. They serve this dish with strawberry butter which I thought was interesting and an unusual pair. When it comes to the ambiance, the place is very homey without feeling small. The service and the people are great. And if you're there for a birthday, I advise you to rehearse your best version of Stevie Wonder's happy birthday song ... you'll see."
2/25/2018,4 star rating,Melba's is a Harlem gem. The food is amazing especially the grits  and sweet potato pancakes. Our server was Sara. She was very nice and helpful but a tad bit slow; maybe because it was a rainy Sunday morning. Also this place was pretty expensive but kind of worth it.

2/3/2017,5 star rating,"As a life longer New Yorker, i am not sure why it took me so long to try out Melba""s.  My friend and I arrived pretty close to their closing time (it was packed) but the amazing waiter let us order and sit at the bar! The chicken and waffles were exactly what i would pictured it to be!So Yummy! and the strawberry butter was OUT OF THIS WORLD!Our drinks were also good, and the bartender (male, Hispanic, super cute) was a sweetheart!!DONT DELAY, GO TO MELBA'S TODAY!"
1/30/2018,4 star rating,"The chicken and waffles is what saves this place. I would give that dish 5 stars. But the frittata we got was mediocre and service was spotty. I also noticed that my chicken piece was the runt of the litter and noticeably smaller than everyone else's at my table. Not sure I'd make the trek from Queens again, but if I was craving c&w and in the area, I'd come back."
7/21/2019,4 star rating,They would've had 5 stars if only there was AC... it's dangerously hot outside and for them to have people working let alone eating in an establishment with no AC is baffling.. but the food was great! It's a bit too noisy for my liking so next time I'll just order take out
1/19/2021,5 star rating,"I ended up going to Melba's because they place I planned on going to was closed even though Google said they were open. Prior to making my way to Melba's I had given them a call just to confirm they would be open upon my arrival. A gentleman picked up the phone and was very pleasant and assured me they'd be open and even offered to take my order so my food would be ready when I arrived. Also, since it was my first time there so I wanted to see the menu since I'm from out of town. Upon my arrival I was greeted immediately. The positive energy was felt as soon as I walked in so I was glad I opted to come here. The young lady who took my order recommended the chicken and eggnog waffle and I trusted her judgement eventhough I DO NOT like eggnog, but OMGEeeeee.... They both were sooooo delicious. The facts that my food came out in less than 10 minutes and was hot, fresh and very tasty. The chicken was sooo good. I even went back inside to order a few additional pieces to take back to my hotel. This time around I was helped by the gentleman who I spoke with on the phone (Reggie) and he was just as pleasant in person. While placing my additional order I was raving to him about the food and how I thoroughly enjoyed it. I let him know I was from out of town and he gave me some great recommendations for places to visit along with a little history. I had an amazing experience here at Melba's and recommend anyone visiting NYC to head to Harlem and try them out!!!! I'm so glad I did."

10/27/2019,2 star rating,We drove out to Harlem to celebrate my daughters birthday and we wanted to try something new & different. I've had soul food before and my fiancé cooks it often so I'm not new to it. I was simply underwhelmed and the icing on the cake was the overpriced check I paid at the end with a whopping  $30+ gratuity that is mandatory . The pros: the manager (I believe his name is Michael) was very attentive and professional . I'd called to check re: coming in a little earlier and he was very helpful even if they didn't have something available . Also our server was ok .We didn't hassle him with a lot of requests or anything so it's not like we were a difficult table to wait on. The dishes came out in a timely fashion and the drinks that 2 of my family members ordered weren't extremely watered down either . However that's where the pros kind of end .The cons : First of all before even stepping foot in the restaurant we had to circle for 45 minutes before even finding a parking spot . The parking is insane. We were about to give up and cancel our reservation but something suddenly opened up. In retrospect I wish we'd just chosen to go downtown somewhere ... The noise level was deafening . I don't know what can be done about it but I've been to many restaurants and don't recall ever dealing with that level of noise. Would it have been one of those days I'd been on the cusp of a migraine there'd be no way I could've tolerated it. We practically had to scream our orders at the waiter to be heard. The wait staff I came in contact with were friendly.Last but not least was the food which probably is the most important thing when it comes down to it. I had wings and waffles . I understand she was featured on Bobby Flay for this dish but it was underwhelming.  My son had the meatloaf and he said he enjoyed it but I was debating ordering it and didn't so I tasted his and I can say I am happy I didn't . My mother had the salmon and potato salad and spinach . She complained of lack of flavor on all the items . Again I had a taste and all items were VERY lightly seasoned . Not something you'd consider soul food . My fiancé had braised ribs and collards and some other side . He seemed to enjoy it so I'd think that was a winner. My daughter didn't really touch her food as she wasn't feeling her best and I had to pack it all up to go. My daughter also had a piece of chocolate cake as it was her birthday celebration and the staff was kind enough to sing happy birthday which was nice .We didn't order desert as we were just ready to go at that point. The icing on the cake was the $33 tip added on the bill . I was really unhappy but at that point I realized this is how it's done in Manhattan . Whether or not you are happy with service they will get their full tip . I'm not a cheap person and he would've gotten his tip but whether it would've been a 20% vs 15% is another story . I doubt I'll be back just because I found the food to be underwhelming .
10/14/2020,1 star rating,"BE WARNED!!!If I were you I would run for the hills. This is the worst restaurant to host your party. They cannot handle more than 2 guests at a time. I had the worst experience with the restaurant, manager, and the caterer for a party of 16 reservation. First, the restaurant told me to call their caterer Reginald (the worst) in order to confirm the reservation. It was one of the most difficult endeavors to get hold of this so-called 'caterer'. I would call text and email and also call the restaurant back and would only get a short response every two days. After so many hurdles I got my party of 16 confirmed and we were asked to pay half the bill ($540) before arrival. We paid!. Then upon arrival (on-time!), I was informed that I did not have a reservation at the restaurant, after speaking with the manager they finally told me I did, but no booths were reserved for my party of 16. they told me to sit anywhere. The second booth that my party was supposed to stay in was occupied by guests and we had to wait for them to finish eating before it was reserved. The kicker of the night was when I was informed that my guests will be served in Tupperware, i.e. in to-go containers! This was a surprise proposal party and I was informed of this. No one seemed to have been able to figure out what was going on, after speaking to the manager again he rectified this and served our food in plates (most food was lukewarm to semi cold). Finally, at the end of the night, our cake (which I purchased and put in the care of the restaurant ) had been smashed on the side, they then proceeded to use whipped cream to cover up the mess in the most obvious way possible. The only victory of the night was our waitress OLAY who helped and assisted the best she could (she is an angel), extremely understanding, and patient, and was a problem solver. I generally do not write reviews on yelp but this by far was the worst experiences of my life and I implore folks to never attempt to host a party (birthday, etc) at this restaurant. AS THEY HAVE NO IDEA what customer service looks like. BE WARNED!!!"
9/10/2019,1 star rating,Ouuuu they pissed me off last time. I drove from Clinton hills to Harlem for bland salmon and my food was cold. The buffalo wings were cold. I had nightmares after i left here. The date was a nightmare and so was my food. I rave about this place and it was an epic fail. I shouldn't have to use hot sauce on grilled salmon.
12/31/2018,5 star rating,"Melba's has been one of my favorite restaurants for the past year. I am never disappointed by anything there ever. My favorite item on the menu is the chicken and waffles. Their steak and eggs for brunch is also amazing. The mac and cheese is definitely in my top 5. The staff is super friendly and nice. I've never made a reservation just because it's right by my house, so I just walk in. The longest i've had to wait is 30 minutes and that's because our whole party wasn't there. I have taken a lot of my friends there and each person enjoys it just as much. The atmosphere and the music is always great as well."
8/23/2019,3 star rating,"Nice little spot in Harlem and a well known classic establishment. My friend and I kept it simple, my eggnog waffle with shrimp was very good. She got shrimp and grits which weren't bad either but the grits was a bit grainy, needed to be smoother"
11/9/2019,1 star rating,"We just moved to the neighborhood and a friend recommended Melba's as a good brunch spot. We were sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre. The fried chicken and shrimp/grits we ordered were horribly under-seasoned and bland-- barely even any salt on it. The grits were also lumpy and lukewarm. I wish I'd read reviews first as underseasoned food seems to be a staple of this establishment based on the most recent reviews. The food was also incredibly expensive for the value-- my shrimp and grits had five tiny shrimp on it for a total of $23. The icing on the cake was the rude, condescending service from our server. We could barely ask a question about the menu without her snapping at us. There was some confusion over the side I ordered with my meal, and she literally rolled her eyes at me like a petulant child when I attempted to clarify it with her. There are so many other great places in this neighborhood for excellent soul food-- save your money and go elsewhere."
12/13/2020,5 star rating,Best desserts as always. The sweet yam pie is always felt home away from home. The coconut pineapple cake is soooo good to die for. They have indoor and outdoor sittings. Prompt to attend customers even without reservation. But highly recommended to have reservation for the place easily got crowded.

4/8/2017,5 star rating,"We came here for a friend's birthday. We arrived 30 minutes early. The host greeted us immediately checked us in and went to fix the room. We were seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress Sherry was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a bottle of Moscato which was exquisite! We skipped appetizers and went straight for entrees. All of the food was delicious from the salmon to the chicken and eggnog waffles. You have to try ""Momma's potato salad""!! All of their team works together and is very helpful. Customer service two thumbs up!! I will def return no hesitation."
11/24/2018,4 star rating,"There will be a line, so get your name on the list (I think they take reservations) and just stand there. Totally worth it. I think I ate every side on the menu. You basically can't go wrong no matter what you order."
9/26/2015,4 star rating,I had the chicken and waffles and it was really good. Chicken was a little dry but seasoned well. Eggnog waffles were incredibly soft and good! The sis had the French toast which was bomb. Filled with raisins. Didn't like that the turkey sausage was fried--overkill at best. Mom had the catfish which was seasoned well. Home fries were BLAND so I'd suggest another side. Service was excellent! Sheer excellence. Guy was attentive and very pleasant. Prices are reasonable and portions are plenty. Overall good experience. Would definitely come back!
11/4/2016,4 star rating,"Southern comfort at it's finest. I'm not talking Popeye's here (although Popeye's is one of my most prized and favorite establishments for fatassory), I'm talking that home cooked goodness you'd expect walking into a southern family home. That soul...yea that shit was definitely felt in this food. The staff greets you with that warm sweet southern sunshine hospitality in this slightly darkened decor with a modern rustic feel.On to the money maker. It was pretty money. Ordered their famous chicken and waffles and you can understand why it's famous. You can taste the love that was put into that succulent piece of chicken. A few seconds overdone but nobody's perfect. The flavor is what counts here. You can taste the brine and blend in every bite of that bird. Decent crunch on that skin, not too heavy with batter. It was a proper piece of fried chicken I must say. For the price, a little steep in my opinion for only 1 piece of chicken, but not that it'll leave you starving after. The eggnog waffle with strawberry butter was just right. Fluffy as a pillow with a splash of magical unicorn sperm. The mac and cheese was also on point, great flavors and not gritty or oily at all. But the cake taker, them collard greens. Yea I'm not even a veggie kind of human, but those were the collard of all greens. I would definitely go back just for that. Peach cobbler is more dough than peach. The taste was good, but would've liked to see more peaches than chunks of dough. It was a modern take of a southern classic, but I would've just liked the classic style of a slice of pie oozing peaches from the side like it's got love handles for days. Stay fat mother suckers."
2/19/2020,5 star rating,"Baaaaayyyybeeee.... the food here is  nothing but the pure unadulterated  truth!  Everything from the wait staff, music, atmosphere to the FOOD was just what my guest and I needed.  There's no more to say, on this here night the Lordt hath made, Melba's served some of the best soul food Harlem has to offer."
11/27/2019,3 star rating,Melba's prices are ridiculously and outrageously expensive for no apparent reason. It's a typical soul food spot and the candied yams seem like they came out of a can.
11/4/2014,4 star rating,"I SOOOOOO Love Melba's!! The total experience is to be commended!! I decided to go to Melba's for my birthday family dinner on Tuesday, October 28 (Yay me!!).  My decision was based on recommendations as well as my cousin's suggestion.  So, I called and made a reservation for 12 with Maurice (the Manager I believe).  From the very beginning, Maurice was professional, kind, attentive, informative, and had a great sense of humor. He was clear and gave me good advice as far as when to come and the best time to arrive.  I called back and changed my reservation from 12 to 15...and it was not a problem.When we arrived (we were all on time excluding 2 in the party), Maurice somehow immediately knew who I was (good guess Maurice...lol!). He asked if we all were here and I told him no. But, I did tell him that my mother and aunt had arrived but were walker/cane dependent and needed to be seated.  Although our table was not fully ready (all but two seats), he allowed us to come in and begin seating.THE FOOD: The food was very good...everything from the macaroni and cheese, yams, fried chicken, waffles, short ribs, mashed potatoes, buffalo wings, salmon, and the collards.  I will say that the calamari was good once we added a little salt and my fried chicken was room temperature and needed a little salt as well.  BUT, my cousin's fried chicken was very good.  MY RECOMMENDATIONS: Short rib sliders and macaroni and cheese! YUUUMMM!ATMOSPHERE: We went on a Tuesday night and the band was AMAZING!!! the atmosphere was AMAZING!!! We had a freaking blast!!! My family danced, other people danced, people took the mic...it was just good, awesome, energy!! I REALLY HONESTLY had a good time. Melba was there and delicately engaged with the crowd.  She has a pleasant demeanor and smiled the entire time! I tried to take a picture with her but couldn't...next time :). I will definitely be back.... and if they keep it up I will be back again, and again, and again!!Maurice was very attentive to my family.  I also watched his interaction with other customers and he was the same.  There were a couple of changes with entrees and Maurice handled it.  If anything, he was even more professional and courteous as he worked to rectify orders.... he was consistent with his professionalism and kindness.  I must say that many of us know that it can at times be challenging to deal with customers and with different personalities.  Really good Managers/employees are hard to come by...especially those who remain consistent AND compliment the business.  Well, Maurice, you compliment Melba's very well! Thank you!!!!!  I look forward to seeing you again and at Sunday brunch starting in November :)!!Okay, sorry to say but here are the CONS. 1.  It is a very small (intimate) place. But, they are expanding and the intimacy created the good feeling.2.  Live band only on Tuesdays. For those of us who work it was difficult for a Tuesday night (for me at least). I didn't get home until almost 1am, in bed by 2am, and had to wake up at 6am. I hope that they will expand and have the live band on Friday nights and/or on Saturday nights.3.  The benches outside.  There are cute old school metal benches but not so comfortable -- especially for the elderly. One of the benches was leaning too.4. I didn't get my birthday pic with Melba!!! :(  -- I will try again next time :).Despite the ""CONS"" I will return and I hope to see ALL of you who are reading there! Lol!!*Please excuse any typos -- I am not proofreading...lol!"
8/25/2019,2 star rating,"Also confused by the 4 star rating here. The place was bustling when we arrived but the way they operate is horribly unorganized. It's literally with a pen, paper and a few tablets. Our drinks were missed, they were ""out of"" menus and it took forever to get served. I ordered a burger. It was very thin and it tasted like the grill needed to be cleaned. My friend ordered a salmon patty thing. It was over cooked. Small places at this price point are usually better."
12/18/2019,5 star rating,Wonderful live Jazz Singing and band performances Tuesday night and the hostess that works there that evening is top notch.  Food was excellent. I've brought many folks there and all have enjoyed the food and entertainment. Had a slight hiccup with a phone reservation so be sure to use yelp online to confirm your spot. With that being said the hostess was absolutely fabulous with service recovery by making it up to us that stay and during the next reservation. The staff are welcoming and attentive to repeat customers -don't be surprised to have an anniversary or birthday shout out during the jazz event!I would absolutely recommend people visit!
12/14/2019,5 star rating,"So I would like to say that the general manager is was amazing . I called in when I was running late for my reservation for a party of 9 and also a side party of 5 as well  , he accommodated when I really needed. He checked on us all the time to make sure we was okay . Brian our servicer was a little overwhelmed but he made  it happened I would like to say . He served all of us well . Food was great . I would like to recommend this place definitely. Comfort food  all the way !"

8/19/2019,1 star rating,Came here with friends to celebrate friend's birthday. The was my first and will be my last time at this establishment.  I will never come back  to an establishment that has a server that basically did not make an effort to correct a mistake that she made on a bill. Mind you the  gratuity was already built into each person in my party of five's bill. Despite that I was basically over charged on my credit card by over 20 additional dollars. So  basically the server pocketed an additional 20 + on top of the 11% gratuity already added to bill. She  was then asked to correct it.  This was after she mistakenly charged one member in my part of five credit card twice. When it was brought to her attention she did correct the mistake but then overcharged my card. When it was brought to her attention I was told that she was really busy and had other tables. Really?!? If you are that overwhelmed then go get the manager. The food was rather average not very remarkable. I had the short ribs and so did another member of our party. The difference between the two dishes were very noticeable. My friend's short ribs entree were very salty and over cooked. While my short rib entree was cooked just right and came off the bone. The tables are jammed in and once you are seated you practically have to squeeze your way through other patrons while they dine to get to the restroom. Go to the bathroom before you are seated. We were told there was a wait if 20 minutes so opted to wait at the bar. The drink I had at the bar was delicious but that's the only thing at this establishment I would recommend. Other than that I will not be fooled again or be charged double for a mediocre meal. Looked at dining room and saw there were open tables.
2/15/2020,5 star rating,"Melba's is a sweet combo of good vibes, good tunes, good drinks, and great food. Our order was perfect. Crab cakes app., barbecue turkey meatloaf, chicken n waffles, maple syrup yams and collard greens. And you'll feel very taken cared of. Luv you Melba"
1/4/2020,5 star rating,Melba 's food was amazing. Seasoned well and over all delicious.The staff was great and attentive. The drinks are well worth the price. And I left completely satisfied. I would recommend going to Melba's any day.
11/8/2019,3 star rating,"Weekend brunch! Overall: Space 4.5, Food  3.5, Service low/mixed. The restaurant is a busy & sunny space. My friend and I ordered the popular waffles & chicken, & French toast & chicken. Waffles were a bit bland & French toast was oddly sweet, but they fulfilled the brunch carb cravings :) Chicken was well done & great flavor.Service was such a mix. We had coffee, but empty water glasses most of the time. Generally, the employees & overall environment had a wonderful energy- all except for our server, Alysha. Looking back after the fact, she was a little abrupt to begin with, but nothing memorable until we were checking out. My friend noticed that her entree was listed as a different price on our bill than we remembered from the menu and asked Alysha if that were the case. She insisted that the bill price was correct, & my friend asked if we could just look at the menu again. She got the menu and we verified that the bill listed the wrong price- & Alysha asks my friend ""what are you fighting about?"" My friend calmly says that she's not fighting.. our server throws another comment about ""fighting over a dollar"" and yanks the bill back when she eventually agrees to correct it. Alarming and strange service, but the chicken's pretty good"
11/13/2017,4 star rating,"Melba's is a Harlem staple that you must go to when in the area. I had heard about Melba's a while ago from Throwdown with Bobby Flay (on Food Network) when Melba beat Bobby with her chicken and waffles. Now I live in the area and try to stop by whenever I can and whenever my ""diet"" allows. This is soul food, people, I wouldn't waste my time on their healthy options. Melba's has a bar area and an extended dining room but it's still crowded on any given weekend. Trust me, it's worth the wait. I think they need some work on the cocktail menu and a professional mixologist could work wonders for them. Their drinks remind me of ""cocktails"" my friends and I would make in college and Melba's deserves better than that. It's okay, I'm there for the food anyway. I usually get the chicken and eggnog waffles. It's some of the best fried chicken I've ever had and the waffles accompany it perfectly. Last time I went, my brother got the short ribs with mac & cheese and mashes potatoes. The short ribs are incredibly flavorful and tender and the mac & cheese rocked my world. You can't go wrong with the entrees & all of the sides are delicious (never forget the collard greens and yams).  So from now on, I need to order the entire menu and you should too."
9/8/2018,5 star rating,"My husband and I are extremely thankful for the wonderful service provided by Melba's for our Grandmother's memorial brunch. Our family was treated well from setting the reservation, providing the wonderful space to serving  the food.  The waiter Brian was respectful, polite and tended to our needs quickly.  The amount of food provided for the service was surprising and as always delicious. Melba's is A+ and is highly recommended for any event you may have."

So I ordered the Salmon dish with sautéed spinach and a side of potato salad. Sheesh ! It was seasoned to my liking. I will definitely be going back again.
6/13/2017,5 star rating,"Off to a pretty good start!  The menu is enticing, and so are the Yelp reviews and photos.  Began with a cocktail - Rum Punch, which is delicious.  NOW, time for the entree - short ribs, pease/rice, and greens - ahhhhhh, can't wait!Okay, I finished my entree with a side of chicken (dark) and WOW - the meal was off the heezy fa' sheezy!  I will not EVER return to NYC without enjoying Melba's!"
7/28/2018,4 star rating,"""Comfort food"" is right. I'm a fit guy with the spirit of a fat guy so here lately Melba's is the only place that really hits the spot when I want some 'real food'. I arrived today and was greeted by two hosts, although they had several reservations restricting the availability of tables, one of the hosts made it a point to get me a table where I wouldn't have to rush out because of an incoming reservation. I wouldn't have minded sitting at the bar where I was initially placed because the bartender was really great to look at (whole other story, lol). Seated at my table, I wasted no time ordering 4 wings with mac & cheese and candied yams. My mind was made and I was on a mission. The wait wasn't long at all and when my plate arrived, I swear I heard harps strumming and angels singing. My inner fat boy, ""Tiny"" did a praise dance as the waiter sat my plate on the table. I posted a pic of my meal to my Instagram and immediately made anyone jealous whom I had previously asked to come have dinner with me and they declined, TUH!! I put down my Instagrammer thing (my iPhone) and dug right in. Now, I must be honest, the fried chicken wings could use a revision or two on the recipe but it's nothing that a little hot sauce can't spruce up and make great, but something is definitely missing in the seasoning process, I can't quite put my finger on it but after a couple dashes of hot sauce, I put all 10 fingers on it... okay?!  Now, the mac & cheese tasted melt-in-your-mouth heavenly and the yams were yamtastic & sweetened to perfection!! (yes... I said YAMTASTIC) If only they would coat them with marshmallows slightly burned around the edges like Granni does on Thanksgiving, but I digress, they are STILL bangin' like Faith Evans on the mic. This dish w/ a glass of Melba's signature Mango iced tea was enough to have me so full that I was walking out of there looking like I was in my 2nd trimester, mind you, I'm a man, lol. There was a party going on in my section and I wasn't invited, I didn't know the people but when they burst out into the 'black' version of Happy Birthday, I sang along for 2 choruses and wondered when they were gonna stop (shrugs). I just let em celebrate & be great. Anyway, I finished my meal, I decided to go to the bar to have a cocktail. Ok, so I really didn't want the drink, I just wanted to see if I could catch the bartenders attention. The whisky sour wasn't the greatest but it served it's purpose in keeping me at the bar long enough to take in my surroundings as well as the attractive sight right in front of me. Shy as I am, I just ordered a peach cobbler to go which I didn't really want, I just wanted to speak to the bartender in any capacity. That drink must have been a killer because just that quickly, I forgot that I ordered the cobbler. My cobbler came and I looked at the bartender like ""Whats this?"", then I remembered that I had ordered the dessert. I closed out my tab and left. I am currently at home, at my computer desk committing 1st degree murder on this peach cobbler as I write this review. I'd show y'all a pic, but the bowl is empty now. I ripped through Every. Single. Calorie. So the moral of the story is.... Get up & go to Melba's (with hot sauce in your bag) :-) Until I get hungry again.......@allofsydir (on everything)"

10/13/2018,4 star rating,So let me start by saying Sylvia's is one of my favorite places to eat in Harlem. But I will give her daughter props. Melbas place is picking up where Sylvia's left off. Sylvia is has become more of the traditional Harlem spot and sort of touristy. Melba's  is situated a little further down on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and it's a little hipper than Sylvia's. The food gives Sylvia's a run for its money. Same family. Some of the same food. Different vibe. Nice addition to the Harlem community. My complaints are no cornbread brought to table while we waited (like Sylvia's ) and small space which made for a long wait. Drinks were good. The oxtails were some of the best I have had ! Def will try brunch next time.

6/18/2017,3 star rating,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did today.  I love chicken and waffles and wanted to live this one.  In short, the food was a 4 out of 5, service a 2.5, and value for money a 2.5.  We had to flag our waitress down to order, flag her for the check and not once did anyone come by in the hour that we were there to check in on how we were doing.  The bill for two orders of chicken and waffles ($16.95) and 2 sodas ($3/each) came to $50 (incl tip) - pretty pricey for the service and food.  The chicken was good but I've had better (was undersalted).  The waffle was interesting - had the density of pancake and was generous in size.  I think I prefer a more airy/lighter waffle.  Harlem is full of great fried chicken spots that have better service and won't break the bank.  Try those jnstea"
3/1/2020,5 star rating,We had the shrimp comfortizer and the Catfish dinner with collard greens and potato salad.

8/18/2019,1 star rating,"THIS PLACE SUCKS. Placed an order for delivery here. It took an hour and a half to be delivered (I live 5 blocks away), the order was incorrect, and the food was truly garbage. The mac and cheese was mealy and cold, the buffalo wings are just bad fried chicken covered in bad buffalo sauce, and I don't even know what to call the dipping sauce it came with, but it was not blue cheese or ranch and was the consistency of icing. It was so bad we threw it all out and ordered pick up from Shake Shack. There are many wonderful restaurants making similar a style of food in Harlem - eat at one of those instead."

I had the pleasure of trying the Chicken and Waffles $13.95, Fried Chicken and Grits $11.95, and French Toast $8.95.All of the dishes were on point, but the grits and toast stood out the most for me. The staff here is very nice."
10/24/2019,2 star rating,"Me and my boyfriend ordered some food from Melba's the other night and I have to say the food did not taste like I remember it tasting, we ordered short ribs, catfish, Mac and cheese, potato salad,yams all were in need of seasoning. The potato salad was horrible I had to boil eggs, cut up green peppers, onions, add relish, add paprika and other seasoning for it to be edible for my man! Whenever people ask me where is the best soul food I say go to Melba's ...I can't honestly send people here anymore if this is what the food tastes like. I'm sorry to say Melba's needs some improvement."

Unfortunately this wasn't a place to be intimate, now I know for next time it's a great girls night out environment."
3/10/2019,5 star rating,"I came with my party of six and Melba made us feel right at home. Unlike lots of the well known NYC restaurants, Melba warmly welcomed me with my family (including two kids) saying ""we were all kids once"" when we apologized for being a party of 6. Melba worked her magic, patrolling the place and doling out hugs to nearly everyone she saw. The food? Wonderful and soul filling. I'd love to try everything on the menu. I'm sure it's just as good as the chicken and waffles, greens, and Mac and cheese I tried.It's a special spot, and one I would frequent on the regular if I had the blessing of living here. Surely a must see treasure."
11/25/2018,3 star rating,"As much as I wanted to love this spot, it was truly underwhelming. This was my second time here, but first time sitting at a table to order food. Came with a party of 8, the people who seated us weren't that nice. They kind of shuffled us around then seated us at a table where if the person sitting all the way against wall and toward the window would have to say excuse me to everyone in order to get pass. I asked if we could move the tables just slightly away from the wall so that didn't have to happen, and was dismissed. So now to the food, and drinks... it was my brothers birthday so we wanted to get good drinks and food. The menu was interesting not too many options for vegetarians, not too much for vegans so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're seeking that. Most people ordered the fried chicken or salmon with either yams or Mac & cheese. I took the route less taken by ordering the grilled veggie Napoleon... interestingly tasty however it was just a tower of Grilled eggplant pieces, tomato & mozzarella cheese balls, and mozzarella cheese balls unfortunately taste old. When I inquired about the dish the waitress said Oh well I sold 1 for the first time today! So probably good... not very helpful. I went ahead and ordered fries (I've ordered theses before sitting at the bar) however when getting them this time they were disgusting. And looked as though they were left overs with a dash adobo on top. So I sent them back and ordered the Mac and cheese. It came out almost immediately. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food for the most part. The spinach and cheese empanadas were also pretty underwhelming. However the fried chicken & grilled salmon were hits!"
1/28/2020,3 star rating,"I thought it was a requirement to have health grade ratings on the door in NYC? There wasn't one here, even after walking around the entire building. Learned later that it was a C from reviewing Yelp, which honestly if I had known before, would've kept me away. Can't help but wonder about that. A bit scary and I hope this is addressed...food safety is no joke. On the bright side, excellent food! Went for brunch and all of us found it to be tasty, from the salmon croquettes to French toast. The chicken and waffle is their most known dish apparently. Chicken was flavorful and crispy-- fried well. The waffle was on the softer side and I couldn't really get the ""eggnog"" taste, but with that strawberry butter it was awesome!!! Wish I could put that strawberry butter on everything :)The mango juice not being fresh was my only dislike... but I guess I should've seen that coming. Still nice to have options, and could make for some good brunch cocktails. Service was pretty blah, but nothing egregiously bad, just not attentive. We had made a reservation for Sunday brunch, but it wasn't crowded shortly after opening. Black owned!!"
7/28/2016,5 star rating,"I absolutely loved my experience at Melba's. The vibe, the food, the service, everything was on point. My friend and I came on a Wednesday evening at around 7 and not too soon after the place had quickly filled up. It is a bit small but from what I witnessed, they do their best to accommodate groups. I would highly recommend making a reservation.My friend assured me that the food usually arrives in a timely manner, so I chose to skip the appetizer. For my entree I had the Country Catfish with potato salad and collard greens. Everything was so well seasoned. I can't even stress how delightful it was. I've had too many tasteless fried fish dishes in this city. Melba's will show you how it's done. The collard greens tasted like my grandma's (this is a good thing!), and the potato salad might've just been the best I've ever tasted. I also had the ""Rose In Harlem"" cocktail and it was the perfect complement. The service was great; our waiter was friendly, attentive, and available. I'm just mad I don't remember his name to give him the props that are due to him, especially since he prevented me from leaving without my credit card! The vibe is great, the music was the first thing I noticed when I walked in. My experience at Melba's was great from start to finish and I can't wait to go back soon!"

Always a good time when I come here."
9/10/2016,5 star rating,"I've tried this place before 2 years ago and I wasn't too happy with the food. But my friend suggested to come here last night and try it again. And since I work in the hospitality I wanted to see if things changed since then. And boy, I was so pleased we came. We arrived on a Friday night at about 10:35pm and was informed immediately that the kitchen was closing very soon. The place was extremely busy as well. So instead of waiting for a table because we were so hungry, we sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice. He introduced him self and made us some good drinks. My friend ordered cat fish sticks with collard greens and Mac and cheese. I ordered salmon collard greens and mashed potatoes. The price was good and oh my gosh, the food was amazing! It was a good portion and everything was perfect. We ended it with a birthday celebration of peach cobbler and ice cream. And if your looking for a nice place to take someone for a birthday dinner, this is the place.  They put a candle in the desert and everyone, even the customers start singing happy birthday. It was the best. I met the owner as well. She came in and was very welcoming."
9/29/2018,5 star rating,"I had such a great experience here! From being greeted and seated by Melba herself to the delicious food, everything was so great. I got the fried chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens. The chicken was cooked well but could have been a bit more flavorful and crispier. The collards and mac and cheese were delicious. My friends tried the oxtail and chicken and waffle, and they enjoyed their food as well. I also loved the atmosphere, very intimate and perfect for a date or dinner with close friends. Melba's is very busy on a Friday evening so definitely make reservations in advance; they were nice enough to hold our table for almost an hour because some of my friends were late. I'd definitely go back to try more of the food!"

After our experience, we bolted over to Melba's. We were late but they held our table thanks to Michelle. The food was off the chain! I ordered the Chicken&Waffles. My mouth is watering just writing this! Others in our party ordered the Shrimp, Caesar Salad, Short Ribs, Red Velvet Cake and the Peach Cobbler. EVERYONE thanked me for selecting this spot and are making plans to returnIt was a little tight but then again, we had more than what was expected in our party. The staff was friendly and VERY patient with us!"

Brunch is just as great. Drinks are tasty. The only thing I dislike is that they close in the middle of the day to prep for evening (I guess). All their dishes are on point.

11/10/2019,3 star rating,"So I went to Melba's on a Sat for a 6:00pm reservation. We were 15 min late but they seater us as soon as we walker in. The waiter was nice and attentive. So I ordered the fried chicken, with collard greens and mac and cheese. My friend ordered the same with potato salad and mac and cheese and we shared a egg nog waffle. So I expected more from the waffle. It was soft but it didn't have a egg nog taste to me personally, it was just regular. The fried chicken was regular also I honestly felt that it needed more season. The collard greens was seasoned really well and I recommend it, the potato salad was good also I  recommend it, the mac and cheese was good also I recommend it but I expected it to be top notch because soul food restaurants are known for their mac. The section we sat in was a little to tight in my opinion. I find most spots in NY are like this unfortunately. NY is crowded to they have to make the most of it. They have a right side as well which seems more spacious but a private even was taken place over there. I prob would come here for brunch just to see what it's like. I'm big on supporting black businesses so to my brothers and sisters stop by when you can."
4/6/2016,5 star rating,Nestled right in harlem is this beautiful small resturant. I have heard of melba's before but to finally eat there all i have to say is wow. I had the beef ribs with mac n cheese and it was delicious. The meat falls right off the rib bone and they must have made it especially for me because that is the way i love it. The prices were reasonable considering the type of reaturant i was in. I will be coming back to try many of the wonderful sounding things on the menu.

1/2/2017,4 star rating,"I came here after the Conan show in search of authentic soul food. There were places that I found on Yelp that looked more authentic, but didn't have as high of a rating as Melba's. So, we gave it a go. My boyfriend thought it was the best soul food he's ever had. I thought it was good too, but because I've had southern cuisine in NOLA, it's kind of hard to beat and my standard became a bit jaded. We got the fried chicken and waffle, and fried chicken with collard greens and mac n cheese. The fried chicken was nicely flavored and you can tell they took their time brining it. It was slightly overcooked, but nothing to make a fuss about. The star was the collards. It was perfectly cooked. I could've ate 2 bowls by myself. The service was also very friendly and made you feel at home. I'd recommend to anyone in the area to give it a go."

The food was melt in your mouth delicious. The portion size was perfect; not too big but perfectly satisfying where you're not leaving there uncomfortably stuffed. They were out of the Pinot Grigio unfortunately so I had the Chardonnay instead which was good, as well as their Melba's HIT - Harlem Iced Tea, which was their strongest drink on the menu.

4/19/2021,3 star rating,"Do Not Sit Outside! We had a reservation for dinner & when they went to sit us inside I asked if we could sit outside.  Someone came took our order, all normal.  After waiting a good hour for our food (while watching people inside who came after us get food), it came in a bag in takeout containers.  Clearly confused, we were then told that when you sit outside your food is given to-go and you can stay and eat if you want.  Had we known this we may have considered eating inside or going somewhere else.  When you're going out to dinner, you want to actually be out to dinner, not have to keep going inside to try to get things so you can eat (we had to ask for silverware, I had to wait inside to find someone to get a drink and pay).  I think the restaurant needs to make this clear (their website even says indoor/outdoor dining), and with Covid there should be an actual outdoor option.  Between that and the long wait for food the experience was just ok.  The food however was very good (chicken & waffles and crab cakes w/ greens & mac & cheese).  If you're going sit inside, if you're comfortable doing so."

Then I get home to eat my crab cake, which was small as hell, I could have brought them shoprite in philly. I only went here because a friend said Sylvia's food was not good any more after I order so I went here to support the business also being greedy.

The music selection r&b was perfect!! My husband Ordered the oxtails. He loved it. I had chicken and waffles.  I haven't hAd a waffle that good EVER!  The wait was short we were seated quickly. we were serviced quickly. The location is great right off of one of the subway stops... like 1 block up. The chicken was seasoned well .the greens were absolutely amazing. Yams were good. I ordered a Melbas Malibu drink that was so good it wasn't light on the alcohol either!! Cant wait to come back in town just for this place!! (Addition) when its your bday they do it big!  They turned off the music and had the whole restaurant singing stevie wonders version of happy birthday.
6/25/2018,5 star rating,This place has amazing southern food. The waiters are super nice. The place is a bit tight and it may take a while to get seated so I recommend making a reservation on the weekends. Some times they have live music :)
2/10/2020,4 star rating,The food is alright.  The fried calamari is very good.  They were nicely seasoned and flat out delicious.  Best calamari I've had since I've started eating it.  The Buffalo wings are great.
5/5/2018,5 star rating,I came here for a birthday brunch I seen they had great reviews I love to support black owned establishment I had... the service was super fast no wait we ordered our food no it came out within 5 minutes and Cooked well ... I got the sweet potato cheesecake and home fries which also had sweet potatoes they were delicious

4/7/2019,1 star rating,"Today was my third and last time here. I'll sum up all three visits. Customer service isn't their fortè. At all. I've had issues on all 3 occasions upon arrival with the host(ess). The last two times I visited (about 2 weeks ago, both within the same week or so) there was a light skinned man as the host. The 1st time, it was early and the place was half full and he seemed to have hesitation seating me as I told him a friend was on her way. When she arrived 15m later and told him a friend was here already he said ""oh she's been here a while."" Unnecessary. Server that day also said a similar comment to my friend when she came over to take her order. Why is everyone commenting on this? I said nothing to this staff about her running late. Again, unnecessary. The food was meh. The following Saturday I went back to give it another try. The same host said ""I usually don't seat 1's at a table."" Interesting that he forced me to sit at the bar when I didn't care to. Sitting at the bar for 10 min before I was even greeted by the older bar guy, I watched him make drinks. Sloppy drinks. (Speaking from a bartender's perspective) he didn't measure anything, he made drinks in wet glasses that he was rinsing...not washing off and his wine pour wasn't a pour, it was just him sloshing the wine in the glass letting it splash everywhere. By the time I finally got a mimosa, I watched him rinse another glass out and slosh the champagne and OJ in the glass. I looked at the glass when set in front of me, I can see lips around the rim. Chapstick perhaps. I left.Today my niece wanted pancakes so since it was nearby I said it's early enough, we shouldn't have a problem getting pancakes. Arrived at 11:15a and the hostess was on the phone for 6 minutes and when she got off, she was scrolling through an iPad for another 5 minutes. We still hadn't been greeted. A server who had come near us greeted us and told us she'd be with in a sec. when she finally gave us her attention, she STILL hadn't greeted us and just asked how many was in the party. We were seated and we gave our order within 5 min. 25 minutes later we had yet to get our beverages (coffee and OJ). The same bartender was there steadily and sloppily sloshing drinks together. We left. Customer service at this place sucks. This stems from management. So management sucks. The food isn't that great to begin with so with shitty customer service, you can best believe I'll never set foot in there again. Every experience I've had there has been trash. Good luck if you try it."
3/19/2018,3 star rating,The food is soooo delicious I had salmon Mac and cheese  spinach and yams The place is pretty loud.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the area I sat in was small and once the place became crowded people were surrounding our table we even had to cover our food a few times.  Our table was surrounded we became frustrated and asked the staff to move the standing crowd which they did try but people don't listen and the problem started back upWe sat in the table on the end close-by the kitchen.  I will definitely go back but I will never sit there againThe waitress was nice she said Sunday nights get pretty crowded and apologized - however it was still frustrating.

11/28/2017,2 star rating,"I ordered the Fried chicken and waffle.My wife ordered the fried catfish which I thought was quite delicious. Also there was a generous portion on her plate along with two large sides. I was extremely disappointed with my dinner. The chicken was tasty but there was hardly any meat on it. This scoop of butter on my waffle was taller than the piece of chicken. The chicken they serve me must've been very skinny. Approximate 3 to 4 ounces of meat.I did see some other chicken come out on other plates that look twice the size of the piece they serve me. This is why I'm not giving them a very good review. I had to go home after spending about $58 and heat up some leftover chicken I had from a couple days ago. My chicken plate was about $17. If you want fried chicken for dinner you would be better off going to Popeyes, Kennedy's fried chicken or other places if your hungry.I gave this restaurant two stars because my wife actually plate looked good and was plentiful it was tasty.This is the first time I had to do a bad review. I did not expect a bucket of chicken but I didn't expect to go home hungry. The other plates I saw looked a lot better. Don't order the chicken waffle."
8/30/2020,4 star rating,Food is always great. My only issue was the excess wait time for outside seating. Myself and many other who were before and after me had issues with the person assigning tables. He was not organized and did not seat people in the order they came. Several people complained as we were all waiting for more than an hour. With outside seating there should be a limit to how long you can occupy the table as other people are waiting for the outside seating.
7/2/2018,4 star rating,I've been here a couple of times and I really recommend Sunday brunch but only a few menu items. Fried catfish and grits is hands down the very best you will find in Harlem. It's the only thing I order when I go from now on. The shrimp is also very good. Their southern ice tea is on point.Definitely avoid the oxtails - subpar. Their chicken and waffles is very popular but I dont care for the eggnog flavor in the waffles and I love eggnog. The waffle texture in the center was gooey and undercooked to me. I did ask for a well done waffle to replace it which was a better texture.Its hella busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait.
11/9/2019,5 star rating,"Them oxtails were fire. I'm still thinking about the flavor and fall off the bone goodness. Every time I come to NY, I have to eat here for some down home southern cooking. Tonight they did not disappoint. I had the ox tails, Mac n cheese and yams and my husband had the catfish and waffle. The sangria, recommended by our amazing waiter was also delicious. I didn't have enough room for desert so maybe next time. Thanks Melba's. Now I can fly back home to LA feeling great :)."
7/13/2016,5 star rating,"Visiting from Los Angeles (Compton) and found this place on Yelp. The food was delicious. I had fried shrimp, mac n cheese and yams. Usually if the Mac n Cheese is good then everything else usually is too and it was cheesy and flavorful. My husband had the fried catfish and waffle and it was very good. Not everyone can make red velvet cake so let's just say I cleaned my plate, so rich and yummy and my husband cleaned his plate of the peach cobbler. This was my second trip to Harlem and I tried another soul food place my first trip that wasn't very good. But Melba's will definitely be my go to spot whenever I return. The service was also excellent, warm and friendly."
10/19/2017,1 star rating,"IMPORTANT. For All Event Planners out there, DO NOT use Melba's for an event.  You'll be VERY embarrassed. I still can't  believe that with a 100% pre-paid confirmed dinner for 43, my entire party was left standing outside on the sidewalk for Over 30 minutes!!!  I had even called and spoken to the manager on duty that evening, Velda, and asked her if I should call her from our coach when we were on the way.  She said, ""No."" Nothing about the event or evening was Professional.  They served approx. 12 people champagne outside, but that was it.  Everyone else was wondering where there's was.  Velda should NEVER have seated people KNOWING that we were coming.  When the people eventually got up, the room was cleaned in such haste, that a slimy piece of bacon was left on the floor.  Of course, that was the 1st thing that one of my corporate clients noticed.  I bent down in my dress and picked it up.The service was terrible.  They have a tacky card system where everyone has to write down their order and their name.   I was willing to live with it if it worked, but it didn't. Every other plate either had the wrong side dish or the wrong entree.  Another client, after waiting forever for his plate, said, ""At this point, I'll eat anything.""  Not everyone got dessert.The food is fine. THe staff was nice, but sooooo inefficient.  I waited a bit to post this to see if Melba (who was supposed to be there but wasn't) ever reached out to apologize.  She didn't.  ENOUGH SAID."
10/7/2018,4 star rating,Very good soul food! I usually go to Sylvia's. Glad my niece suggested something new. Nice quiet section of Harlem. Will return soon.
9/26/2020,5 star rating,Service was quick and friendly and food was delicious! Smothered and fried chicken were both tasty. Eggnog waffle with strawberry butter was delicious and truly tasted home made in the best way. Syrup was also delectable. Mac and cheese and yams were really flavorful and yummy. Drinks were not weak!
11/30/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant was very nice. Decor, setting, and music makes it a delightful brunch choice for small or big groups. The food is very well seasoned () and rightfully so as the restaurant is nestled in the heart of Harlem. I recommend it especially for couples who are looking for something quaint"
11/27/2019,2 star rating,"I came here multiple times with friends and sat at the bar to enjoy food and drinks. Food and drinks are excellent at those times. I love the fried catfish. My last experience, my friend and I sat at a table. It was a evening on a weekday and wasn't crowded at all. I ordered the crab cake as my appetizer and my friend skipped the appetizer and ordered the smothered chicken dish as her main. About 20 mins pasted and my friend received her chicken meal. I didn't get my appetizer yet. Almost 40 minutes later my friend finished her whole meal and I'm sitting there still waiting for a crab cake. I called the waitress to the table because she never checked on us not once and completely forgot about my appetizer, she did not apologize but came back 10 minutes later with a burnt crab cake. I was so turned off I didn't even want to order a meal after that. I did ask to speak to the manager about my experience and she took the crab cake off the bill which was good, so thumbs up for that but I didn't enjoy this night dining here, or should I say bearly dining because I bearly ate."
4/6/2019,5 star rating,"OMG that food at Melba's is Sooooooooo DELICIOUS I had to say my grace twice to thank the Lord for the hands that prepared it and the people that served it. First we ordered the Spring Rolls with all that southern goodness in them and then I ordered the Braised Short Ribs (meat falling of the bone y'all) with Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. Man both of the sides were so good I started wondering if one of my aunts from Louisiana was secretly working here. BUT HONEY THE SERVICE!!! Is AWESOME. Our waitress, OLAY, asked us whether we had been there before. Then welcomed us as first timers and told us what the restaurant was known for and made great recommendations based on her own favorites as well as the items the  restaurant is known for in the culinary community. OLAY, knows her stuff, and when she noticed we might be straining out necks looking up at her she squatted down to table-level and continued helping us order our yummy meals. Warning the drinks are DRANKS. I had to ask Olay to adjust my Chocolate Martini to the ""lightweight version"" and she made it happen with a smile. And it was divine with all that whipped cream on top. Our food appeared on our table pipping hot in less than 10 mins. They really have their system figured out because that food was definitely recently cooked. That food was so fresh I could see wisps of smoke rising off of it and it smelled so good. When I had my first bite of Mac & cheese, I had to pause and say the second grace because everything about that Mac & cheese was good (texture, color, just salty and cheesy enough). The 3 cheeses used worked harmoniously together as one. OMG, If I write about the tastebud poppin' deliciousness that is those short ribs we are gone be here all day. Those ribs were GOODT (said in my southern Baptist preacher voice). Man and those Yukon gold mashed potatoes were fluffy, a little buttery, and all types of delicious especially with the sauce running off of the ribs pooling into to areas of mashed potato. They have large portions too.Also, if you want a soulful happy birthday song sang to you by some of the warmest individuals, come here on your birthday. I saw them sing this guy a lively, black church choir, Stevie wonder rendition of the happy birthday song complete with soul clap. Just in case you can't tell already. I LUV MELBA's!! The food, SERVICE (Olay is a gem), and drinks are top notch. I already have a list of different people I plan on going back with on separate occasions so I can work my way through the whole menu. I want to taste it all."
4/6/2018,5 star rating,"I came to Melba's with friends for dessert after the worst service and average meal at Row House. In the little time that we were there, we got a warm and authentic greeting at the door, accommodated with a smile when we asked to change our seating and the most divine chocolate cake and peach cobbler taste buds can handle. Melba's is consistent that way!"
7/7/2018,5 star rating,"The food and service was impeccable! The staff was warm & friendly & the manager Jeremy was a god send! It is without a doubt, no secret as to how Melba Beat Bobby Flay in a throwdown. The decor was beautifully decorated with creative & original African American art. While I normally don't try chicken & waffles, I had to try this star dish! Before trying the chicken & waffles we began the meal with calamari. The calamari was fresh, crisp, and perfectly seasoned! The entree I tried was the delicious chicken & waffles.  The waffles were not just ordinary waffles, but they were eggnog waffles served with a strawberry butter. Who says eggnog is only for Christmas? If that's the case, everyday is Christmas at Melba's and what better way to spread cheer than with great home cooked authentic food! I had white meat served with my waffles.  While some people complain about white meat being dry, this whole breast & wing was both tender & juicy! To top the meal off,  I tried the greens & mac & cheese. The greens were rich and perfectly seasoned, tasted just like my mama's home cooking.... after eating here Oh how I miss my mama :( . I am very critical of mac & cheese as that is one of my signature dishes I am known for. The mac & cheese was heavenly. The cheese was rich and perfectly blended with the macaroni. While I was stuffed... a great meal is enhanced with delectable dessert. I must admit my eyes are at times bigger than my stomache.As Jeremy came to check on us & make recommendations regarding dessert... I asked about the cobbler & explained my eyes may be too big for my stomach.  Jeremy asked if he could give me a sample of the cobbler so next time I visit.. I will know how great it is. Jeremy was indeed truthful. This cobbler was down home, rich, buttery, slap your mama in the face type of good! Melba's made me a believer in authentic & original soul food. Melba's must be a stop when you are in Harlem. One thing is certain, two things are for sure... great food is at this place & I will return!"
12/22/2019,5 star rating,WINNER! Enjoyed our meal. Service was excellent. Used Yelp to make reservations. See pictures of our selections. This text is here to make the post longer as it is shorter than most.
7/31/2018,3 star rating,"The macaroni and cheese was the best part!  Their signature chicken and waffles left a lot to be desired in my opinion.  If you are a chicken and waffles spot I expect that to be the best part. It wasn't memorable. The strawberry butter spread left a better impression than the otherwise bland waffle and moderately juice but slightly less than flavorful chicken.  It wasn't bad at all but just wasn't near levels I was expecting.  As drinks go, I got the Malibu Melba as it reminded me of my younger days when Alizé was popular.  I literally ordered it for the nostalgia. I'd come back here to run through the cocktail list and reminisce some more.  And I'd also be willing to try more menu options, but I wouldn't get my hopes up in advance like this last time.  The atmosphere and the music is good so definitely come with friends and family to enjoy.  I also came just after the doors opened as I was in Harlem with visiting family who had this place marked on their to-do list. Maybe the food gets better later into the evening?"
9/18/2019,5 star rating,This was my first meal in NYC from Seattle. Everything my group ordered was so good & the portions were perfect. I ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese. This place is definitely a repeater.

10/7/2018,4 star rating,"So let me start off by saying the food is  definitely good and the drinks are strong. Now let's get into the cons. I called the day of at 11am to make reservations for 6pm. I arrived at 615pm I gave my name and the hostess said there was no reservations. Totally pissed me off I was told The wait would be 45 mins.smhSince I drove from Queens I was not leaving, me and my guest waited outside. Melba's is not a big location so the entrance is really tight they have a makeshift plastic entrance plastic where you can stand but it can get very tight there as well. They should have the hostess posted up there so they can keep track of the guest.  The hostess being inside and the guest outside can not hear when there names are being called . There is no speaker outside. So after waiting and waiting we finally see someone who came after us go straight in and sit down which pissed me off. Which means we may have been called but didn't hear it because the hostess is inside and there's no place to stand inside and wait.  So me and my guest advised  the hostess that we have been standing there for quite a while how did those  guest get seated first. He apologized and took care of us, but had I not noticed they sat down first we would have still been standing outside. Besides that the waiter was cool the food was very good especially the Mac and cheese and the mini burgers.  I would go there again I just think they need a better seating arrangement and keeping track of there guest."
11/5/2019,5 star rating,"I had fried chicken with collards and yams. Very delicious, the breading on the chicken was just right, great texture and flavor. I also enjoyed the collards and candied yams. The price seemed fair for a piled high plate, and the service was excellent. The ambiance of the restaurant was celebratory and they were playing all the classics (90s + 00s). The music was loud, but I thought it was a nice vibe. I only wish I had been hungry enough to eat more, or had the chance to go with a group so I could try more things."
8/31/2017,2 star rating,"First time visiting the famous Ms. Melba's. Total let down. Arrived around 6pm on a weeknight and easily found two seats at the small bar. My gf was so excited for me to try one of Moses' masterpieces however he wasn't tending bar that evening. There were two older gents manning the bar, one named Champ. Champ made our initial drinks, BP Punch. Watered down kool-aid with no liquor. We watched this man tremble as the alcohol poured from the bottles into our glasses.  He literally jumped back each time the alcohol dropped out of the bottles as of he would get burned. Insane. The most bizarre experience. Not sure who he is in association to the owner but she should consider giving this gent something less strenuous to do. He should not be handling drinks. The backup tender made my second drink and thought a bit better, it was still bad. We ordered a number of apps:Wings - healthy portion. Rank. Meat tasted as if it wasn't cleaned prior to cooking Calamari - really good. Crispy and well made Egg rolls - also good. The filling contains collards and is well executed Sliders - I did not try these. Serving comes 2 in an order and topped with cheese I'm embarrassed for this venue as I've heard so many good things about them.Sorry, Ms. Melba.  This is no neighborhood gem."
8/9/2018,3 star rating,I went to Melba's for a work event. I wasn't able to order anything from the menu but they gave us shareable plates of some of the popular dishes. I was able to try the Mac and cheese which was favorable but a bit too cheesy or me. I tried the fried car fish and I was sadly disappointed. It did not taste good AT ALL. The fried chicken was good and so was the collard greens. The ribs were hard and from the appearance it looked like oxtails the meat wasn't tender AT ALL. The lemonade was AMAZING!!!! Now down to dessert... I tried the sweet potato pie which was cold smh another disappointment who wants to eat cold sweet potato pie ?? Not me ... the peach cobbler was also cold and too sweet. I doubt I will be back
10/24/2019,4 star rating,"If you're ever in Harlem, Melba's is the place to go. The Mac n cheese was absolutely so DELICIOUS. I enjoyed how we were able to get two different sides with our meals. We did go late at night and I didn't like how dark it was because I like to see when I'm eating. But overall the food is great"
2/2/2019,2 star rating,"I have been to Melba's several times. The mac and cheese is the best in Harlem.  But my last visit on December 23, 2018 was disappointing.  I was having drinks at the bar with a friend. Melba herself was there and extended happy hour pricing to us. She even threw in a free round on the house. When the bill came my friend paid $60 of the bill which was 67.47. I paid the balance + 10 additional. We even took pictures with Melba. Good times...until i looked at my statement 2 days later. I was charged 77.47 instead of 17.47. The bartender kept the cash and charged my card. Calls to the restaurant and im given the run around.  I was offered a gift card and told they would call me back. No calls have been returned. I called back this week and was put on hold and then hung up on. I am disappointed because i was basically robbed and i cant get assistance.  My advice when dining here; use cash if possible. I will continue calling until this is rectified."
9/6/2020,5 star rating,This is my happy place. Great service and scrumptious food. My favorite is the catfish n waffles with the strawberry butter. Might just get some today.
8/29/2017,4 star rating,"Went to Melbas to catch up with an Old Friend. Usually my default for soul food in Harlem is Amy Ruth's but decided to switch it up. The wait was pretty long don't underestimate it ! The ambience was great live music was a very nice touch. Now for the food. I got a wing platter with two sides. The chicken was on par but it definitely wasn't the best I've had. I prefer Amy Ruth's in that regard. I also have high standards for chicken...The mac was flavorful and very cheesey nothing super special.But the GREENS !!! PHENOMENAL. These are your grandmothers greens, like they took me back. I would come here just for the greens. Overall the meal was good and the portions were great !"
8/25/2018,4 star rating,"You can tell this place is a staple in the neighbourhood, good music, welcoming attitude and overall great ambience. We were seated as soon as we walked in, granted it you a while for someone to come over and ask us what we would like the wait was worth it though.

7/22/2017,1 star rating,"Melba's used to be my favorite dinner and brunch spot in Harlem! Their prices were perfect, the food was deliciously seasoned and portions were big.  The wait staff has always been less than stellar but due to the portion size and how delicious the food was I gave them a pass. I can say that no longer. It started with the price increase, which is understandable considering the rent in Harlem is only going up so you give them a pass for this. Then the food began to taste more bland with every visit. This makes it hard to over look waiting sometimes up to 35 minutes for dinner, forgotten drink orders after already waiting 30 minutes to be seated. There seems to be a revolving door with the wait staff (no one stays more than 3-6 months) and the regulars that are there are clearly unhappy. During a very strong heat wave (92 degree days) you would think Melba's would provide AC for the customers and especially the workers but that isn't the case. Which results in slower unpleasant staff.My boyfriend and I will not be returning with the price increase and diminished quality of food."

9/1/2017,2 star rating,"Another soul food restaurant, another let down. I know Melba's is famous but the quality sure doesn't scream it. We went in earlier today about 5pm and were seated near the entrance. First thing I noticed -- no joke it smelled like a bathroom. It was a really overwhelming unpleasant bathroom smell that filled half the restaurant. We asked to be moved to the opposite room, no problem. We had a cool female waitress but the man that came to bring the food out looked like he hated his job or something. Soon as the food hit the table a bunch of flies came around. We ordered three plates of:Eggnog wafflesTilapia with mango sauceWine braised RibsCollard greensMac and cheeseIn addition to:Ginger ale2 Malibu Melba's (alcoholic beverage)The food was good, zero complaints on taste (tender meat, good seasoning, side orders were good) but the flies swarming around our table really ruined it. We had to watch our plates carefully while swatting them, and so we asked another waiter for a food cover so we could eat with some peace of mind. He was nice enough to retrieve it for us. The Malibu Melba's were pretty good, nice balance of fruit flavor and alcohol. I decided to get a Malibu after rejecting the Sexy Sangria which tasted like garbage, too much alcohol.Question, what type of soul food restaurant serves no cornbread? I didn't see that anywhere on the menu.The total bill came up to a whopping $95 (including 10% tip which is bare minimum and you're forced to tip). Ripoff in my opinion considering the bathroom odor, the flies landing on you while trying to eat, it's not fancy, the food being good but not magnificent to warrant that price. Another thing, although the waitress we had was nice, we had to keep flagging her down, and it was a turnoff when she was hovering over the table staring hawk eyed telling us how much we could tip, whether 10%, 15%, etc. You should let the customer decide. This place is ok but it didn't strike me as somewhere I need to return.In other words, overrated."
7/4/2018,4 star rating,"I went here with family on June 28,2018. Interior: The place is spacious it looks like it was once two separate store fronts that were combined to make this restaurant. I would say that it is very cramped when you come in the front door and are waiting there for a table. Other than that, there is adequate space between most tables. There is a large bar as soon as you walk in. The kitchen is to the back of the venue on the right most side . The bathrooms are in that area too. My suggestion for the bathrooms would be think about reconfiguring the way the doors open. I ended up ""trapping "" a person who was exiting the back bathroom when I was exiting the bathroom before it. Also there is no way to know someone is stuck until someone in line tells you so or you exit and they mention it to you! Yikes!!!Food: The food is typical Southern cuisine. I got the oxtails because since this is not Caribbean food I figured the oxtails would be savory and not sweet (no molasses or browning sauce).  I didn't want the sides, I wanted a salad instead, but since it confused the server I ordered sides for the table and an entree salad. This was really annoying because I just couldn't understand why this was such a hard concept to wrap his head around. Some people don't want the sides and a salad should be an option. Even an up charge for the salad would be reasonable... despite the fact that it's one thing versus the two you get with your meal-I could gripe about this for another ten sentences so let me move on. (Insert Eye roll emoji) Others at the table got the waffles and chicken which was said to be good. The braised short ribs which had to be good because the plate was almost licked clean. The burger which was a burger nothing amazing there. The Cesar salad was okay but the complaint was that the dressing made it too soggy. I think that's just a matter of preference and it shouldn't deter anyone from trying it. The buffalo wings seem to be spicy even when you request mild. The lemon chicken strips looked really good and were reported to be flavorful. Everyone that had the lemonade said it was really good. Service: I really was happy with the service I got when I made the reservation as well as the person who seated us. Our server, Luis, was not great. As I mentioned above he was not great about the salad side swap situation and he just was very slow in serving our table. It took too long to get the bill and even longer for him to bring back our cards (only two cards anything more than that is just asking for trouble). The restaurant added gratuity to the bill. I didn't see it mentioned anywhere so I am assuming it was based on the number of people in our party. I always tip at least 20% but based on the service or should I say inattentiveness he only got what was included in the bill. The service is really what took the rating down to four stars. This is the ""new Harlem"" there are restaurants a dime a dozen serving soul food- they really need to work on their customer service to keep the clientele coming back here/ recommending this place to others versus going to other soul food places in the area  that are all hype and touristy."
10/8/2019,5 star rating,I love this place the food was delicious and the atmosphere was so refreshing.  We had a family birthday dinner for my daughter.  The wait staff were also very friendly.
8/11/2018,5 star rating,Melba's a family own & operated soul comfort food restaurant. Love the food love Melba's waffle & chicken but this restaurant is so much more. With its full bar & to large dining areas you may have to wait a few for your table (so call & reserve space is recommended) but it will always be worth the wait !!
6/18/2018,4 star rating,"I am visiting Teachers College at Columbia University again decided to stay over in Harlem this time. Today was super hot so I was looking for a place that I could order from. To my surprise Melba's was literally at the end of my block. I placed the order with ease, was given a time, pause with PayPal (although you could do a card or Yelp Pay) and the food was ready and waiting on a shelf right inside the door when I arrived. I didn't need to wait or ask for assistance. I ordered that oxtail which came with two sides. The food was delicious traditional comfort food. The flavor was spot on. The main dish and sides were packaged separately, which was cool. It looked like it had a nice bar inside but I didn't have to walk very far to get my food so I didn't really check out the place."
8/25/2016,5 star rating,"Being a Southerner, I'm always a bit wary of trying soul food north of the Mason-Dixon or west of Texas. After all, there's just something about Grandma's home-cooking in Alabama. HOWEVER, Melba's made a lifelong fangirl out of me. My friends treated me to a birthday dinner there and it was divine! I needed a lighter meal, so I had the salmon with sautéed spinach and candied yams. The salmon was among the best seasoned cut of that fish I've ever had. The spinach was perfectly sautéed with garlic. The yams tasted like all that makes Thanksgiving beautiful. Add to that Melba's iced tea (read: liquor with more liquor with a splash of lemon and topped with liquor) and the smooth ambiance, and the entire meal was just perfect. I'm a fan now and I'll definitely be back!"
5/5/2019,4 star rating,"The food was good! We got the chicken and waffl. Really Nice waffle and the chicken was delicious! Our waitress, Alisha (sorry if the spelling is wrong) was one of the best we encountered. She was on top of it and was beyond nice with us! However the waiting was a bit hectic. Definitely book before going"
8/15/2016,4 star rating,"I tried Melba's for dinner on Saturday after my friend (who lives in Harlem and is from the south) recommended it to me. So glad I came in-- We had such a great meal. The service was great-- friendly and attentive. We started with the spring rolls -- I have never had a spring roll like this before- it comes with rice, black eyed peas, collard greens and cheddar cheese- but it was so tasty. For the entrees, I got the catfish with mac & cheese and collard greens on the side. The catfish was great and I enjoyed my sides equally as much. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles-- He said he couldn't really taste the eggnog in the waffle, but enjoyed it.Overall, this was a good meal and I would definitely recommend if you are in the area."
8/28/2018,4 star rating,Delicious food even if the drinks aren't up to par. The servers are very welcoming and the wait to be served is almost non-existent.
8/26/2015,4 star rating,"This was my first time dining at Melba's and my cocktails and dinner that evening were amazing. We missed our initial reservation by 5 minutes searching for a park and unfortunately had to wait another hour and a half before we were seated as the restaurant is very small but delivers with their food.Catfish strips and chicken and waffles were seasoned to perfection. I was thoroughly surprised with their potato salad which was VERY good and you know how you compare everyone's potato salad to your Aunties..? Well, they delivered."
8/17/2019,3 star rating,I would give this place 3 1/2 stars. I had the catfish and grits. I came around 12 on a Saturday so it wasn't crowded. The cheese grits went well with the fish. But I felt the fish should have been deep fried more. It seemed more like a filet than a fried fish. Also they gave me only a smidge of grits.
2/8/2019,1 star rating,"Tried to charge our group for people that didn't show and generally brought very basic food (waffles, mac and cheese, fried chicken and short ribs ) to a bday party that was supposed to be special. Very very disappointing - don't book it for a group / special dinner. Do not recommend"
5/16/2019,5 star rating,Melba Melba Melba...  child that food!!!!! i have never taken food from out of town back home.... I took my leftovers back to the hotel and put them in the fridge for 2 days packed them in my luggage and brought it right back home to the chi.... (last night dinner)... great drinks and food
10/19/2019,3 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch. It was very busy and crowded but we got a table under 15 minutes. Our server seemed friendly, however her customer service wasn't good. My boyfriend got his food first instead of us having our food bought out at the same time. She forgot his plain grits, 10 minutes later she came back with cheese grits and bought out my incorrect order. I asked for chicken wings and waffles and she gave me the breast piece. I told her I ordered wings and she told me I would have to wait 15 minutes for it. I told her she should've informed me of that first instead of giving me whatever chicken was available. She said she understands she just didn't want me to wait any longer for my food. The food was delicious. I would go back again because the food was so good, hopefully I'll get a better server next time."
10/19/2019,5 star rating,"100-plus blocks of travel is well worth the trip to this Southern comfort food stand-out. You like chicken and waffles? No place does them better.  You like shrimp and grits? Get ready to love, love, love them. And the background music was perfect. Suffice it to say that Melba's is wonderful, and if you are fortunate enough to have Olleigh greet you with a smile and guide you through the various phenomenal menu options, your experience will be all the better."
10/18/2019,5 star rating,"As soon as I entered I was  greeted by the manager, waited less than two minutes to be seated. Once seated water was brought over and waiter came to check in. He was very knowledgeable on the menu. Ordered the cat fish strips as an appetizer and ordered the Darn Good Burger which couldn't be any better, had this sweet BBQ sauce that completed the circle of what a burger should taste like. Will definitely go back!"
11/13/2017,5 star rating,Melba's is a cute intimate place in Harlem. We had reservations for 2 and was seated right away.  I tried the fried catfish and waffle with home fries for Brunch this past Saturday and it was everything and more. Omg the catfish! It was the best I've tasted. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The waffle was good as well with the strawberry spread. I enjoyed the home fries too. It had some sweet potatoes with the regular potatoes. Anywho if I ever come back to NY I definitely will be ordering the catfish again.
6/29/2018,5 star rating,"I've come here quite a few times bit time one is the most memorable because I had my 11 month old baby and the staff was BEYOND accommodating!  They were conscientious to seat us in a ""baby friendly"" table and then also brought over a handful of fries for her.  Something soo simple went such a long way.  It doesn't hurt that the food, drinks and atmosphere here are all on point!  Kudos to the staff here!"
9/8/2019,3 star rating,"Came here for a wedding dinner. The food was good. Mac and cheese, fried chicken and collard greens remind me of Glorys spice up wth some seasoning. It located in good area and we didnt wait long for food to come serve about 40 of us in the area."
9/6/2019,4 star rating,We came in about 30 min before close after a long day of traveling. The Mac and cheese hit the spot. Chicken and waffles were tasty. Everything was great. Service was quick.
11/28/2015,5 star rating,"This is my second time here... And I still love it. Service was amazing. The good was great and my party felt at home. There was a birthday in the house, so the waiter asked everyone to sing ""Happy Birthday"" by Stevie wonder. Everyone was clapping and singing.... And it was great.I had the chicken and egg nog waffles, very delicious. The service was great. We were checked on multiple times.  It's a small space, so be sure to make reservations."
10/11/2019,5 star rating,"Great music (my opinion, of coure) and most importantly, great home cooking. The plates are large and the service was very good. I finished my meal with sweet potato pie... that was amazing."
3/23/2019,5 star rating,Went for a family dinner to celebrate my stepmoms birthday. Great food. Great music. Great service. Portion sizes were awesome. One of my favorite soul food spots in the city. Can't wait to go back!
4/15/2018,3 star rating,"It's been a hot minute since I've been here, but I came back with friends for brunch. It was not as good as I had remembered. I had the fried chicken breast with eggnog waffles and a side of eggs with a Mellini (basically a Melba's bellini), which tasted ok, but......our service was incredibly slow. We had to remind the staff person at least 2-3x about water, milk for our coffee, napkins, silverware, drinks......things were not running smoothly that Sunday. Nobody ordered a menu item but it ended up on our receipt. In any case, since there are so many other good spots in Harlem, I would check those out first before coming back here."
2/2/2014,4 star rating,"An intimate restaurant with great food=Melba's.  I came here last night for a friend's birthday celebration so it was my first time here.  I had previously read reviews about the catfish so I zero'ed in on the fried catfish.  True to form, it was flaky, soft, and absolutely deliciously fried.  The dish came with 2 sides, so I chose collard greens and chili onion rings.  My bf got the catfish and waffles, so I got to try some of his eggnog waffles, which were absolutely amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the chili onion rings......literally, I was eating raw onions underneath the fried shell.....nope, did not like that at all. And I was puzzled about what part of this was exactly ""chili"" --- so next time, I will refrain from ordering that side.We were eating dinner on a Saturday night at around 5:30pm, so quite early but it was packed very quickly.  A wonderful meal and I will definitely come back!"
7/29/2019,4 star rating,Melba's was amazing. The food and service were spectacular. Definitely a great addition to the community. My favorites were the mango mimosa and the egg nog waffle.
6/30/2018,4 star rating,"The food here is always tasty. Catfish is on point and eggnog waffle is really good. This time I got the crab cake appetizers, oxtail dinner with candid yams and mac n cheese. Crab cakes were good, crispy outside but tender and flavorful inside. The oxtail was super good, falling off the bone tender and bursting with flavor but a tad bit too salty. The Mac n cheese was good but a little lack luster. I've definitely had better. The yams were mouthwatering delicious! By far my favorite part of the meal. On the negative, there is always a super long wait. We waited almost an hour to be seated. On a busy Friday night, it seemed like they only had 2 waitresses working the whole place. Needless to say, service was poor."
4/9/2017,3 star rating,"Met here with a few co-workers for some awesome dining and drinks. One of the ladies had dined here before and was raving about it so I was looking forward to feelin the fuss, ya dig? Now, I'm a southern born and raised black woman with a granddaddy who smoked a pipe while makin shine in the garage. Ya heard? I grew up on soul food and, perhaps, therein lies the issue. I was expecting to be blown away and, unfortunately, this fell a bit flat. With the greens and peas egg roll (DELICIOUS) leading the experience, I was convinced this was going to make me slap somebody's aunt sass but, alas, it was the stand out for the night. My smothered chicken was bland, rice & peas dry and the greens tasted canned. I did try another person's Mac-n-cheese and yams and while the yams were tastums the Mac-n-cheese didn't stand up to it. For those prices, I doubt I'd make a second trip but if I do, it will be for apps (more egg rolls please!) and drinks only. That Harlem Tea...I've had raunchy dreams about it. Shout out to the bartender (who was a gorgeous chic who happened to remind me of the guy who stars in Mr. Robot...only, obviously, a girl) on that one. That drink was everything. I'm going to write it a love letter right now."
6/10/2019,5 star rating,"Decided to check place out because it's black owned and the reviews were great. Our party of 3 ordered catfish, Mac n cheese, yams, fried shrimp, and onion rings. Everything was good except for the onion rings but I'm not trippin. The catfish was so good. Perfectly fried and seasoned, not too fishy. Mac n cheese was amazing! Not too cheesy and the perfect texture. Potatoe salad - bomb af. The yams were mouth watering. Really wanted to try the peach cobbler but they were out. Would highly recommend this place and can't wait to come again."
8/5/2020,5 star rating,"Absolutely love Melba's. The food was amazing. I had fried chicken wings, baked Mac & cheese and potato salad. Enjoyed every bite and the staff was also great."
11/26/2017,2 star rating,Nothing special. Chicken wings were good. Waffles were dry. My wife burger was over cooked and dry even though she requested it medium. Went to bluejeens yesterday and maybe they placed the bar to high.
6/28/2020,5 star rating,"This place is genuinely amazing !!! The food is out of this world. We love soul food and melba is our spot for it , we come all the way from New Jersey and we do t mind traveling to go and eat there. Chicken and waffles are to die for. The ribs, Mac and cheese , fish , basically everything is so awesome. Can't wait to go back there when corona virus is over , but we'll be making some to go  orders soon."
11/22/2017,4 star rating,"The greens, sweet potatoes and ox tails are on point. An unusual but surprisingly good dish are the Melba's spring rolls."
9/14/2018,5 star rating,"Ooooooh chile!!!! Let me tell you about MELBA'S. Heaven on a plate that's what it is. All joke aside... Melba's is an awesome brunch spot! If you're looking for quality soul food, look no more. The smothered chicken and waffles is my personal favorite. The fried chicken and waffles is also amazing. The next time I go I think I'll try the French toast. My friend had it and said it was fantastic. The food is tasty, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere screams elegance and black excellence. Sunday brunch gets really crowded so make sure you get there early. It can also be a little loud during peak brunch times so keep that in mind as well. The prices are fair but this place is not cheap!! However, the food is worth every single penny. After brunch at Melba's I find myself stuffed and unable to eat for the rest of the day!!! Keep blessing our stomachs!!!"
3/8/2015,4 star rating,"So I revisited Melba's back in January on a Sunday for their Gospel Brunch in the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Building. The food was amazing. The service was ok. However we never did get the live gospel performance. We were constantly told it was on the way and that's the reason for the minus 1 star.They have two seatings for the gospel brunch so call ahead of time to place a reservation. I think it was either $20 or $25 for all you can eat! And please believe I ate all I can lol. They truly redeemed their self from my first experience, will be back again."
10/29/2014,2 star rating,"I wrote this review while still sitting in the restaurant(last night), and I'm just getting the chance to post it.  The only reason they received TWO STARS is because of the buffalo wings and their southern twist on spring rolls from the ""comfortizer"" (their appetizer) section of the menu, was really good! After I give you the laundry list you will understand why.So here we go:1. They messed up the orders. My suggestion is when taking orders (especially of a big party) take the orders according to the seat of the patrons.2. Ok so when they bring the orders out (3 of us order the same main dish but with different sides). They give one person the wrong order so they have to take it back and all of us who ordered the salmon now have to wait an additional 30min. But huh? You mean to tell me the person who got the wrong food keep the plate and you just bring them out their correct sides. And why exactly are we waiting 30min for food that should of been done. Moving on...3. My salmon finally arrives and I put a piece in my mouth and go this texture is off. Use the light on my phone to open up the filet and see that it is raw on the inside. Now if I wanted a salmon roll I would of went to the sushi spot across the street. The asst manager sees me looking at my food and comes over and ask what's wrong. I tell him and he says he can have  it cook longer and explains they make the salmon medium rare, and I say that should be said upon ordering or even asked how would you like it cooked. (I've personally never heard of fish being cooked this way). The asst manager then gets snappy and catches an attitude. So normally I would of gone off but I don't do so when it comes to my food. I look at my food, look at him, look at my cousin, then back at him. At that point my cousin jumps in before I may go off the edge. 4. The cook ""fixes"" my salmon but it still comes out rare. So now the asst manager sees my annoyance, and I simply say thank you but no thanks I no longer want it because it is still not well done(and i don't want to send it back again). He insists that I order a drink and a meal to go on the house. But at this point I say it's fine I really don't want anything, because partly I'm over the whole ordeal. He says he won't leave the table until I tell him what I want, and I believe him. So I order turkey meatloaf with mac n cheese and collard greens with a glass of Merlot as I wait.5. Keep in mind the third order of salmon still hasn't arrived. Not to mention I have sent my food back twice, 2 members of our party who had arrived late and ordered 30min after everyone food is now on the table and that third order of salmon isn't at the table. My cousin tells asst manager since it is taking so long I also hope it is well done when it arrives (of course it wasn't).6. I get my order to go. But we are here for a birthday dinner so since we are waiting for them to bring the cake out, I dig in. The meatloaf is cold (which was hard to believe since asst manager told me everything is cooked to order), the mac and cheese was just ok, and the collard greens were too hard.Am I saying I will never return? No! I will return because I want to give Melba's the chance to earn that 5-star rating I see in other reviews and based off my family enjoying their meals. However I will not be back with a big party and I will try to keep it to a weekday because for a Tuesday night it was really packed so I can only imagine the weekends. To end on a high note. The decor and ambiance was perfect. Will visit again and update the review."
3/1/2018,3 star rating,"I ate at Melba's for my chapter's anniversary brunch/lunch. The waitresses were not on point. But they were nice and apologetic. The family dinner style dining we requested came out extremely late. It was all suppose to come out altogether or at least closely together. The food was good. The chicken was good but overseasoned. The drinks were watered down. There lemonade was good. All in all the service and dining experience was not worth the price. The only thing I can say I really enjoyed was the red velvet cake they served. The cake was too good! So I do recommend EVERYONE go get that. As for dining, depends on your curiosity."

7/28/2019,5 star rating,"This place is a gem.  We stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  We were immediately seated and welcomed by our waitress.  I ordered the eggnog waffle and catfish.  My goodness!  That was the best catfish I've ever had.  Hot, lightly battered and meaty!  I'll absolutely stop in next time I travel to NYC."
3/10/2019,4 star rating,"I went for Sunday Brunch and had the best time. I ordered the chicken and waffles, unlimited sangria and rum punch. The food was really good and the drinks was strong.

5/10/2017,4 star rating,"First Melba's visit for the year and tried something new. The Spring Rolls!!! Why haven't I had these all along??!!! Never would have thought to try black eyed peas, greens, and cheese wrapped in rolls. It was deliciously paired with a duck-like sauce. I've been frequenting Melba's for years and have not been disappointed yet. Simple decor. Great atmosphere. The staff and patron are always so friendly. Just wish they served cornbread."
6/5/2016,5 star rating,"Melba's my go to restaurant for Southern Comfort. I'd literally leave my house in Brooklyn and travel by train on a Sunday night just to satisfy my palette. Melba does it for me! I usual order the chicken and waffles, burger, fries, and grits. I'm not a burger and fries girl but the burger is so juicy and seasoned to perfection. The fries! Yes! I haven't been disappointed yet. The staff at Melba's are so pleasant and accommodating. I feel comfortable dining here. The patrons appear more authentic and do not shy away from a conversation. I witnessed a diner once pay for a family's entire meal because it was the mother's birthday. And oh! If it's your birthday, you are serenaded to Stevie's version of the HB song. I love this establishment. Disclaimer: I've never been here during brunch hours so I'm usually seated almost right away for dinner."
2/18/2017,2 star rating,"UPDATE:I don't know what happened. Overall, the food was extremely bland and did not have that homemade flavor as in the past. The spinach and candied yams tasted as if they came straight from a can. The catfish strips were so salty I couldn't finish them. Even the mac and cheese missed the mark. Where was the cheese?  No one in my party finished their food.My friend ate the catfish strips and immediately started to have an allergic reaction. She's only allergic to tilapia so I don't know how this happened. Luckily another person in our party carries Benadryl with them!Thoroughly disappointed with Melba's. My appetite was not satisfied. They'll be on the back burner for a minute."
12/8/2013,5 star rating,"Excellent food! Party of 3 for dinner, some pros and not so pros. They're not cons b/c they're not that serious.Friday night, no reservation, restaurant was in full swing but we were seated very quickly. Food was DELICIOUS! Caesar salad, catfish, chicken cooked all the way through (yay!), waffles, candied yams to die for, and sauteed spinach like I've never had!Food took forever to come, and I mean FOREVER. There must have been some mix up in the kitchen with our order b/c people seated after us received their food before us. But our server was diligent with checking on in us and offered us complimentry dessert. BINGO! That right there bumps them from 4 stars to 5! Great service!Great music and ambiance, but too darn dark! I wasn't embarassed to use the light on my cel phone to see the menu when I noticed other patrons doing the same. Screw ambiance, I need to be able to see what I'm ordering. They can turn the lights up a tad.Place is small. Nothing they can do about that and it doesn't deter from the great food.Overall, great food and service. I will definitely be a repeat offender here!"

8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Aw man, this place is da bomb! I'm going to start with the service. Way above average and made sure we were taken care of, even when passed off to another staff everything stayed smooth. The music playing was good. The live music even better. AND THE FOOD, the food y'all was so good, my left eye teared up. I kid you not. Highly recommend."
8/17/2018,2 star rating,"Very disappointing experience. It seems service and food has deteriorated.... what's going on here? I was just here in March and the food was pretty good, today the food was mediocre. Made reservations to celebrate a friends birthday and I ordered the sea bass which is a dish on the menu however I was brought red snapper. I informed my waiter that I ordered the sea bass and he says ""oh we don't sell it anymore, try the red snapper it's amazing."" How do you not tell me that when I order? All of our dishes were served luke warm, nothing was hot. The rice wasn't seasoned and the macaroni and cheese was okay. My red snapper was okay, it was really a mediocre experience and I can't stress how disappointed I am. There was an awful smell when we first walked in, don't know where it came from but it wasn't pleasant especially in a restaurant. To make matters worse I was seated close to the bathroom so when the door was opened I smelled all the urine that was probably on the floor.  also there are stains on the cloth covering the benches near the wall, I mean deep down dirty stains. The other thing that was disappointing was our waiter, or maybe the busboy. He didn't take our order but he brought our drinks and food, he would slide across the bench to give me my drinks or bring my food. I thought that was unprofessional... Melba's seem to have a young group of employees working for them which is great but they have to school them a little more on professionalism..."
8/17/2018,4 star rating,"I visited Melba's for a dance party last week. It is a very nice place. The food is nice and the ambiance is also comfortable. After starting with a beer, I decided on having their cocktail a ""Malibu Melba"" for the remainder of the night. After the party went into full swing, I enjoyed it immensely! The staff was friendly and patient in the wake of a busy evening/night. Overall, my first impression of Melba's is very good."
8/16/2018,5 star rating,My family loves this place. When I'm in town. We go there ... eat good unpretentious food... enjoy ourselves... and move forward. Its popular but for a good reason. Have fun!
8/14/2018,4 star rating,"We went for the brunch. We had family style waffles, pancakes, bacon, strawberry butter, catfish, potatoes, sweet potatoes and fried chicken. The food was excellent and our server was a very nice lady. Service was a little slow, but that didn't bother us too much since we knew this was all made to order and home made. Good comfort food!"
8/11/2018,5 star rating,Melba's a family own & operated soul comfort food restaurant. Love the food love Melba's waffle & chicken but this restaurant is so much more. With its full bar & to large dining areas you may have to wait a few for your table (so call & reserve space is recommended) but it will always be worth the wait !!
8/9/2018,3 star rating,I went to Melba's for a work event. I wasn't able to order anything from the menu but they gave us shareable plates of some of the popular dishes. I was able to try the Mac and cheese which was favorable but a bit too cheesy or me. I tried the fried car fish and I was sadly disappointed. It did not taste good AT ALL. The fried chicken was good and so was the collard greens. The ribs were hard and from the appearance it looked like oxtails the meat wasn't tender AT ALL. The lemonade was AMAZING!!!! Now down to dessert... I tried the sweet potato pie which was cold smh another disappointment who wants to eat cold sweet potato pie ?? Not me ... the peach cobbler was also cold and too sweet. I doubt I will be back
8/9/2018,4 star rating,I love Melba's.  I actually think the flavor in their food is much stronger than Amy Ruth's and has a better overall taste.  The service is quite good and is very attentive from the times I've been there.  Always a lot of food that I have never in my life finished the first day but that's expected.

8/3/2018,1 star rating,I never got to taste the food because the delivery guy refused to deliver. Melba's should either pose on the page that they only do curbside or change delivery service.
7/14/2017,5 star rating,"I was looking for dinner near an event I was attending when this place caught my eye. I instantly remembered reading about it somewhere, and explored the menu. The menu looked AMAZING, so I went to see if it was the real deal. After a 12 minute wait for a table and 30 minutes for food, I got my answer. It was. The chicken and waffles were right on par with my high expectations, and the candied yams BLEW MY MIND. This is absolutely a great place for everyone: families, couples, or just yourself!"
6/7/2019,5 star rating,"First, let's start with Melba's hospitality. True Southern charm! Now let's get to the food: catfish is lightly-dusted, crispy fried, never greasy; the mac n cheese, or should i say the cheese with some mac? And the collard greens are cooked just right, slight touch of vinegar but not overpowering.But the test of the night was the red velvet cake and I may have a new favorite spot!"

6/25/2020,5 star rating,"I've wanted to try Melba's ever since I heard such good things about her food.  I also want to support black owned businesses, so tonight I decided to treat myself during this pandemic and ordered in from Melba's and boy is it good!  So good - sweet candied yams, mac and cheese, fried chicken, and potato salad - are all delicious!  Will definitely spread the word to friends and family.  Yum!"

I am visiting from Indiana and seen the menu and I was ohhh no I have to try this food . When I sat down I wasn't sure that I have made the right choice but I was quickly greeted by my server Alyssa , she was so nice and comforting and insured that the food was good and that I wouldn't be disappointed. Her service spoke for itself . It  was one of the best service I had in a long time she was on top of everything . The salmon croquettes was AMAZING. I will come back every time I am in New York .

6/28/2015,4 star rating,"We had brunch here on a Sunday and there was only about a 5 minute wait. The hostess was very accommodating. I had the eggnog waffles. It was delicious. Didn't love the strawberry butter that came with it, but that was only a minor detail. The waiters weren't the most attentive, but our specific waiter was incredibly respectful and very thankful for our business-which we really appreciated. The prices are great and the wait for food wasn't too long. Definitely be back!"
1/14/2018,5 star rating,I'm in town from Vegas and I wanted some real breakfast so I came to Melba's. It's small and quaint. I love the ambiance and the staff is very courteous. I ordered the catfish and grits ( I don't even like catfish to be honest) it was beautifully plated and everything about it was perfect. The grits were smooth and creamy and went perfectly with the well seasoned catfish (which I thoroughly enjoyed). I'd definitely recommend anyone to try it and I hope to come back and try the eggnog waffles.

5/20/2019,5 star rating,"My go to place to get chicken and waffles in NYC. Melba's always deliver. I love the food there. If you're ever in Harlem this is the place to eat. Harlem has changed a lot and there are many restaurants there but none of them come close to Melbas. The last time I went there, I got the mac and cheese with collard greens and their beef ribs. It literally fell off the bones. I'm obsessed with this place. Catch me there often."
2/24/2016,4 star rating,"Went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday. Place is small but we were seated immediately. Very close tables but it's ok as everyone who came here and we were seated next to seemed friendly. Great service from our service Trent. He was very attentive. For appetizer we got the Spinach and Cheese Empandas. They were SO Good and cheese and came with some amazing sauce. They only came with 2, and it was just me and my boyfriend but we wondered if their were more of us would we only still get 2. But anyway! For our entree we got the Chicken and Waffles of course and they were AMAZING. Waffles were so soft and yummy and the chicken was amazing, both the regular and the chicken wings. We also got a side of mac and cheese. Took a little while to come out after the entree so my boyfriend and I tried to wait for it before becoming stuffed with our entree. When it finally did some it was kind of a disappointment. Was not as cheesy or delicious as I would of wanted so I just let him eat it. For our drinks I got the Rose in Harlem and I forgot what my boyfriend got but both drinks were SUPER sweet but strong. Their mixed drink menu isn't expansive but they'll make whatever you ask for so I got a Patron Margarita which was so good and my boyfriend got a long island iced tea that was SO STRONG.Overall, I am a fan will be here again. Food was DELICIOUS with the exception of the mac and cheese.  P.S. We've never been here before but we overhead other tables complaining that their portions have gone down if that matters to anyone!"
11/30/2014,2 star rating,"Melba's definitely has it going on more for dinner than for brunch - at least as far as the eggnog waffles and turkey sausage goes.Had brunch with the wife today and was looking forward to the eggnog waffle and turkey sausage. The wife had the omelet special which for today happened to be the collard green omelet which came with potatoes.The verdict on the waffle is that while it had the flavor of eggnog present, the consistency of the waffle's texture was more dense than I'd prefer. Combined with the artificial syrup (some came heated, the remaining syrup didn't), the waffle required additional syrup to keep from turning into a dense dough ball in my mouth. I only finished 3/4 of the waffle. For an established restaurant looking to feature waffles (and pancakes too), real maple syrup goes a long way (their strawberry butter takes the dish halfway (maybe even 2/3 way) there).The turkey sausage was not much better. it was one dry link cut lengthwise. Period.My wife described her omelet as follows, ""it was what you'd expect. The collard flavor was good, but I was hoping for some extra something - spice in the egg, peppers, onions - something."" her turkey bacon was also ""meh"".The service was pretty good. Our server was polite, attentive and answered all of our questions.So four stars for dinner, but only two stars for brunch. We'll stick to Amy Ruth's and Billie's Black for brunch for now."
3/26/2012,4 star rating,"Melba's...oh Melba's...what a delicious place you are.I meant to write this two weeks ago when my cousin from Boston came into town and we went to Melba's to have dinner; I had the BBQ Turkey Meatloaf dinner and my cousin had the Fried Chicken dinner. We had calamari for the appetizer and macaroni and cheese and greens for the sides along with red velvet cake for dessert.The food was outstanding. The service? Not so much.So I returned tonight with a good friend/coworker for a second take. I had the chicken wings and eggnog waffles and my friend had the fried chicken dinner with macaroni and cheese and greens. Calamari again for the appetizer.The calamari was light-flaky and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, but not taffy chewy like calamari can get when prepared improperly. There was a clear savory spice in the breading used - yummy.The chicken was pretty good with a decent meatiness and savory flavor. The waffles were delicious. They were a bit heavy, but there was the definite hint of eggnog and the strawberry butter was a nice touch. Real syrup rounds out the dish. My friend's chicken, macaroni and cheese, and greens? Delicious. Oh, and did I forget to mention that the macaroni is made with three cheeses? And that the greens are cooked with smoked turkey necks among other spices?I really like the healthy spin on soul food. Another feature of the restaurant is the beautiful decor. To be honest, it's a bit tight in there with the seating, but the decor and ambiance is wonderful. Classy soulful is how I'd categorize it. There's also a full bar which serves what seems and sounds (and looks) like good drinks (I don't so take that for what it's worth).I give it four stars for two main reasons: one - I need consistent good service. The service on my first trip was lackluster, and the service tonight was on point. Let's see how they do when I return (hell yeah I'm coming back). Second: if and when I upgrade this star, I'll also upgrade my star rating for Amy Ruth's. The food is similar enough - the main difference is ambiance, service, and that Melba's costs a tad more than Amy Ruth's. But if you're in Harlem - definitely check out Melba's. You might actually run into her - she likes to mingle with the guests/patrons when she can."
3/19/2020,5 star rating,"Many of us are feeling the stress of the pandemic...didn't realize I needed a hug - some comfort food - until I ordered Melba's takeout. The delicious catfish, mac and cheese, spinach and sweet potato pie reminds me that we can still create a joyous, peaceful space in our own home...even in a chaotic world. I would attach a photo...but I ate everything! YUM!"
2/19/2018,5 star rating,Melba's is STILL my go to restaurant when I want to eat YUM YUM great food and service. I often dine alone or with groups of friends and business colleagues. The service is friendly and the atmosphere feels like being at home. I also use Melba's catering and delivery service....guaranteed to get rave reviews for my guests!

I feel greedy as my mind does a brain freeze....though I know what is on the menu....trying to decide what to order first. Just know, I have to talk myself out of ordering the sweet potato pie first...the food is fresh and lovingly prepared and I highly recommend to all...especially if you are celebrating a birthday....and you may be able to meet the wonderful legendary owner Melba Wilson! Her staff reflect her grace and are eager to please. FYI: Ms. Wilson owns Melba's 125 in the Harlem State Office Building and a sought after catering business, Melba's Catering."

Hubby had short ribs fall off the bone tender, while the kid had the lemon honey gooey chicken tender.  We had the Yams Mac n cheese and greens for sides. I must say the chicken was nicely seasoned as were the greens.  Yams were not overly sugary and sweet. We will be coming back!"

Had brunch while Spike Lee was here, so a little more of a wait than normal but as soon as we were seated our waitress got our order right away and the food came hot and quick!

She brings me the wrong dish & has the nerve to tell me she didn't hear me order my French toast. ( meanwhile wrote it down & pointed at it ) wtf???? .... At this point I'm extremely frustrated & hungry as hell finna swing on someone... but ok. I get my French toast 3 minutes later. 0 stars shit was soaked in eggs , super soggy & 5.00 for a little ass plate of eggs. This place is a JOKE. My waitress was whack. First & last time EVER. No tip or anything...."
6/16/2019,3 star rating,"TOO SALTY, if you could lessen the amount of salt required for each recipe and leave room for your patrons to add it if more salt is needed then I could give this review  5 stars. I would also suggest to add spices to replace the required amount salt for your recipes.  Less salt replace the taken away with a spice please. I like to eat out and would love  to frequent your establishment more often. Thanks"

12/28/2016,3 star rating,"One of the only restaurants in the area that have that casual, yet intimidate type of atmosphere.  Lights are dim, a lot of wood furniture, with a hit of vintage ambiance. I was super excited to try the waffles and chicken. There was even a caption next to it that said it was highly rated! However, I was super disappointing after eating it. The chicken was pretty tasteless, and there was no crisp to the skin. I substituted the waffle for mac and cheese and was also disappointed by the sogginess of the mac and cheese. It was overcooked and was too saucy for my taste buds. The service: The waiter we had was pleasant to talk to, and was diligent on getting us our orders. But other than service and ambiance, the food really did not hit home for me at all."
6/10/2015,1 star rating,HORRIBLE SERVICE this stars reflect the service The owner is a friend or the family but I can't tell a lie.Staff was rude forgetful and almost annoyed to service I expect this service everywhere in Manhattan except Harlem and a black owned place at that.The crab cakes were the size of a quarterOther than that the food was amazing keep your boh staff and train your foh staff better or keep them longer every time I come here there's new waiters and waitresses They messed up so bad we got a free Deseret The coconut cake was amazing red velvet was warm I did a dance when I got it.

The woman, Linda, said she is Melba's cousin. I don't care if you're Ava Duvernay, I don't want to be in your low budget film. I was dismissed. Very disappointed. It's, unfortunately, the last time I'll be here."
8/19/2017,4 star rating,"After living around the corner from this place for a while, I finally stopped by for dinner. There was a Harlem Havana event happening, so there were some special menu items and a very talented live band. It can get really loud in the first bar room (with band), but the hostess happily seated us in the quieter dining room. Some tables have tablecloths and some don't, which makes the formality of this restaurant a little confusing, along with the bar and decor. I can't really say whether it's a casual joint, or more of a fancy occasion place.My party ordered the chicken and waffles and catfish, with mac'n'cheese and yams. The portions were generous and make the higher prices worth it. That was definitely the best fried fish I've ever had in NYC. The macaroni was the creamy style without breadcrumbs on top and was superb. The blend of cheeses is really high quality and there are great flavors of pepperjack and cheddar.The service was pretty slow, considering that the restaurant was not super busy, there didn't seem to be enough waitstaff. Our waiter was very friendly and was helpful with menu suggestions, though. The waiter gave us the wrong check, but quickly swapped them and apologized when we let them know about the mix up."
3/9/2016,4 star rating,"I've always wanted to go there and I finally had my chance!  The service was great, the drinks were fantastic and food was good (not excellent but good).  Although the place is kind of small, the atmosphere was pleasant and I most definitely will be dining there again -- definitely worth it."
9/12/2014,4 star rating,"The guy who originally waited on us, he wasn't all the way with us on this day in particular so he passed us along to another woman who knew her stuff. She set us up and had our order in quickly. Lunch time, had to have been about four people total at the start of our meal and ten by the time we left. I ordered the chicken and eggnog waffles. Not even a hint of eggnog but what I will brag on is that strawberry butter. That's the bees knees. That, I asked for more of. The chicken was crispy and flavored well. The mac and cheese was really good. My friends catfish was delicious and the spinach was fresh. That's definitely what I'm ordering when I come back. However, I wasn't a fan of the peach cobbler. I hate cinnamon and there was a plethora of it. If it's mild, it's doable but as soon as I opened the container it smelled like a cinnamon factory."
5/31/2020,4 star rating,I love everything about this place EXCEPT the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I just wish they made regular mac and cheese. I'd rate it a 5 but the truffle has to go.
6/1/2019,5 star rating,"Never disappoints- great ambiance and food. Cat fish is a must, potato salad- not to mention the drinks."
10/3/2014,4 star rating,"This place is delicious!!!!! It's a very small intimate restaurant located on the corner. It has a cozy ambiance and soft R&B music gently plays in the background. Growing up in a southern household the food meets my standards. Everything was absolutely splendid.For our appetizer we had the Melbas Spring Rolls. It consists of rice and beans, collard greens, and cheese with a savory dipping sauce. It was slightly oily but nothing that ruins the flavor. My entreé was the fried catfish with a side of mac & cheese and candied yams. WINNING!!! Oh and the catfish comes with chipotle mayonnaise. Sooooooo good. My date had the turkey bbq meatloaf with a side of mac & cheese and collard greens. Bbq turkey meatloaf just sounds odd but to his surprise it was good. He enjoyed everything on his plate. Not to mention I stole a few bites. We actually started to feel comatose in the middle of our meal. The food is very comforting. It was also sweet when the staff got the attention of the entire restaurant so we could sing happy birthday to a guest. Of course it was the rendition Stevie Wonder version. That was very nice and I'm sure they felt special. The only bad thing I would say is there isn't a good sized space for a waiting area. Everybody is crowded by the door. All in all I recommend."

1/22/2017,4 star rating,"Nice good sized soul food in Harlem. I really liked the chicken and egg nog waffles with white meat. It was a bit dry but was well fried, tasty, and a large portion. The ma and cheese was incredibly cheesy which I thought really worked well. My girlfriend thought the waffles were too heavy.One thing I will say- we arrived about ten minutes before the rest of our party and they wouldn't seat us until everyone had arrived. Given that the restaurant was almost completely empty this seemed kind of stupid."
4/29/2018,5 star rating,"Ok, I've been here twice now. The food is exceptional, the service is wonderful. Wait staff is attentive. 1st time, my family hosted Thanksgiving dinner. The Short ribs, Turkey and all were delicious. This time, Chicken wings & Eggnog waffles. Fabulous, crispy chicken, light fluffy waffle. I will be returning to Melbas soon."

1/28/2019,2 star rating,"This was THE secure, never fail, Harlem go to for all my out of state friends to visit. I would always recommend Melba's . Haven't been there in a few years. Had brunch on Saturday, chicken and waffles (my staple, my ALL TIME FAVORITE) and it was such a disappointment. Waffles were blah, chicken was dry and the service was mediocre (waitress wouldn't bring us our drinks unless we asked and would ask us if we wanted anything...so weird). The quality of the food, not there anymore."
9/9/2016,5 star rating,Down home delicious southern food in the heart of Harlem. Finger licking food eating. I have tried many of the dishes and they continue to delight me for years. If you are there on a Tuesday you get to experience live music while you graze on all the yummy menu options. Great staff who can help you navigate your food choices and the cocktails are on point everytime. My favorite dish is the brazed short rib it's slap you're mama good.   So next time you are in Harlem make sure to visit this Uptown staple and get you some good ole southern fusion food.
5/11/2011,3 star rating,"A few of my friends from VA were visiting NY and had seen Melba's Chicken and Waffles being featured on Throwdown with Bobby Flay. They suggested we go and give it a try. This was my first time trying chicken and waffles and I was really excited. I'm not sure if they were just having an off day, but the hosts and servers weren't very welcoming or attentive. Our cups were barely filled with water and I think we saw our waitress a total of 2 times. At the beginning to take our order and at the end to give us our check. Overall, the chicken and waffle dish was mediocre. I was a bit disappointed because my chicken was on the drier side. The skin itself was nice and crispy but the meat could have been juicer. The waffle and strawberry butter were good, but I don't quite understand what all the hype is about? I've tasted better waffles elsewhere. The strawberry butter is unique though. I haven't tried any of the other dishes served here. I probably won't be back to do so either. Maybe if everyone was a bit more welcoming (as seen on Food Network), I would have been more willing to give this place another shot. My friends and I had a mission- To try their infamous chicken and waffles.Our conclusion- They're nothing to rant and rave about."
8/10/2015,4 star rating,"Had the Harlem Iced Tea and it did not disappoint! The bartender was so courteous and attentive, despite the busy atmosphere. Also had the chicken and waffles with a side of collard greens. I'm salivating just thinking how succulent and crispy the chicken was! And it was the bessssst waffles I've ever tasted. Full of flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. Would def go to this place again!!!"

8/6/2016,5 star rating,"Melba's is legit. Amazing smothered chicken. It's even a really nice modern space (with a great bar) for a soul food place. Totally not what I expected.Don't kill me but I didn't taste any eggnog in that waffle, though. I know that's one of the things they're famous for. I mean, it was a good waffle and the strawberry butter was amazing and it paired well with the chicken, but I wanted more nogginess. I think I'll have to try it again next time and compare experiences. Gives me a good excuse to go back."
8/18/2014,5 star rating,"This was my second time at Melba's and I have to say the food there was way better than the first time around.Hubby and I went on a nice Friday evening as he's been wanting to try this spot.  While the place is small and was filled upon our arrival, we didn't have to wait too long for a table.We decided to skip appetizers and head straight for the entrees as it was kind of late and we were hungry.  I had the fried catfish with mac and cheese and potato salad (I know two starches -- don't judge me).  Anywho I have to say my food was absolutely delicious!!  The fish was piping hot and was served on top of the mac and cheese which was cheesy and flavorful.  The potato salad was just the way I like it (a lot of places make it with too much vinegar).  Hubby had the chicken wings and waffles - his wings too were hot and the waffle he said was delicious.  They give you generous servings with your food so either you're stuffed when you leave or you're taking food home.  Me being greedy ate all of my food, while hubby took some of his home.The service was also good as our waitress was on top of all our needs from bringing me hot sauce to getting our drinks and she did it all with a smile on her face and pleasant conversation.This is a perfect date night spot if you want some good music that isn't too loud and enjoy some really good southern food."
5/28/2016,5 star rating,"Melba's is a wonderful, fun, delicious and inviting neighborhood eatery. The menu, though oriented around a vision of American 'comfort' food (fried chicken, mashed potatoes, barbecue ribs, waffles, etc.), contains surprises, like the small but succulent spring rolls.  The food is almost literally addictive.  My wife ALWAYS orders the fried chicken, I ALWAYS get the turkey meatloaf, and my daughter ALWAYS gets the sweet yams and short ribs.  The service is reasonably efficient, but consistently warm, friendly and personal.  The bar is impressively inclusive and the specialty drinks creative, varied, and delightful.  And Melba herself is like the mama your family needed - seemingly everywhere, ruling with love, clearly filled with joy at the sight of her evolving family (the customers, of course).  By the third time we went, she introduced us to the staff and everyone at the bar, all of whom she knew by name. My only caveat is that the music (funk,soul & R&B of the highest quality) can get loud enough to hamper conversation.  Doubtless there are customers who love it.  It's a problem when we bring my mother-in-law, who loves the food, but speaks very quietly.  The good news is that nearly every time I've asked a waiter if it could be lowered, it has been, and the staff attitude has been accommodating.But even with that, Melba's is so good and so special I can't bear to deduct a star.  There's something about it that makes it feel like your own personal treasure."
4/27/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time going to melba's . My brother and i went on sunday it was Easter sunday. They open at five on sunday. Make sure you make reservations because the place is not big but not small either. The manager Nicholas sat us down he was very friendly and engaging with the customers. I ordered the grilled salmon, sweet yams, mac and cheese and potatoe salad. It was delicious. And for dessert i had the coconut layed cake, it was a little to sweet for my taste. But if you have a sweet tooth go for it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoy soul food. And i forgot to mention the music was very soulful. And i love the art on the walls."
2/20/2019,5 star rating,The best southern cooking I have ever had. Friendly and fun service and don't miss the live music on Tuesdays. It is incredible. We ordered sliders twice. Tender and addicting! Shrimp was so juicy with a hint of sweetness. The Mac and Cheese is a must try....comfort food taken to a whole new level. And don't get me started on desert! The coconut pound cake is out of this world.
4/26/2019,5 star rating,"The food here is always fantastic.  However, I want to highlight the great service of the waitstaff Olleigh B. She was warm, knowledgeable about the menu and recommended a fab drink. The entire staff was on point. We never had an empty glass of water without asking anyone for refills.Olleigh was attentive, and so fun. Honestly one of the best servers that I've had at any Harlem restaurant. (I've been to almost all of them)Melba's food is consistently tasty, the drinks are yummy, and the service consistent. I'm glad that she is a Harlem institution, especially against the rampant gentrification of our neighborhood.Melba's allowed my partner and I to stay consistent with our #BlackFridays. We support Black businesses on Fridays, with the aim of keeping a dollar in communities of color longer."
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"Melba's is AMAZING! I went for Sunday brunch to celebrate my birthday. I got the chicken and waffles; my food was fresh, hot, and seasoned perfectly. The staff were very welcoming and sang to me! It was a great time, and I was happy to meet Melba. If you're in the city you should plan to visit Melba's. I can't wait to go back!"
1/4/2019,3 star rating,"So, I was very excited to try this place after word of mouth reviews as well as the Yelp reviews. Gotta say I'm a tad disappointed and expected better. I ordered the fried Jumbo shrimp which comes with a choice of two sides. I selected yams and mac and cheese. Now I must say, the portion size is odd. The shrimp are indeed jumbo, (got about 6 of those)...and I received tons of yams but a disproportionate small amount of mac and cheese. The shrimp are fried perfectly. Nice and crunchy but it lacked seasoning. Not even salt and pepper. That's so lazy. It tasted like eating fried nothingness. Yams were decent, not too sweet. Mac and cheese wasn't bad but could've used a pinch of salt and pepper. For dessert I had the pound cake a la mode. The vanilla ice cream tasted like a cheap watery imitation vanilla based ice cream that must have been cheap store brought. The pound cake is served warm, and glazed. But somehow it lacks moisture. It's dry and seemingly microwaved. While the glaze is nice, the actual cake is bland and lacks sugar. Gotta say this was pricey and missed important but easy points in flavoring. The food gets a 2 but the music is such good Black BBQ soul music that it gets a star for that alone. But, Melba..I'm disappointed. Please make sure your cooks aren't skipping steps because they didn't do it justice tonight."
9/17/2016,3 star rating,"Food was good. Just terrible service.We ordered the smothered chicken and waffles and it was tasty. The waffle was superb.My friend ordered a salmon omelette and they said there was nothing in it but salmon and egg. So it cost $ 1.50 per item to add veggies/cheese to it. Seems ridiculous. One server came over after a solid while to take our drink order. Forgot our drinks, we had to go to the bar to ask for them because we couldn't get anyone's attention. Then he finally comes back and takes our order. Someone else comes by and tries to take our order again. Confusing. Asked for the check. Never came. Then another waiter comes over and asked if we want the check. What's going on in this place I'm not sure. But they have some solid comfort staples and with some refinement it could be a great spot.I may try again sometime and reevaluate."

4/16/2019,5 star rating,"Melbas is amazing. The service was great ! Delicious food and drinks. I also had the pleasure of meeting a very beautiful and sweet employee named Alysha. She is very attentive,  pleasant and easy to talk to. Thank you Alysha! I will most certainly come back again!"
10/6/2017,3 star rating,Hip spot with a live crowd and tasty food. Waiter was nice but could not break a 100 dollar bill when we needed less than $40 back.
11/21/2016,4 star rating,"Not bad, not bad at all. The fried chicken and eggnog waffle are great, no more no less than what it is supposed to be. No bells and frills and very, very solid. The cheese grits side was delicious, and so was the French toast. Good price, filling, tasty food, friendly staff... The place is a little small but it gives it a nice cozy and intimate atmosphere. their coffee isn't great, but hey, you're not going to a Friend chicken and waffle joint for good coffee. On the other hand... GET THE ICED TEA. PLEASE."
6/30/2018,1 star rating,"So very disappointed with my trip to Melba's tonight. Trying not to be too judgemental when we arrived, but I had a bad feeling when I saw the grade pending sign in the front window. We have eaten in many soul food restaurants a little bit of everywhere, some also in Harlem and we were very excited to visit this iconic spot that had once been featured on the Food Network. The disappointment started when our appetizers arrived at the table in less than 2 minutes. I personally like my food cooked not reheated. The second disappointment came when we had already finished our appetizers and still not received our drinks. The next disappointment came when the entrees came out just five minutes later, again I prefer my food cooked and not heated up. The rice and peas luke warm, dried and unseasoned. Couldn't even compare to some of the boxed rice and peas sold in the supermarket. The disappointments continued when I discovered while some of my food was hot I could stick my finger directly into the macaroni and cheese which was soupy and cold. We even joked calling it a mac and cheese gazpacho. Again, I don't know about you but I personally like my mac and cheese with a little baked topping and some crispness to it. We thought we would give it one final try and order a dessert and much to my dismay what I would call a quick peach cobbler arrived at the table it was a boxed cake with soupy peaches. I've had my share of southern cooking from family, friends and restaurants and this by far was the most disappointing. On another note as we sat and ate we watched them set up for a party where folding tables were assembled right next to us and tablecloths were dragged on the floor as they tried to unfold them and shake them out before putting them o  the table. Pretty unprofessional and unappetizing. I will also mention this very disappointing meal cost over $150 with the tip. Yes we ordered two drinks each but we had to do something to try and satisfy us, that didn't work either it was more like sweet drinks with a drop of alcohol. I hope one day Melba's will be back to what it once was or at least what we heard of it."

We had the salmon, the BBQ Turkey Meatloaf, and the Shrimp with sides of Mac and cheese, collard greens, spinach, sweet potatoes. All prepared to perfection.  The cocktails were heavenly originals and the service was fabulous."
2/16/2020,3 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp. I had the wine braised beef ribs, collard greens, and yams. That was pretty good. However service is majorly slow. Too slow considering a packed restaurant. We ordered at 8:00 and food wasn't service until 8:45pm. Plus they don't give you any bread while waiting. I don't know if they were out of bread or just don't have any bread or cornbread. Plus music needs to be a little louder on the one side of restaurant to keep the ambience. Otherwise, overall it was cool."

3/12/2014,4 star rating,"TIPS: RESERVATION ON A WEEKEND NIGHT IS A MUST!!!!+++- Fried chicken and egg nog waffle is the truth; altho I didn't taste much egg-nog ness in the waffle    *I feel the white meat chicken, ordered by my friend, had more meat than the dark meat chicken++- Satueed spinach is not wet and greasy and actually tastes kind of healthy- Mac n Cheese is good- Red sangria has brandy in it and you can taste it+- yams tasted just like sweet potato pie- warm pound cake for dessert, literally melted in my mouth-- not enough syrup and strawberry butter to fill the waffle- Waiters can get aloof and forget requests on a busy night- Not much room in waiting area; make a resey and please come around that time"
1/15/2017,5 star rating,"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.When we got in, there was pretty much no room to get to the host (it was too packed) so we just waited for him to come back up to the front, luckily we were seated fairly quickly.Our server was Daquan and he was attentive and accommodating. We both ordered the Harlem Iced Teas & Chicken & waffles. Loved them! I normally go downtown for brunch and I'm glad we found a place with good food and service in our neighborhood."
12/30/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time to Melba's since, gosh, in years and it didn't disappoint. It was my date that actually suggested that we have dinner here and it was an excellent choice. While walking in, you're immediately greeted by the host, who reassured us that we'd only be waiting a couple of minutes to be seated. After a few minutes we were then seated & our waiter, Luis, came over graciously introduced himself & made some menu suggestions that I appreciated, knowing it was my first time, in a long time. We ordered cocktails which were delicious, while waiting for dinner. Fellow Yelpers, it was worth the wait. I ordered the grilled shrimp, collard greens and macaroni and cheese. The shrimp were succulent, the collard greens were flavorful and the macaroni and cheese was cheesey and absolutely delicious! Thank you to Luis for a fantastic dining experience. Thank you to the bartender who made our amazing drinks, once we moved to the bar and staying just a little longer than we expected. The other fashionable  patrons that shared the bar with us agreed, that the one thing that we would say brings folks back to Melba's is the atmosphere and I'd have to agree. This location has a high-energy personality which for me, is a match made in Manhattan! This is not just a restaurant but is that one place that welcomes you in, like visiting friends. You can't wait to walk in and absorb it all. Come on in, take your hat off and stay awhile. I promise, you won't regret it. See you soon! Enjoy! Kudos to the staff! Great job!"
10/7/2018,3 star rating,"We came here for brunch on a Sunday. Called 30 minutes ahead of time to put our name on the list and we were able to sit as soon as we came. It was great service, the host and waiter were nice. My only complaint is that they barely serve any food! I ordered the sweet potato pancakes and it came with two small pancakes, basically super dollars. The food tasted great but you don't get enough bang for your buck. Too expensive for just one waffle and a chicken wing. We left hungry, it felt like we just ate appetizers yet it was whole meal and was the cost of a whole meal."
9/20/2020,4 star rating,"Melba's restaurant definitely has southern comfort food. Everything I had on my plate was on point. The Charleston fried shrimp, Mac and cheese, collard greens, potato salad, and the southern smothered white meat fried chicken was good like always. Strawberry Henny drink was also good and strong! The only reason I didn't give Melba's 5 stars was because the customer service was terrible. It took our waitress about 30 mins to take our order. Had we not called her over it would have taken even longer since she was taking orders from customers who came after my family. When we finally got her attention she told us she wasn't aware of what guest came first which is definitely bad service. There should be some kind of system where the waiters/waitress knows who has been seated first so they can be accommodated. Overall I would continue to go back to Melba's they just need to figure out a better system especially when they have customers who have been supporting them before and now through the pandemic."
2/19/2015,5 star rating,"Heard about this place a year ago, but just couldn't fit it in my last trip. This time I did, boy was I stupid to wait a year. The place is cute as heck, great setting, lighting and everything you need for a cozy evening. We went early at 5:30 since we didnt' have reservations and we didn't want to be there when it was packed due to noise level. Which would be great for other nights, but not for the particular evening we went out. The food was just a joy. We started out with 2 of their signature drinks for $11 bucks, and let me tell you. The gentleman I was with and I are both good drinkers but these drinks knocked us on our butts. We had to drink them very very slow, they were strong and delicious. Then we had 2 appetizers one catfish fingers, OMG truly the best I ever had. They were like butter. Crispy yes, but tender and soft yet crispy, I seriously don't know how they did that. I always get them crispy but hard some times dried out but this place mastered the balance of crispy and tender forgoing neither. Then we had Melba's Rolls which were different an amazing. Crispy egg rolls filled with greens, rice, beans etc. Yum!On to dinner... Fried Chicken and Waffles. OMG This combination should be illegal in all states!And Melba's should be seriously taken down for their added effort to recipe by making the most amazing waffle I've had in a while.... EGG NOG WAFFLE people! Seriously EGG NOG WAFFLE!  and they made the belgium type waffle perfectly thick, fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside. IF that's not enough of their crimes, they have the nerve to add their home made strawberry whipped butter which was not too sweet with salty savory tones. Plus with pure natural maple syrup which I like to mix with a little hot sauce for the fresh juicy crispy fried chicken. Yum Yum Yum And as a stickler for service. We had impeccable service by everyone there. Polite, knowledgeable, on the ball. This will definitely be my go to place when ever I'm in Harlem. This place is not to be missed!"
2/3/2017,4 star rating,"Came here on a date and Melba's did not disappoint. The staff was helpful and personable, and the restaurant has a very friendly, lively, Harlem vibe. Given its reputation and popularity it was still pretty easy to book a table a few days out, but I would definitely recommend doing so. While there weren't a ton of vegetarian options on the menu (drawback for me), my boyfriend was happy as a clam with his chicken and waffles, and both of our desserts were tasty."
5/1/2019,3 star rating,"Meh.....I had really high hopes for this restaurant. I've previously read many reviews...you either have a good experience or you don't. When visiting New York, I love dining out. I'm a foodie and an adventurous person so surely I look forward to seeing and tasting. I was already a little irritated with parking but luckily a guy was pulling out just steps away from the door so I'm definitely thinking oh yeah this is meant to be. We were seated in a dark cozy area with others and it took awhile before our waiter approached the table. I heard many great things about the waffle so I ordered the eggnog waffle with wings. Food came out pretty fast...but that chicken though...it's a no go for me. I'm from the south and I like my fried chicken to have some type of seasoning. It was tasteless..REDO THE BATTER BABY....smh. The waffle was delicious!!! I asked for strawberry butter to go with it....for some reason I thought it automatically came with it....who knows. I am glad I was able to see what all the hype was about...but like I mentioned just mehhhhhhhh"
2/22/2015,3 star rating,"Okay so first suggestion in one word ""Reservation"". This spot for Sunday Brunch......busy, but worth the wait. So this is my first time and it stood up to the hype my friend and I had the chicken and waffles.......#Delish a side of sausage and eggs and my other girlfriend who's been before had the fried catfish and waffles.......and I dare to say the catfish was fried to perfection to rival Amy Ruth's. And anyone who knows and my reviews drinks I like and their white sangria to die for......and I'm usually not a sangria gal......theirs Awesome!And I only gave 3 stars to due to the wait and slight disorganization, but I must say the staff and manager was on top of things. This is on the revisit list......"
11/25/2019,5 star rating,Great service and food. Staff and owner makes sure you're well taken care of even if it's busy. You'll most likely need reservations on weekends.
8/8/2016,5 star rating,"Celebrated my friend's birthday here on Friday. We made reservations, came early and had drinks at the bar while we waited for our party to arrive. It was happy hour for drinks and appetizers and the bartender was on point! We were well toasted before we sat at our table. We all ordered the chicken and waffles, a first for me--I know but I've never been living right. I went for the white meat which had well seasoned skin and paired well with the waffles and butter...for an appetizer we got calamari and catfish. Both were fresh and amazing. The catfish was best and we ended up ordering another two rounds for the table. The space is small and it looks like it's always popping but the food is well worth the visit. I will be going back."
2/23/2019,5 star rating,Food is yummy and delicious. Will be back again soon. I totally recommend Melba's. You will not regret it.
2/7/2018,1 star rating,"The one star doesn't reflect their quality of food. Too bad for me I can't attest to it. But what I can speak for is the service of their group catering department. It is by far the worst I've come across, I requested a table for a birthday brunch 10 days ago and still haven't received confirmation. I've just been playing a game of phone and email tag with them. I don't want to play anymore!! I'll be taking my brunch someplace more professional. I think this is a prerequisite for a horrible time at Melba's."
8/25/2016,3 star rating,"After reading some reviews and browsing the menu I thought it would be a good option. However, I was super disappointed and underwhelmed with the overall experience. The eggnog waffle tasted like and eggos waffle and lacked any flavor resembling eggnog. The rest of the food: salmon, chicken, and spinach was just okay. The Mac and cheese was good! Wouldn't come back again."

4/17/2016,3 star rating,"This was my first visit here for brunch and I was pretty excited to try  the soul food here.  My friend made reservations for us which seems to be necessary as the place is small and gets really packed for weekend brunch. We were seated right away but then we just sat there waiting for our server.  Our waiter was pretty much unavailable most of the time,  we waited quite a while after being seated for water and the menu. Once we placed our orders, I asked our server for the drink menu because in my mind it's not a real brunch without some alcohol. After about 10 minutes our server still had not come by to check on anything or bother bringing the drink menu, finally my friend got his attention and reminded him about the menu. While most times I'm pretty relax and understanding if servers are very busy,  the experience felt very unorganized and the service was practically non-existent. We both ordered the smothered fried chicken and eggnog waffles. I must say that the food was delicious! The smothered chicken was absolutely amazing, the gravy was so good and the sweetness of the waffle made it the perfect combination. I'm a big chicken and waffles fan and I really think this was one of the best I've had. Honestly if my review was about the food alone then it would be 5 stars but the service was just lacking. If you want to try some delicious smothered chicken and waffles I would definitely recommend, just be aware that service does not appear to be a strong suit here."
2/21/2020,5 star rating,Great Southern Cooking. Alysha was the best waitress ever. She had our family figured out from the time we sat down
11/19/2018,5 star rating,We visited for an adult mother daughter dinner date but I love this place. I will definitely be back with my hubby and friends and others. The food was delicious. Drinks were great and the service was friendly. Our only complaint was they did not serve cornbread but when we asked about it the waiter informed us that they would not serve it if they could not serve it fresh as needed. We appreciated that but would have loved to have some. My peach Melba fell slightly flat but it did not ruin the dinner for me. I will be back
11/24/2013,4 star rating,"If you want a spiritual experience in Harlem on a Sunday, you could walk past the houses of worship, with their doors open, and gospel music floating into the street. If you want a divine intervention in Harlem on a Sunday, you get the grits during Brunch at Melba's. Good lord, hallelujah. You order those grits if you know what's good for you--and you make a reservation, or you could wait 45 minutes. Melba's is comforting soul food served up in a chic and bistro-style ambiance. Prepare to get real comfortable with your fellow dining customers and the elevated noise level in the room. Everybody's talking and having a good time.  I started talking to my neighboring table when the one lady sat on my leg. The banquette tables are close. My complete brunch order consisted of the Eggnog Waffle, served with strawberry butter, a side of eggs and grits, and lots of coffee. Then I got another side of eggs, unexpectedly. Sitting with my six eggs, the waiter told me that the kitchen thought I needed more eggs. Melba's makes you feel at home, with your mom making you breakfast.The Eggnog waffle was beautiful, and it came with its waffley face powdered with sugar and a pot of warm syrup to melt the strawberry butter. The plentiful plate of eggs was perfectly scrambled. Yet, it was the grits that really spoke to me.When my new table neighbor friends saw me closing my eyes and spooning those grits into my mouth with determination, they ordered them too. I'm pretty sure Melba's cooks the grits in chicken broth, then mixes chicken fat in. This is not 100%, and the grits certainly did not taste greasy. They tasted like my stomach got itself a hug for the first time. From some grits that tasted like the smell of good fried chicken. My neighbors and I, we all swapped stories of past grits experienced, not even noticing that we were really sitting on top of each other at this restaurant. Melba's grits bring strangers together in a comfortably crowded restaurant like we were at a community picnic. That's the true meaning of soul food, I'm sure."
12/29/2016,5 star rating,I'll keep this short and simple...fried catfish and eggnog waffles amazing!!! And the wine braised ribs....amazing!!! But the catfish hands down the best piece of catfish I've ever had in my LIFE!! It was perfect!!
1/2/2011,4 star rating,"Great place!  Small, nice restaurant with a really warm feel to it.  Went at 1 PM on a Sunday with three other people.  No wait but it definitely got crowded quick.They brought us warm biscuits with raisins (gratis!) and water quickly.  They were playing John Legend and Erykah Badu softly in the background so I was a happy girl.  I ordered the coffee ($3 and didn't get a refill - wouldn't do it again.) and Southern Fried Chicken and Pancakes.  You can have the chicken dark or light and it comes with two large pancakes and a small assortment of fruit.  The food was brought to us quickly and so very good.  The chicken was cooked well and juicy and the two pancakes were the size of the plate.  I had to take one home.Love Melba's.  I will definitely be back for brunch or maybe dinner next time."
8/27/2017,3 star rating,The food is well seasoned but the oxtail was too mashed up ..more gravy than meat & it's a little salty for me..I love the mac & cheese ..drinks were good
4/30/2016,5 star rating,Best food in Harlem! Chicken and waffles are delis and their wine selection is fab! (Huge Pinot Nior fan and theirs is by far my favorite) if you're looking for a nice soul food spot with a comfortable yet classy decor I strongly recommend Melba's. I'll be coming back real soon! *sometimes they'll have a live band and allow a few people to come up and sing! *
12/22/2015,1 star rating,"Not sure what happened tonight...  Melba's is one of my favorite spots in Harlem in which I have dined in and done take out.  I hadn't been here in a while, did take out today & was not happy w/ the food...  The cat fish bites were different - they didn't have that flaky crispy breading like they should've being that they were supposed to be fried; the fried shrimp tasted very fishy - not sure if they were supposed to taste that way, but I've always ordered them & they've never tasted like that; the yams were not good - seemed as if they needed a little more sugar, some cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg.  I also had the Tres Mac & Cheese and I was highly disappointed - the noodles were hard, and there was barely cheese on them; it definitely did not consist of 3 different types of cheese because it did not have the flavor of 3 nor other seasoning, it was very bland.Not sure if management will see this, but I hope so - I would like to return to Melba's but would definitely need the food to be better.  I'm wondering if there was a change in chef period or just tonight..."
12/8/2015,2 star rating,"Good food, terrible everything else.Oh, except the paintings. The paintings, specifically the one of the dude on the couch? The paintings are golden. But the rest? The rest made me want to write a bad review and let me tell you, I have never had any interest whatsoever in writing any sort of review. There are enough people mindlessly yammering their way through the Internet. But this experience warranted something. 6 pm reservation - didn't get seated till 7. No apologies, not even much interaction, except when we gently reminded them we'd been waiting. We're not prima donnas, but if you don't want to honor reservations, don't have 'em. Once we were finally seated, our food didn't come for over an hour, even though pretty much 99.9999 percent of the other tables (many of whom were seated after us) were served. It actually started to be a bit funny, except in the 'Wait, are we on some sort of prank show? If so, this a really boring concept for a prank show' sort of way. I'm not even mentioning the little things, like the fact that we had to get our own menus, and water refills. Well, I guess I kind of am.When the food finally arrived, we were so starving, we scarfed it down in 10 minutes and didn't even talk to each other. So much for that nice special Sunday dinner we planned (and reserved). And of course, the bill arrived real quick. And of course, the hostess was real quick to remind us to pay our bar tab, for the 3 measly beers we didn't even want but ordered because our reservation was one full hour late. And we had to actually argue for those 3 beers to be on the house, because, service?! Look, as I said, the food is fine. There is nothing wrong with the food. But as far as we could tell, there were many many things wrong with their communication skills: amongst staff and towards customers.C'mon, Melba's -  get it together."
11/19/2016,5 star rating,"Great food, service, ambience. We ordered the fried catfish, potato salad, mac and cheese, crab cakes, garden salad. Everything was good, but mac and cheese was ok, no complaints but not raving about it. The potato salad was great, light and flavorful, and not overloaded with potato. Crab cakes were good but quite small, that should be worked on, 2 small balls.The main event--catfish-- was great. It was crisp, not overly breaded, well season, just delicious. Service was good, not exceptional, but good, nothing to complain about."
11/11/2018,2 star rating,"Annoyed! Actually super annoyed! I used to love Melba's and used to come here at least twice a week. I'm not sure if they switched management but the last few times that I have been here have been disastrous. Today was the last straw. I came here for brunch with 3 other people and of the 4 orders, 1 was correct. Not only were the orders incorrect, the replacement food took 30 minutes to come out (pancakes and eggs) after all if that, the orders were still incorrect and the food was cold. GET IT TOGETHER MELBA!!"

11/24/2019,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite soul food restaurant in Harlem. The food and service were amazing. I had catfish and home fries and my friend had the shrimp and grits. We went for brunch on a Sunday and the wait time was about an hour. I would recommend always making a reservation as we were seated in 10 min because we had a reservation.

Their wonderful singer could've used a little more volume on her mic :-) The servers were all charming and helpful!My dining partner had the dark-meat fried chicken and said it was delicious. I was disappointed that my fried chicken breast was dry. I assumed they brined the chicken before frying it since they won an award for it. Unfortunately, I am not a leg and thigh chicken girl. The triple macaroni and cheese, and the collard greens were both good (8/10). I had the waffle for dessert - DARN, I should've had it with my fried chicken - the way it comes on the menu!"

I had the BBQ turkey meatloaf which I thought was out of this world, my hubby had the sautéed catfish, he's a picky eater and thought it was phenomenal.

10/21/2018,5 star rating,"This place served THE best shrimp and grits I've ever had. And I've done my share of tasting. They were garlicy though so if you're not a garlic person- you may not agree. My cousin and I shared this and the eggnog waffle and the consensus was that there will be no sharing next time! The service was friendly and unlike many other places in busy NYC, we were given all the time we needed to hang out post paying the bill, which is rare and was appreciated. Will definitely return the next time I have a craving!"

After starting with a beer, I decided on having their cocktail a ""Malibu Melba"" for the remainder of the night. After the party went into full swing, I enjoyed it immensely! The staff was friendly and patient in the wake of a busy evening/night. Overall, my first impression of Melba's is very good."

8/9/2018,4 star rating,I love Melba's.  I actually think the flavor in their food is much stronger than Amy Ruth's and has a better overall taste.  The service is quite good and is very attentive from the times I've been there.  Always a lot of food that I have never in my life finished the first day but that's expected.
6/23/2019,1 star rating,While the food is delicious the service is horrible. I'm waiting for my food. Sitting here for an hour and 15 min is not cool. Our server has a whole section she is serving by herself. This is my 3rd time here and the service has gotten worse. After today I will never come here. Too many other brunch places in Harlem.
9/18/2016,3 star rating,"Had heard really good things from some native Harlem cats but was a bit disappointed.On the good side the chicken and waffles were as good as I've had anywhere with the waffles being some of the best. The greens were perfect also. The service was polite but almost non existent. Our drinks arrived after 30min and we had already finished our appetizers...and it was sweet tea. How does that happen?The apps were ok and the spring roll was interesting and fun but didn't blow my mind. Mac and cheese was dry and yams a little on the sweet side. The peach cobbler was literally a cup of crust. Which was good but just not a whole cup full. I had to ask for some peaches to be added. Would I go again? For the chicken and waffles, yes and maybe the catfish. If I was looking at a hour plus wait I would probably go head somewhere else. BTW - the owner was there and she was very nice and sweet."
10/9/2017,3 star rating,"Fried chicken was delicious! I would say that overall brunch was good, but the service was slow at best. It took a long time to get drinks and our order. We ordered waffles and chicken, so unsure why it took 45 min. On the flip side, I was there with a group of friends and it was nice to be in a place where we could hear each other and catch up, but it was a little frustrating to wait longer (than normal) for service. Ps - waffles are made from a box, as evidenced when walking past kitchen to bathroom"
12/9/2018,3 star rating,"This was my first time here. I drove from CT was looking to get away from studying. The decor was cool and the music I loved. If your into R and B  you'll really enjoy the sound. So I'm southern breed through and through (Carolinas and down lol) I wasn't to happy with my meal. I had the oxtail with Mac and cheese and collard greens. The Oxtail wasn't cooked long enough, the collard greens had some kind of sweetness added to which it wasn't appealing. The Mac cheese was a no no. It wasn't southern style it was as if all the ingredients was thrown into a pot and then slopped on your plate also the type of cheese used wasn't appealing. Some foods or dishes just shouldn't be altered to make it unique. The lemonade was disgusting might I add."

My four other friends and I were pleasantly surprised even with the coffee we received. I had the sweet potatoes pancakes with white meat and cleared the plate! My friends had a combination of pancakes and chicken and wings. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the environment at the venue. Will definitely come back and recommend others go as well. Service was good not excellent but good. I'll say its because the place was packed and wait staff had a lot going on, nothing to prevent me from coming again."
12/29/2015,5 star rating,"Came here to brunch with a friend and I truly enjoyed myself. Melba's closes after brunch and reopens again for dinner. I got there a little late for brunch but I was accommodated. Loved the atmosphere which was sophisticated. The decor, paintings and low music made me feel right at home. Our waiter was nice and he even gave us suggestions on what to have. I had the fried catfish and cheddar grits and it was delicious. You have to try the cheddar grits!  To drink I had a mimosa and it was delicious. All in all- I will be returning again, to try dinner."
12/1/2015,3 star rating,"I came here with my girlfriend and we had a great time. It is a family-run establishment, and more than anything the service and the vibe are what I liked best about this place. I had the chicken and waffle--the waffle in particular was fantastic, considering I don't love waffles. That being said, Harlem is a hot spot for great comfort food, and there are better places in Harlem.We had dinner, and then 2 hours later went to dinosaur bbq which is the king of soul food in Harlem."
9/29/2019,4 star rating,"Service was good! Shown to our table right away. Took a large group order right away. No appetizers since we had an event to get to, but the food came out with gaps for different people!  The food was very good though, fresh and tasty but not hot.  The waiter forgot my drink order and I had to catch their eye a couple of times to remind them! I ordered a second drink but waiter forgot again and did not bring before we had to leave!  Melba's has expanded since the last time I was there and the extra room made the dining experience more comfortable than in the past. Breakfast and brunch is the best here!"

8/5/2015,4 star rating,"The chicken and waffles here were perfection!  (And they are apparently recipients of some Bobby Flay stamp of approval, if that means something to you.)  I was with one other person, and we split this main dish with four sides: - The spinach, which was light and garlicky goodness.- The collard greens & the peas-n-rice, which were both tasty.- The mac n cheese, traditional and terrific but for the burned bits that felt like shards of uncooked macaroni.Knowing we were splitting everything, the waiter asked the kitchen to bring everything already split, so we got eight little bowls for our sides, and the waffles and chicken in two servings.  Very thoughtful!For dessert, we asked the waiter if Melba's is especially known for anything, and he called out the Peach Melba Cobbler without hesitation.  It's not what you'd expect--it's not a wedge or square of pie, it's more like a  suspension of cookie dough and baked peaches served in a glass cone.  You can get it with a scoop of house-made vanilla on top, which we did, but it was a bit tricky because digging into the ice cream caused the whole cup to overflow, spilling the peachy goodness.  I'd say skip the scoop, the dish was swell without it.A live band plays here sometimes (I think every Tuesday night?) -- when I was here, it was the Swagger Band, fronted by Jeanetta, whose name I hope I'm spelling correctly.  They kicked in around 8:30pm, playing a mix of funk and songs like Everything is Everything, some Sade, some Mary J Blige.  It was too loud for the space, but hard to dislike.The space is small but not cramped, dim but not dark, and full of families, couples, and larger groups of friends.  And the bill was surprising inexpensive.  Only $7 for desserts, $14 for the renowned chicken waffles, and $4-5 for sides."
11/23/2015,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I went here last Saturday, and we had a great time. While we did make a late-night trip to Dinosaur BBQ a few hours later, the portions were yummy and well-sized. The fish and chips (my order) was filling but not as fried as your standard iteration on this dish and the eggnog waffles were some of the best I've had. There was also a wide variety of cocktails, and the bartender was willing to make cocktails that were not on the menu.Most important, the entire staff was extremely respectful and gracious. Dirt from someone's shoe transferred onto my boyfriend's coat and one of the waiters insisted on wiping it off. Not necessary, but very thoughtful."
5/17/2019,1 star rating,"I did not get to actually eat in the restaurant. My mother and I was almost knocked down by someone that rushed to the door as we tried to enter, informing us that they do not open until 5:00pm.  It was then 4:35.   I thought it was very rude and unprofessional to have an elderly woman with a cane stand outside of your establishment especially when it looked as if it was about to rain...As a corner table would have been sufficient until it opened.  You have now lost two customers!  Unfortunately I could not leave 0 stars because that would be my rating of the establishment!"
8/1/2013,4 star rating,"This place is tiny, so be sure to have a reservation and dont be late. Initially the service was slow, but then it changed. Maybe because Melba walked out and chatted with us. She even touched my shoulder..*swoons*The food was amazing and worth the wait, I got the beef rib, spinach, and yams. I tasted the catfish and mashed potatoes and both were very good also. I maybe an alcoholic because my friends said the drinks were strong, I didnt think they were. However, they were tasty! I ordered The Harlem Iced Tea. My lily livered friends ordered the Lust in Paradise and White Sangria which I finished for them.I'll be back!!!! The server was a thin woman with brown eyes, she was a hoot!!Sidenote, replace those big chandeliers with even larger ceiling fans, it was HOT!"
8/27/2015,2 star rating,"Let me start off by saying I am from the south.  I went to Melba's because of it's high ratings, of course, but I should've thought better about getting southern food up north.  It was an ok attempt at doing southern food, but it doesn't hold even a tea light next to true southern cooking.  It may be good to people who aren't from the south, but it did not make my taste buds jump.  The chicken was dry and my friend didn't enjoy her catfish.  For what you got it really wasn't that inexpensive like people kept saying. We were happy to quickly grab up seats at the bar because the restaurant is super tiny and she said it would be over an hour wait.  The service was okay.  It was just an experience that this southern girl could've done without on my trip to NYC."
7/19/2018,3 star rating,"It's OK. If you are too lazy to cook and want a meal that feels like home cooking this is your joint. It's close by, so I order from here fairly frequently, but would I tell an out-of-town visitor that then *need* to try this place? No.I will say its a little pricey for the flavor, but I'm not going to stop ordering from here."
4/8/2018,5 star rating,Great southern style place in Harlem !! Loved food. Good quality. Check this place out. Mac and cheese is amazing also.
9/2/2016,5 star rating,"A very cute, cozy place. The music playlist was amazing!!! The service was good too. Server checked in and was attentive. I ordered the chicken wings ans waffle with strawberry butter. My friends ordered fried shrimp with greens, Mac and cheese, candied yams and rice. The greens were amazing and I haven't always been a greens fan! The candied yams just warmed my soul with each bite. I could eat them everyday!! The waffle was light and fluffy perfection. I did not try the mac but both my friends said it was flavorful and delicious. I will definitley go back. If you are looking for good soul food with that homemade taste this is the place for you!"
5/24/2014,4 star rating,"What a lovely place to go for lunch with a good friend. The fried chicken was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the waffle, biscuit and my friend  really enjoyed her sweet potato pancakes.  The fruit salad was delicious as was the coffee. The place is small which makes it feel very cozy. The staff was wonderful. No pressure and was well attended to throughout the meal.  The prices are par for the area.  My only complaint was the bathroom. I enjoyed the tiles but the toilet was very low to the ground and the seat was not stationary.  The metallic stainless steel sink was reminiscent of being on an Amtrak train or airplane. Happy there was ample hand soap and paper towels.Lastly,  the red velvet cake was a little undercooked but had very delicious frosting."

9/10/2018,2 star rating,"Glancing into the entrance the main room looked inviting! However our large party with a reservation was placed in the back room. We were grateful they seated us early! That was kind. The table was actually a long plastic card table with a soiled black fabric table cloth over it. It was pretty disgusting that the table cloth couldn't be replaced with a fresh clean one. Food: Our party all ordered cocktails at the same time as placing our food order. Surprisingly the food came out FIRST! Unfortunately, the rapidness of receiving the food came at the cost of the temperature. The oxtails were ice cold. Obviously they had been refrigerated but not properly reheated. I found two hairs in the Mac & Cheese. Cocktails: I've never had a worse cocktail. It was a classic cocktail that doesn't require much expertise to execute. Loved the music! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."
4/21/2019,4 star rating,"Melba's is G00D Money w/me, point blank period!!! After A Looonnnnggg 4/20 day in GYALhattan TRYING to find parking in order to attend the International Auto show @Jacob Javits, I was beyond Hungry and wanted something good to eat and from somewhere nice. Considered shooting to Bk, but after A few minutes, we decided to head uptown and check out Cove lounge, cause The Lady, wanted chicken & waffles and the red velvet interested her. As we got to Harlem, I inquired about Melba's, drove that way and directly across the street A vehicle was moving, which allowed INSTANT parking!!!!!! You can't beat that with A Bat!!!!! Once inside, we were seated immediately, it's A small Intimate, establishment, with many paintings adorning the walls. Music playing, but not too loud, where, it's impossible to have A conversation while dining and the lighting allows you to comfortably view the menu. The bathroom is well kept. As far as the main reason we attend Restaurants, The F00D....... I considered the salmon, but them rib(S) were calling me, so I asked the server about the portions and he assured me it was A Hearty amount, w/that said I ordered the ribs with candy yams, rice and peas and A  Guinness stout. My Lady ordered her waffle and chicken wings, she clearly enjoyed the waffles not so much the chicken as she gave me A piece and indeed it was kind of dry.  As for my meal.........piping HOT and Delicious!!! As well as A pretty nice amount, I was not the least bit upset. I WANTED the PEACH COBBLER for dessert, but we decided to leave. I Definitely plan to return and test out that cobbler. Melba's is A G0!!!!!!!! 3.3/4 STAR(S)"

10/15/2017,5 star rating,So my wife and I decided to do a little Sunday night date night at Melba's. I was a little hesitant bc all the soul food I have been getting in Harlem has been leaving a lot to be desired but not this place first off the hostess I didn't get her name but she was very welcoming and sweet she even went around and checked on everybody as we ate which I enjoyed very much. Now on to the food the spring rolls were great I almost ordered some to go but I didn't want to be super greedy lol. The Macaroni and cheese is freaking amazing I loved it best I've had in a long time. I also really enjoyed my potato salad and chicken. My wife had the egg nog waffle and fish which she said was great as well. Overall I really enjoyed Melba's and we will definitely be back.

8/31/2018,3 star rating,"Sooooooooooo I was there celebrating my sisters birthday August 29, 2018. Let's go one thing at a time. I love this place let's keep this in mind.. Ready? Okay it was 8 of us 4 adults and 4 kids and we we're hungry. We walk in and they seat us in one section that was slightly quiet and then we were asked if we would like to move where we could sit comfortably. We agree and don't know what we had in store... MIND YOU IT IS HOT AS HELL OUTSIDE; since we we're placed by the door we didn't get any air conditioner.. SO PISSED.... Now it's time to order - I ordered catfish, spinach, mac & cheese, potato salad and a half & half with smiles and everyone else orders their food. About 20 minutes or so the waiter comes and gives us all the wrong food so we had to exchange plates and he didn't care a bit he just walks off. As I go and try and enjoy my food as sweat dripped down my face the mac & cheese was dry and looked horrid, the catfish was salty as ever and my half & half was not what it was suppose to be. We are all annoyed by the service and the food at this point. I call the waitress that has been missing since she took the orders and ask why is it so hot she explains again it is because we are sitting by the door and everything is moving slow because it's a big party next door. POOR EXCUSE..... The best thing I ordered was the peach cobbler... OMG... Can we say YUMMY..... Best I've ever tasted..."

8/24/2019,2 star rating,"We went back to Melba's on a Friday night to celebrate my husband's birthday which we noted on our reservation.  We waited 30 minutes for our ice tea and then asked 3 more times for it before saying just cancel the tea. It's coming was the standard waiter's response. The catfish dinner and sliders were a solid 3 or 4 stars, but the birthday went unacknowledged so we left and had dessert elsewhere.  Oh yea....it was Harlem Restaurant Week, but I guess that means just order from the menu at regular pricing.  There were no specials or combos as with New York Restaurant week.  Overall, a disappointment and we won't be back."
10/27/2019,5 star rating,I'm from the south and I love soul food. MELBAS never disappoints. The food is seasoned and delicious! I bring all of my friends here because the staff makes you feel like you're at a good relative home for dinner! The sweet potatoe pie AMAZING! The OXTAILS yes lord! So good!

7/21/2019,2 star rating,Please tell me how this place has 4 stars on yelp? First impression walking in was not good...it just did not have a clean vibe. The food was not the best either....it just did not taste fresh nor was it good...PERIOD! I had the fried chicken and that was ok but the pancakes were not. My husband had the salmon croquettes that tasted fishy and overly breaded at the same time...bottom line they just weren't good.  The home fries were far from crispy and fresh too.  I rarely leave bad reviews for a place but this was just not the best culinary experience as i was hoping per the great Yelp rating.
5/26/2015,5 star rating,Best meal I had all year! Excellent service also- will be going back. I had the catfish with Mac and yams. Catfish was fried to perfection and the Mac and cheese was to die for. Yams were sweet and savory! Go for a little piece of south in the city!
6/22/2013,5 star rating,"Went with the family to Melba's for the first time. I had the Southern catfish with collard greens and the trés mac and cheese. It was...phenominal. All were delicious with generous helpings. The staff was so friendly and the atmosphere was contemporary and chic. My only complaint was that the music was a bit loud for such a small space. And it is small, so I suggest a reservation.  Or you can wait at the bar. I didn't try any drinks but I can't wait to return and do so."
12/4/2015,5 star rating,"My first time here and I loved it! I had the catfish and eggnog waffles...pretty good! ! My boyfriend had the turkey meatloaf w/ collard greens and mac n cheese. The turkey meatloaf was good but the sides were amazing!! Coming from a family of comfort food cooks, I was blown away by the greens and mac and cheese.  I'm the greedy girlfriend so I sampled everything no complaints. The service was amazing everyone was welcoming as soon as we walked in the door. The servers were extremely courteous. The size of the restaurant is small but it wasn't a tight uncomfortable space, nice and cozy. The heating,lighting and music was good. I do wish the music was a little bit more up to date, but overall it was a great experience and another go to hot spot."
5/9/2015,5 star rating,Oh dear.... I want to give it 1 star because now I will never have any money and there goes my waistline. The food was delicious.  The service was impeccable.  Get the fried chicken and pancakes with a side of bacon.  Start your weekend right!

5/8/2015,3 star rating,"So the lesson learned is: don't come on Friday at the height of dinner time. But otherwise, our meal at Melba's was delicious!My husband and I drove in from CT to join my family for my father's birthday dinner at Melba's. We arrive just before them, and after some initial confusion over the reservation (under ""Big Papa's Birthday"" - because I totally would've known that, Dad *insert sarcasm*) are seated at one of the window tables - clearly the best seats in the house. The place is tiny and cramped, especially with full tables/bar of diners, which also makes it LOUD. You can't have a conversation with anyone at your table without shouting, which honestly was unpleasant and caused my father to pretty much not talk at all.Our waiter was very nice, took drink orders after getting us water and left us with the menu. Everyone was pleased with their beverages, especially the mojitos. We shared the catfish strips and pulled shortribs sliders to start; the strips are quite good, crispy batter-fried with a light batter akin to tempura, and a tasty aioli sauce. The sliders were...teeny tiny. I mean, they are legit bite-size, and two per order. The kitchen and waitstaff seemed to be having difficulty with the packed dining room, but our entrees finally arrived and the food is really good. My dad allowed me a taste of their eggnog waffles and fried chicken (delicious, some of the best waffles I've had, but sweeter than most) and his side of mac 'n cheese (good cheese combo, creamy). My pan seared chilean seabass was delectable, they cooked it perfectly (portion was so small, but maybe I'm being greedy) - although I regret getting the potato salad, my sister's description didn't quite match my expectation. My husband also had the fried chicken, although he wished there had been more meat on his plate. The pecan crusted tilapia was also fabulous, as were the collard greens - and boy are those yams SWEET! The one issue we had was how freaking long it took for us to leave. My dad was the only one who wanted coffee, so we waited...and waited...and I eyed the large crowd waiting for seats...and waited...and as my mom got up to find someone and ask for the check, his coffee arrived. 20 minutes. As he drank, my mom paid and we gathered ourselves to go home for the cake I made. My parents have been to dinner at an earlier time during the week and didn't experience any issues, so it must be the weekend where you have noise and longer waiting times for everything. Make sure you have a reservation if you're dining here!"
7/5/2018,5 star rating,"I Came from Dc and had a list of restaurants to go to.  Melba's was everything I hoped it would be. We had Ox tails, mashed potato's, greens, mac and cheese, chicken and and waffles. EVERYTHING was good. You know you get it right if the macaroni and cheese reminds you of Thanksgiving. A side note, the music and staff were also awesome."
1/29/2018,5 star rating,"Soul food at its finest. Location was in the heart of Harlem, close to shops and places to visit just in case you find there is a wait (they do take reservations!). Very friendly hostess and waiters, attentive with warm personalities. A variety of entrees to choose from: we got the vegetarian spring rolls with dipping sauce which was delicious!; fried chicken/garlic mashed/collard greens were fantastic as well! No triple layer chocolate cake available but no loss there.. we got the peach cobbler with a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top and were NOT disappointed! Great music, ambiance, and overall character at Melba's."
7/30/2018,4 star rating,"The food is in point! I went there with my son and we got for starters Buffalo wings & fried shrimp. The shrimp was good I didn't taste the wings but, my son said it was good. For our meal he got the fried chicken with Mac& cheese and he loved it. I got fried catfish with yams, potato salad and collard greens. It was soo good! For desert I got sweet potato pie. I gave them a 4 star instead of a 5 Star because they only give you 1 piece of chicken and fish. The place was nice and clean and I will be back!"
1/20/2019,3 star rating,"Stopped into Melba's late Saturday night after celebrating my cousin's birthday at Paint N'Pour just a block down. (Paint N'Pour was fantastic by the way.)We were a party of 9 and they seated us immediately upon entering. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed. We were greeted by a smiling hostess and escorted to our section. Our waiter, Falou, was absolutely amazing! He was humble, gracious, hospitable, and mostly patient. Now, the food: 8/9 of us had never heard of Melba's, but a quick glance at Yelp solidified our decision to get some Southern comfort food before returning home, after a great night out. We immediately ordered drinks and appetizers. I can't comment on the drinks, as I don't partake but nobody complained about them. Appetizers: Calamari was great. Wings were great. My boyfriend said the sliders were perfect. The crab cakes were a hit for the group. The little catfish bites were good. Entrees: Here's where it gets tricky. My cousin and I ordered the wine short ribs, Mac and cheese, and collard greens. The beef was tender and nice, not amazingly seasoned. The Mac and cheese was bland and ""gucky."" That's the best I can do to describe it. We had to send the collard greens back because they were sweet yet tasteless. There was no hint of seasoning nor was there a hint of Smoked meat. They were just cut collard leaves cooked down and sweetened. I tasted my friend's spinach and it was garlicky and nice so I asked the waiter to swap out the collards for the spinach. He kindly did. We had to put the collards on separate plates to send back to the kitchen and then they sent out the spinach. Weird, but okay. Sadly, the spinach we received did not taste as garlicky and good. No consistency. Two orders of chicken and waffles were eaten by others in the party. They commented that the chicken and waffles were just ""okay"" and enough to satisfy their hunger. That's it. Everyone else ordered either the catfish dinner (my friend thought the catfish was salty) or the crab cakes dinner. The group consensus was that the crab cakes were delicious! Why only three stars?1. The prices did not match the quality of the food. Melba's is overpriced and the food is underwhelming. 2. The kicker: As we were leaving, some other patrons began conversing with the birthday girl. The restaurant was closing at this point and everyone was lightheartedly chatting while putting on their coats and gathering their things. We mentioned that it was my cousin's birthday and there was a joyous ""ayeeee"" from the patrons and members of our party. Someone suggested giving my cousin a free shot of alcohol in celebration. So a couple of the waiters and the bar staff gave a look of confirmation. A waiter said, ""wait, let me just make sure it's okay."" He turned to ask a man who appeared to be the manager, maybe part owner, who knows. With his spectacles sitting on the bridge of his nose, and with a look of slight annoyance, or disgust, he shook his head and pensively said, ""No!"" Everyone, everyone, in an awkward silence, looked at each other and kind of ""okayed"" it away. He walked off and sat down. This was truly off putting. We had already paid the tab and tipped our waiter well. It was the end of a joyous night and everyone was in a celebratory mood, including the staff. The assumed manager was a negative! We will not be returning to Melba's, not because he turned down the free shot, but because his negative disposition left a bad taste in everyone's mouth (pun intended). Customer service is what keeps patrons coming especially when the food is mediocre at best. Side note: I remember going to Cannoli King in Little Italy for my birthday. On our way out, the owner (who we didn't know was the owner initially) overheard that it was my birthday. He made it a big deal to other patrons by saying, ""aaaaye, Happy Birthday!"" He offered us a free dessert but we were on our way out. He said,""Make sure you come back, ask for me, and we'll give you your birthday dessert."" That's hospitality! That's customer service. We didn't ""need"" the free offer, it was the feeling of being an appreciated patron. To wrap up this long review lol, I'm sorry to say, Melba we won't be returning. There's really no reason to. But, I must reiterate, our waiter was fantastic and the bar staff was just at great!"
7/20/2014,5 star rating,"Usually I try to use a great, good, bad form to my reviews, but there is no bad to talk about. Melba's has an upscale look to it with a hometown family feel to it. The service is extremely friendly and very helpful in terms of recommendations on what to eat. After we sat down for brunch, we were offered complimentary raisin biscuits. They were outstanding. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. To drink we had the mango mimosas which were very good but a bit pricy. (Literally the only negative about our experience)As for the main course, I had the famous chicken and waffles. Simply amazing. The portion was generous and the flavor was excellent. However, the star of the meal were the sweet potato pancakes the gf had. The serving of 2 extremely fluffy is more than enough, and with a hint of cinnamon, these pancakes were easily the best either of us had ever eaten. Simply enough, this was one of the best brunches we have ever had and absolutely worth planning your day around."

We tried to get a reservation earlier in the day but their reservations were all booked, so if you want a table on a busy night I would recommend making a reservation a couple days in advance. My friend and I sat at the bar. To start, we ordered the calamari and split the eggnog waffle w/ strawberry butter. Both of these were very good, but the waffle stands out especially. It was thick and spongy and a little sweet. For my main meal, I got the walnut-encrusted tilapia with a side of spinach and mac & cheese. The tilapia was pretty bland; I finished maybe a fourth of it. The spinach was just normal, nothing special. The mac & cheese was pretty good, but I also think it's pretty hard to screw up mac & cheese. To me, the food was just OK, with the exception of the waffle, which was delicious. I am also not a huge fan of Southern/American food, so this could have biased my opinion.What stood out to me was the service. The bartender was really great and answered all our questions about the menu and was very attentive. Would I come back? Probably not, but Southern food is also not my favorite type of cuisine."

2/20/2016,5 star rating,"Melba's gives me the perfect feel of southern cuisine in a northern, chic environment. The Mac and cheese is to die for. It's perfection. Their catfish is also great. The drinks are as well!"
12/9/2015,4 star rating,"My only experience with ""Southern Comfort Food"" is through watching Chopped. So I was kind of intimidated by Melba's weeknight crowds and jazz music that pours out its doors every other night. But I eventually went for dinner on a Thursday night and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered fried catfish with collard greens... what else would I order. I wanted to order a beer but didn't, which I regret. The food was delicious! I don't know how they infuse so much salty flavor into it, really. It can't be healthy, but it's really tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. Even though my friend and I were the only white people there at the time, I didn't feel out of place. Great authentic Harlem feel, excellent food. Atmosphere is casual and diner like."
7/31/2015,4 star rating,Reservations at 9pm - and quickly seated. Definitely make a reservation as they have a limited amout of seats. Only downside - they ran out of white meat chicken by the time we arrived... I went with the Waffles + Chicken - see how they beat Bobby Flay in the throw down!! The eggnog waffle is such a nice surprise! Adds just enough sweetness to each bite.
2/27/2019,1 star rating,"So far so terrible. I'm here by myself and I sat for a minute (long time) waiting for a server WHO when told by the bartender I'm waiting for her did nothing to acknowledge me. Thereafter she continued to ""take an order on the phone"" while I'm in person feeling famished! I'm not too sure of how they operate but that's extremely unprofessional. The manager quickly came to her defense and instead of rectifying the situation and getting my order in, he explained her carelessness. It's unfortunate, Black businesses in their mistreatment of its clients! Plus the food wasn't great. A fool for staying indeed !"
1/4/2016,4 star rating,"This place is legit. This is what 'street bird'on 116 & 8th ave. is trying to be (and failing miserably)Great music, not to loud to have a conversation. Polite staff and great fried chicken and waffles."
9/20/2018,5 star rating,"The food was amazing! I ordered the following for delivery: The potato salad, yams, Mac and cheese! The fried chicken and Shrimp was cooked to perfection. The waffle arrived a little soggy, but overall my new favorite soul food spot!"
5/11/2017,5 star rating,"Let's discuss this amazing place. I had oxtails, cabbage and collards. For some reason most places give you just enough oxtails Melba's had no shame there was more than enough to go around and my plate had a plenty. I honestly could not eat everything and yet I was tempted to snack on everyone else's plate. My two friends ordered the smothered pork chop and the smothered chicken. The drinks we're okay, nothing too fancy and I'm sure because I can't remember the name of the drink that I ordered. Next time I'll just order wine or something ... Overall this place deserves an A in my book. Food, crowd and service = A!"
6/15/2016,5 star rating,"This was honestly the best meal I've ever had in my life, so freaking delicious! I couldn't even speak the whole time I was eating because it was that good. I purposely ate slowly, so I could savor the food! Ugh! It's a bit pricey and little long wait but I promise you you will not regret it!!!!"
6/6/2018,5 star rating,Came here and had the eggnog waffles and smothered chicken. Delicious! Would come back here again.

7/3/2018,4 star rating,"Why isn't there any good soul food in Boston ? My guess is because outside of the south( I see you Virginia ) it's in Harlem, New York. Melba's is amazingly good. The service is great and the food is better. I'm a fat butt ( and super picky)if I say so trust that it is."
4/10/2015,5 star rating,"Goodness gracious! Melba's is the place to be if you want some truly amazing chicken and waffles.If you love chicken and waffles, go here immediately.If you're never had chicken and waffles, go here immediately.If you hate chicken and waffles, go here immediately and have your mind changed. The chicken is moist, and the waffles are crispy. The flavors mix in such a way that you feel as though you have left your body and gone to some new plane of existence, a plane where the world tastes better. Go to Melba's. I don't know how many other ways I can say it. Just go. Eat chicken and waffles there."
2/6/2013,4 star rating,"When I heard fried chicken and waffles, I envisioned a Roscoes Chicken and Waffles joint with food haphazardly served to you on newspapers. What I instead found was a nice dimly lit restaurant that was featured on the Food Network. // LOCATION // Lower edge of Harlem a few blocks from the 110 subway stop// SERVICE // Great service although it was very slow. It took a long time for food for our entire party of 5 to be brought out // FOOD // The food was definitely on the pricier side for chicken and waffles, but everything was very tasty      + Southern Fried Chicken with Eggnog Waffles: The chicken was crunchy on the outside and very juicy on the side. The waffles were moist and sweet although I wish they were bigger. They were on the softer side so those of you who like crunchier waffles probably would not be a fan     + Chili onion rings: The onion rings are not covered in chili but instead have a bit of chili powder mixed in to the batter. They are gigantic and tasty      + Tres mac and cheese: Delish, creamy, and incredibly heavy     + Sauteed spinach: A slightly healthier option on the menu that was tasty as well      + Sweet potato pie: Meh, I could do without this next time, there was no wow factor      + Red velvet cake: Beautiful layered red velvet cake that was rich and moist"
10/11/2015,3 star rating,"I went for a late dinner on a Saturday night (9:30 pm) and got right in, which was nice because usually there is a lengthy wait here. I had a glass of wine and my date had a beer, mostly because the special drinks were pricey, although they looked delicious. I had the fried catfish with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese (why not splurge?) and it was delicious. It was a big portion so I brought half home. My date had the chicken and waffles which were also very tasty. I really liked the strawberry butter with the waffles. Although the food was delicious, the service makes me rate this place a 3. Our waters went unfilled for over half the meal and we waited 15 minutes before the server would come so we could get our bill. Once he delivered the bill, we immediately out a credit card inside and placed it on the edge of the table. 10 minutes later, he came to get it. He was very kind, but very slow and inattentive considering the restaurant was not busy, or even full for that matter.I want to come back for the food, but will probably come when I have plenty of time and patience to spare."
9/7/2015,3 star rating,"Been here twice and not sure if I'll go back. Both times I went, I ordered the chicken with buttermilk waffles. The dish is ok, the one thing I clearly remember is the strawberry butter... but the service could be better. The wait times are long.. and the second time, the hostess was a mess, giving my friend an attitude for checking on the wait time."
7/14/2017,2 star rating,"Born and raised in NYC. I moved to LA 4 years ago and when I came to visit last week I was adamant about going to Melba's with a group of friends. Kudos on the expansion but the food has changed and not for the better. More vegetarian options are needed and that portobello mess with one slice of mozzarella cheese, drowned in balsamic vinaigrette needs to be revamped. I enjoyed the mac and cheese but the yams were souless, tasteless, and floating in juice. The service was lackluster, as we were often searching for our server. I love my people but we've got to do better. The music was a nice touch but if you're on a bad date the absurd volume is perfect lol..."
9/3/2017,4 star rating,"First time eating here, but the food was delicious and service was phenomenal , everybody was so professional and super, super friendly, highly recommend if you are ever in the part of town, the crab cakes were scrumptious ."
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Aw man, this place is da bomb! I'm going to start with the service. Way above average and made sure we were taken care of, even when passed off to another staff everything stayed smooth. The music playing was good. The live music even better. AND THE FOOD, the food y'all was so good, my left eye teared up. I kid you not. Highly recommend."
3/27/2017,3 star rating,"Went here with a friend for our quarterly catch up....she wanted to dine in Harlem and I hadn't been uptown in a while. People from my office crave about the place so we gave it a go....my girlfriend tried to make reservations but there was no one to pickup the phone and an answering machine was nonexistent.....Still we decided to continue with our plans! Got there about 6:30pm and the tiny place was packed....did manage to get a table rather quickly however....the waiter was very attentive and let us take our time although the place was indeed crowded....we both ordered dark meat fried chicken...surprisingly we both got very small portions....collards, potato salad, spinach and rice & peas rounded out our meals....chicken was ok but wasn't seasoned much....we both had to use salt and pepper.  My collards and potato salad made up for the chicken. My girlfriend's spinach and rice & peas were just okay...since we were still hungry, dessert was next....OMG happiness finally......the coconut layer cake the pound cake were fabulous....actually served warm!!Overall just okay dining in Harlem"
6/18/2018,4 star rating,I celebrated my birthday this past Saturday at Melba's and was not disappointed at all. When we arrived our table for 11 was awaiting us and our great server Fallou was there to greet us. Everything from the drinks to the appetizers were on point and enjoyed by all. The meals for dinner like the oxtails and fried catfish was cooked to perfection. This was maybe my 4th time there but for sure it won't be my last. Also glad to see the expansion of the place it looks good. The manager Brian Jean was very helpful also to me and my guest.
3/10/2019,5 star rating,"(4.5) solid comfort food while not being too heavy and amazing service. restaurant definitely exudes a lot of history and culture behind it and it was a generally very pleasant dining experience  stop by if youre in the neighborhood, not necessarily worth the trip if you arent though"
8/16/2014,4 star rating,Another local spot in Harlem that's pretty cozy (about 15 small tables super close to each other & bar seating) but offers great comfort food. The host was super nice and even made us laugh before we sat down at our table (no wait surprisingly!) Place is not good for groups bigger than 6 and it can get quite loud since the small room gets packed for dinner.The food here is delicious. I got the catfish with mac&cheese (yum) and rice&peas (ok) and my friend got the braised short ribs with collard greens and candied yams (so good!). I took off a star because our entrees came out before our appetizer and my friend's sides were not what was ordered but so tasty (so getting that dish next time!!) Also had Melba's hit iced tea and it was strong but refreshing. There was no room for dessert as we were so stuffed (great portions). I will def come back to try the red velvet cake and the eggnog waffles that literally the whole restaurant ordered (my friends have told me it's epic). Reasonable prices and even better soul food so you should def stop by if you are in the area.
6/15/2018,4 star rating,We went to Melba's to have their chicken and waffles after we heard the food network featured them! They weren't as delicious as I'd hoped they'd be but they were good. The coffee was delicious though and their music was on point! The atmosphere and extremely friendly wait staff made up for the mediocre meal. Will be back again to try their dinner menu!
4/18/2016,3 star rating,"Visited on a Sunday for brunch. The staff is very nice and friendly but it seems like they are short-staffed and everything takes a long time to come out. We had a reservation for 12:30pm on a Sunday but arrived about 20 mins later because of traffic. We called ahead and the manager was very very nice and held our table for us. I really appreciated that because he definitely didn't have to. The wait staff was very slow. We ordered a round of mango mimosas and our food came out before our drinks did. The biscuits are delicious. I had the southern fried chicken wings and eggnog waffles. The chicken was good and flavorful. The waffles were suburb... I just wish there was some kind of special syrup to compliment the eggnog flavor better. The mimosas barely had any champagne in them and at $9/each, that sucked. The food was great, but the service left a little to be desired. I would go back, but only if there was some kind of bottomless mimosa special."
4/29/2017,5 star rating,"Melba's was recommended to me by a co-worker and i cant wait to see her to thank her. I took my close friend just to treat her because i know she like soul food. The Harlem HIT iced tea was nice and strong. The spring rolls were good and the sauce it came with was wonderful. I ordered the Charleston jumbo shrimp and opted for the deep fried with the mac and cheese and sautéed spinach, i wasn't a fan of the spinach and i usually love spinach, however it was better when i added some salt. My friend ordered the fried catfish with mac and cheese, yams and sautéed spinach. I tasted her yams and they were lovely. Service was great, we had Vilo and he was attentive and pleasant. Overall we enjoyed it. Cant wait to go back and try the eggnog waffles and fried chicken."
6/9/2019,4 star rating,"Absolutely love the food. I've ordered take out and also sat in for dinner without a reservation be mindful that the restaurant has two separate sides, one for reservations and one for walk ins. Either one is okay food is great regardless. Would be a 5 star but the food doesn't ever come out hot which is a bummer when dinning in."
7/10/2017,4 star rating,"This past Sunday was my first time here and I enjoyed every bit of it minus the alcoholic mixed drinks which was kind of weak. However, the catfish and waffles was delicious.  Great southern comfort food and great atmosphere.I would love to come back for dinner."
10/16/2017,5 star rating,"Went here on a quiet Sunday eve with a couple of friends in from Australia and thought they would enjoy trying soul food. While the menu looked really great, we all ended up getting chicken and waffles since they had never had it and I can't resist. In the end, this was the right choice as it was super delicious. The chicken was perfectly done and the eggnog waffles were a real hit because they were super light and had a hint of spices.I can't forget to mention that our server was so nice and super friendly! In fact, since we had stayed so late, we ended up talking with the staff who were also so welcoming and really made the experience. Also, I really loved the contemporary decor, which made it a good choice to take out-of-towners. Not to mention, I'm looking forward to coming back again soon on my own!"

5/7/2018,4 star rating,"Solid soul food joint. Had the chicken and waffles (excellent) and the catfish (good). Mac 'n cheese is okay, I've had better but it gets the job done. Good service, nice ambiance."
3/14/2018,4 star rating,"Update: I ordered delivery from Melba's and it was RADICALLY different from what I usually get. The meatloaf tasted like it was made with a different type of (gross) meat entirely, and the Mac and cheese was bland and disappointing. I hope this won't happen when I go back in person, but I am never going to order delivery again."
1/15/2018,5 star rating,"Good LORD was this place good.Super friendly service, phenomenal turkey meatloaf, flavorful juicy collard greens and the mac n' cheese is to DIE for. Everything melted in my mouth and I nearly passed out from the awesome. I tried my friend's waffle, and it too was amazing.Decor is understated and nice, restaurant is relatively quiet (you can hear your table neighbor). Dinner time is pretty packed, it seems.I'll be back as soon as I've shed my Trump 20 :-)"
7/29/2018,4 star rating,"I had a friend visiting from out of town who normally can't find this kind of food where she lives, so I was more than happy to take her here as I was pretty confident the experience would be good and I would score some brownie points. What worked well?The food over all was good. We shared a plate of BBQ meat loaf, catfish strips and a few sides (potato salad amazing!).  The not so good comment is for the rice and peas, it was not cooked fully and my first bite contained raw bits.  I thought I'd chipped a tooth until I realized what it was.  That turned me off.The night we went they had live music and the quality of the singers were on point, but if they re going to do that they need to get someone in with a sound board to mix and contain the volume - - it was so loud my friend and I couldn't talk even though we sat in the separate dining room area.What didn't work?Decor.  It's time for a re-do and a facelift folks.  One of my beef's with some of our businesses is they do not take care of the little things.  Like keeping the fixtures, paint, seat cushions and wood things looking well manicured.  The other restaurants in this area are nice, so don't take our food dollars for granted.  Hire a professional interior designer (sorry momma, you gotta sit this one out...)And I didn't understand why their food grade sign was ""Pending"".  All food establishments in NY must let the public know the rating they've rec'd from the department of health.This place has been around for a minute, so that for me was a red flag."
4/25/2017,5 star rating,Great atmosphere and food must go and try their catfish and waffles with that amazing strawberry butter hmm yumm.
4/26/2018,4 star rating,"Got the chicken and waffle for brunch it was really good. The waffle is their famous eggnog waffle so I wished there was more of an eggnog taste, it just tasted like regular waffle but nonetheless good. Good mimosas as well.. waiting for unlimited as an option. Advice: if you looove eggnog like I do, don't get the eggnog waffle you will be disappointed but if you want just a very small hint of flavor go for it with mango mimosa! Would return there!"
4/24/2018,5 star rating,Great food and drinks. I would like bottomless mimosas because their mimosas are actually pretty good. I got the chicken and eggnog waffle (very good but needs a tad bit more eggnog). I would definitely recommend coming here again.
6/18/2019,2 star rating,"I went there on Father's Day. Myself and 2 friends. The service was ok. A few tables were waiting for there food. One table, the lady was visibly upset that her food took so long. Our food came a 1 hr. 37 min. The server apologized. I will still try and visit more places uptown, but this will probably be the last one I try, again."
1/2/2018,4 star rating,"Yesssssss.  Some soul food w friends to kick off this new year!   Hadda take our Brit friend out for some Harlem eats and Melba's was the right place to do it.  Service was friendly and we quickly ordered some apps.  Fried catfish, crab cakes, and a plate of wings that was so good we ordered another plate.   For an entree I got fried chicken w a side of potato salad and Mac and cheese.  Yes, it was carb heavy.  No judgement please. It was also delicious.   The potato salad had the right amount of dressing and a hit of relish which I like.   The Mac and cheese was creamy and decadent.   The chicken was friend to perfection, juicy and it was a large portion which I ended using taking home mostly.   I sampled some oxtail and some collards from m my friends plates and they were delicious too.  We were far too full to try dessert but I'll certainly be back and will make an effort to end on a sweet note."
12/8/2016,3 star rating,"I've heard countless of raving reviews about this restaurant.  I went with a group of friends and we were stoked to try some of this well known ""chicken and waffle"" combo.  I also heard that their strawberry butter was delicious, but I passed on that.   One thing I appreciated about the waiter was when they asked if we wanted white or dark meat when we ordered our combo.  Alas, the meal arrived and it was...ok.  Not a grand-slam-out-the-park experience; just fine. I honestly have tasted better waffles at other venues before (Above restaurant in South Orange, NJ, heck even IHOP the franchise, Toast in Montclair, NJ). The chicken? I mean, it was fried and there was no mistaking that.  It definitely was just made so it was hot and fresh, but having simply a crunchy skinned chicken just doesn't appeal to me to have me screaming from the mountaintop about this food combo.  I believe they have other items on the menu, so if I happen to be in the area next time, I'll give Melba's a try again.  As a matter of fact, we were with a vegan and he ordered homefries with some vegetables and THAT looked delicious, he also loved it and asked the waiter to give a special thanks to the chef/cook who whipped up this special dish from him.  I may actually ask for that if I go next time, but what I know for sure is that I'm not going to order the waffle again.  (shrugs).  Oh as far as decor, venue, and service? Pretty decent."
2/20/2017,5 star rating,"I had the best time ever at Melba's tonight. It was my very first time, and I had a great waiter, Fallou - who after listening to my preferences- he suggested a great drink and then I was confident enough to entrust my entree, sides and second drink recommendation to him! I'm glad I took his advice to try the oxtail, sautéed spinach and mac and cheese because they were flat out amazing! The Harlem Iced tea was strong (just as I like it!). Overall, the service there was great. Another waiter -who wasn't even serving my friend and I - stopped by to check on us. Kudos to Melba and the team on service, food, drinks and ambience..I'm excited about becoming a regular!"
2/18/2017,2 star rating,"UPDATE:I don't know what happened. Overall, the food was extremely bland and did not have that homemade flavor as in the past. The spinach and candied yams tasted as if they came straight from a can. The catfish strips were so salty I couldn't finish them. Even the mac and cheese missed the mark. Where was the cheese?  No one in my party finished their food.My friend ate the catfish strips and immediately started to have an allergic reaction. She's only allergic to tilapia so I don't know how this happened. Luckily another person in our party carries Benadryl with them!Thoroughly disappointed with Melba's. My appetite was not satisfied. They'll be on the back burner for a minute."
12/8/2013,5 star rating,"Excellent food! Party of 3 for dinner, some pros and not so pros. They're not cons b/c they're not that serious.Friday night, no reservation, restaurant was in full swing but we were seated very quickly. Food was DELICIOUS! Caesar salad, catfish, chicken cooked all the way through (yay!), waffles, candied yams to die for, and sauteed spinach like I've never had!Food took forever to come, and I mean FOREVER. There must have been some mix up in the kitchen with our order b/c people seated after us received their food before us. But our server was diligent with checking on in us and offered us complimentry dessert. BINGO! That right there bumps them from 4 stars to 5! Great service!Great music and ambiance, but too darn dark! I wasn't embarassed to use the light on my cel phone to see the menu when I noticed other patrons doing the same. Screw ambiance, I need to be able to see what I'm ordering. They can turn the lights up a tad.Place is small. Nothing they can do about that and it doesn't deter from the great food.Overall, great food and service. I will definitely be a repeat offender here!"
2/17/2017,4 star rating,"Great ambience, great food. Spring rolls were a fun/different starter. Chicken and waffles is obviously the move. Could have taken or left dessert. Funny that they don't serve diet soda. Live music started at 8:30p and was excellent."
2/11/2017,3 star rating,"So this review is more about the service than the food.  In short, I would rate the food three stars.  it was served hot, but the meat portions, in my case the fried chicken, was very disappointing.  I didn't realize that by default they would serve you the breast/wing portion of the chicken without even asking if you would prefer the leg/thigh.  Moving forward, I was served a very small leg/thigh with collards that were full of stems.  The party I was with, we were told that they did not have any diet soft drinks.  How is that possible on a Saturday night and we were the FIRST guest arriving through the door??  I able to taste a piece of the catfish which was very nice and the jumbo shrimp.  Both were well seasoned.  Overall, if you know what good soul food is from your mama, grandma, or auntie..this will be acceptable.  For those who do not know or have ever experienced HOME COOKIN' Soul Food, you may think this is the best thing smoking'.  So either way...as far as food is concerned, I would say it is worth the visit.  Now onto the service...I was very disappointed.  We went for my sister-in-law's birthday dinner.  I could not believe how SLOW the service was!!  When I say slow, I mean appetizers, entree, dessert....TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!  In fact, I didn't even get to have the dessert because I had to leave so I wouldn't miss the train home!  No, it wasn't the kind of slow that is meant to be smooth and relaxing as you move from one part of the meal to another.  This was the kind of slow where you are sighing under your breath and taping your fingers on the table like ""where is our food!""  Overall, this place did not seem like they were prepared to receive guest; almost like they didn't even start cooking until you walked in the door.   The staff was pleasant, but seemed confused and disorganized."
2/11/2017,3 star rating,"Didn't realize that they did not take same day reservations. We got there at 5:30 and still had to wait 20 + minutes for a table. Several large parties. It appears to be a favorite for birthdays. Service was polite but slow. Atmosphere is nice but very noisy. Hard to hear across the table. The food was bland and would have been better had they used a little seasoning. Reasonably priced but not sure we'll go back or bring friends there. On the whole, disappointing."
2/3/2017,4 star rating,"Came here on a date and Melba's did not disappoint. The staff was helpful and personable, and the restaurant has a very friendly, lively, Harlem vibe. Given its reputation and popularity it was still pretty easy to book a table a few days out, but I would definitely recommend doing so. While there weren't a ton of vegetarian options on the menu (drawback for me), my boyfriend was happy as a clam with his chicken and waffles, and both of our desserts were tasty."
2/3/2017,5 star rating,"As a life longer New Yorker, i am not sure why it took me so long to try out Melba""s.  My friend and I arrived pretty close to their closing time (it was packed) but the amazing waiter let us order and sit at the bar! The chicken and waffles were exactly what i would pictured it to be!So Yummy! and the strawberry butter was OUT OF THIS WORLD!Our drinks were also good, and the bartender (male, Hispanic, super cute) was a sweetheart!!DONT DELAY, GO TO MELBA'S TODAY!"
1/27/2017,5 star rating,Amazing food...simply delicious! Went for bday dinner and so glad I decided on this restaurant. Everything we ordered was great. Party in my mother! I can't wait to go back. The staff was super friendly and accomodating.Deinitely recommend.
1/22/2017,4 star rating,"Nice good sized soul food in Harlem. I really liked the chicken and egg nog waffles with white meat. It was a bit dry but was well fried, tasty, and a large portion. The ma and cheese was incredibly cheesy which I thought really worked well. My girlfriend thought the waffles were too heavy.One thing I will say- we arrived about ten minutes before the rest of our party and they wouldn't seat us until everyone had arrived. Given that the restaurant was almost completely empty this seemed kind of stupid."

11/16/2014,5 star rating,"I don't know who Melba is or where she came from, but she needs to run in the next presidential election. Yes- Leader of the Free World. The food, ambience and wait staff were all top notch and the drinks just pushed it over the edge of glory. This was my second visit and this time I opted for the salmon croquettes, home fries and egg nog waffle. Everything was cooked to perfection. The texture and seasoning of the salmon croquettes made me feel like I had eaten the food love child of an old baptist church mother's submission for the church cook off and Bobby Flay. I cannot wait to go back and try something different.Melba for Prez."
12/15/2017,4 star rating,This place was really good. Super cheesy Mac and cheese.  Great atmosphere and the owner Melba is an amazing woman.  I highly recommend this place!

3/6/2016,4 star rating,"This nice and authentic place is one of the best spot for a brunch in Harlem. The service is very attentive and waiters really care about you.Food is fine: especially the fried food: light and well prepared, without too much oil. The fried catfish and the friend chicken (on waffles) really deserve a try. The only ""con"" is on the drink: a part from for types of cocktails there are not many other available alternatives for drink. Some sodas and lemonades (and maybe even a couple of selection beers) would have definitely been a plus. Apart from this, I really recommend this place."
5/19/2015,5 star rating,"I absolutely Love this place!!!!! The food is delicious and always hot. The staff is very kind and happy to serve....... :-) I appreciate good service and great food. The Upside: Quaint and Tasty. The Downside: there will be a wait. What did I order tonight???? Hmm, I had fried catfish nuggets with cheesy & yummy MacNCheese and candied yams. Oh my!!!! #Delish. Followed by a rum punch. Go and indulge but prepare to wait."
12/8/2015,3 star rating,"I'm actually somewhat shocked about some of these reviews because my experience at brunch was FANTASTIC.I went here on a Sunday for my mother's birthday with my siblings and some family friends, six in total. We made a reservation prior and we're seated immediately. We were also greeted by our server (who was really cool, helpful, and funny) immediately! And, to no surprise, the food came within 12 minutes! Amazing! The placed was filled to the brim and it arrived that quickly!! The food? Tasty! The mimosas were refreshing and there was a nice variety of them. I do wish they had unlimited ones, but hey! They offer complimentary biscuits which were just sweet enough and are great if you're starving. The chicken? Yum.  I wouldn't say it beats homemade, but it was good nonetheless. I enjoyed my waffles as well. All in all a great experience! Three stars because while it was enjoyable, I don't find myself eager to return. But recommended all the way."
4/22/2017,5 star rating,1st time in NYC. Was told to make sure I check out Melba's restaurant. Great experience. The host at the door was very friendly. Now as far as the food. I thought I was home in the south. It was Great. Great server also. Sorry I forgot her name but she is originally from Alabama.
3/4/2018,5 star rating,Brunch to me equals chicken and waffles and a mimosa or 10. Melba's elevates the chicken and waffle experience to another level. The eggnog waffle with fried chick is delicious. The waffle is fluffy yet still crunchy. The chicken is so well seasoned I didn't have to add hot sauce to mask the flavors. The strawberry butter elevates the meal to a whole new height. I am in love with this place. The service was great and fast. The manager took time to come out and check on us and others in the restaurant. It wasn't as busy when we got in since we got here so early. For sure I'm coming back on my next trip to the city. If I could I'd give them more than 5 stars. I'd def recommend this to anyone
9/7/2017,5 star rating,"This is the spot. I went there last night and enjoyed the meal. Waiter was great. I had the catfish, mac and cheese, and yams. Slap ya momma good! Drinks were great. Highly recommended."
9/29/2015,3 star rating,"Tried the chicken and waffles and the catfish. Both dishes were good but they have a problem with plating everything together. The chicken came without the waffle, the drinks were served at different times, and the waitstaff, although very pleasant, were not in sync with the kitchen. If the food were spectacular, all of those things could be overlooked. Cash only."
4/8/2017,5 star rating,"Met a nice young lady and her family in Hawaii who was from San Diego. She informed me that she and her best friend were coming to New York on April 1, 2017, and ironically they were staying a block from Melba's.  Went to Melba's on Tuesday, April 4th around 8 PM.  On Tuesday nights there's an awesome band playing and there is also open mic. Well, we were greeted and seated immediately. Destiny was our wonderful waitress who was very gracious and so sufficient. We ordered berry lemonades and the fried calamari as a starter.  I truly love Melba's calamari, I'm a calamari fanatic and she makes the best darn calamari, the BEST!!!   Moses who was the bartender that evening definitely quenched my thirst with his talent that he displays in every cocktail that he creates; and I had quite a few. I ordered the southern fried chicken, white meat only with candied yams and potato salad.  My two guests both ordered the fried catfish with collard greens; one had mac and cheese and the other had candied yams too.  I warned them about the catfish and when they bit into it such pleasure and delight arose across their faces.  They were hollering about the collard greens, saying how delicious they were. Therefore, I ordered a side dish of them and my friends had every right to scream cause they weren't lying those greens were ""singing.""  My chicken was moist and succulent and the crispy skin contained flavor galore, I tasted the herbs and spices in every bite.  As for my potato salad creamy and sensational and those red bell peppers in the mix sweetened the deal.  Candy coated candied yams were perfect nice and sweet the sweetness was not overbearing.  The plate presentation was appealing.  I believe in aesthetics which is visual taste; we taste with our eyes before our palate.  The chef had my fried chicken sitting up high on a pile of yams; it looked so pretty.  I was unable to finish my meal because I was making room for dessert.  One of my guest and me had the sweet potato pie and the other guest had the the peach cobbler which she allowed me to taste.  Both desserts were really good.I will recommend Melba's to anyone.  Great food and music, outstanding mixologist, nice atmosphere, and wonderful customer service.  I haven't been to Melba's in awhile and when I returned I didn't think it was possible but since her expansion the food has gotten even more tasty. Lady Melba of Soul Food I applause you!!!"
8/19/2016,4 star rating,"Quite honestly some of the nicest and welcoming staff I've come across in brusk New York City. Everyone from the server to the bartender to the busboy were just in a jolly good, despite the insufferable heatwave rolling through the city.I ordered the fried chicken with cheese grits and both were delicious. My only complaint is that I could have 'tolerated' more chicken on my plate. Give me fried chicken! Give me all of the fried chicken, Melba's!"
8/3/2017,2 star rating,"I have to say that the food is delicious, the place is load and never try calling. They never answer. I have tried calling for pick up orders a few times over the past 2 weeks and they never pick up. Worth the wait. But annoying."
1/9/2015,5 star rating,"Serviced by Daquan, Attentive and very imformative. Comfortizers: my best friend and i had the catfish and the spring roll which our server recomended. He did not lie; the spring roll is really good my friend who always orders spring rolls really likes it. ""Its better than the Thai spring rolls."" Not a fan of fish but trying catfish for the first time I really like it. It soft and moist and has flavor. A squeeze of lime for zest and its even better paired with chipotel sauce.  We both had the eggnog waffle; she had dark meat and white meat for myself. It was stupendous. Side orders because we were being excessive as always we got, candy yams and Mac and cheese. Great by themselves and together. Did I really forget the strawberry butter!!! Oh it's comes with the waffles but you can order extra. The Venue: it's a tight neat place so if coming with a group, say more than 2-4, reservations are recomended. You will be looking at a 45 min wait, which is worth it if you are willing to wait. There is a bar which you can seat at will ordering drinks until your table(s) is/are ready.#Yelpon"
8/11/2016,4 star rating,Went for back for happy hour. Better max and cheese. Perfect bartenders!Try the rum punch!!!
7/29/2016,3 star rating,"3.5 stars total. The Good- Nice decor, good music, the Catfish strips and the collard greens are GOOD. The bartender's drinks were on point. The Average- Waited a exceptionally long time for a table despite having a reservation. There were 15 of us and we waited over a hour for just water. I know that's a lot of people however- this was booked a while ago. Server was a bit inexperienced and I think he should have had a helper for a party of 15.The Bad- Mac and Cheese was a big disappointment!!! Like tasteless and bland. Save yourself the pain and get anything else...It was a step above boxed Mac and Cheese. Please add something to it.The Worst- One of the bathroom's was stopped up and the smell was atrocious...."
1/13/2015,3 star rating,"Food was delicious, it's just the overall experience that makes me give it 3 stars instead of 4. I honestly didn't know it was that small inside but that wasn't a big deal. What WAS a big deal is that despite the outside awning/door before the actual front door (I don't know what those things are called, forgive me) and despite the big thick, black curtain separating the front door from the dining space, it was really cold in there. Obviously they know it and tried their best but either they need a new heating system or there's some cracks that need to be sealed. Anyway, the service was interesting. We never had one person introduce themselves as our server, rather it was a number of people who did random things. One dropped off the scones, one poured the water, one took our order, another one brought me the teabags for my hot tea, another brought the food out, another one brought us a dessert menu after we ate and someone else brought the check and returned it. None of that was an issue. What WAS an issue was that it took a good 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. It wasn't crowded, we got there shortly after they opened for Sunday brunch. Food came out quick and HOT and like I said above, it was delicious (I had the catfish and eggnog waffles; my companion had the chicken and waffles but said her chicken was overcooked and dried out). The waffles were perfect texture and really good. But, after we ate, we had to flag someone down to take our plates away (which remember the place isn't big). Then we sat for another 10-15 minutes when some random person popped over with dessert menus and tried to convince us to order. Maybe next time as I'd like to go back for dinner eventually."
9/7/2014,3 star rating,"My first time at Melba's. I made a special trip since a friend recommended the Chicken and Waffles. Upon arrival we waited a while before we could even order. The manager was standing in the corner not doing a single thing to help the situation. When we expressed our concern that we were waiting too long to order he simply apologized and said "" that waiter will be there shortly."" Keep in mind that the server was being held up by a customer who decided to have a phone conversation whilst ordering. Instead of the manager being proactive and taking our order himself, he continued to let us wait while occupying his corner. Once the server actually came to us, our experience was pleasant. He was very professional and extremely attentative.  The food was great as well. I had the chicken and eggnog waffle. I ordered white meat and was given dark meat, but no big deal I still ate it, and it was superb. Very flavorful I highly recommend it. As soon as the bill came, without hesitation the manager flew over to the table to take the payment, while we were still eating. He then sent over someone to start clearing our table, once again still not finished eating. Our being as outstanding as he was, apologized.  There is nothing that irks me more than feeling rushed when I eat. Not to mention we were done with our food in less than 20 minutes. It took longer to order than for us to eat. I'm very disappointed in the management of Melba's. It's tough to say if I would ever return.  But hopefully you helpers have a better experience, because the food is delicious."
6/10/2019,4 star rating,"I frequent Melba's quite often. Never disappoints. From the Catfish, Meatloaf, Shrimp, and Mac and cheese to the chicken and waffles. Everything is always tasty. Wait staff is friendly and if you want to have a drink, check out their Sexy Sangria."
2/8/2015,4 star rating,"Food absolutely amazing! The venue is small   So don't go around busy hours because you will probably have a long wait time. Very intimate atmosphere regarding lighting and since it's so small, but it was loud. Service was good. Very accommodating and friendly. The reason it's 4 and not 5 was because I called prior to arriving to ask if there is a wait and the person said I can't assess that until you arrive. Even though I was 5min away and it was a packed upon arrival. So a simple yes or no would have sufficed. Buttt great food. Like finger licking omg it's all gone I want more GOOD!"
7/29/2016,3 star rating,"Cons:The Three stars is for the poor quality distressed tables and chairs that are semi hidden in the dim the light. Its not that dark .I can see those chairs had lots of booty calls . Come on Melbas you know you guys can upgrade those tables and chairs the place is small Its not that many. Also toilet was not flushing Yikes.ProsSuper friendly male bartender professional.Food off the chain delicious Catfish, mac,yamsWill recommend ,disturb by decor quality."
8/23/2015,4 star rating,That was solid fried chicken not overly salty Eggnog waffle was sweet and spicedBacon fat back was smoked n fatty with crispnessThe bartender waiter was awfully slow and incompetent
6/1/2019,2 star rating,"I wanted to enjoy my experience at Melba's but it was very difficult for the following reasons. I was with a party of over 20 people who traveled from Philadelphia, PA. When we arrived the entire table that I was sitting at had silverware that were not clean, as well as dishes and glasses that apparently were not washed but rinsed. All of the appetizer and dinner plates had food residue, greasy thumbprints from the staff which made me very uncomfortable to eat from. I asked for plastic ware and was told they did not have any. The waitstaff brought out cleaner dishes but I had to be carefulnot to select from the top of the pile. When our family style dinner was served, the collard greens were cold and I noticed something strange in my Mac and cheese. I had a piece of plastic wrap in my serving. I immediately brought it to the manager's attention. He started to explain how the restaurant prepares its Mac and cheese dish. In my opinion his explanation was unnecessary. After he gave his explanation, it took him five minutes to decide to offer me another dish of my selection. I then ordered the chicken and waffles, which were good but I did not finish. I would recommend that you bring your own tableware when visiting this restaurant. When I visit Harlem again, Melba's will not be on my list of places to visit. I only gave two stars because the manager attempted to make my eating experience better. I am glad I had the spring roll appetizer or I would have left without eating much."
10/10/2015,4 star rating,I walked into Melba's Friday night with 2 friends. I initially made reservations on Thursday and received a call back Friday afternoon that I may have to wait  an additional 25 minutes before I get seated. I arrived to the restaurant and it was packed! I knew this spot was a hometown favorite. My reservation was for 7:45 pm and my party was seated at 7:50 pm so I was content with the speediness. We were seated and greeted by our nice waitress. She took really good care of us. I ordered the Chicken wings and the egg nog waffles and a side of Mac and cheese. The meal was delicious. I also highly recommend getting their Arnold Palmer. For dessert I had the sweet potato pie which was also delicious.Overall I had an enjoyable experience. The general manager Mike is also amazing. He informed us that the restaurant is in the process of expanding. I thought this was amazing news because it would provide the opportunity for more people to dine at the restaurant. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant
3/14/2017,5 star rating,"There was a wait at Melba's when we showed up at 1:45. Worried about making a flight, the hostess was kind and made sure we were seated quickly. Our waiter, Dequan, was not only polite but was enthusiastic and provided the perfect amount of attentiveness. I ordered the catfish and grits, and my significant other had the eggnog waffle and fried chicken. I'm not a fan of waffles in general, but loved the strawberry butter made me change my mind. He proclaimed that his fried chicken was ""the best he ever had in his whole life."" My catfish was well seasoned, crispy and tender, but the catfish WITH THE GRITS. The grits were fluffy, yet creamy and rich. As I write this, I wish I had some right now! If I'm  looking for friendly service and comfort food, Melba's will definitely be a go-to."
9/6/2017,2 star rating,"The food is good, but I think good food should at least be served on clean plates and cups. My first impression was that this is a nice neighborhood spot. When I sat down to sip my water, it was a bit sweet and when I took more notice, my water looked a bit pink... Like there was previously juice in my cup. When I told the waitress, she made it seem like it was a normal thing... otherwise, food is ok. But there's def better places for chicken and waffles."
10/31/2015,4 star rating,"The food here is very good. I had the chicken and waffles. The food was very fresh, the chicken was fresh out of the fryer. The service is also great."
10/28/2012,5 star rating,"So I was kicking it with a colleague who lives on 108th when we decided we needed to hit a brunch spot in the area. Yelp brought me to Melba's.We casually rolled in around 1:30 on a Saturday and were immediately greeted By the suave guy who runs the place and some soulful music.The decor is amazing - they have this huge oil painting of Marvin Gaye, I was impressed before seeing the menu.The menu was out of this world - being from Atlanta, I was happy. Smothered fried chicken, grits, scones, salmon, French that. Melba's is on point. It's seriously legit. If this place was closer to my apartment, I'd probably become a brunch regular.Toss in a couple Ketel & OJ's and this place was amazing. Music from MJ, Prince, Blackstreet, and Al Green - go here and experience it."
4/27/2017,5 star rating,"I went for my fathers birthday and it was awesome! Short wait and great food. I got the chicken and waffles and it was amazing, the mac and cheese was good too."
12/6/2018,5 star rating,"This is my favorite place to eat in Harlem. The food is consistently good. I love the live band on Tuesdays, I take any visitors I have from out of town and they always have a great time. I've even met a few celebrities in there.  The portions are perfect I even order takeout from here. My faves are the catfish  and the braised ribs."
9/30/2017,3 star rating,"We had the chicken and waffles and an omelette. While the c&w were delicious, the three stars is for the service. I had to get up twice and ask for our food as people who walked in after us finished their meal and walked out. While the staff was apologetic, and while I appreciate that, it spoiled our experience. I wouldn't recommend going here if you are really hungry. :|"
7/16/2017,5 star rating,"Spent the day in Harlem.  This place was recommended by a local in Brooklyn.  We arrived at 5:00 when they opened.  I had catfish, greens, man n cheese, my cousin, salmon, potato salad and rice n beans. We both agreed all were exceptional. Waiter was helpful with suggestions and no rushing. We told to try Melba's first before Rooster by our friend.  Glad we did."
5/9/2019,3 star rating,First of all the waiter was quick to seat us next to the restroom which was totally unacceptable. The floors were greasy. And I have a problem with the kitchen being next to the restroom. The waiter was a little upset when asked to move. Food expensive. Seating is very close & tight. Not kid friendly to me. But there were people waiting to eat after church.
5/8/2019,4 star rating,The ambience was amazing. From the music and chill vibe. I made a reservation got there early in hopes of sitting early but didn't. The host was very very friendly. The food was amazing hands down. The drinks were also very good and I loved the selection. I will definitely visit again.
1/15/2018,5 star rating,"We went here for my B'earthday and I really can't say enough about this restaurant. First off, it was easy to find. Hopped off the subway and walked not even 2 minutes to Melbas. We were greeted by a smiling young man who asked that we wait to be seated by Melba. Her smile alone made me feel special and it's always so awesome when the owner is actually at the establishment. The ambiance of this restaurant puts me in the mindset of how restaurants probably were during the Harlem Renaissance. It is very intimate, lighting is dim in a very good way and everyone seemed to be enjoying conversation, a warm atmosphere and good food. Our waitress was smiling ear to ear as she tended to our table of 2. We had the lemon honey chicken fingers for an appetizer and she returned to our table with it within 5 minutes or so. The appetizers were tasty, thoroughly made and just good. Our entrees came out not even 10 minutes or so later. I enjoyed the southern fried chicken with Mac and cheese and potato salad. I can clearly tell the food was literally made with love, given to me in a timely manner and just really good. Our waitress was very attentive while we ate and our bill was absolutely reasonable. Not only will I be coming back but I will be making this my absolute stop when I am in New York."

6/11/2012,3 star rating,"So...we tried to make a reservation at Melba's.  Their website said to email them.  We did but no one answered.  Next, my husband called them and told them he sent an email which didn't elicit a comment but we did get a reservation.  Later, we realized that no reservation was necessary.Then...we showed up at Melba's on a Friday night shortly before 5 p.m. to find a sign from the Health Department that said ""Grade Pending"".  Okayyyy---now what?  Do we chance it?  Well...a couple of years ago, we ate at a ""Grade Pending"" restaurant and survived, so...let's go for it.We were early and noticed that the front door was propped open.  When we walked in, we told them we had a reservation---and no one cared.  The bartender, who was friendly, took us to a table, gave us menus, then told us that they would take our order at 5 p.m.5 p.m quickly arrived as did our waiter, Seth.  He, too, was very friendly.  Since we had plenty of time to look at the menu, we knew what we wanted.  I started with a ""Sexy Sangria"" which consisted of red wine and triple sec.  Dang!  That was one strong drink!  One third of the way through the drink, I was loopy LOL!  My husband did the smart thing and had a glass of Chardonnay which he said was good quality.For my main course, I had the fried chicken and egg nog waffles.  One version came with strawberry butter.  I don't care for strawberries so I ordered the version that came without---but was given it anyway.    I asked for all white meat chicken and was pleased to see that there wasn't an upcharge for that.  The chicken was crispy and flavorful on the outside.  However, the inside was on the dry side.  So, no, the chicken wasn't mind-blowing.  The waffles did not even faintly taste of egg nog which was a disappointment.  If the menu had just said ""waffles"", I would have said that they were good ones.  This dish doesn't come with any sides so I ordered a side of Melba's Tres Mac and Cheese.  Her mac and cheese was supposed to have 3 different cheeses in it---pepper jack, mozzarella and cheddar.  The only cheese we tasted was cheddar.  There wasn't even a hint of spiciness that should have been there due to the pepper jack.  In fact, this dish tasted exactly like the baked mac and cheese recipe that I sometimes make which only has cheddar.  So...another disappointment.My husband had the Charleston Shrimp which consisted of spiced barbecued shrimp.  While he liked the flavoring, he said that the shrimp was overcooked.  His dish came with 2 sides.  He chose candied yams, which were quite good, plus tres mac and cheese.While the food wasn't horrible, we were expecting a lot better given the hype.  I do hope that Melba's fixes whatever needed fixing so that their final Health Department grade is a good one.  As for us, I doubt we'll be back."
8/13/2011,2 star rating,"The matre'd told us it would be 25 minutes of waiting, which turned out to be an hour and more waiting. The decor was quite nice, the best of other soul food establishment we ever tried.We ordered southern fried chicken with eggnog waffles  and side order macaroni and cheese and chili onion ring.The chicken was bland, the side order was good. The portion was small thoughThe service was slow and when we paid, they didn't give back the change.For 2 fried chicken and no additional drink, the total was 34 bucks.  One hour wait? not worth it."

5/10/2015,3 star rating,"The wait staff was wonderful and attentive. Place is very clean, nice but small. Food was very good but the greens were a little under cooked. I also felt the prices were a Lil bit to much for the amount of food they give you. My chocolate Martini was so good but so damn small."
5/19/2017,3 star rating,Damn I liked the food but the drinks could have been better and they need some damn fans or a a/c in there. I couldn't really get to enjoy my food yesterday because I had to keep wiping my forehead. Tried to have a nice late Mother's Day dinner with my mother and aunts but it was just too hot. Having the windows open on a 90 degree day where there's no breeze wasn't a good idea. Ultimately I enjoyed the food just wish it was under better conditions. Next time I go it will definitely be on a cooler day.
5/3/2017,5 star rating,You CAN'T go wrong choosing this restaurant. Everything was on point! From the food to the staff. Our waitress was very friendly and she made us feel right at home. I brought my girlfriend whose from out of town and she was LOVING the chicken and waffle. AMAZING...!!

2/23/2019,3 star rating,"In NY and decided to try Melba's, surprisingly, on a Saturday there was no wait. Our server was friendly; the busboys overly aggressive when clearing your table. Drinks and food were still being consumed and they were trying to clear them, lol. The sweet tea/lemonade mix is delicious but no refills and it's $3 per cup. I had the chicken wings for an appetizer-they gave us 4 wingetts. The catfish was cooked perfectly, the greens had too much stalk and were too sweet, the macaroni noodles were a bit undercooked, but overall meal was decent. I'd return to try the chicken and waffles. My friend raved about the turkey meatloaf."
4/21/2011,4 star rating,"We hiked up to Melbas a few weekends back for brunch. It's a pleasant looking place on the corner of 114th and Frederick Douglass. The whole brunch went by pretty fast actually. We were immediately seated, the waitress took our order toot sweet, and we had fried chicken & eggnog waffles on our table in like 10 minutes.While I'm a fancy gentleman in my 30s I have never sampled fried chicken and waffles together. It's actually pretty damn good, though not something I could put on my menu on a regular basis. As you can imagine, it's pretty heavy and pretty filling. I finished about 3/4 of the dish (and I went easy on the syrup) and I was bursting at the seams. I can't remember how much we dropped here, but it was pretty reasonably priced for the huge portions we got. Looking forward to going back one of these days."
4/27/2019,5 star rating,"Had a wonderful brunch at Melba's today!  We all came from different areas of the country and well worth taking the time to dine there!  The staff is wonderful, food is beyond amazing!  The best grits I have ever eaten and I grew up in the south eating them.  We had Melba's award winning fried chicken and waffles, the chicken tasted like it came from your grandmother's frying pan!  Eggs, bacon, potatoes, all were phenomenal.  I'm a huge sweet tea person, Melba's sweet tea did not disappoint!  The icing on the cake is Melba herself, a gracious host, who makes everyone feel like family!  She is just and all around beautiful person!"
8/1/2015,4 star rating,This was my first time here...the place is not to big at all...the customer service was great...i had reservations for 2 at 930 we had to wait only 20 minutes but wasn't a problem. The food and drink was great. This is definitely a place i wouldn't mind returning too.. Food came out in a timely fashion. Great job.
2/1/2015,5 star rating,"This restaurant is a neighborhood GEM.  I went there last night with my girlfriend and we fell in love with the food. For first timers, I strongly recommend getting the Chicken and Waffles, Tres Mac and Cheese, Catfish or the Atlantic Salmon. These dishes were enriched with soulful flavor and you truly get a bang for your buck.  You will not be disappointed with the food and ambience of the restaurant. In addition, the staff was very friendly also.The only down side is that the restaurant is fairly a small space.  A party of two was a wait of 10-15mins, but well worth the wait.  It's a really popular place so if you decide to go with a large group of people i'd call in advance."

8/15/2016,4 star rating,"I tried Melba's for dinner on Saturday after my friend (who lives in Harlem and is from the south) recommended it to me. So glad I came in-- We had such a great meal. The service was great-- friendly and attentive. We started with the spring rolls -- I have never had a spring roll like this before- it comes with rice, black eyed peas, collard greens and cheddar cheese- but it was so tasty. For the entrees, I got the catfish with mac & cheese and collard greens on the side. The catfish was great and I enjoyed my sides equally as much. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles-- He said he couldn't really taste the eggnog in the waffle, but enjoyed it.Overall, this was a good meal and I would definitely recommend if you are in the area."

8/11/2016,4 star rating,Went for back for happy hour. Better max and cheese. Perfect bartenders!Try the rum punch!!!
7/29/2016,3 star rating,"3.5 stars total. The Good- Nice decor, good music, the Catfish strips and the collard greens are GOOD. The bartender's drinks were on point. The Average- Waited a exceptionally long time for a table despite having a reservation. There were 15 of us and we waited over a hour for just water. I know that's a lot of people however- this was booked a while ago. Server was a bit inexperienced and I think he should have had a helper for a party of 15.The Bad- Mac and Cheese was a big disappointment!!! Like tasteless and bland. Save yourself the pain and get anything else...It was a step above boxed Mac and Cheese. Please add something to it.The Worst- One of the bathroom's was stopped up and the smell was atrocious...."
8/8/2016,5 star rating,"Celebrated my friend's birthday here on Friday. We made reservations, came early and had drinks at the bar while we waited for our party to arrive. It was happy hour for drinks and appetizers and the bartender was on point! We were well toasted before we sat at our table. We all ordered the chicken and waffles, a first for me--I know but I've never been living right. I went for the white meat which had well seasoned skin and paired well with the waffles and butter...for an appetizer we got calamari and catfish. Both were fresh and amazing. The catfish was best and we ended up ordering another two rounds for the table. The space is small and it looks like it's always popping but the food is well worth the visit. I will be going back."
8/6/2016,5 star rating,"Melba's is legit. Amazing smothered chicken. It's even a really nice modern space (with a great bar) for a soul food place. Totally not what I expected.Don't kill me but I didn't taste any eggnog in that waffle, though. I know that's one of the things they're famous for. I mean, it was a good waffle and the strawberry butter was amazing and it paired well with the chicken, but I wanted more nogginess. I think I'll have to try it again next time and compare experiences. Gives me a good excuse to go back."
8/6/2016,1 star rating,"We been to Melba's many times on a dinner date with my partner or with friends. I understand, restaurants can be busy Friday night or the weekends.  What really annoyed me is that we waited for 1 1/2 hour for a table as we were told it would take 40mins.  So we decided to wait because we were craving for southern food.  As we were waiting, we were past on by other,  two and four guest, after the 40min wait as they were not present as we arrived at the restaurant and we were at the front, to be observant who was being checked in.  These guest did not have reservations.  It did not take an Einstein to figure out what transpired beyond my annoyance.  The maitre D, Michael, literally past us over for two and four guest because we were not black.  At that point, I had to VOICE out my concern to Michael why guest were being seated while we have been waiting for an hour, which he apologized that he overlooked our presence in small pack entrance.  Okay-sure, really?  At that point, my annoyance from his lack of customer care was so un-excusable.  I did not mind for being past on by an elderly ladies, but with group of young additional guys, that's not acceptable.  Especially waiting for the last 1 1/2hour was my last draw, and finally, we were seated.  Don't get me wrong, Michael offered to buy us dinner because I know his action implied, ""RACE FACTOR,"" because I knew it was.  It was felt and conveyed.  Thank you Michael for buying our dinner but we can afford to buy our dinners and our tip should suffice our entrees.  This was the worse and annoying service at Melba's as I was not the only guest who had different complaint.  I couldn't wait to get out of Melbas and the food is always tasty but the bad taste of the service will deter me from not coming back, and we rather spend our/my money else where, around the neighborhood.  I was literally disgusted and appalled by the racial favoritism."
8/5/2016,1 star rating,"My first time at Melba's was not what I expected since I heard so much about it, maybe i went at a bad time the food was subpar I could've just cooked for that price"
7/29/2016,3 star rating,"Cons:The Three stars is for the poor quality distressed tables and chairs that are semi hidden in the dim the light. Its not that dark .I can see those chairs had lots of booty calls . Come on Melbas you know you guys can upgrade those tables and chairs the place is small Its not that many. Also toilet was not flushing Yikes.ProsSuper friendly male bartender professional.Food off the chain delicious Catfish, mac,yamsWill recommend ,disturb by decor quality."

5/22/2016,3 star rating,"I visited Melba's for brunch on 05/22/16 with a friend. The wait was about 1/2 hour, which wasn't bad because the weather was nice. Firstly, this restaurant is very small, so tables are cramped together and it is difficult to move around. The service was unusually slow for this time day. Meanwhile, there was a line of people waiting to eat. Once inside it took a while for the waiter to come take our order. After ordering it took an additional 40-50 minutes for the food to make it to our table! I found this to be very discouraging and I was really annoyed waiting to eat for over 2 hours altogether. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and Eggnog Waffles, this is probably the most popular item on the menu because it was ""featured on the food network."" The waffles were really good and had a great taste. However, the fried chicken was flavorless, bland and lacked seasoning. Overall, I would have enjoyed it here if I wasn't waiting for so long while watching other people around me with their food. Very poor service."
11/18/2017,4 star rating,Always enjoy walking in and having the food. Bartender isn't that exciting but you get the desired effect. This is a place where i prefer all the sides so have fun with your order. Please make a reservation during weekends. Don't count on getting a seat right away. The best spots always stay packed. I can go on but just try it for yourself.
9/21/2015,2 star rating,"My man and i were debating if we should stay local and go to ""sweet potato"" in new Rochelle, or drive to harlem, as you can c, we decided to drive to harlem... the chicken & waffles were nothing to go crazy over (my first time having chicken and waffles), we were still hungry when we finished eating. The portions were a tease. And im not a big eater, so for me to say that, smh. i dont think ill go back... plus this was literally the smallest restaurant ive ever been to. I like my space, and there was none in that place. Definitely going to ""sweet potato"" next time"
3/21/2016,5 star rating,Legit. Real Soul Food. Place was clean. Service was Great. Drinks were quality. The wait is worth it.
2/14/2010,3 star rating,"Had a difficult time deciding how many stars to give this because there were certain elements of the restaurant that was stellar and others that were underwhelming.  If you take my advice you will be fine.Recommendation*Severely disappointed in the eggnog waffles. It tasted mushy and not fresh :( I got the feeling that they mass produced it then serviced it--Not served to order :(*I disagree with the other reviewers in the fried chicken though, it definitely tasted flavorful and krispy, and I don't even like fried chicken.*GET GRITS and SMOTHERED CHICKEN.  Do I dare say it's the best grits and smothered chicken I ever had? *Gasp* YES! :D  *Get a reservation because they definitely are busy during the weekends*Service is EXTREMELY slow, but if you bring good company the poor service won't seem so bad*Definitely a great place to bring a date or girlfriend.  The decor is beautiful an soulful :)CHALLENGE: Fried Chicken and Waffles"
1/18/2018,4 star rating,"My son and I visited this very nice restaurant last night.  He got the fried chicken, which was very tasty- but a notably small portion on the plate.  He also got the onion rings, which were quite strange, with a crumb crust, not the usual tangy batter served commonly around NYC.  I got the oxtails & collard greens, which were both excellent and generous.  Finally, we both enjoyed the delicious mac-n-cheese.  We'll be back- but I hope the kitchen is buying larger chickens."

11/3/2017,4 star rating,"Went for a friends birthday OCT 27 2017 , overall a very  good for a dine in soul food spot . Its more upscale dine in but under $25 menu. I wouldn't come here in sweats for those looking for a bite to eat. The food was really good had mac and cheese southern fried chicken and Yukon potatoes everything was hot throughout the whole meal. The only thing i didn't understand was the big fried chicken being placed on the mac and cheese it actually jus messes up the mac in a way almost making it soggy if you dont move it from the chicken due to the oil i get its for presentation but they need to rethink that over . Def would come here again!"
3/17/2012,5 star rating,I can't wait to come back to this place. Food is really good.I had the Salmon Mac n Chesse and Collard Greens. Reminds me of real southern food.
7/18/2014,3 star rating,"Went to brunch here a few months ago. The place is small and it was packed! I have to take a few stars off because of the service. There was one waitress working the restaurant. I asked for the mango mimosa and it took literally 20 minutes, maybe a half hour for it to come. I think she basically forgot. The pancakes are to die for! Extra fluffy! Maybe I will come back for dinner one day, but the service needs tightening up."
6/27/2016,5 star rating,"Went here with friends one Saturday afternoon, was initially a 45 minute wait which ended up being ~15 because a large party didn't show. My oh my was this food delicious. Had the catfish and waffles, with mac n  cheese, collard greens, and potato salad (yeah, I know,  I'm greedy...lol). With the exception of the waffle, everything was superb. My friend had the salmon with sides, which she loved. And my other friend had the turkey meatloaf and rice, which he said both were dry...and I did confirm after tasting. But I would definitely recommend and certainly be back. The food was so good I didn't even get a chance to take pics..."
7/17/2018,1 star rating,"Stopped in with a friend who loves soul food. Plus points: the waiter was very pleasant and the place was packed. However, I'm baffled as to why this place is so popular. Food was not good at all and we waited ages for our drinks, which were also not good. When the check came, it seemed very expensive considering the quality of the meal. I won't be going back."

The food? Delicious! I ordered the fried chicken, mac & cheese, and greens. Everything was so good and inexpensive. The service was great and I felt so welcomed when I walked in the door. I'll definitely be visiting Melba's on my next trip."

My sister had the salmon croquettes with cheese grits which she enjoyed and I had the famous chicken and eggnog waffles with strawberry butter!! It was out of this world!! The chicken was crispy and seasoned to perfection!! Very moist and tender!! And on top of everything, we were able to meet and chat with Melba the owner before she left!! Such a sweet woman!!! If you are looking for good soul food in Harlem...look no further!! Melba's is the place to go!!"
10/3/2017,4 star rating,"I finally had the opportunity to check out this restaurant after hearing so many positive opinions from friends and family.  I went for brunch with two very close friends, and this place far exceeded my expectations.  I was fortunate enough to have Brandon as my server, and he was super-attentive to our table.  The food was very, very good; perfect portions and reasonably priced.  Each person in my party ordered a different dessert so that we could try them all.  The coconut cake was excellent, and the sweet potato pie and peach cobbler were served warm!!! Ms. Melba, I will be back!"
10/1/2017,2 star rating,The food is good but management nees to decide if your regulars mean more than white folks who visit onve in a while.
6/9/2017,4 star rating,"While in Harlem waiting for Show Time At the Apollo, I asked a person on 125th St for a good place to eat.  They said Melba's!  So we drove there and so happy we did..  With the exception of too much cheese in my grits, the food was awesome.  It was early Sunday morning 6/4/17 and a lil crowded, but we are coming back for sure...Between the four of us, our plates included cheese grits, catfish, fried chicken and waffles, french toast, slab bacon, and home fries.  If you've never been before, I encourage you to give it a try folks!"

My food was a little cold coming out so had the waiter nuke it for a little...actually still came out semi-warm so only reason I can't really give the five star rating.Had to end the dinner with peach cobbler...you already know..."
4/2/2017,5 star rating,"Yessssss. All very good. I ordered the salmon, greens and spinach. My friends ordered mac and cheese, beef ribs (I think) and sweet potatoes; another one ordered fried shrimp, potato salad and cole slaw. It was their first time there and they loved it as did I. And we sat at the table next to Melba!"
10/10/2010,2 star rating,"Ive been wanting to go to this place forever since I live close by and the excellent reviews. However, the food failed to meet my expectations. The decor is simple and gives the small space an intimate feel. Staff are nice. I ordered the supposed specialty dish- Southern Fried Chicken and Waffles. What a disappointment! The dish comes with three small waffles topped with strawberry butter. The waffles themselves taste more like a doughy tough donut with no flavor. The butter on top was hard, I had to wait for them to melt a little to spread them. Now for the accompanying chicken, it was a small serving size which I am fine with. The chicken was crispy without tasting greasy and moist. I enjoyed the chicken, although not the best out there. Overall, this upscaled version of chicken and waffles were not for me. The chicken was tasty but not memorable and the waffles were awful. I am not sure if the quality of the food has gone down or what but I am not a fan."
11/26/2017,3 star rating,"AMBIANCE: The place is nicely decorated and comfortable. The music was nice and at an acceptable volume. The floors and tables were clean. The staff were friendly and attentive  (please note, it was about 11:15 AM on a Sunday). The temperature was very comfortable despite sitting close to the entry way in November. RESTROOMS: The bathroom facilities were clean with no debris on the floors. Soap was available with both hot and cold water. Guests can use either the Dyson Air blade, or paper towels to dry their hands.PRICE: It's on the expensive side for a soul food brunch especially when there are no complimentary mimosas, Bellinis, or bloody marys. FOOD: Here lies the problem. In 2017, we must be a little more health conscious. I ordered a vegetable frittata and my husband ordered a salmon omelette. Both dishes were EXTREMELY OILY. I litterally used four quality napkins to lift the oil in order for the food to be edible. I sat there wondering if my last bite would lead to an heart attack and I'm not a large woman. I would give 4 stars, but the food is not 4 stars UNLESS people like oily, unhealthy food."
4/29/2014,5 star rating,"I went here for brunch  around 1pm on Easter Sunday with my BF. He's addicted to chicken and waffles, and was anxious to try Melba's eggnog waffles. Surprisingly enough, the wait for two on Easter wasn't long at all, and we were seated within 10 or so minutes. The server and hostess were excellent and quick. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the place was quaint.We both ordered the fried chicken and eggnog waffle, and I got a side of cheese grit (thanks to you other yelpers). Man those grits were AMAZING!!! The fried chicken was full of flavor, and fried to perfection. The waffle was one of the best that I've ever had, and the strawberry butter made them even better!I'd definitely like to come back here for dinner."
11/25/2017,3 star rating,"Went for Thanksgiving.. The atmosphere and music were wonderful but food was just ok. The service was not too good but I think it was our server who brought my appetizer out and then the others 15 minutes later. The rest of my group had soup but he forgot the spoons, we also had to ask for our forks for our meals and no coffee was offered with dessert. Still I like to go back and give it one my try."
9/10/2017,4 star rating,"By far the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. My only issue is, the 3 wings they give or maybe I'm just that greedy . I think 4 wings would definitely be suited better to go along with this waffle especially for the price I goes for (17.95) still good either way."
7/13/2015,5 star rating,"The food and the service was totally awesome. I thought the place would be a lot bigger. I would definitely go back!!! I had the eggnog waffle with fried chicken, mac and cheese, and the yams!!! Yes I am super greedy!!!  The food was finger licking good!!"
9/7/2014,3 star rating,"The service is amazing here but I wasn't too impressed with my food. I had the eggnog chicken and waffles. I thought the chicken was good but I wasn't really that fond of the circular tiny waffles that accompanied it. I prefer one large waffle like Soco in BK. Harlem is a bit out of the way, so I probably wouldn't return because I wasn't wow-ed. I would recommend it though to someone looking for a brunch place in Harlem."
3/1/2017,4 star rating,"So refreshing to go to a place that serves southern food at a decent price. My husband had the eggnog chicken and waffles, and I had the salmon croquettes with cheese grits. Both dishes were delicious! Highly recommend this place!"
8/16/2017,4 star rating,"Nice spot with good food, nice portions, and great music playing overhead. Only downside was that it was pretty hot inside. Fried catfish and Melba's Spring Rolls were my favorite. Chocolate layer cake was alright. Peach cobbler was not what I'm use to. More on the lines of a bread pudding consistency. Loved the crispiness and cheesiness of the spinach and cheese empanada."
2/28/2015,4 star rating,"Such a great place! I would definitely suggest making a reservation. Luckily another party was running late, so my friend and I just slipped right in and were seated. We sat by the window, in the corner...which was fine but just a tad chilly. Not all that pleased. However! The food surely made up for it. I had the southern friend chicken & egg-nog waffles with turkey sausage. One word DELICIOUS! The chicken was so juicy and crispy, and seasoned from the inside out! Just the way it should be. True southern cooking!My friend ordered the steak & eggs with home fries and the cinnamon raisin french toast. All of which was to die for. The French toast was amazing! I think I ate more of his French toast than I did my waffles. Will certainly go back for dinner. Cute and quaint! Melba's is a harlem gem"

10/22/2017,4 star rating,"The food is delicious here! My aunt brought me here when I graduated earlier this year and our waiter was just delightful. In August, I brought her for her birthday and sadly we did not have the best experience with our waiter. We waited for almost 20 minutes as he talked to other customers, acted as if he didn't see us and just carried on. If it weren't for the fact that we had been here before and knew what to expect as far as the food, we would have left. We did however enjoy our meal both times and if it matters, the drinks are good as well."
5/24/2010,3 star rating,"Did the waffle propose to the chicken or vice versa? Do you suppose the food priest said the following?""Chicken do you take waffle to be your plate partner until teeth do you part?""Both chicken and waffle agree. Strawberry butter is exchanged.""I now pronounce you a delicious food pairing, you may now be drenched in syrup."" This was my first ever chicken and waffles experience and it really gets about 3.4 stars.Both chicken and waffle, but both just seemed to have been a bit on the drier side. That strawberry butter was something else, tasting freshly of strawberries (more so than butter). I actually liked taking bites of just the waffle with that and syrup (and bites of just the fried chicken and hot sauce, sorry it's the Korean in me). I went with a group of five on Saturday at about 12:40ish and we were happy to have no wait. The waiter did get upset with us since we paid with 4 cards (I was a server once, it really is annoying). I know this beat Bobby Flay in Throwdown, but I'm convinced there may be better chicken and waffle marriages elsewhere. Got suggestions? Send them!"
3/12/2017,3 star rating,"The first time I dined here, everything was amazing. The drinks were perfect, the chicken was crispy and the mac & cheese was delicious. When I came back two nights ago, it was different. Our server was inattentive, the chicken was salty and the mac & cheese was. . . just wrong. I'll try again in hopes of having that first experience again, but I suppose this place is a hit or miss."
5/14/2016,1 star rating,"I came here because of the hype. Very disappointed. First thing I noticed before I entered this establishment was the ""B"" rating. I should have turned around. Second bad thing was the wine glass was dirty. I asked for a new one which was a lot better. Finally the salmon I ordered was very uncooked, I had to ordered the beef short ribs which was an improvement but not that great. Melba's is HORRIFIC BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. DO NOT GO. OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF BAD FOOD & DRINKS."
7/31/2017,4 star rating,"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I am not disappointed, we were immediately seated, the waitstaff  took a little bit longer than usual to come to the table however the food came out hot I got the catfish and waffles my daughter got the chicken and waffles and we were not disappointed.  Both the catfish and chicken were seasoned to a T. we also get a side of macaroni and cheese and collard greens."
10/9/2015,3 star rating,"I've never had southern comfort food but I think this is it. It was really flavorful albeit not the healthiest. I ordered catfish with onion rings and collard greens.

1/9/2015,4 star rating,"A group of us, 6 people, made reservations for a b'day dinner. We adjusted the reservation and made it for 45 minutes later than originally planned. The place is SUPER small; literally only about 20 people can fit inside, so we had to wait for about an hour despite having the reservation, so we set at the bar to pass the time and soothe our sorrows. The bartender helped us immediately and was very kind. She also ended up being our waitress, which was kind of funny. The food came quickly and was A-MAZ-ING! I had the salmon, macaroni and cheese, collard greens and candied yams. Everything was perfect. They (the bartender not the actual wait staff, which was lacking) did a great job serving the cake as well. We had fun, despite the faux pas. I would definitely go again. I want to try everything they have."
11/10/2014,3 star rating,"My experience overall at Melba's was not bad. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and it was fried and seasoned perfectly. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese and waffles but only received the mac and cheese even after asking the server numerous times for the waffle. I guess they were busy that night. The food was still pretty good and the ambiance was laid back. Next time I visit, I want to try a desert because the ones I saw being ordered looked tasty."
9/3/2016,1 star rating,We came at 2 PM which was still brunch service. The place was about 60% full at the time which leaves the expectations to have fast service. I took us 20 min to get water and a menu.  Server name is Destinee. She didn't seem to be an experienced server at all. We got our drinks which was two cokes and one sprite and all of it was superflat. We ordered the chicken and waffles which was OK.  I've eaten all over the United States and other establish chicken places like Roscoes chicken and waffles  and sweetie pies and even the Ezell's in Seattle.  This place is ranked last amongst all of the afore mentioned chicken places named.  I may want to give them dinner service a shot to see if more of the experienced waiters are on staff but I need to think about it. We were never checked on after we got our food so we had to flag her down to get the check. We had to tell her that the three drinks that we receive that were unsatisfactory were not removed from the bill. She told us thank us for reminding her because she would have forgotten. Food-service 101.
7/20/2014,4 star rating,"We went for brunch. I got the Salfie Special Omelet (collards) and cheese grits. Partner got the fried catfish and grits. We shared a fruit bowl, had bellinis and miosas. The service was excellent, and the decor is clean and modern. Will definitely return for dinner."
12/9/2015,1 star rating,"Dining at Melba's is an endurance exercise in waiting a very, very, very long time for food.  If you are thinking of eating here, please take note: reservations mean nothing at this restaurant.  You should expect that your table won't be ready for at least an hour after you arrive, even if the restaurant called earlier to confirm.Once you're finally seated, there's no guarantee that a server will bring you menus.  However, you may opt to get them for yourself.In lieu of menus, you will be presented with a bill from the bar for the drinks you and your friends ordered while waiting.  You will be urged to pay immediately, but when you attempt to do so, no one will retrieve it, and it will sit on your table for the duration of the evening taunting you.Inexplicably, you may be given only three glasses of water to share amongst five people, and when you ask a server for two more, he will nod as if in comprehension, yet still no water comes.  You should feel welcome to get your own water from the bar.Your mains will take over an hour to arrive.  You will watch forlornly as tables that were seated after you order their food, complain that their food is taking too long, eat their food, order dessert, enjoy dessert, pay their bill, and leave.  All the while, your server will maintain that your food is late because the kitchen is backed up, and you'll wonder, ""how is everyone else being served?""   It doesn't make any sense, don't question it.Alas, when your food finally arrives, it won't be what you wanted.  You ordered catfish with collards, yams, and mac n' cheese (it's a lot of food, but you're pregnant and starving!).  Instead, you'll be given catfish on a waffle with strawberry butter.  Luckily your server will quickly bring back the catfish on a plate with yams and collards, and when you politely remind her about the mac n' cheese she'll snap, ""I only have two hands!""   You'll think, ""She's right, we're only human, but most servers are perfectly capable of holding one plate in each hand, so she could have ostensibly carried the mac n' cheese in her second hand.  Why not this time?""  Remember, don't ask questions. You're ravenously hungry by this point, so you must eat too fast, like a rabid wolf.  Your friends will be doing the same in total silence.In case you begin to worry about the side of mac n' cheese again, don't.  It will finally come, overcooked and dry from sitting under a heat lamp, but you will still eat it because that's how hungry you are.Finally, once your blood sugar returns to an acceptable level for human survival, you will recommence conversation with your dinner companions.  You'll ponder why this happened to you.  Have you done something wrong?  You'll also debate how to best convey constructive criticism, and what's the tipping protocol in this situation?Your tipping question will be answered once you see that the bill includes an automatic 18% gratuity, which definitely isn't deserved, but whatever...  you've been stuck in this hell hole for three hours.  You want to go home more than you want to argue about the tip.The hostess, who turns out to also be the manager, will approach to collect your bills (don't forget, the bar bill from ages ago is still sitting there), at which point you'll wordlessly nominate your most diplomatic friend to deliver the aforementioned constructive criticism. She'll explain to the hostess/manager how poorly the evening has gone and request to be comped the three beers you ordered while waiting for your table.  The hostess/manager will protest, telling you that a lot of people had reservations and also waited for a table and food, as if that makes it okay.  You'll stare at her dumbfounded, and your diplomatic friend will press on, clarifying that you watched as every other table seated after you got their food.  At that point, if you're lucky, the hostess/manager will ask, ""was it really only three beers?"".   You'll all simultaneously respond, ""yes!"", but she doesn't believe you, so she snatches the receipt from your diplomatic friend's hands, inspects it closely, and reluctantly agrees not to charge you for the Coronas.  Out into the the chilly December air you'll exit, looking forward to a time when you can reflect on this evening and laugh, and laugh, and laugh...  Will that day ever come?  Of course it will!   But was your suffering worth it?"

2/16/2014,1 star rating,As a new person to Harlem I didn't feel very welcomed first of all. My drink was half of a glass- I asked about the other half but was bascily ignored.My food was greasy and had zero taste- and it was an OMELET! I can make a better omelet at home. I didn't like it and will not return.There are too many places in NY and in Harlem to settle.
10/29/2014,5 star rating,"Melbas is a beautiful little corner restaurant, not too big, but bursting with life and easy elegance on a late Thursday night. My friend took us there to eat, because their food is...well, it's probably one of the top ten meals of my entire life. I had chicken and waffles, which I've never had before and I'm so glad I waited for the RIGHT chicken and waffles to come along before diving in because they were exquisite. It was worth the wait. If I could wear a ring to signify my devotion to this chicken and waffles, I would. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese off my friends recommendation and if the meal could be a sound it would be mmrrpppphhh...that's me, drowning in goodness. Also, we were starving, having just eaten breakfast that day and by the time we ate it was like 8:30pm, so it all tasted like heaven itself.Seriously, this is the best food I had in our entire visit to NYC. Worth every penny and minute of the wait."
3/8/2016,5 star rating,Delicious and Authentic soul food in Harlem only con is not enough portions tho can't go wrong here small dining area for patrons and a little pricey other than that the food is a1
8/3/2018,1 star rating,I never got to taste the food because the delivery guy refused to deliver. Melba's should either pose on the page that they only do curbside or change delivery service.
7/7/2017,2 star rating,"Very excited to have good fried chicken, and it was good. Not as good as The Ribbon, and I'm a child of an Alabama born woman! Unfortunately, The Ribbon has no waffle. and it would be fantastic if they did."
12/19/2016,5 star rating,"I literally had no complaints about Melba's. I got the catfish with two sides (candied yams and collard greens) and everything was DELICIOUS. It even tasted good warmed up as my leftover lunch the next day. The staff was very friendly. We were greeted by several staff when we walked in and they also greeted us on our way out. You can tell that the staff is happy to work there and it showed in the way they treated the customers. Everyone was smiling and friendly, which = a better tip, obviously. I will definitely return!"
4/4/2014,3 star rating,"The waffles were some of the best I've had but the chicken had no flavor. The mac n cheese with fish was also very good, they are two of my favorite soul food dishes. I know you might be thinking what does this little PR girl from Jersey know about soul food. Not a lot I'm sure but I've been hooked on chicken and waffles for a long time and have had it all over the country. I also grew up with an African American southern aunt who's house I spend many a summers and I know all about fried fish with spaghetti or baked mac n cheese.So yea pass on the chicken friends. The eggnog waffle was amazing I need to figure out how to make them with that strawberry butter. The restaurant is clean and cute, the staff are friendly and welcoming. If you have the chance to spot in for a bite, please do so."
2/3/2015,5 star rating,I am an executive Chef and I must tell you ! This is the real deal in Harlem the food OMG! And trust me I know good food Home cooking at its best ! A must try is the chicken & Eggnog waffles and the strawberry butter . If your in Harlem you got to come by.
2/13/2014,1 star rating,"Food Is good. Not extraordinary, but good. The service is HORRIBLE. The staff is bored, and uninterested. I felt like a huge inconvenience to them. I called maybe 2 months later for a take out order, to avoid the poor service, But i was in for even worse service. I was put on hold for 35 minutes. I hung up, and called back. When the hostess answered, and I said I was just on hold for 35 minutes, she gave no apology or anything. She responded with ""what do you want"".I hung up the phone. and have never been back."
2/10/2018,1 star rating,There are too many restaurants in NYC to settle for this crap .. celebrity or not .. we are all humans and should be treated the same ... now let's get to the review . Been going here for a while . Brunch was great . Went today and place was crowed . Sat at the bar no big deal..UNTIL a celebrity decides to come in and the staff decides everyone else in the place can wait .. they are served in record time .. me well 1.5 hours later I'm leaving because I've yet to be served.  Sure maybe they won't care . maybe Melba's is now too big to care about regular folks . So I'll spend my money elsewhere .  I am so disappointed in this service .. I will never go to this place again . Do yourself a favor and go someplace else
1/25/2015,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's for my buddy's birthday dinner. I really didn't know what to expect from a self described ""soul food"" place. The server recommended tchicken and waffles as their signature dish. And O M G... It was amaz-balls. On paper, chicken and waffle combo doesn't seem appetizing. But at Melba's, the chicken and waffle dish was the best sweet and savory mixture I've had. The chicken was tendor, and the buffalo and maple sauce mixture was the icing on the cake. The outside the place doesn't look great, but it's a great low key intimate date spot. Highly recommended."
6/18/2017,5 star rating,"This place is GREAT!! The atmosphere was nice, the staff was great and the food was DELICIOUS. Melba's will definitely be a MUST visit spot every time I visit the city. ONLY THING...if you don't like your food to touch, you may want to let them know so the can plate your food differently!!!!"
3/6/2011,4 star rating,"I first heard about Melba's while watching an episode of Bobby Flay's 'Throwdown'. Bobby challenged Melba to a chicken and waffles battle.I can't remember who won the throwdown, but Melba definitely won me over with her secret ingredient: strawberry honey butter! Thus, I knew it was fate when several months later I saw a Groupon for Melba's.The ambiance of Melba's was something that caught me off guard. I kind of felt like I was in a club in the 1920's. It was romantically dark, the tables lit with candles, and soothing music filled the small dining room and bar area.The service was speedy and nice, though I was a little disgruntled that they lost our reservation. They quickly accommodated us though.Although they have a pretty interesting cocktail menu, we did not drink. The drinks were also rather pricey.We ordered the crab cakes, Rusty got the fried chicken with waffles (and strawberry honey butter!) and I got the southern style catfish with macaroni and cheese and potato salad.Russell's fried chicken was very good! It was moist and there was a ton of it. I really enjoyed my fish, but the sides, not so much. The macaroni and cheese was on the spicy side, with peppers in it. The potato salad also had too much relish and was too salty for my taste buds. Rusty finished everything that I didn't eat.I think that if I had stuck with my gut intuition and just ordered the chicken and waffles, I would have been more satisfied with my visit to Melba's. When I looked around, it's what practically everyone was eating. It was a terrific night out, and we even saw Melba! I would visit again. Like I said, the atmosphere is perfect for a date."
3/4/2016,3 star rating,"The chicken and waffles was smashing , I was a bit put off that the credit card machine wasn't working but I was able to run to an atm real quick and get some cash"
2/19/2014,4 star rating,"This place was really niiiiice! The ambiance was cozy and the music on point. They have a  smooth painting of Marvin Gaye, so make sure you look for it. I got the chicken and waffles. The waffles taste as if god made them. That's how good they were. Also the syrup that came with it was delish! The chicken was nice and make sure you ask for some hot sauce. I'll be coming back to this spot."
12/6/2014,4 star rating,"High quality Southern comfort food.Had the short rib and it was delicious and cooked well. The meat was soft and fell apart from the braising and the wine-reduction sauce was excellent.Wife had the fried chicken. Again, really good technique -- the skin was crispy but the meat remained moist and flavorful.Would come back!"
7/5/2014,4 star rating,This was the second time I have ate at Melba and it will probably go again in the future.  Everyone I was with got the chicken and egg nog waffles.  The food is good but not great in my opinion... My wife would disagree because she loves the chicken.  I got the dark meat and it was lightly breaded.  It was not greasy and good meat but it lacked flavor in my opinion.  The waffle and maple syrup were also pretty good.  Gave it 4 stars because of where it is and the fun atmosphere.  If you have not been I would say to go for the experience but don't over hype the food.
11/14/2016,3 star rating,"I love Melba's! I truly do. The food's good and the wait staff is usually very pleasant. BUT...most times their service is very slow! Quick dinner outing with my wife, or so we thought, turned into an 1.5-2 hour sitting. We watched parties come in after us and get their food long before we did. Maybe their kitchen was backed up. Maybe they were under staffed. Whatever the reason, an 1.5-2 hours for 2 people, 2 entrees and 1 appetizer just seems like a bit much...especially with a restaurant that small."
8/5/2016,1 star rating,"My first time at Melba's was not what I expected since I heard so much about it, maybe i went at a bad time the food was subpar I could've just cooked for that price"
6/5/2016,5 star rating,"The food was AMAZING! I had the fried codfish and egg night waffle. The waffle just melts in your mouth..and the fish was nice, flaky, and was not over seasoned (which some people can do with fish). Also, from the appetizers i had the spinach and cheese empanadas and crab cakes, which were both amazing. I would definitely recommend this place. Oh yea...the service was very good as well...I was raving about the food, that I forgot about the service"
5/18/2016,5 star rating,"We came here with two friends for an anniversary brunch. We ordered the chicken and waffles, salmon croquettes with grits and cat fish and I got a mimosa. A buttery raisin scone came out first which was buttery and light. The fried chicken (dark meat...) was so delicious, I am daydreaming about it now: not greasy, moist on the inside and a thin crunchy fried coating on the outside. The grits were delicious and I'm in love: I never had them this good! The waffle and strawberry butter was fluffy and light. The salmon croquettes were delicious and full of salmon deliciousness and so perfectly cooked and moist with just enough breading, and the catfish was some of the best I have ever had: lightly battered and fluffy. All the food was spot on, I hope to return soon for their dinner menu. The service was warm and inviting. The place was packed but somehow not too loud nor crammed; instead it felt lively, warm, and welcoming and was a great meetup place for old friends. I am coming back here for sure! Thank you Melba's!!"
7/1/2016,5 star rating,Although the restaurant space is limited it is worth it! Everything was delicious. I ordered the short ribs and the spring rolls which were very tasty. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. Champs the bartender is the reason I gave this review 5 stars. He was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. Definitely a place I would visit again.

12/18/2016,5 star rating,"Wow. My sister friends and I really enjoyed dinner at Melba's. Our table was ready for a birthday celebration (even though the entire party did arrive yet [parking is rough]). We were promptly seated by the lovely manager and given a great server. The drinks, appetizers, and entrees were excellent. BTW our server was honest with the tastes of certain menu items. The birthday girl made  great choice with this spot! The bartender even got in on the fun taking pictures for us. I hope Melba's stays a wonderful spot in Harlem. As a Brooklyn girl all the way, I would come back for more."
1/2/2016,5 star rating,"Food was fantastic! Everything we had a was cooked to perfection. We had the catfish strips appetizer, crab cakes and calamari. Entrées were salmon with Mac n cheese and collard greens, short ribs, eggnog waffles and chicken. All delicious but the eggnogg waffles and chicken wings were to die for! The drinks pack a punch too. We had the PB punch.  The crowd was urban and mature,  beautiful ambiance and clean, cost environment. Make a reservation and be on time because seating is limited. Last but not least Michael, the host was very accommodating and professional. Looking forward to going back very soon!"
2/15/2014,3 star rating,"I've been to Melba's on multiple occasions; birthdays, graduations and romantic dinners. The ambience is the most amazing aspect of this restaurant. If you love small dim lighted sexy intimate settings, Melba's is the place for you. HOWEVER, the chefs must have changed over the years because the food is no longer what it once was. I typically order the sea bass but recently it wasn't up to par. I'm giving Melba's 3 stars because I still have hope!"
12/1/2016,4 star rating,"Cool Vibe, just a tad bit small. Food was really good (Chicken Wings & Waffles). Also the staff is great, I love the way they sung happy birthday to the birthday guests."
1/2/2015,5 star rating,"I absolutely loved it here! We came on a Tuesday afternoon a little before 5, which is when they opened. We had to wait a little bit since they weren't technically open but we were able to sit at the bar until then. Seating is a little cramped and cozy but I didn't feel suffocated at all. Our waittress was really friendly and attentive. I can only speak for what I had to eat, but I'd like to think the entire menu is as good! I ordered a mango martini to start with. I didn't taste the mango at all, unfortunately. I then had the fried shrimp appetizer. It was incredible. Probably the 2nd best shrimp I've had in my life - the first being a spot in Naples, FL. For my entree I had the infamous chicken and waffles. It was so good! I've had a lot of chicken and waffle dishes and this one definitely takes the plate. I rarely if ever pick at the bones for fried chicken meals, but this one all I wanted was more. The waffles came with strawberry butter and syrup - amazing. I cannot wait to come back and perhaps try a dessert next time. I definitely recommend Melba's and will definitely be returning as soon as I can."
4/22/2017,5 star rating,"We had a fantastic dining experience. The food was delicious. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The catfish just melted in your mouth. The greens were well seasoned and the mac and cheese tasted like my grandmother's recipe, just like the potato salad. Manager Nadine, Bartender Moises and our server Shay took great care of us. The hospitality was just terrific."
12/21/2018,4 star rating,I had my cousins birthday dinner here.  Food was great but was charged a $50 cake cutting fee sneakingly attached to the bill..waitress never mentioned that fee also highest tip amount was placed as part of the bill.  Great to take your family just review the charges on the bill carefully before making payment.
7/5/2018,4 star rating,"Yesss awesome soul food and a whole lot better than the other soul food tourist trap in Harlem that starts with the letter ""S"".  Went here this past Saturday because the boo and I were in Manhattan for a few days and was dying for soul food.  Every time he says he wants soul food that usually means turkey wings so he was a little disappointed to not see them on the menu.  Soul food to me is catfish.  And BAAABBBY...I was not disappointed.  I absolutely love soul food that's prepared so well that no table condiments is needed to be added.  He said the same thing about the oxtails.  My only gripe is this place close to early.  I thought NY was the city that never sleeps.  So closing at 11 was a little disappointing considering we had just arrived a little after 10:30 and kind of felt rushed.  I also appreciated the smooth R&B music that was playing on the radio but if I can make a suggestion, a live band on the weekends would be nice.  Nothing beats live music paired with soul food on a date night (weekend).   Yes I'll return because I'd still like to try the signature chicken and waffles dish."
5/1/2016,5 star rating,"The Egg Nog Waffles & Fried Chicken. Please slap someone's mother! Soooooo good!! Everything looked amazing & our table was totally happy. Just take that 5 block walk to Central Park, b/c the look alone will add a few pounds. I left soooo happy & planning my next nightmare drive thru traffic.....all 8 miles which takes 35 minutes. I hate NY for it's mad traffic. But my greedy self will bob & weave all the back to Harlem to eat here again. Oh! The mac & cheese, greens & catfish in person - my next indulgence. My friend had it & she was very happy. Right now my love for her is mixed - she's lives literally one block away. I guess we'll make that a positive."
5/22/2016,3 star rating,"I used to love this place.  There was a time when you could walk in on any day of the week and anything you ordered would be cooked and seasoned to perfection. You could tell the food was made with love. Something has changed. I don't know if there is a new cook or new management. But I was sorely disappointed with my meal today. I was with a large  party and everyone in my party was very sad. We have always had good experiences here until today. We waited about an hour for our food and when we got it, it was greasy, bland, and the steaks were overdone. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this because this used to be one of my favorite places to eat. How you have fallen since the days of the Throwdown."
6/21/2016,1 star rating,"I had taken my boyfriend there to celebrate Father's Day. It was a bad decision. The experience was disappointing. Once seated we waited nearly twenty minutes before anyone came over to our table.  Also, I was surprised we were not offered bread or rolls as we waited. We joked that perhaps they were in the back watching the basketball game. The food was nothing to rave about and we had to wait an additional twenty minutes to receive it.  Our dishes were mediocre at best. The shrimps were over cooked. Nice decor, friendly staff but for $85.00 I expected much more."
3/20/2011,5 star rating,"There's not much more I can say than has already been said.  The chicken and egg nog waffles are to die for--with the strawberry butter being a fantastic addition.  We (two of us) were there on a Sunday around 1pm, and it was packed, but we were seated quickly and served promptly.  So far, this is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood."
12/11/2018,4 star rating,"One of the best Mac and cheese out there in my opinion, amazing candied yams. The only complaints I have is the cleanliness of the kitchen , it's way too close to the bathroom leaving speculation if there could easily be cross contamination between the food and the bathroom germs. I've stood waiting for the bathroom and the bad smell lingers into the kitchen, not cool.  If you're looking for a quiet place this ain't the one.  Highly recommend that Mac and cheese though can never take that away from the restaurant."
6/2/2017,5 star rating,"Came here with a large group of people, have been wanting to come for some time. Making the reservation with Dina was terrific, could not have gone smoother. It's a great place with terrific food. It was very busy but the service was amazingly good."
5/27/2017,3 star rating,Must say food was great!!!! Service was poor and the restaurant was half full. After placing our order we had to ask to take the menus. Hair on my eggs. Received food and had to ask about the drinks. No one received their entire order due to food  missing. Price for food is expensive. Wouldn't be returning
1/14/2017,5 star rating,"One of the best southern/soul food restaurants in Harlem.  The grilled shrimp added to a Caesar salad were 6 in number and big plump and fresh.  The sides were generous- a big pile of collard greens and excellent Mac and cheese.  The fried chicken had a crispy breading and cooked just enough, the only issue was that the piece was not very big.  Quick wait staff, only a brief wait in a crowded restaurant on a Friday night."
1/11/2017,5 star rating,I love Melba's!!!! We usually go for happy hour which is Mon-Fri from 5pm to 7pm.$5 drinks and apps.Our favorite bartender is Moises!! He is so much fun and so entertaining. On tuesday's they have a live band and in house singer.. shes pretty dope as well!! Cat fish strips are sooo good....and Melba... she's sweet as pie!

11/1/2013,4 star rating,"Never had a bad meal here. For brunch, you can't go wrong with the egg nog waffles and fried chicken. The strawberry butter is EVERYTHING. That with some mac and cheese on the side. Amaze. My only complaint is the space is small. But the food makes up for it. Happy Brunching!"

1/26/2014,4 star rating,"The catfish. I could go into a lengthy monologue about the adorable setting, attentive service, blah blah... But, the catfish. The crispy, flaky, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth (who knew fish could do this?) catfish. Gee whiz."
8/16/2014,4 star rating,"The food was so good!!! I had the fried catfish with the famous mac & cheese and spinach. The person I was with had the chicken & eggnog waffles. The best time to go is lunch time, if you want to avoid a crowd or the noise level.Overall, its what I expected. I'll definitely go back."
8/15/2014,3 star rating,"We went here for brunch and I was a bit disappointed with the menu options.  Being from Atlanta, our definition of brunch is breakfast items and lunch items with delicious side dishes.  I was disappointed to find that for a brunch menu, the only vegetable offered was an appetizer salad.  Where are the collard greens, green beans, etc.?  Anyways, I ordered the fried chicken and fries (since the only other side dish options were waffles or hash browns).  The fried chicken was good, but better sides would have made it much better.  The service was also very slow & the restaurant was way too small for my taste.  My friend and I had to yell just to hear each other talk.  Our waitress was not very attentive either.  She never asked us if we wanted any beverages other than the water she just sat on the table when we were seated.  My friend had to ask the hostess for a lemonade and it took over 10 minutes for her to actually receive it. Melba was there and she was very nice!  So, I'd go back for dinner on my next trip to NYC when they aren't as hectic and have their full menu available."
12/20/2014,5 star rating,"I absolutely love this restaurant. The wait can be a bit long, but that is because the food is so amazing. The servers are wonderful as well. The prices are very reasonable.I've been here several times for both brunch and dinner. At brunch they serve amazing butter biscuits that are flaky and delicious. I don't eat chicken or pork, but the catfish is by far the best fried fish I've ever had. Everyone who's been here with me agrees. The eggnog waffles are also incredible. I'm not usually much of a waffle fan, but these are the perfect texture, chewy with just enough crisp on the outside. My friend got thick cut bacon with her brunch meal and also reported that it was the best bacon ever. Basically, Melba's feels a little bit like eating at someone's house, who just happens to make some of the best food around. Plan to wait, but it's worth it!"
1/12/2014,5 star rating,My first time at Melba's last night and it definitely won't be my last. We had reservations but still waited about 10 minutes upon arrival. The staff was so super friendly it hardly felt like you were waiting. Its a quaint setting and I love it. Let me just say that Ms. Melba Wilson herself was right there in her restaurant and gave her up seat for us. I ordered the southern fried chicken wings and eggnog waffle with strawberry butter!! Soooo good!!! Melba stopped by our table as the food was coming out to make sure the mac and cheese looked creamy enough. She was so attentive throughout the evening. She helped her staff. So hands on. A true Harlem native who isn't too grand or Hollywood. I took a picture with her as I was leaving. She's the sweetest lady ever!!!
2/19/2014,4 star rating,Cozy restaurant with good music and great food. Came with the boyfriend and we loved the atmosphere and food. I got the salmon with spinach and mac n cheese - all excellent. My bf ordered chicken and waffles which apparently won a (well deserved) award on bobby flays throw down. Service was okay. Can't wait to return and try out other options.
12/5/2016,4 star rating,"I rarely find food that makes me feel like touting how good it was.  However I must say that the food her was excellent. I had short ribs with potato salad and sautéed spinach, the ribs and potato salad were some of the best I have ever had, the spinach was just average. The servers were extremely friendly although a little slow. I will definitely be eating here again."
9/27/2017,2 star rating,"I wasn't very hungry at a recent dinner visit, so I decided to combine an app and a side for my meal. I ordered the short rib sliders appetizer ($9.95) and the ""chili"" onion rings side. They arrived all on the same plate along with a small cup of ketchup. There were 2 teeny tiny sliders and 3 onion rings, so I actually flagged the waitress down to confirm that this was a full appetizer and side order. I also inquired where the ""chili"" came in to play for the chili onion rings, which neither tasted like chili (in fact they were shockingly bland, massive amounts of tasteless breading overpowering the onion), nor came with a chili sauce on the side. She said it was in the batter (maybe they forgot it this time)? The sliders tasted good, but they were so itty bitty for $5 apiece. My companion had a fish entree which was a more reasonable serving size and presentation, and tastier. Still, not sure I'll be back."
1/1/2010,4 star rating,"Saw this on Bobby Flay's TV show and had to try. The restaurant is pretty small but it is very welcoming. It is more of a brunch style breakfast in comparison to any cheaper breakfast that you can get, The food was good. I ordered the cheesy grits which were good. I had many grits in my life and these were yummy. In your head you may think ""Grits from a restaurant ?"". These were not watery, but full of flavor. I ordered the waffles with the strawberry butter, pretty delicious however when you look in comparison to the price they were on the expensive side. All in all nice place to visit, not to frequent."

They were patient, efficient and definitely helped to make the evening a success.Melba's is a fantastic restaurant with good food, great service and an overall festive atmosphere. Run, don't walk there now!"
5/14/2016,2 star rating,"Okkkkkay, so this food was okay at best. The service was really great but the seasoning of this soul food was off. The crab cakes are basically the size of a small donut hole  with breading for days and at 10 dollars for a crab cake that size is highway robbery. I was really excited about this restaurant as a visitor, but to be honest if you know good soul food you may be disappointed in this place."

11/7/2015,1 star rating,"Very Unprofessional! I was supposed to have a dinner party there that I booked three weeks in advance. I confirmed a few times and they let me know they they could accommodate everybody. I was told to call back the day before my birthday and let them know the exact number of people so they could be prepared. When I called to do as they asked,- the day before my birthday,they informed me that they had double booked and couldn't accommodate me .The day before my birthday I had to scramble and find a new place for myself and my twenty guest. I spent hours looking for a new place and calling all of my guests letting them know what happened.Thankfully I found a new restaurant to help me . For a restaurant that it supposed to pride themselves on comfort food, they left a very bad taste in my mouth."
4/18/2014,4 star rating,"After teaching a class at Wadleigh High school a few blocks away I decided that I was craving some soul food. I googled the place and read that there is often a long line. When I strolled up there was absolutely no way. I was floored. I ordered 2 drinks and the Pulled BBQ Short Rib Sliders with cheddar cheese. They were really delicious and perfectly sized for an appetizer (I'm 6'2"" 234lbs) that'll leave you satisfied. The crowd was a comfortable mix of young urbanites and a few tourists.  After chatting it up with a few folks at the bar  and destroying the delicious sliders I ordered the Southern (smothered) Chicken w/ a side of candied yams & Mac. The Yams were delicious (could've been a little sweeter). The Mac was on point. I almost cried while eating it. Moderately priced and a solid atmosphere. Check this place out."
7/30/2018,5 star rating,Wow!! so amazing. The service was outstanding. Brian was our perfect waiter. Everyone so attentive. love that! The food so delicious. We were a party of 8 and EVERYONE loved their meal.  You gotta come here. We're coming back for sure
3/18/2017,2 star rating,"Don't recommend! Terrible service, menu is not impressive, nothing that you can not make at home. I got fried chicken with grits, portions was so small for $16 . Waiter was moving with a speed of turtle . And then whe we waited for food for 45 Min and we got things in small pieces. When we made a complaint she manager said he will take care of the bill and give a discount for cold food entries but that did not happened!!! Anyways don't waist you money and time on this!"
4/1/2018,5 star rating,"OMG.... this place is awesome, you have to make your reservation ahead of time and if you don't its worth the wait. The food is amazing, I dont really get desert but I did and the coconut layer cake is the thing to get. The staff is very pleasant, and friendly, my waiter and the host even though it was pack in there always came by to make aure we we ok. I love this place."
3/12/2017,5 star rating,I learned from Melba's through the podcast The Friend Zone. And I went last night with my mother for a little mother/daughter date. And I LOVED IT. My waiter was friendly as heck. And the food and drinks were great. I mean we waited by the door and in NYC it's cold so we kept feeling the cold air when it open and closed. But other than that the whole experience was great. I'll will be back real soon.
12/26/2016,3 star rating,"Note: BASED ON CHICKEN WAFFLE//Was seated quickly for a Sunday morning brunch. Ordered the infamous chicken and eggnog waffle. Chicken was met standard chicken expectations. However, that waffle had no business being that good. It was so good it made the rest look average. In my comprehensive review/overall Melba's was everything you would expect. Above average but would not go out of my way solely for a waffle."

5/29/2015,5 star rating,"I've been watching ""Consumed"" and really wanted to try and glad to venture into Harlem.  The location was good except I didn't know that 8th Ave. was the same as Frederick Douglass Blvd., so got to see a little of the hood while looking for Melba's.  The place was hopping and the staff were friendly and eager to please.  Cocktails were yummy and food were so delicious and satisfying. Comfort food indeed.  Can't wait to go back but can't go too often without working out.  That fried chicken with eggnog waffles will settle in these thighs quickly!! Thumbs up for Melba's."
11/28/2017,1 star rating,"Went in with my daughter for brunch. Waiter walks up to table and says, "" are you ready to order ? "" .  I said to the young man that we haven't even looked at the menu. I said how about taking a drink order. A few minutes later three Caucasian ladies sit net to us and he warmly greets them with "" Good afternoon, my name is @&$hole and I will be your server today, can I get you something to drink? Because my daughter was with me I didn't get to say what I really wanted to say.  I called the young man over and said, I'm sorry what's your name? I didn't get it in the beginning. A total sellout. Crap waiter. Had to ask for Ketchup, my side dish and syrup for waffles. Know the power of minority money."
2/17/2017,4 star rating,"Great ambience, great food. Spring rolls were a fun/different starter. Chicken and waffles is obviously the move. Could have taken or left dessert. Funny that they don't serve diet soda. Live music started at 8:30p and was excellent."

10/4/2014,4 star rating,"I fell in love with Melba's since she was on the Bobby Flay show & beat him. My cousin took me here for my birthday. We waited a hour to be seated. Unfortunately we got there there a large group and they took their time leaving. But the Host made sure we was okay and went to the group nicely,  time to time to give them a hint. I must say the food was well worth the wait. I'm not sure if it's true but they said you can't make reservations which is something that needs to be done. Its a VERY small spot &  EXTREMELY loud. Be mindful if your going at night."
12/4/2013,4 star rating,"Really nice, relaxed atmosphere, accommodating servers, and delicious food!  They were very kind to our kids too. Now the food-Best fried chicken I've ever had! The egg nog waffles were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. I wish I could come here weekly! Next time we come to New York we will be coming back! If you're in the area and haven't stopped in, you need to!"
9/5/2014,5 star rating,"It was my first time at Melba's and it was amazing!! I had the southern fried chicken and waffles (the fried chicken tasted like heaven and the waffle was so sweet and filling) and macaroni. It was an exceptional meal. We also had an amazing waitress named Jackie, true southern hospitality. Definitely plan on going again!"
7/28/2015,3 star rating,"I passed this place so many times, I wasn't very flattered with the outdoor color and tiny dining room until Friday night, searching for food, I noticed crowds of people of all ethnicity's going in and out. A friend and I agreed! Melba's it is!!! As we checked the menu it was mouth watering, and the prices were very reasonable. We asked the Host for a table of two; she replied we have a few tables paying, I'll give them a few minutes. Few minutes went by we sat immediately on a Friday night! Yay!!!! We then met our server, very nice guy, a little overwhelmed with tables but still patient. We started off with wine-Chardonnay. There were so many delicious items on the menu I had no idea what to choose. After contemplating I chose jumbo shrimp with two sides, sweet potatoes and Mac & Cheese. As we waited the playlist was great. Oldies RnB brings great conversation. Dinner took about 15 minutes. Hot and yummy smelling. I was extremely happy to eat all of my food, no leftovers. The shrimp were actually jumbo, sweetest potatoes and melty Mac! I loved the food as well as customer service, I'm very excited to try again! I can't wait for brunch I hear it's a busy one I'll try to get there early. Thanks Melba's stay great"
2/20/2017,5 star rating,"I had the best time ever at Melba's tonight. It was my very first time, and I had a great waiter, Fallou - who after listening to my preferences- he suggested a great drink and then I was confident enough to entrust my entree, sides and second drink recommendation to him! I'm glad I took his advice to try the oxtail, sautéed spinach and mac and cheese because they were flat out amazing! The Harlem Iced tea was strong (just as I like it!). Overall, the service there was great. Another waiter -who wasn't even serving my friend and I - stopped by to check on us. Kudos to Melba and the team on service, food, drinks and ambience..I'm excited about becoming a regular!"
7/12/2013,2 star rating,"Even with good food, customer service goes a long way. It would seem that Melba's is non-accommodating to big groups unless you would like to pay ahead for everyone in a contract. I was trying to plan a dinner for about 10-12 people for my husband's birthday. Nothing out of the norm, but a simple get together where we have a table large enough for us, everyone eats and pays for themselves. When I contacted Melba's about a reservation, I was then told that they would have to satisfy the ""event"" with a pre-fixe menu which I guess was fine - though some of the pricing changed days later (a forgotten upcharge). What I was not expecting was to sign a two-page contract paying 100% (not even a deposit) for everyone under one form of payment. I am a recent newlywed and even when we hosted a private event and paid for everyone, we were never told to pay for everything upfront in full. While I do understand that restaurants have to protect themselves in the even of no shows, etc. this was a bit extreme. When I responded with my dislike, I was then told they couldn't do the pre-fixe but would just hold the reservation and have everyone pay individually. LOL! Hello, that is what I wanted to do in the first place and it took...well over a week to go around in this circle. As the dinner is next Friday, I am thankful I thought of a just in case plan at another restaurant who can accommodate our dinner party without trying to get full payment, etc. I have been to other soul food places in the area as well as other establishments, and it's not out of the norm to make a reservation for 10 people. I never asked for the red carpet or special event, but a mere reservation that they were unable to satisfy until AFTER I complained about having to sign a contract.Thanks but no thanks."
6/18/2016,5 star rating,"Right up there with Sylvia this is a contender for the best soul food in Harlem. Delicious fried chicken and good sides---mac & cheese is delicious and the sautéed spinach is great (fresh and not too greasy or oily). I would not, however, recommend the Yukon potatoes, which were a bit underwhelming. Nevertheless, everything else was good enough to earn Melba's five stars."
10/6/2016,4 star rating,"This place rest in the heart of the Heroin traffic dating back to 1966.  Where Melba is located you could not walk down the streets, due to wall to wall drug addicts.  Today it's a change place.  The food is great.    Melba is small so get there early.  They going to expand so look out Great place"
2/27/2013,4 star rating,"Yeah girls night out! I've wanted to check out Melba's  for awhile!! Did u know that the owner of Melba's and the late, great Sylvia (of uptown eatery SYLVIA'S) were related?!  There's a bit of useless trivia for ya!So I decided to make 3 apps my entree. Crab cake, catfish strips, and Tres mac n cheese! WHAT THE FRAGGERNACKLE!!? What kind of crack like substance do they fry the catfish in/ with?! So. Damn. Good!  The Mac n Cheese.. Def memorable! One of the best I've had! Drank Peach Moscato and capped off the night w/ chocolate mousse cake! Listen to me.  Are you listening?! My tummy would not lead u astray...make reservations and get in there.  We went right after work 5:30 and there was no crowd!  DEFINITELY GOING BACK! Service was wonderful and the DJ was spinning the old school R&B that made me wanna hit a basement party for real!"
12/11/2014,3 star rating,"While the place is not that big and we had to wait slightly...it was well worth the wait. The host was very attentive and pretty much nailed the orders except for a 2 missing sides which was better than expected when dealing with a large group. The food is great--chicken and waffles (are a must try), catfish, mac & cheese, collards, cabbage, etc. Food came out hot and portions were good. Only complaint is that desserts were OVERPRICED! I think it is unreasonable and a rip off to charge your patrons $6 for a small saucer bowl (looks like a 1/2 scoop) of ice cream. And no, I am not talking about any kind of gourmet ice cream. Regular store bought ice cream. I paid over $12 on ice cream alone for the 2 children I had with me. That is turn off, particularly b/c it was for a child and perhaps should have been charged a kids meal type of fee...say $3.Hope to visit again but no time soon and definitely wont do dessert."
10/25/2015,4 star rating,"Most amazing thing on the menu is their eggnog waffle (must try). Chicken and Mac and cheese are just above ok, but that waffle is definitely worth going there for. Drinks are also good and strong. The service is great, very friendly staff."
8/18/2017,2 star rating,"I had the BBQ meatloaf with Mac & cheese with collard greens. Majority of my plate was collard greens with one small scoop of mac & cheese with a big chunk of meatloaf. The meatloaf is absolutely disgusting!! It was just a big pile of mush with too much peppers and onions, where's the flavor? It was the consistency of baby food. Yuck. My boyfriend had the southern chicken with mashed potatoes and Mac & cheese. The mashed potatoes were gross as well. The potatoes tasted weird, it was like mashed potatoes with cinnamon and garlic. I'm giving two stars because the Mac & cheese and collard greens were good. - the restaurant had guests who were obnoxiously loud, & they were not told to lower their tone. I couldn't even hear what my boyfriend was saying across the table."
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"Both times I visited Melba's I was not disappointed.  You can not go wrong with the chicken and waffles, but my fiance got the Wild Atlantic Salmon, which was delicious too.  I recommend going on Wednesdays because their happy hour is extended til 8 and you $5 cocktails, beers, and wine.  The staff is lively, friendly, and courteous.  I felt like they didn't just want me to have a good meal, but a good time as well.  I'll definitely be visiting again soon :)"
6/25/2017,1 star rating,"I am sitting in Melba's 55 minutes after I walked in the door and I don't even have a drink. The appetizers just arrived, the catfish strips are good; however, waiting almost an hour is unacceptable. Oh now here comes 3 of the 6 drinks that were ordered of course mine is on of the ones that have not arrived. 15 more minutes pass and now my drink arrives. 10 more minutes out comes the food. So 1 hour and 20 minutes it took us to get our food. Meanwhile 2 couples that entered after us. Have finished their food, one has even left. A Melba's version of a LIT ( I forget what the name was) was ordered and it came without the Iced tea. It was explained the they were short handed and the bartender was fairly new; however, I am a paying customer when I come to an establishment I am expecting to not experience any of the behind the scene issues. I want to eat and drink and enjoy my evening. Over all the food was good but not good enough to make me forget the horrible experience!!"
2/21/2016,4 star rating,Phenomenal Food. Good service. Just be prepared for a Loooooooong wait...Its definately  worth it though
4/1/2016,3 star rating,"The fried chicken is the best I've had. Ever. It's pricey, but I have to remember it's Melba's in NYC. The collard greens were bitter and had too many large stems in them (I hate that). The rice and beans (they call them ""down home beans"", but it's black-eyed peas) was horrible...just horrible...super dry and had no flavor. My mother's from the south and I know the black-eyed peas are supposed to be juicy (like in a gravy) and super flavorful. My partner's beef short ribs were amazingly good. I got a glimpse of the onion rings and mac & cheese at a neighboring table, and they look amazing so I'll try those next time. To my horror, they don't serve corn bread!!!! Whaaaaat?!?! A soul food that doesn't serve corn bread is like a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve chips and salsa. Unbelievable."

8/7/2015,5 star rating,"No question, 5 stars. Stunning food and service. Harlem Iced Tea is strong AND delicious. Waffles, catfish, and Mac & Cheese are all The Very Best. I sat at the bar - very helpful, attentive staff. Really an amazing experience. And for real: the best Mac & Cheese in my life."
6/18/2018,2 star rating,The chicken and waffles are not that good and service was slow.  Not worth the cab ride all the way to Harlem.
5/13/2015,4 star rating,"I would give it 3.5 stars. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned, but the Mac and cheese was mostly cheese on top and noodles. It didn't have the creamy base I like from a good homemade roux. Service was friendly enough, and the butter with the waffle was delicious."
6/16/2016,3 star rating,"I know that this will come as a surprise.  I wanted to try this restaurant because I heard Melba on a radio talk show. She made it so enticing that I had to go on my birthday weekend. I went with family before an Apollo show.  We didn't wait because we had a reservation, which was a good thing.  Fast forward we ordered our drinks & food, which came in good time. The white sangria although good came in such a small glass.   I ordered short ribs of beef.  I was surprised that the meat was tough and stringy, chewy and it was a small portion.  The bbq sauce it bathed & saturated  in was way too sweet. Its almost as if they used the bbq sauce to hide the inferior quality of beef.  My sister ordered turkey meatloaf which  was flavorless and unseasoned and it looked undercooked. She said it wasn't very good. I'm not in the business to give bad reviews but I was disappointed in our meal. Maybe I'll give it one more chance , but I'll try  the chicken and waffles that everyone raves about."
2/27/2010,4 star rating,"2015 update: Featured on CNBC's Consumed.Wanted to come for Harlem RW but caved and got some dinner takeout instead. Called in and picked up an order (no desserts, though? Really now? I know I should be happy, but I'm not.)Ambiance/service: I'm sure Food Network helped the business out (though I didn't get the chickeneggnogwaffleswithstrawberrybutter). The interior was different than I'd expected (but nice) & the music was too capricious even in the 5 minutes I was there. The guy who greeted me at the bar was clearly ripped and brought out a bag with one item inside and asked if it was OK they didn't have a fork to go in said bag. I said it was fine but made sure both of my items were inside--they weren't, good thing I asked. When he returned (within 20 seconds), crab cakes and a fork/spoon/napkin packet both magically placed themselves in plastic and materialized in my bag.Food: The cheesy grits, with which I don't have much experience, were merely cheese holding together grits at the bottom. That's not to say they weren't good, they were damn good. The crab cakes were enormous and incredible, as was the dipping sauce. The bed of greens on which they sat was also good, an aspect of a dish some places often overlook when it comes to appetizers. The mac & cheese was a bit dry but still very very tasty, and the pecan-crusted tilapia was full of flavor (though the pecans must've escaped my tray before I got to them). Overall, it was expensive but definitely a lot of (really good) food."

3/9/2014,4 star rating,"Melba's is a modest cozy dinner spot that's comparable to its cooking cousin Sylvia's of Harlem. My wife and I entered this restaurant on Valentines Day without a RSVP but was shortly afterwards accommodated for the evening. The decor had a smoky flavor , with romantic candlelit tables and smooth background music that added a good vibe to its ambience. The delectable food more than made up for the pokey service. My wife ate the scrumptious southern-fried catfish  and the best melt in mouth eggnog waffles barnone. I devoured some of the greatest battered dip fried shrimp  not from Louisiana and the addictive cheesiest macaroni. So, for all  those hearty Soul Food lovers,  go and pay a visit to Melba's and  to set your taste buds on fire. You'll be glad you came."
6/2/2016,4 star rating,"Some of the best fried catfish I've ever had. However, I was a little disappointed to have to pay an extra $7 for eggs to go along with my fish and grits. Also, we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. But we were seated in 30 minutes so that was a pleasant suprise. The waitress was very nice and accomodating! Overall...I would definitely go to Melba's again."
5/18/2015,4 star rating,"Visited Melba's on a Saturday evening. Cozy restaurant with a very nice ambiance. For such a small restaurant on a Saturday night, the wait time was not too bad. I tried the fried chicken with mac and cheese and collard greens and it was very good. Will visit again."
1/12/2013,2 star rating,"Hmmm I decided to give Melba's a 2nd chance before I decided to write a review. As mentioned like other Yelpers if you are going to charge folks $15 - $20 for an Entree you should be licking the plate or take leftovers home. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that a sistah is doing her thing in one of of the toughest industries but if you are specializing in Soul Food please have some ""corn bread"". Me and my bf were surprised they did not put any kind of bread on the table when we first sat down. We asked the waitress if they have corn bread and she said ""no"". Really!!I ordered the catfish which was pretty tasty. The candid yams were ok. The greens were a bit salty. My bf ordered the meat loaf, yams and greens. The meat came in 2 small pieces. Truthfully his food was served on a smaller plate and it looked like a kids meal. Seriously!!! I felt bad because he's a pretty big guy and he was still hungry after he finished his meal. The manager tried to make up for the portion by offering him a piece of red velvet cake. It was a nice gesture but I'm sure he would of rather have a descent size meal instead of dessert.The restaurant is pretty small. The tables are very close together you have to squeeze yourself in to sit down. The background music did set a nice vibe. The ambiance was cute and trendy. I am a big supporter of black owned businesses but if you are going to serve Soul Food in Harlem please serve some ""corn bread""."
9/27/2017,1 star rating,Food was average and it was uncomfortably hot- 80 degrees. Unacceptable. The food was not fresh. It was microwaved and soggy. Not a good look.
1/24/2013,4 star rating,"I dined here in Decemeber for a girlfriend's birthday. Naturally, most of us ordered the chicken and waffles. Now, while the waffles were yummy (the flavor was great but personally 2 out of 3 of mine were a lil moister than I'd like) the chicken is CRACK.Crack.Crack.CRACK. The cocktails were great and our  was a sweetie pie. So please, go there and eat the damn chicken. For real. We even asked our server (I think his name was Andrew?  I might be making that up...) if there was crack in the chicken. He laughed...which is not denial.Eat well, kids."
11/28/2012,4 star rating,"Sometimes when I go to cool places in Harlem I kind of envision myself living there and then I slap myself back to reality.  I'm a BK girl all the way.  However, that doesn't stop me from trying out some cool spots in the area.  My friend had been raving about Melba's for a while so another friend and I took the opportunity to dine there on a Tuesday night. We came around 6 without a reservation and we were told that we could be seated but that we would have to wrap up by 8 for a large party with reservations.  We agreed and were promptly seated. Rotating DJs, a vibrant after work crowd, dim lighting, and intimate seating set the mood for  the night.  The service is pretty impeccable.  The very courteous and professional staff throughout the night was really impressive. It felt like every other person that walked in was a friend of Melba's which is always a good sign.There was a cocktail lady passing out free samples  of Chambord Liqueur which was a nice little treat.  I had the sangria which was tasty but I initially felt needed to be stronger,  however it may have been my very delicious meal that sopped up all the alcohol floating around in my body.  I couldn't resist and I went for the chicken and waffles.  So dang good.  The chicken had a light coating and didn't have a saturated greasy taste and the waffles were like 3 mini clouds on a plate.  My friend had the tilapia with spinach and rice and peas which he really enjoyed.  Tuesday nights they have ""Open Mic.""  We were only there for the beginning so I'm not sure what it was really about but the host was cracking jokes and people seemed really into it.  Why Hello Harlem.  I think you're starting to grow on me!"
6/15/2015,5 star rating,"Melba's is a requirement on almost every trip to Harlem to visit my boyfriend. It's a neighborhood favorite, the food is DELICIOUS, the staff is super friendly, and I've even made new friends as the patrons are just as friendly and in great spirits, all b/c of the food I'm sure. The beef shorts ribs, mac and cheese and greens are to die for. Pretty much everything in the menu is great, but do yourself a favor and order the mac and cheese as a side. It's a very relaxed, but small restaurant, so come prepared to have a great meal, in an intimate space, with a possible wait that will be well worth it."

Clearly home-cooking.  Only negative- place is really small and was a little loud for us to converse, but we would absolutely go back again and recommend it to anyone in the area."
8/24/2016,3 star rating,"I had the Southern Fried Chicken with Egg Nog waffles. It was good, but the waffles were kind of dry. The chicken tasted great, crispy, hot (temp), and juicy. The waffle just didn't cut it for me. The mac and cheese and salmon was delicious though! Worth a try if you like comfort. But not the place for chicken n waffles in my opinion."
2/20/2013,5 star rating,"This place has to be the best soul food you can come across. Nothing beats Grannies cooking but this hit's the spot. If you are familiar with southern food, you will not be disappointed. The strawberry butter makes the food even more succulent once it's placed on the waffle. I obviously recommend the chicken and waffles just because this is great combination. I always like to observe other's and what they are eating and it seemed like each person at this restaurant ordered something different. That means they obviously offer a variety of good food like mac and cheese, greens, smothered potatoes,  collard greens, and sweet potato pie. This place makes me feel so cozy and sleepy. Make sure to run some laps after you eat here !"

10/4/2015,4 star rating,I came here for my birthday wi th my sister and we had a great time. The food was really good and seasoned to perfection. We really came here to try the mac and cheese but it didn't live up to all the hype. The atmosphere was very pleasing and I will be back.

5/15/2016,4 star rating,"I've eaten here over a dozen times and the food is great. Mac & cheese, yams and collard greens are all consistently good. The wait staff are all friendly and attentive. The space is small and there can be a long wait. I've tried calling many times to make a reservation and the phone just rang with no answer. There is no waiting area so you may have to wait outside. But the food is fantastic so I will keep going back."
4/30/2017,5 star rating,My friend recommended here for my bday dinner and I must say the service was excellent and so was the food. I had the catfish and it was excellent. I would definitely eat here again.
4/24/2013,5 star rating,This is my favorite restaurant in Harlem... Tuesday nights in Melba's is the best place to be in NYC!
6/20/2013,3 star rating,"The food is always so delicious! The service is on the poor side. The hostess barely greets you, and there is no real area to wait for your table. The corridor is actually the door way, which is actually a few short steps from the bar. This gives you a very suffocated- jamed  feeling as you enter. You can even almost be unnoticed.The tables could be cleaner. The wait staff is usaully professional and friendly and the food is super tasty. The food takes longer than you'd expect it to but once you have it, it's delectable!  Waffles are delicious and the mac and cheese is the best in harlem! The pricing is perfect for the portioned served.  I wish they offered takeout."
8/4/2013,4 star rating,"I recently had the Southern fried chicken and eggnog waffle. The fried chicken was incredible- super juicy, good size, and fried in delicious batter. While the waffle was good, it was a bit on the dense side. I wish it would have been fluffier and lighter. The restaurant inside is pretty nice and the service is friendly and attentive. Overall, a solid place for good Southern food."
10/12/2012,2 star rating,"I have tried a couple of ""soul food"" places and this is my conclusion. If you are paying more than $15 for soul food that consists of fried chicken and waffles, it's absolutely not worth it. You know what I would rather have? Popeyes chicken, Kentucky Fried Chicken. I am officially DONE paying more than $15 for bland dry chicken at these so called great soul food restaurants. Don't waste your time. Go to KFC or Popeyes instead. You will be much more satisfied."

7/16/2017,1 star rating,Not too sure about who's doing the cooking.   Had brunch salmon croquettes were mushy same consistency as my grits.   The portion was so small felt like they didn't want to cook anymore grits so they split the portion that they had left between he three of us.  I actually came home and ate.   Not satisfying at all.   But hey. You live and learn.   Maybe good for some folks.  Just not for me
1/25/2015,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's for my buddy's birthday dinner. I really didn't know what to expect from a self described ""soul food"" place. The server recommended tchicken and waffles as their signature dish. And O M G... It was amaz-balls. On paper, chicken and waffle combo doesn't seem appetizing. But at Melba's, the chicken and waffle dish was the best sweet and savory mixture I've had. The chicken was tendor, and the buffalo and maple sauce mixture was the icing on the cake. The outside the place doesn't look great, but it's a great low key intimate date spot. Highly recommended."

1/20/2015,4 star rating,Melba is like a little mom and pop up scale type situation !I loved it! It's super small in there though.  Like everyone is in arm length of your table. people next to you are like 4 inches away people behind you like 5 inches away. I am happy we caught an empty night in Melba's. I think that if there was another soul in that dang on building we would have went into a panic. I order the fried fish ( a little salty for me) mac and cheese and greens. EVERYTHING was good though! Personally I dont do much salt if any on my food. The guys I were with went ham on the rolls! They actually ordered a few of those. I would recommend it for night with bae. Drinks are a little pricey but gives you that punch.
1/18/2015,2 star rating,"I had been to Melba's for a drink a few times and tried a few appetizers.  I had enjoyed those experiences and decided to have dinner with my wife in the restaurant.  The night we came the waiter brought out the food but unfortunately had dropped both plates and broke them in the process while spilling water and some food on me.  My wife fortunately did not get anything on her.  I honestly felt bad for the waiter so I did my best to downplay what just happened.  The waiter did apologize.  Our new meals came out about 15 minutes later.  We ate, paid the check and then left.What stood out is that no one on the staff came up to my wife and I and offered a complimentary drink, dessert, whatever which would have been a nice gesture.  It just felt strange because with all the other soul food spots to choose from in the area, service should be memorable at all times for the right reasons.  I wrote an e-mail to Melba's to not put them on blast about my experience which happened in the fall but never got a response so wanted the public to know since the restaurant didn't feel the need to reply."

1/13/2015,3 star rating,"Food was delicious, it's just the overall experience that makes me give it 3 stars instead of 4. I honestly didn't know it was that small inside but that wasn't a big deal. What WAS a big deal is that despite the outside awning/door before the actual front door (I don't know what those things are called, forgive me) and despite the big thick, black curtain separating the front door from the dining space, it was really cold in there. Obviously they know it and tried their best but either they need a new heating system or there's some cracks that need to be sealed. Anyway, the service was interesting. We never had one person introduce themselves as our server, rather it was a number of people who did random things. One dropped off the scones, one poured the water, one took our order, another one brought me the teabags for my hot tea, another brought the food out, another one brought us a dessert menu after we ate and someone else brought the check and returned it. None of that was an issue. What WAS an issue was that it took a good 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. It wasn't crowded, we got there shortly after they opened for Sunday brunch. Food came out quick and HOT and like I said above, it was delicious (I had the catfish and eggnog waffles; my companion had the chicken and waffles but said her chicken was overcooked and dried out). The waffles were perfect texture and really good. But, after we ate, we had to flag someone down to take our plates away (which remember the place isn't big). Then we sat for another 10-15 minutes when some random person popped over with dessert menus and tried to convince us to order. Maybe next time as I'd like to go back for dinner eventually."
1/9/2015,4 star rating,"A group of us, 6 people, made reservations for a b'day dinner. We adjusted the reservation and made it for 45 minutes later than originally planned. The place is SUPER small; literally only about 20 people can fit inside, so we had to wait for about an hour despite having the reservation, so we set at the bar to pass the time and soothe our sorrows. The bartender helped us immediately and was very kind. She also ended up being our waitress, which was kind of funny. The food came quickly and was A-MAZ-ING! I had the salmon, macaroni and cheese, collard greens and candied yams. Everything was perfect. They (the bartender not the actual wait staff, which was lacking) did a great job serving the cake as well. We had fun, despite the faux pas. I would definitely go again. I want to try everything they have."
1/9/2015,1 star rating,"Let me preface this by saying that I've eaten here on quite a few occasions & the food was always great. This review is more about the lack of optimal service during my last & final visit here. Therefore, It's really unfortunate, but zero stars would be a better representation of my last experience at Melba's. This review is way overdue as my nightmare happened back on November 17th, my beloved Mother's 65th birthday. We were a party of 4 & arrived 30 minutes late for our dinner reservations. The place was quite busy but because we were late we didn't mind patiently waiting to be seated. After 45 minutes of standing in the overcrowded entryway/vestibule, & noticing that several parties that arrived after us had already ordered dinner- I politely asked the manager, Maurice, how much longer before we could be seated. He assured me that we would be seated in the next few minutes as soon as a couple seated near the live band got up to leave. Fair enough...After-all, it was freezing outside (every time the door opened we were reminded of this), it was getting late, I had raved about this place to my Family & I wanted to treat my Mom to a great local spot for her bday. After, the couple left, the table was cleared & my fam & I started to remove our coats, hats etc in preparation to be seated. Well, to our disbelief, Mr. Maurice sat another party who had just arrived at the same table he offered to us. Needless to say, I was LIVID!!! His reasoning was that because we were late, he had to seat other customers 1st blah blah blah. Ok, fine- but how long does this rule stand? We were standing in a walkway/vestibule/entryway for an hour. My Mom is 65!  I was really disappointed & embarrassed because I recommended this place to my family for my Mom's bday. I didn't want to make a a big deal of it & further ruin my Mom's eve so we quietly left.  THANK GOD FOR CHOCOLAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We enjoyed a delicious, intimate dinner w/ very tasty dessert! YUM! I called Maurice that night & got the same unapologetic, scripted, crappy a** excuse. He had the audacity to say he came outside to look for us when he noticed that we had left. Really?? Then, he told me to return the following night for Mom's dinner. No thanks Mr. Manager; tomorrow isn't her birthday! I'm sure the owner of Melba's would be less than satisfied w/ this kind of treatment. Then again, if Maurice is the best demonstration of managerial expertise- maybe not!"
1/9/2015,5 star rating,The customer service from Daiquan was amazing. He tended to every need from taking our orders and giving suggestions to giving us extra strawberry butter for our waffles. He even somehow knew I was gonna call him even when he wasn't looking my way. Never had to look for him because he was right there   And the food?!?! OMG it was beyond amazing. The southern fried chicken and eggnog waffles went great with the strawberry butter and maple syrup. Melba's spring rolls was really good. It's actually better than regular spring rolls at a point. Wished the spinach and cheese empanadas didn't take 40 mins to cook but Daiquan kept us updated on wether they were still coming or not. The Mac n cheese and candied yams were suggested as sides and damn good as well. Now for dessert we haven't ordered that yet but I'm sure it's on the high horse. Definitely will be coming back. When coming in though it's either a hit or a miss when it comes to seating considering its a small venue that seats 36 ppl comfortably. It can get crowded quickly.
1/9/2015,5 star rating,"Serviced by Daquan, Attentive and very imformative. Comfortizers: my best friend and i had the catfish and the spring roll which our server recomended. He did not lie; the spring roll is really good my friend who always orders spring rolls really likes it. ""Its better than the Thai spring rolls."" Not a fan of fish but trying catfish for the first time I really like it. It soft and moist and has flavor. A squeeze of lime for zest and its even better paired with chipotel sauce.  We both had the eggnog waffle; she had dark meat and white meat for myself. It was stupendous. Side orders because we were being excessive as always we got, candy yams and Mac and cheese. Great by themselves and together. Did I really forget the strawberry butter!!! Oh it's comes with the waffles but you can order extra. The Venue: it's a tight neat place so if coming with a group, say more than 2-4, reservations are recomended. You will be looking at a 45 min wait, which is worth it if you are willing to wait. There is a bar which you can seat at will ordering drinks until your table(s) is/are ready.#Yelpon"
6/4/2013,4 star rating,"This past Sunday a dear friend of mind came to NYC for his birthday. We had dinner at Melba's and it was a good experience. I ordered the grilled salmon with mac & cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. The salmon was seasoned and prepared very well. The mac & cheese, although good, did not taste as if it was made to order (almost as if it was sitting in the pass or in the oven-you know what I mean right? The cheese wasn't all goey and falling all over the plate, it had hardened a little) and the garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. For dessert I opted for Grandma's sweet potato pie. GOT DAMN mama put her drawers in that pie! So sweet, potato-y and delicious!! The food I give it 4 stars, as there is always room for improvement. The service was also very good: on multiple occassions one of the staff members came up to our table to check on us (very nice Melba's). All in all, I was very satisfied after I left and look forward to coming back."

9/6/2015,4 star rating,"SO I live in Harlem and had some colleagues in from out of town so I took them to Melba's as I know that one of them from Atlanta is a big Chicken and Waffles fan.  Well that was enough to convince them.  I have been to Melba's several times and it seems like it keeps getting better and better.  Trent (Yes I actually remembered his name!!) was spot on and had several suggestions for us as we got 6 Chicken and Waffles and one Catfish (I had the catfish as I been eating too many desserts lately!)  Anyway we ended up getting the Collard Greens, Sauteed Spinach, and entree of Mac and Cheese, Catfish Fingers, Potato Salad and the garlic Mashed Potatoes!   YES, we tried them all!!  While not a huge potato person (again with the need to diet) I LOVED the garlic potatoes.  the Mack and cheese was very creamy and was great..... NOW we had a Unanimous decision that the Chicken and Buttermilk waffle was the best my people from ATL had ever had!!!  My Blackened Catfish was light and flaky and delicious  .....Great job AGAIN!!"
12/2/2012,4 star rating,"So I'm from LA and my idea of what soul food is is limited to Roscoe's. I can't trust anyone who thinks Melba's is comparable to Roscoe's because Roscoe's is overrated.Whenever I have friends visiting NYC, this is one of the places I bring them to.Plus: I've come here on several occasions and the food is typically on-point. They have the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted although you know they probably a trillion calories. With the waffles, the strawberry butter is to die for. The Harlem Iced Tea was of course really strong and more on the bitter side, which I like. The service is really friendly and sometimes, it's even Melba greeting you and checking up on how the food is. The environment is dim-lit and intimate so there are a lot of couples. Typically, the music is old-school R&B, which I absolutely love.Delta: For the fried chicken, you have a choice of dark and white meat (Of course, y'all know me. I LOVE my dark meat). I think my experience with the chicken though has been hit or miss in that sometimes the chicken is too dry for my liking even when I order dark meat. Sometimes, the wait can be irritating. One time, I was waiting for a friend and we were waiting for our third. They said they couldn't seat us because not all of us were there despite the fact that there were more than enough seats for everyone. We waited at the bar annoyed. The food is on the pricier side. Also, at times, this place can get really loud.I think I will continue bringing my friends here until I have a horrible experience. The food is just too good to not have my friends try.Tip: It seems a lot of couples follow the rule where the man sits on the outside and the woman sits on the inside part of the table in relation to the restaurant. Confusing, I know but I guess it's proper date etiquette.RatingsService/Wait time - 0.5Food/Drinks - 1Environment/Music - 1Price - 0.5Experience - 1Overall = 4"

4/1/2017,1 star rating,Complete waste of time. We called early to find out if they had space or reservations and were told to come in after 8pm which we did and apparently they have all reservations and are full all night. Waste of damn time coming to Harlem for a false pretense. Get your reservations together folks.
3/12/2013,4 star rating,"the fried chicen w/the eggnog waffles were really yummy. The strawberry butter, I personally thought that was inventive. Small cozy spot w/ some classy funkyness to it. I had the pleasure of meeting Melba, which made my 1st experience even more amazing. I told her that I saw her on food network w/ Bobby Flaye. Service was very nice oh and before I forget there sagria was pretty good!Go girl!!! #Melbas"
7/27/2015,3 star rating,"Typically when you make a reservation, you have about a 10-15 minute window where they would hold your table if you're running late. As a frequent restaurant goer, I know this and respect it, however my situation was very different. I made a reservation for 15 people, for a Bridal Shower Brunch from 12 - 2pm which, as listed in my contract, included a Prix fix menu and a $250 deposit. My group and I were running late and I called the restaurant to check in with them to mention that. The manager however claimed we had 10 more minutes to arrive before we lost our table. I hung up then immediately searched my email for the contract that I signed to see if there was any mention of late arrival, which was not mentioned. I called back and spoke with the hostess Destiny, who told me not to worry because we would not lose our table (SHOUT OUT TO DESTINY!). I was under the assumption that when you pay money to book a table for an allotted time listed in a contract, that is your table regardless of who is in the restaurant waiting to be seated (maybe I need to ask around on that one). We arrive at Melba's at 12:15 and the manager makes a sly comment to one of my friends that we made it just in time. Thankfully the food was good and the Bride enjoyed her meal. The chicken and waffles were really good and filling. I wanted about 2 more of those raisin biscuits they bring to the table once you're seated. Our waiter (I think Larro was his name..?) was friendly and got all the orders right, I know that can be difficult sometimes for a large party. Destiny came over to our table a few times to check on how we were doing, if we needed anything and how we liked the food. It could be due to the poor first impression but I am pretty sure the Manager was side eyeing our table the rest of the time we dined there. Lastly, I paid $2 more than the required deposit when I made my booking. It took an additional 15 minutes after pulling up my credit card form and bank statement to get the final bill correct, because the waiter had to get the manager's approval. Thanks to our waiter and Destiny for being friendly and accommodating for our party and even the extra late comers. I was disappointed at my first impression. I came Uptown from Brooklyn to support a black owned business (PLUG: I Don't Do Clubs -100 Black Owned Restaurants and Bars in NYC). Thankfully the food was worth the visit. I might come again to get take out."

11/7/2014,4 star rating,Good Food and Great Service. The Manager and staff are always very attentive. I recently went on a Tuesday night to celebrate my cousin's birthday. I had the turkey meatloaf with mac and cheese and Collard greens. It was very taste. The band on Tuesday nights is great. I highly recommend a visit especially on Tuesdays.
6/7/2019,2 star rating,"So tonight my bae and I went to Melba's for dinner and we were met with the wonderful manager who sat us immediately, but our server Fallou did not come to greet us for about 10 minutes once he finished flirting with the two young ladies who were seated next to us but after us. Once he was done with them he still did not come to us he left and went to another table where there were another two young ladies sitting. It was only when he noticed me looking at my watch with a annoyed look on my face that he came to us. When he approached our table there was no introduction like with the young women. There was no menu suggestions or even drink suggestions. We didn't even know his name until the bill came. I feel like if you are going to greet customers you greet them all not just the ones you that you can flirt with. Hopefully if we decide to return to this establishment and we get Fallou again it will be a better experience because tonight we weren't happy at all."
4/24/2011,2 star rating,"I have yet to say if this place is great or not just for the mere fact that customer service was horrendous and outrageous.  I decided to come here on a Thursday night after work to have dinner with my boyfriend and boyfriend's sister.  Now the point of bringing these special people was so they could experience some southern comfort food that has ""suppose"" great reviews. Well if this place deserved 5 stars- THAN YOU ALL ARE ON SOME SERIOUS DRUGS.  Most reviewers rate on food.  Food maybe the essential aspect of all dining experiences, but what about waiting until the ice age happens again, or be given flat soda and have the bartender know she/he was giving this to me flat but cared less if I noticed, or the most important part of dining the hostess not being clear on wait times because she wants to impress her boss that she has everything under control.WELL HELL NO!! When I arrived Thursday night it was close to 7pm.  I spoke to the hostess and explained I had a party of 3 with no reservation.  Granted she did explain that they were seating the reservations first and if I could wait 15 Minutes to see if the parties have arrived.  Never did she once say, if the parties are all here it may be a longer wait - as a matter of fact she never really told me anything.  I had to constantly harass her like an annoying customer to grab her attention that we are still waiting and only after an hour waiting did she ask for my name to be put on the list. WTFACKKK!I finally became agitated and noticed I have been waiting for nearly 2 hours - in any restaurant industry this is ridiculous. TGIF does better on wait times. I complained to the hostess and she kept trying to reassure me that customers were getting dessert menus, however, she had forgotten that she had two customers seated before me when I had arrived before that party.  which I was appalled to begin with.The sad part is that this place is not the originator.  Melba is the niece of the FOUNDER of ""chicken and waffles"" called Sylvia's which is only a couple blocks away from this place.Sylvia's has better service and seated within minutes upon arrival.  The only reason Melba's became so popular is because she did a segment with bobby flay on the food network channel for ONLY ""chicken and waffles"" and the popularity she received was astounding needless to say.  Overall, I would not come to this place for anything just because of the way I was treated.I hope that Melba restructures her establishment because it should be well noted that this is a reservation only restaurant and if its not, than there should always be a section for those who do not reserve.  It is not fair that a walk in has to wait nearly 2 hrs to eat dinner - that's appalling and rude. When I left this place, I decided to go to an Italian restaurant where I was seated instantly and the venue was as packed as Melbas.  This is the way customer service should be.So if you still want to come to Melbas be sure to make a reservations, if not, than you surely wait 2-3hrs for a table to clear.  Mice have better seating than an average citizen."

8/16/2012,4 star rating,"OK OK So I have to admit I havent been to melbas in a while.  Never on a Tuesday.  My sister and I usually catch it closing and grab a plate to go!!!  Its always packed. Last time I went we waited 20 minutes for a table and the food was eh...lets just say I had to go eat afterward!!!!!Anyhoot - I went with my mentor this past Tuesday and I must say the service and portions have been greatly improved.  Although overcooked (sea bass) oily fish must be handled delicately it was fried like a steak....not grilled as it should be...it was edible....3 mac and cheese was excellent and so was the spinach.   For appetizer I had calamari and spring rolls which were also delictible.  Calamari was NOT greasy (bonus points) .  I tried one of my mentors jumbo shrimp, it was a little salty for meLets talk about service.  Maitre D was on it.  Waitress ON it!  Host  ON IT!  when I say on it, I mean, came outside and said ""thank you"" Now I dont know if this was because of who I was with (my mentor is very known in NYC especially Harlem)  or because the brother from my social club was serenading the restaurant for the evening and he shouted me out....either way KUDOS because im yelping about it!Ambiance.  While I love my brother.  I think the restaurant needs to warn people about that.  If you come to have a cozy dinner in Harlem swanky spot...youll be overtaken in shock when this Petawane starts crooning a repetoire of hits stemming from the 50's to the present.  His show also includes welcome to guests and special friends.  No intimate conversation can happenOverall - since the last time ive been there..there has been an upgrade the food and service.  Im happy to experience sylvias niece is carrying the torch proudly in the restaurant business.  I am looking forward to her future expansion in Soha!"
3/28/2012,4 star rating,"One crisp, Fall afternoon my girlies and I headed north to Harlem to fill our tummies with soul food brunch. We walked in Melba's and immediately fell in love. It's a warm inviting atmosphere, while keeping an element of coolness with it's exposed brick and marble bar. The chicken and waffles is world famous and delicious. We did sides of grits and sweet potato pancakes and they were also fantastic. FFF (my fav foodie friend) is from the South and her Daddy whips up some stellar grits. Well, Melba's grits were just as good. I had an omelet that was good and with lots of fresh veggies, but no where near as tasty as the chicken and waffles I stole some bites of (rookie mistake I know - should have ordered the specialty). Melba herself made an appearance and chatted up the table next to us before we rolled all the way back downtown, full and happy."

So instead of a 1 star review based on service...the 4 star review was based on EXCELLENT food. I had the Salmon, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach...company had Fried Catfish, Mac & cheese and greens.  My salmon was a bit dry, but that was my fault for ordering it med-well...but the flavor profile was delish.  The catfish was heaven, light, flaky, crispy and perfectly seasoned...sides were great as well.Thanks to Matt, we'll be back:)"

I dutifully waited for them to open at 10am and saw my way in.  I was excited to be here.  The restaurant is smallish, but does have a rather nice bar prominently situated up front.  Plenty of seating fills out the rest of the space and accents like vintage chandeliers definitely add charm.  Miss Melba herself can be seen on the main floor, commanding the area effortlessly with her ever genial personality.  Melba's definitely has a neighborhood spot feel to it, and I enjoyed the coziness of the restaurant.  I courteously looked over the menu, but there could ever only be one choice for me:  chicken and waffles with a Sugar Hill beer (drink local) to wash them down.  Let me be clear about the waffles.  They are --egg nog-- waffles!  Yes, that delicious seasonal drink, which is probably runner's kryptonite for all practical purposes, forms the basis of the batter for the waffles.  Obviously, what results is a much richer waffle teeming with flavor that is deliciously pre-sweetened and flavored.  My dish served up three of them.  They look a bit small, but, being rich, they go a long way.  With a little bit of confectioner's sugar and a little bit of syrup, I managed to have some fairly decent waffles.  They were not heavy at all either.  The chicken was great too.  I had a choice of dark or white and opted for the dark.  The skin was tasty and crispy.  The fried chicken, comfort food at its best, was particularly comforting.  All in I had a great meal and particularly excellent service.  Overall, they are not the very best chicken and waffles I have had, but they are quite good; and that eggnog twist is something you will not find anywhere else.  Throw in a charming spot and happy people, well, you really can't miss with a visit here.  Definitely recommend!"
1/10/2007,5 star rating,"I've been living in Harlem all my life and always felt disappointed that I had to trek downtown to have a good time at quality establishment. However, I've been so impressed by the new restaurants and lounges that take the chic Soho-like formula and add a sexxxyy Harlem twist to it, making it hip to the core while not looking tacky or forced.    Anyway...Melba's. I was actually trying to get into Society Coffeehouse across the street but it was packed! My date and I waited a couple minutes to see if anyone left the tables but no luck. So we went across the street to Melba's. This is a chic, cozy restaurant. The decor is perfect. You even have your own DJ there after 7PM spinning the good stuff. We got in at 6:30 and by 7PM the place was packed. The bar area was full as well.    They've got Mojitos...awesome Mojitos! Chock full of mint leaves (best I've had in a long time). The signature drinks are a bit on the expensive side, but with the Happy Hour deal and all they came out to $6 a pop. I had a second Mojito free! I had a Po' Boy Catfish sandwich with spicy fries. Amazing...every morsel with the accompanying spread sauce! The fries had seasoning and were spicy. My date had the fried calamari. She loved it. Everything was enjoyable including our waiter. He couldn't have been more courteous, professional, and above all knowledgeable of the menu. I never felt we had to wait long. I didn't get his name but he was tall, lanky with short cut hair and square framed glasses. Really cool guy! Definitely come to Melba's! Perfect for friends, dates (and first dates), or just having a good meal! The pricing is just right too."
3/31/2011,1 star rating,"TO ALL 1 STAR READERS LISTEN UP:The review goes like this.... My gf and I went to Melba's to use our Groupon $40 discount (thank god we didn't pay full price!).  The first go around, we didn't make reservations despite trying to call to make one... they, however, don't answer there phone after 6pm.  So on the first go around, we didn't get a table because the restaurant was PACKED... a good sign we thought, so we decided to come back for another try a week later... boy were we wrong!Strike 1 On the second go around, despite making reservations for 7:15pm, we weren't seated until 7:30pm despite being early and arriving at 7pm... Strike 2 goes to the amount of time it took to even get served a drink and take our order (15 +15 more mins! = 30 mins of nothing but seating so far)Strike 3 went to cooking time.  I had the most expensive plate on the menu (The Sea Bass for $23) and she had their ""infamous"" chicken and waffles.... (Caution... dark meat takes 5 mins more?)... took 40 mins to get my puny dish, and another 10 mins for my date to get her's... we've now been here for over a hour, and they didn't even ask if we wanted more wine on the 2nd go around... and what's up with serving in 2 tranches? FOOD SHOULD COME TOGETHER PEOPLE!Strike 4 is THE FOOD:  Thinking the most expensive thing on the dish would be half good (THE SEA BASS) but nooo... it was tiny (compared to the people around me who ordered the sword fish, and other plates... mine had to be the smallest there... which prompted this review). It also was sub par... only warm not hot especially for the time we waited.  It also tasted like something I cooked at a university rez out of the frozen super market... DISAPPOINTED!Her chicken and waffles were tasty I have to admit but SMALL! Seems like a soul food place with a minimalist dish... not impressed. I'd say go to KFC and save the extra money and time!Strike 5 came in getting any service at all for the bill or clean up... with such a long wait line you'd think they'd be in a rush to seat as many as possible but noooo they take there time here too!So all in all, if you can afford to waste 3 hrs waiting for 'OK' chicken and waffles (steer clear of all else) then MAYBE it's worth a look... but would I go back again?NO~!"
2/9/2012,2 star rating,"2.5 StarsUnremarkable.  That basically sums up my experience at Melba's.  First, the hostess (who I presume is an owner, because she had an air that was dismissive, yet authoritative) was not nice.  There nothing welcoming about her welcome.  It was more like, just so you know you'll be waiting --  very abrupt and matter of fact.  The food was underwhelming.  I'm trying to figure out why this place is so popular, because based on my experience, it's a mystery.  I had what I believe is they're signature dish, the Chicken with Egg Nog Waffles.  The Egg Nog Waffles were supposedly featured on Food Network or something.  The chicken was pretty dry to be dark meat and fried.  The waffles were pretty good.  They were topped with a strawberry butter, which I found tasty and clever.  But it's not the type of thing that going to make you running back.  It was good, but if I never have it again, I'll be unaffected and not regretful.  The music was pretty good, so was my bellini."
10/1/2012,3 star rating,"Sorry, Melba's, I really wanted to like you but it was just kind of... okay. The service for our party of five, including two small kids, was gracious and welcoming, the highlight of the experience. The food was the let down. The chicken and waffles were just okay. Portion was rather small, the fried chicken was dry, and the whole eating experience was just plain. To reference Malcolm Gladwell, maybe for this day the kitchen experience was an outlier and more practice is warranted. I'll give it another chance but still this was a bummer."
6/22/2012,5 star rating,"Love, love, loveee Melba's!!! The food is delicious, the ambiance is very nice with a hybrid rustic and Tudor feel and the staff is amazing! I've had the salmon (delicious),  Yukon mash potatoes ( so savory), spinach (soo tasty), crab cakes (perfect blend of crab meat and crunchy coating) and the waffles with strawberry butter....to die for....like you have not lived unless you tastes Melba's waffles! But what makes this place really amazing is the staff: Damien, the manager, is quite honestly one of the nicest and warmest human beings I've ever met; and to think my first encounter I was trying to be a pushy  customer. Instead of throwing shade  back at me, Damien, instead,  stayed calm, cool and collective, reassuring me my table would be ready once all my dinner guests arrived (we were 30 mins late to our reservation). Since then, I've enjoyed every moment with Damien, he is truly so kind, fun and a great manager! Then there is Sherrie...Sherrie is one of the most attentive waiters I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. She was a sweetheart from jump, never rushing us and making sure that whatever we needed , was taken care of 100%. So you might be questioning how sweet and lovely Sherrie really is? Well when one of my inebriated dinner guest forgot their credit card, Sherrie was kind enough to run 2 blocks, in all black, in 90 degree weather, just to make sure my friend's credit card was returned...that amazingly kind and lovely!And this is what I love about Melba's: it's old Harlem 21st century style. When you would go to a restaurant in Harlem  back in the day, halfof the time you went to the restaurant for the food, but the other half you were going there for the people because you knew the people and the people knew you and cared about your well-being! That's the service Melba's provides: great food and better people! I  Heart Melba's and you should go!"
4/27/2008,4 star rating,"I'm a sucker for chicken and waffles.  And this place certainly hits the spot.   All this at a small yet classy restaurant with the nicest lady around makes dining here a welcoming and warm experience.Chicken was fried to perfection with the skin at the right saltiness and crispiness while the meat was of the appropriate juiciness - not at all oily compared to the fried chicken at lesser dining establishments.  If you're worried about dried out chicken, I recommend sticking with the dark meat.  The half chicken breast I got for my white meat portion was on the drier side so it was disappointing (the fried chicken at Gladys and Rons is slightly better).  While the fried chicken was on par with what I can get, the waffles were absolutely AMAZING.   Melba's Belgian waffle-styled eggnog waffles were amazing in their sweetness and fluffiness and not like anything I've ever had.  That accompanied with the strawberry butter is TO DIE FOR.I understand that the fame of beating Bobby Flay at a throwdown is going to flood the place, it wasn't too terribly busy while I was there and I thought they would be slightly more attentive than they were (hopefully they can work on that).  Despite their shortcomings the amazing waffles combined with their fried chicken in an amazing place."
1/24/2011,5 star rating,"There are some tasty, tasty,..... tasty things happening in here. I've only been here for brunch so far, but I've tried quite a sampling of the offerings. It's hard to keep trying new things when the cheese grits are as delicious as these are, when the bacon is as massive and amazingly crispy, the sweet potato pancakes are fluffy and perfectly sweet, and the eggnog waffles are light and crispy. I shouldn't write this review while I'm hungry. Nor should I even THINK about Melba's when I'm hungry.Moving on from the food, the service is kind, efficient, and well, honest. On one visit one of the servers took my sweet potato pancakes to another table by accident. Our server (who may have been Melba herself!) apologized profusely and brought me an ENORMOUS mimosa (that was basically straight champagne with a shot of orange juice) while the cook remade my order. Not only did I get what looked like an even larger helping of sweet potato pancakes, i also got a big old bowl of cheese grits since I had to wait. My entire meal ended up being taken off the bill. It's a nice gesture and I know it's not unheard of for places to do things like that when someone's order gets screwed up, but that one incident will definitely keep me trekking uptown to get my delicious carby brunch on!"
3/20/2017,4 star rating,"I wrote a review a few years ago about how bad the food has gotten because the Chef had changed. I have not been to Melba's in about 3 years, I decided to call and see it they had hired another Chef and to my surprise they did! The food was amazing! We were a party of 5, we ordered 4 different appetizers to share (shrimp, catfish, calamari and crab cakes) and loved each one. I ordered the chicken and waffles and I hummed each time I took a bite. I also got to taste the mac-n-cheese, all I can say is Whoo-Whee. My only complaint is that the restaurant was pretty crowded and the waitress could use a little help. It took us a while to get our drinks. The waitress and staff were very pleasant. Yes I would go back and I recommend Melba's to others."
7/23/2017,4 star rating,"Definitely one of the better soul food restaurants in Harlem. The staff here is so welcoming and extremely nice! We went here on Sunday for brunch. It gets very busy during brunch time here so arrive early. We ordered the southern fried catfish with sweet potato pancakes (delicious!) and my boyfriend ordered the Spinach omelet with grits and an extra side of turkey sausage (delicious also). For ONE sausage link $5.95! I think that was outrageous. Also, be prepared to wait a minimum of 30-35 minutes for your food to be delivered to your table. Other than that, everything else was good. We will definitely return."

7/19/2015,3 star rating,"The dinner was delicious in my opinion but the wait is what threw me off. So we came at around 8:30pm last night and told a lady that was wearing red (I assume the greeter) that I would like to have a table for 3. She said it would be a 40 minute wait which I did not mind. One would assume your name would be written down on a list with your party number but i guess not. 40 minutes passed, then a hour, then a hour and a half and still no one calls our name but yet I see employees walking in and out the door and going around the corner. What made it worse is that people were coming in and being immediately seated. When I finally asked about my party they asked who did I tell my party to I said the lady in red as she walks out the door because its the end of her shift. No apology about waiting nearly 2 hrs or the unorganized establishment that they was running. What really saved this place was the food. I don't know if I will be back."
12/18/2011,4 star rating,"This was my first chicken and waffles experience - although I actually had the fried catfish instead - and it was borderline transcendental.I was brought to Melba's a couple of weekends ago, after a movie, on a date. First of all, the space is impressive. The large chandelier-esque lights cast down a light glow which tends to bring out one's best features... and although the space is small-ish, the tables are situated so you aren't on top of the table next to you. It felt intimate despite the dining room being full by the time we left. We also got a table once we walked in - though we arrived close to opening time for dinner.The food was great. I got the fried catfish and waffles, as mentioned above, and my date got the fried chicken and waffles. I am a person who LOVES having sweet/savory in one bite - and this particular salty, well spiced fried fish paired with the sweet maple syrup covered eggnog waffles filled all of my foodie fantasies...and left us rolling towards the train back to Brooklyn.Right on, Melba's - we will be back."
2/21/2018,5 star rating,"Their food is amazing ! Ribs that fall off the bone, oxtails so tender they taste like they were slow cooked perfectly . Mac and cheese like my grandmother made it. Even when given minor issues they insured they were taken care of. Love the staff and the owner ! Best soul food in Harlem !!!"
7/8/2007,4 star rating,"Wow. I love my (soon-to-be) neighborhood. Everything about it has really impressed me thusfar and Melba's is no exception. What a BEAUTIFUL restaurant. As I was sitting there amongst fellow yelpers I took a moment to envision me and all my friends dining and laughing and enjoying good food and good company.I had already eaten across the street but I browsed the dessert menu and went for my first slice of Red Velvet Cake. It was indeed red. It was certainly velvety. And quite rich. A little sweeter than what I desired but all the same quite enjoyable.I was sitting next to Hugo O. And when his Po' Boy Sandwich came he offered me some fries. I wasn't going to take one and then he gently insisted. And ... Well ... THOSE ARE SOME GOOD FRIES. Golden brown, crispy, seasoned to perfection with a little kick at the end. Mmmm.The wait staff was slow with getting our order and slow with bringing the check. Guess they wanted us to stay a bit longer. Southern hospitality I suppose. Surprisingly reasonable for the atmosphere as far as prices are concerned. And the background music was really good. I can't wait to go back."
9/23/2011,4 star rating,"My grandma is going to turn over in her grave- but I think Melba's is the best soul food experience I've ever had- straight up. First off the place is super cute- tiny bistro tables and candle lit, but still low key. Perfect place to take a date for dinner or bring your mom for a ladies brunch. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. Split the fried catfish and fried chicken with my date. Came with 2 sides, we got mac and cheese, greens and a side of yams. Yams were ehhhh. A little too sweet for me. But the mac was SLAMMIN. We got an extra order at the end just to take home because it was that good. SO cheesy, gooy, amazing. Greens were also to die for, especially with their homemade hot sauce. Stuff is crack. Only thing they were lacking was maybe some amazing corn bred, but I honestly didn't even need it. Everything else was beyond beyond amazing.Service was a little slow and shaky at times and the cocktails weren't really work $11 a pop which is why I had to knock em a star. Our waitress was super sweet and did her best, but she was way over her head. She didn't have much experience and maybe just started, but she was so NICE and adorable I can't knock her hustle. At the end of the day, the food was so good I would have served myself to get it!! Melbas- yall do take out? I can't be showing my face in there 3x a week, cus that's definitely how many times i""ll be coppin your mac n greens combo. See ya soon!"
9/20/2011,5 star rating,"Love...Love...Love Melba's!!! The food is ""slap ur momma"" good!!! I had the pecan crusted tilapia with Mac n'  Cheese and candied yams! The Mac n' Cheese was to die for along with the fish! The yams, I could have done without. I think they used too much vanilla and they also seemed under cooked?? Idk. Other than the yams the food was superb! The staff was nice and friendly(which is hard to come by these days). I also went back to Melba's for brunch on Sunday and once again, I was overly impressed! I had sweet potato pancakes, cheese grits and slab bacon! Whew! I was super full and delighted :)The only thing that I would suggest they improve on is the lack of space. It's extremely small, but exceptionally CLEAN! Melba's is my go to secret!"
6/8/2015,4 star rating,"I have come to Melba's a few times each time was for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  I never had an issue getting a table. Service and food have always been great.  Catfish with cheese grits were GREAT!! Tried the egg nog waffles and fried chicken,  the chicken was not for me but I think that was just because the recipe is dumbed down for those with less adventurous palettes."
10/28/2014,4 star rating,"Great atmosphere, great food, great customer service. I was here for my sis-in-law's birthday with a party of 12. The servers were very attentive and pleasant. I had the chicken and waffles. They were both cooked to perfection. The calamari needed a touch of salt. The place is small but cozy. Music can be very loud so come prepared with cotton if it's too much for you. Overall a great time!"
11/9/2008,4 star rating,"My friends and I had tickets to see Tracy Morgan at the Apollo so we stopped here for a quick dinner before the show.  The dining room is small but is dimly lit.  I think it would be a nice place for an unpretentious date.  So my friends had seen Melbas on the Food Network show - Bobby Flay's Throwdown where they competed to see who had the better chicken and waffles.  So we went there with great expectations and wanting to try the famous dish.Well when I first received my plate, I thought - boy I'm going to be hungry.  And as I slowly ate my waffle, I thought this is pretty good but I didn't think the fried chicken was anything to write home about.  However, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  When you combine the two and eat them in one bite, now that is a good dish.  I don't know what it is about the crispy chicken skin (maybe all the grease? ;-)) but it makes the waffle that much better.  Oh and by the way, the dish was surprisingly filling."
5/16/2013,4 star rating,"Let me start by saying CATFISH, CATFISH! One of the best tasting Catfish dinners I have had! This fried Catfish is to die for! My niece had her Sweet 16 dinner here and had about 20 folks.  The downside is that this spot is SMALL!! I mean Tiny.  We were really cramped up in the corner and could barely move our elbows to lift our forks! The owner however, (Sylvia's Niece), was super nice, warm and friendly, meeting and greeting us at the door and stopping by our table to make sure we were full and happy! I cant think of anything else but that Catfish/Mac and Cheese, however, my brother ordered the short ribs and they actually made my eyes cross!! They were seasoned to the nines and tender as tender could get--excellent! My only disappointment was and I hate to say it...the Fried Chicken.  This was actually the dish that she beat Bobbi Flay at when he challenged her on her Waffles and Fried Chicken on Food TV Network.  I just didnt care for it, too much seasoning and salty.  Outside of that, I loved Melbas and would absolutely return for that Catfish and those short ribs and that Mac & Cheese! Also, its on a really nice corner street in Harlem USA, that has decent parking and is a decent area."
1/31/2016,4 star rating,"Great food at Melba's and very friendly vibe! Prices are reasonable; service is uneven...they forget to bring your drinks, etc, but not a big deal. The room is very pretty with great lighting.  Music is too loud and not conducive to staying and lingering. An easy fix, which would tempt me to go often."
12/9/2006,4 star rating,"Been living in the neighborhood for over 2 years and have neglected the nearby restaurants, firstly because there aren't very many and secondly, since I tend to meet friends in Hell's Kitchen all the time.  But, finally, I made my way around the corner for dinner with a friend/coworker (Amy) at this cozy little uptown eatery.  Got there early so the place was quite empty leaving table choice up to us.  We grabbed the corner and our super friendly waiter got our drink orders and shared the specials.  A DJ was setting up near the windows and soon started spinning plenty of Luther's Christmas Album, setting the perfect mood for a chilly winter's night meal.  The bar was full of the afterwork crowd, quietly enjoying the atmosphere and their cocktails.We shared a Mango Martini which was deliciously refreshing.  For dinner, Amy thoroughly enjoyed Pecan Encrusted Tilapia with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Country Yams (see below for description).  By the way she cleaned her plate, I'd say this was a fantastic choice!I had the BBQ Meatloaf.  Two huge slices of perfectly cooked Turkey Meatloaf with just the right amount of slightly spicy, slightly sweet BBQ sauce.  I couldn't eat it fast enough.  On the side, I had the sauteed spinach with garlic and like Amy, the Country Yams.  Oh those yams!!!  Every bite melted in my mouth, sweet as can be, YUM!Needless to say, we were far too full to even attempt dessert, but I know I have to make a return trip just to savor their Sweet Potatoe Pie.  You should too!"
10/4/2014,4 star rating,"My friend and I went to Melba's for dinner last Tuesday and everything was amazing! We both had fried catfish, collards, Mac & cheese with a side of potato salad. Piping hot, seasoned to perfection and nice portion size. I personally know Melba & she's down-to-earth, kind and really cool. We'll be going back soon with more friends!"
8/26/2012,3 star rating,"Wow. I didnt think it would be such a small space. Anywho, we went here for brunch after running the Harlem Week 5k. My friend had the salmon omelette & homefries. Cool thing about her fries was that they were made with both sweet & regular potatoes. Sure wish Id ordered those fries!  Instead I got the sweet potato pancakes with a side of cheese grits. The pancake flavor was nice but they were awfully mushy inside. We both had Mellinis to drink (mango nectar & (cheap)champagne). All & all Melba's was cool. I'd like to go again for dinner.  Saw a couple of children at other tables.  Maybe I'll bring mine next time.  Either way, its good to know that I can.By the way, Melba's has a ""B"" rating from the dept. of health."
2/19/2012,4 star rating,"Stopped here for dessert with a friend and was so happy we did.Upon entry, we were greeted by the owner, Melba, who was extremely kind and welcoming.  She told us about her upbringing, life as a chef, and how she started Melba's.  I really appreciate that she took the time to explain the history and interior design of the restaurant-just gorgeous!  I ordered the sweet potato pie and my friend ordered the red velvet cake. It's funny because while they were both good, we should have swapped desserts because I LOVED the red velvet cake (made fresh and served warmed) and she LOVED the sweet potato pie. I also ordered some mac & cheese to-go (don't judge!).  It was good, but not the best-Amy Ruth's got my heart for that one.  I want to go back to try their other dishes.Even though soul food can be a little heavy, I highly recommend that you save room for something sweet here-you won't be disappointed!"
8/20/2008,3 star rating,Melbas.....oy.I'm giving it Three Stars as an average--I have had both wonderful/savory/fabulousness and doughy/dry/choke-worthy crumblage. Great service while seated under the awesome painted of a  1970's Marvin Gaye and Vein-throbbingly bad service where my friends and I stood and waited for damn near TWO HOURS while people were seated who showed up after us. What can I say people? It's a crapshoot--the only constant is the Malibu Melba; this drink all by itSELF should get 5 stars!! :D
1/11/2012,5 star rating,"I love this place, and I actually think it's hands down the best ""soul food"" in Harlem.  That's not to say that some of the others aren't good, but they are the only ones who get the spirit right and I think they just have the best food.  There are a lot of complaints about the wait, and I'll be honest.  I'm not a planner and I've taken people here when I have the urge and have ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked--even with a reservation.  But if you have ever eaten in New York, you know the deal. Furthermore, the dining room is really small and I think this is one of the few times that the phrase ""intimate setting"" really does fit.  For two years I've supported the restaurant because each time I've gone I've had fun.  It's one of the few places where you can go an eat and meet new people while enjoying a fine meal.  Perhaps the intimate setting plays a role in that. If you're not a ""people person"" I wouldn't recommend going on Monday night...or anytime someone is having a birthday--the whole restaurant sings!  But this is what really makes this place standout.  At least, for me it's more than just is the food good, the service has got to work and here the service is peerless in Harlem.  Sure, the wait may be long but once you take a seat you'll experience the finest service in Harlem.Now the food.  I've had lots of things on the menu, but the chicken and waffles are great.  I don't like fruit...at all, but Melba has me craving for the strawberry butter with my waffles.  Now to be fair, it's not a full waffle they are three small waffles which is fine by me because the bird is really the star of the show.  The crispy outer and juicy inner is exactly what fried chicken should taste like and when the syrup from the waffles manages to stick to the skin...that's when the magic begins! I love the macaroni and cheese, but this is really a matter of taste.  I love how cheesy it is.  But those who don't like it I understand why.  I also love the catfish and the sauce they have on the side is delicious.  The potato salad and greens are also delicious.  I've had the tilapia and it was ok, and I'm not really a fan of the spinach.  But those are my only two complaints.  The cocktails are also delicious!  If you want a full experience in Harlem this is the place to go.  I'd say it offers the second best atmosphere, yea that place with the Red awning may have them beat on atmosphere by a hair.  But I definitely prefer the food here."
1/16/2016,4 star rating,Loved the brunch... I had fried catfish and cheese grits.... Wanted to try the waffle with chicken wings until they told me it would take 30 minutes for chicken wings.... And the Arnold Palmer could have used some sugar but overall enjoyed it...
2/5/2011,3 star rating,"My first time at Melba's brunch started off perfectly, with cute, classy decor, a coat rack, a corner seat, the best scone/biscuits that I have had in the city, and a great cup of coffee.Unfortunately, the ideal situation didn't continue through the whole brunch.  Nothing was horrible, but the service got a bit slower towards the end, they ran out of decaf coffee (which is why I am still buzzing a little at 5 pm), and I wasn't totally thrilled with my salmon croquette (I discovered an eye socket bone and realized that it was made with canned salmon, which just grosses me out when they keep all the skin and bones in it).My friend and I who were there both decided that if we could just eat biscuits and coffee the whole time, we would be perfectly content!  I would recommend giving it a try-- I would go back and try something else."
5/31/2008,5 star rating,"LOVES IT!!Ambience--great. Food--really good. Drinks--cool and great.And Peter, who sings there on Tuesday nights--AMAZING!I recommend just about everything on the menu, honestly. Been a few times, the catfish strips as a starter, and sea bass or fried chicken platter with spinach and collard greens (know it sounds a little weird) would be the perfect meal, a la New York Magazine.We liked it so much, in fact, that Peter will be singing at my fiance and I's wedding this fall. If that doesn't mean I loved it, I don't know what does!"
7/11/2015,5 star rating,"Perfection. I had the chicken and waffle with strawberry butter and loved it. The fish, macaroni and cheese, greens, and candied yams were also very well done. I also like the room itself. Usually soul food places are holes in the wall. This feels more like a night out. I hope they get successful enough to expand to Chicago or Texas. I highly recommend it."
7/5/2018,1 star rating,"Considering that Melba's was my first time visiting and eating at that establishment; I would like to say it will also be my last. My significant other, his sister and I ran out of options of eatery and decided to go to this place. I've ""heard"" of Melba's by other acquaintances but couldn't remember their feedback. Anyhow, we went for dinner last night and the place seemed a bit empty - being that yesterday was a federal holiday. Which I was happy about - that meant quick good service. That wasn't the case AT ALL. We arrived and stood by the door hoping to be greeted by someone that worked in the establishment. The person working the bar didn't acknowledge us, the waiter that was waiting the table near the entrance also did not greet. I literally had to walk around to find someone to seat us. So once I found that person (Farrah) she seemed irritated when I asked if she was the person that was suppose to greet us by the door. Her response was, ""it's the managers job to greet at the door is he not there?"" I'm thinking to myself - well obviously he is not if I'm asking u for assistance. Anyhow - that was the first incident. So the same person that was extremely unprofessional was our waiter (go- figure) . She took our order at 8:42 pm- and we sat there for nearly 35 minutes with no food. Mind you the place was damn near empty. So she proceeds to come our table at 9:10 to ask if we wanted dessert. We all looked at each and said - we haven't received our entrees. She then said, ""are u kidding me?"" And storms off towards the kitchen. She then comes back with proof of a receipt showing that she did take the order and that the cooks failed to cook the food. Which at that point was asked to speak to the manager. We explained to the manager the situation and at that point we were upset and was ready to go. He was very apologetic and said - if you stay we'll have your meal out in 5 minutes. So we decided to stay. The waitress (Farrah) came back to prove her case that she wasn't at fault and also stated that we should be happy that the manager was offering our diner in his behalf. And that wasn't our intentions we were not there for a ""free"" meal. All we wanted was for her to take accountability - and she refused. So with that being said ... please be aware of Farrah - not sure where she gets her manners but she is def a bottoms of the barrel type of chick. No home training. Please asked to be waited on by someone else besides her. Not only that we saw how unprofessional she was with other tables. I'm not sure why she is working there. Not a people person. And the food is mediocre at best. Don't not order any of the fish it's bland. However, the Mac and cheese is bomb!"
1/11/2018,5 star rating,"This was my first time at Melba's. I googled a few places in Harlem and upon seeing the menu online I decided to try it. I loved the ambiance of the place. Dimly lit and cozy, perfect for date night or out with friends. The food came quicker than expected which was great. I ordered the chicken wings and waffles while my friend had the country catfish and two sides. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The drinks we had were also good and very strong. We had to wait a while for our second and third round of drinks due to our waitress attending to the other customers but other than that everyone was very attentive. Melba also walked around ensuring that everyone was enjoying their meals and striking up some conversation which I thought made the place feel homey. I would definitely go again and recommend to others."
8/9/2014,2 star rating,Where do I start? Well the place is small and it can only seat about 20 people at a time and groups no bigger than 4-5 people. Waited 45 minutes for our food! They charge for juice or soda refills. Horrible. Once the food arrived I was really disappointed by the smothered chicken it was real salty :(. The sides were pretty good. The prices range between 15-30 for an entree. I wish I had gone to Sylvia's instead.
1/31/2012,5 star rating,"(Though I've heard plenty of great things about Melba's dinner, my review is solely based on their brunch)I LOVE this spot! To me, it is the best soul food restaurant in Harlem. The first time I took a trip there was for a friend's birthday brunch. Their ""country pancakes"" were so amazing that I went back the following weekend and then a few times after. Second time around I tried the eggnog waffles and chicken wings. Again, PERFECTION. The chicken was seasoned to a T and cooked just right. I'd also recommend their cheese grits and fried catfish."
8/5/2010,5 star rating,"Wasn't expecting the best service after being warned from the previous reviews. I was pleasantly surprised for dinner on a Wednesday night. Arrived early and there was no wait, for a table of 2. Was seated as soon as we entered around 6:30pm.The wait staff was still very attentive when we arrived as the restaurant was not yet full. The seating can be cramped depending on where they seat you. We were seated by the booth area and had more than adequate room. Started the meal with Mini-Burgers, even after reading the name I expected more than just two minis to arrive. They were tasty enough though that I was happy we were able to start with them. The waitress recommended the jack cheese and it complimented the mini perfectly, perhaps next time I will order medium rare, medium was too well done for me.The Chicken and Waffles and the Strawberry Butter were the perfect entrees. We had two orders for our table and then ordered two sides. The Mac and Cheese and the Grit Cake. The Tres Mac and Cheese was much better but the Grit Cake tasted almost healthy (which was nice). Ended the meal with the Red Velvet Cake a la Mode. Perfect ending, a bit sweet but fine with a coffee.*Only complaints were that they could use another server for drink refills, etc. And that more chicken needs to come with the waffles, raise the price, it is just that good."
6/15/2015,3 star rating,"Safe place to eat.  Came here after the mess at Amy Ruths June 13, 2015 and due to the reservations and graduation parties, we had to dine at the bar which was no problem.  I had the chicken and egg nog waffles, and my friend had the salmon with mac and tata salad.  Everything was good and great conversation at the bar."
3/30/2009,4 star rating,"I came to Melba's for brunch yesterday and had a great meal.  The decor is not what I was expecting at all from a soul food restaurant - it's very modern, with black granite tables and exposed brick behind the bar.  I liked it, though.  The music they were playing was a bit loud, but I supposed it just added to the atmosphere.  It wasn't too loud for us to have a conversation or anything.I ordered the French toast and it was really just the ideal French toast, the way French toast should be, always.  It was made from soft raisin challah, and it was perfectly cooked - not soggy, not burned, not undercooked.  The few pieces of fruit they served with it seemed kind-of old, but it really didn't matter because the French toast was so good.  I am sad now, though, after reading the other reviews, that they didn't serve it with the famous strawberry butter.  They did give us each a biscuit (buttery, hot, and delicious), but it came about 30 seconds before our meals.  My friend got the vegetable frittata and said it was good.  I'm not a huge grits fan but the ones she got with her entree were pretty tasty.  The portions are huge, and the prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food.It was pretty empty at 11 AM on a Sunday, and there was only one waitress and a few people helping her.  The service was pretty good, but definitely relaxed.  I look forward to coming back for brunch again (especially to try those egg nog waffles that kept going by our table), and hopefully for dinner to try the mac & cheese."
5/10/2013,5 star rating,"I enjoy every visit.  In fact when I have visitors in town, they always make me commit to putting a visit to Melba's on the routine stops.  Friendly staff that makes you feel like you're coming home to a family dinner each time you come in.  Awesome food and drinks.  Dessert is a must have.  I don't know how many diets I've broken grabbing dessert to go.One small ask that I think enhances efficiency is to offer reservations online and through an application.  Then sending emails or text at times when there's something special.  There are times when you go, and the wait is tremendous.  Being able to grab a smartphone and grab a table while on the go is a great benefit and eliminates hold times on the phone.I love the fact that the place is a small neighborhood spot.  Wish they were in a few more neighborhoods."
12/22/2010,2 star rating,"I've been to Melba's twice.  Once for brunch and once for dinner.   Brunch wasn't bad.. dinner was terrible.  Melba's is a very small restaurant with an nice decor.  But decor can not compensate for bad service and terrible food. My brunch experience was 3 stars -- not great but not bad.  I had the egg nog waffles and sausages all of which were pretty good.  Service was alright nothing stood out, be it poor or good. My dinner experience was 0 stars!  It was probably.... no... IT WAS the worse dining experience I've had at a restaurant in Harlem.  We called to make reservations but was told that the restaurant doesn't take reservations.  Fine, we just walked in and were actually seated rather promptly.  However... we did not get a server to come over until 30-45 minutes after being seated, even after our attempts to get their attention.  When the waitress finally came over she was like ...wow.. you guys didn't get served yet?... hmmm..what do you think???Anyway.. we ordered our food...and waited at least another 15 minutes for it to arrive.  I ordered the fried cat fish, grits and mac & cheese.  Ok.. where do I begin... this is a ""soul food"" restaurant and all of the above ""soul food"" items were horrible!!  Not one good thing about the meal.  I don't know what kind of grits they serve - I've never seen anything like it - it was like a made in the form of a cake of some sort and had no taste -- i tried to put some salt and pepper on it but nothing could help that thing.  It was dry, tasteless and dull.  The cat fish and mac & cheese was bland too.  Salt and pepper gave the mac & cheese a little kick but nothing could bring that fish to life -- it was like eating soft cardboard with a slightly fishy smell.  I do not intend on coming back here for dinner...EVER!   My friend disliked her meal too.  Maybe even more so than I did. Once I've had amnesia over my last dining experience, I'll eventually give Melba's another shot for brunch because it actually wasn't bad.  I will only have those eggnog waffles and sausages there though... nothing else... but if I experience the same type of service again... I will not return again!!"

We  are seniors and don't usually eat this much at dinner but just moving into the area we had to give it a try. Everything was so good, we didn't leave anything over. The service was wonderful and very attentive. Highly recommend to all."
4/27/2011,3 star rating,"I went to Melba's for brunch with my parents, boyfriend and a few of my friends.  We had seen the Throwdown with Bobby Flay for Chicken & Waffles, so we wanted to try it.  The venue is tiny,, and we were a large group of 6 for Sunday brunch, probably their most crowded meal.  I do not suggest eating here if you are more than 4 people.  However, the staff was extremely friendly, welcoming  and apologetic about the wait.Once we got seated the cornbread was AMAZING.  We ordered more because they only allow for 1 per person.  Most of us ordered the Chicken and Waffles, which was great but not amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the catfish, and that was the best.  If I go back I'll get the catfish.  It was light and battery.  We all tried to eat more from his plate because it was so great.They gave us a pie and cake slice to go for dessert, which was really nice.  Melba herself came by and chatted with my parents, which they thought was the best thing ever.  Overall a fun experience, and good food, but only the cornbread and catfish were amazing."
12/5/2008,2 star rating,"I love me some down-home cooking, okay? My mother is from Arkansas, and I grew up in the vast comfort-food-choked suburbs of Detroit. I know from comfort food.And having recently moved to Harlem, one of the things I was most excited about was the abundance of soul/comfort food restaurants. Um, yum. Thanks.Now. Imagine my excitement when I realized not only that this place, Melba's , is literally around the corner from my apt, but also has CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.Holy baby cheeses.And so, one Sunday, with a New York Times tucked under my arm (because don't you feel that despite its belated lack of journalistic integrity, it has a certain delightful, New Yorky quaintness?), I skipped down to Melba's for what I was hoping would be a delicious, salty-sweet gut bomb.Instead, here's what I got:A looooooong wait to order. And by looooooong, I mean looooooooooong.A waitress who seemed totally unbothered by how loooooooong everything was taking.A loooooooooong wait for my food. And by looooooooooong, I mean looooooooong.Sidebar: this last part is curious, since when the food did actually arrive, it had CLEARLY been sitting beneath a heat lamp for DAYS.To continue the list of what I got:Fried chicken with a ceramic skin that could chip a tooth and meat made of desiccated suede. Oh--and cold.A cold waffle made of pulverized styrofoam packing peanuts.A strawberry butter to accompany said waffle that was actually delicious.A coffee refill that was cold--no, not ""not hot."" Seriously. Cold.All in all, deeply disappointing. I know Melba's was featured on the Food Network. One wonders if she reserved the good stuff for the TV cameras?Sigh. Won't be back."

8/28/2011,4 star rating,"Expensive but good and worth the experience. For a night where you want to have a drink, listen to some music, and eat some soul food. I think it's a nice place. The customers here seemed to be more student's/professors who are from the colleges, then your regular NYC/Harlem/Brooklyn/Queens locals. I was glancing around, and also noticed, must of the people who worked here were rocking the baldy, which I thought was very Cult Like, but hey everybody dressed and acted very professional which is most important when you're going out to dine.I was really enjoyed the crab cakes, again even though they were over priced they were delicious. I didn't come to Melba's planning to get drinks, but when I saw the bar I thought this place would be awesome to go out after work for a drink, and some fried chicken. Melba is also walking around looking happy, and excited which gives ALL customers a sense of enjoyment. This is something I don't think I've seen at Amy Ruths, or Sylvia's.Sheesh, I don't even know who the owners are at those other establishments. I just see some random old photo of an old woman on the menu that I've never seen in my life, unless it's on the shelf in pathmark or whole food's.I haven't came here as much as Amy Ruths, but after writing this review I think I will be visiting Melba's again very soon. Again, it's a little more pricier then soul food spots, but you pay for excellence  and it's all in the bag at Melba's. Oh they also have live music I believe some day's, an the music is good. Seem's like there are more conservative people here, but not prude like Sylvia's. Check Check Check it out, and Melba KEEP ON SMILING HONEY! It makes me enjoy my meal, more and more every time."

2/7/2011,4 star rating,"I have converted so many people to this place, been with friends, been on dates, been for brunch, mostly for dinner. If you are with a group of more than 4 people I would suggest calling ahead. The ambience is nice, cosy, beautiful and at night romantic. Everything I have had here and what other people I have been with have had was good, except the meatloaf. I will always recommend the fried chicken and waffles - and the strawberry buttercreamy thing they serve - altogether really tastes like love. I feel like they used to give more food a couple years back. For sides I recommend the mac and cheese and the collard greens. For appetizers the sliders are great. The service can be kinda slow which is why I give 4 stars. The crowd is eclectic - mostly chill, professional and artsy."
3/19/2011,4 star rating,"My husband had been to Melba's once before had and raved about the chicken and waffles so when Groupon had a deal we decided to go. He chose Valentine's Day to make the reservation and was sure to ask if they would accept our Groupon although it was a holiday. They assured us they would, however we found out upon paying our bill that they did not accept it. My husband was irate to say the least, but I let him know I still thought Melba's was a fine establishment and didn't want that experience to ruin our Valentine's Day. I just think that the staff at any place that participates in Groupon should be educated before giving false information to patrons.This mishap aside, the prix fixe menu was fantastic. I chose the butternut squash soup for my appetizer and it was deliciously creamy at a perfect temperature. I wanted more once I reached the bottom of my bowl! For my entree I had the beef wellington and while I had never had it before, it made me want to learn to make it so I could try it at home. The beef was very tender and perfectly seasoned. For dessert I had red velvet cake. It was slightly warm and moist. I wish there had been more icing though. Since we had the outstanding Groupon we went back to Melba's a month later to celebrate a special milestone. We didn't have a reservation but didn't have to wait long on a Wednesday at 7:30p.m. By 8:30p.m. there was a slight wait for a table.We shared the black eyed peas, rice and collard green wraps. My husband wanted calamari but I'm glad he compromised on this because it was so good. The crisp crunch and softness of the rice was a great combination. For my entree I ate every morsel of my catfish, which was crisp just how I like it, seasoned well and piping hot, collard greens and mac and cheese. There was enough sides to last for the entire large piece of fish - I always get annoyed when the sides aren't in proportion to the meat. Also, the mac and cheese was much better than the one my husband was served as his side on Valentine's Day. It was creamy with a bit of a crust on top. Overall, I found the second time around to be much better as the portions were larger although on Valentine's Day we paid 2x the price because of the holiday. The service is good, and the ambiance warm. In particular I liked that they filled my water glass and remembered to bring lemons and straws when we asked. I'm a bit quirky in that I usually only drink lemon water with my dinner out of straw (can't stand my lips on glasses but my own), and waiters often forget my lemon and straw request so I take it as a sign of good service when they promptly remember. I will definitely be returning to Melba's in the future."
8/15/2012,5 star rating,"Melba was in on the night I visited to catch up with an old friend.   She was very interested in our experience, food was great, fresh&of the highest quality.  Everyone was very nice, it was slow, which I liked, because we were dining at 5 or so on a Monday.  Living in Jersey now, but this is a place for soul when I'm in the area.  So many places have popped up in Harlem that are terrible."
9/9/2012,3 star rating,"I ordered the friend chicken and waffles.  It was delicious!  So why only 3 stars?  The portions are small and the price point is high considering the portion.  I had read this feedback from other reviewers and was expecting it, but it was somehow smaller than what I was expecting.  I wasn't looking for massive portions, but it felt more like ""gourmet soul food"", something of an oxymoron when I think of soul/comfort food.I'd encourage everyone to try it once."
12/11/2009,4 star rating,"I had the pleasure of dining @ Melba's and all I can say is ""DELISH"" ! It was a busy Friday night and we didn't have to wait long for a table . Our waiter was helpful and very knowledgeable not just about the menus but also about the various wines that were available. I had the braised short ribs which were perfect !!. I will definitely make plans to go back again and would recommend others stop by . You won't be disappointed ."
10/14/2014,2 star rating,"My first experience at Melba's was fantastic. Not a complaint in sight but my latest trip there on Sunday left MUCH to be desired. Let me start off by saying that the wait staff is outstanding- courteous and attentive. Now on to the bad...Upon arriving I ordered a RED Sangria. When I got it I noticed that the orange slice looked a little old, almost like it had been sucked on but I figured the bartender just struggle to attach it to the glass. It wasn't until I finished my drink that I noticed huge RED lipstick prints on my glass. I was disgusted to say the least and then realized that the orange probably had already been enjoyed- good thing I just put it to the side. The waiter was apologetic and took the drink off of our bill. Now on to the food. I ordered sweet potato pancakes, fried chicken and grits. Pancakes: the one on the bottom was completely burnt, seemingly put on the bottom to hide its charred state. The strawberry butter that they put on top was still frozen and had a refrigerator-like taste.Chicken: the chicken was well seasoned but severely overcooked. Leaving little meat to enjoy.Grits: the grits had a filmy layer on top- like they had been sitting out for a while. We literally had to break through the film and mix the grits up to make them edible.Overall, Melba's disappointed me this time and I don't think third time will be the charm. : ("
6/20/2016,2 star rating,"Excellent coffee. As a neighbor, we most often do brunch at Melba's for the chicken and waffles, and the cinnamon raisin French toast. Father's Day was very disappointing, far below what we have come to expect.  We were seated at 10:00 am, opening time, and waited, with a full house, for our food to arrive. Everyone waited at least 45 min. and we were served before almost everyone. Now the biggest disappointment. Without being informed that the Melba's signature  cinnamon raisin French toast would be replaced with an item available at any diner, two of us were served ordinary FT. Since it was a festive occasion, no fuss was made. At the end of the meal, we requested an explanation from the server. She said she would ask the chef. She only returned to our table to present the bill. Asked what the chef had said, our server said she would get the ""manager"", who turned out yo be the receptionist. We were told they order the bead for Melba's signature dish every weekend for brunch. No chef, no answer. Melba, if you are reading this, something is rotten on you kitchen."
10/13/2009,4 star rating,"My partner and most of our friends are in New York for one more year of God school, and we have resolved to break out of our Chelsea/Village/Midtown rut at least once a month, and get out where the good food is. Our first stop was Melba's, and we were not disappointed. Six of us headed uptown (we made a reservation at the last minute - a good idea if you are a party of 6) on a busy (but not insane) Tuesday night. The service was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly and piping hot, and our water glasses were never empty for more than a couple of minutes. Most of us ordered the chicken and waffles, and no one had any complaints - other than how full they were. I personally thought the chicken was superior to that at (the late great) Maroon's downtown, and certainly didn't find it bland as some Yelpers have suggested. But hey, if oversalted, burned fried chicken is your thing, who am I to say? The cocktails ($11) were delicious and the pours were generous...very generous. And as for dessert, the pound cake a la mode was out of this world. Why not 5 stars? Two reasons: my beer was not cold, the other desserts were unremarkable, and the catfish fingers were a little mushy (but very flavorful). The live music was excellent and entertaining, but way over-amplified. Still, overall, a wonderful experience and I look forward to going back."
12/25/2017,2 star rating,"We called first and asked about a reservation, the person that answered said no reservation needed just come. We got there within 45 minutes and ended up waiting 20-25 minutes for a table for 2.  A group of 6 were seated before us and came in after us because they didn't want to breakup a table of four, (bad business). As far as the food I ordered that chicken and waffles white meat, wing had no meat and was warm not hot.  the waffle was very good but not hot either.  I'm from Harlem and I have had better."

The wait comes and goes, it still will be 30 min. I was fine since my friends weren't there yet. They arrive, we're still waiting. By then it is 2 hours. The host pulls me to the side and brings me in to show me where we'd be seated. In a jammed table wedged between the kitchen/bathroom walkway. Are you for real!? We got up and left and headed to Amy Ruth's which was just as busy but seated us in 20 min and served us promptly."
3/19/2008,4 star rating,"Really excellent excellent food.  Who knew that fried chicken and waffles would go so well together?  However, since we were starving by the time we got it, that may have contributed to how good it tasted.  My friend had tried to make reservations but ended up leaving two messages and end result, no reservation.  So we sat at the bar to eat, which wasn't that bad.  I have no idea why there were so many people going out to eat on a  Wednesday.  Go home and cook for your families so that I can have a table!  The food took a really long time to get out, like probably more than half an hour after we put in the order.  It was good, but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait..oh and the fries were nothing special at all."
10/14/2017,4 star rating,I came here on Saturday for brunch. I ordered the catfish and eggnog waffle. The catfish was nicely seasoned and crispy the way I like it. The eggnog waffle was fresh and fluffy. Everything was tasty. The Mellini was decent and not too strong. I would definitely come here again for brunch. The only downside was the 30 minute wait to be seated. It was busy so get here before noon or after 1:30pm.

9/26/2014,5 star rating,This was my first time eating at Melba's and I was pleasantly surprised! I never know what to expect from soul food restaurants but Melba's was sooooo AMAZING.  I almost went back today. I just never had anything like it.  The food at this place was DELICIOUS!  And I will be going back.  Everything was cooked fresh and came out the kitchen piping hot. I never had sea bass before but now I am a fan. Melba's has won over my stomach as THE BEST RESTAURANT EVER!
8/14/2009,5 star rating,"Like many of you, I saw this place on Throwdown and was intrigued.  And like many of you, I think dive when I think of chicken 'n waffles.  So I went in to Melba's with mixed feelings and moderate expectations.It was a Thursday night and the place was full, but not so full that we had to wait.  It was also my husband's birthday, and we lucked out with a cozy corner seat right by the window: very lovely, really.  I hadn't been expecting this to be a romantic dinner.  Pleasantly surprised.Then came the wine.  We ordered a bottle of white.  Or so we thought.  Our server came over and presented us with a bottle of red by the same winemaker, already had the cork popped and ready to go.  Oops - had we actually said the type of wine, or just the name?  A miscommunication somewhere, as easily our fault as his, we decided.  While we were awkwardly hemming and hawing about whether we should be hardasses and send it back or just drink the red, the waiter slipped away and returned with the bottle we'd ordered and managed to make us not feel bad about the mistake (whose ever it was) at all.  I hadn't exptected such polished and excellent service!  Pleasantly surprised again.Then came the food.  The food I give four stars. The chicken and waffles with strawberry butter were solid.  Not the best I've ever had in my life, but definitely up there.  The wine braised short ribs were also very good as were the sides (yams and onions).  I wouldn't bat an eye if served the ribs dish at a swanky restaurant for twice the price.  Pleasantly surprised?  Yep.Then came the birthday.  The birthday is what made this a five-star experience for me.  On an ostensible trip to the restroom, I tried to chase our waiter down so I could ask about getting a cheesy little birthday surprise for the hubby - just a candle in the dessert we would undoubtedly order.  I was intercepted by Melba (who I recognized from the show).  She gave me a wide grin and assured me they'd take care of it.  Minutes later, we were presented with a gorgeous piece of Red Velvet cake and a candle by Melba herself!  Who then proceeded to lead the entire restaurant in a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday.  I was floored.  My husband was floored.  And obviously, very pleasantly surprised."

SO that was the first thing.  The service was the WORST. I waited to be seated for a long time and then when I finally was seated the waitress took forever to return to take my order. I must say the food was GOOD-4 STAR, that was the best part of the evening.  Well I wont be going back BUT if they have a take out menu I might consider getting my food to go!!"
5/3/2010,4 star rating,"I have gone to many a date here and many a late night weekend bite, and I have never been disappointed.  Never even close.The highlights for me are always the catfish (which is amazing) and the fried chicken with eggnog waffles.  And the cocktails.And also the way that they're able to serve you food that it's clear has been freshly prepared, but at the speed of light.  Sometimes I feel almost as if the kitchen staff must be telepathic.  But I love it.  Because even though the food comes out almost before you order it, you never feel rushed.  Never."
7/27/2007,3 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place, but I don't.  However, I'll still give it three stars, and here's why:Pros:1)  Tasty cocktails.2)  Great service.  Melba is quite nice.3)  Great location, if you live in Harlem.Cons:The food.  The food is just average.  For being a soul food restaurant in Harlem, I was expecting a lot more.  Amy Ruth's (116th/Lenox) and Rack and Soul (109/Broadway) are much better.  I love fried chicken, and those dirty take out places with bullet proof windows probably serve up better fried chicken."
10/26/2010,5 star rating,I found out about Melba's by watching Bobby Flay cook off in which Melba won. So I know I had to go to Harlem to try it out.I was a little nervous about thought of Harlem but it was really fine...It kind of resembles Ms. Toostie in Philadelphia in its size and atmosphere. However I ordered the chicken and waffles it was very good..The chicken was fried too perfection and the waffles came with strawberry butter... I will definetely be backMELA more chicken please ... lol
3/28/2015,2 star rating,"My Son and I both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken. The chicken was tasty. Of the sides, the spinach and Mac& cheese were best. The mashed potatoes only so-so. My dark meat pieces definitely came from one small chicken. I got  jipped for sure.Prices seemed a bit high; disappointed that the meals didn't come with cornbread or biscuits or some sort of bread. Last, our server Trent was too overwhelmed with tables to be attentive. The host could have stepped up and helped, but chose not to. The guys busing tables spent most of their time walking around empty handed. They also should step up their games. It's not good when you see customers looking about for their waiter. Not cool when they catch their waiters glance, only to have him say just a minute- then disappear in back then return in five minutes. I don't expect that we'll visit Melba's again."
7/18/2015,5 star rating,"This place is Oozing Class. It's a Social Intimate Environment,  I made   this place My Second Home. The Food is Amazing, Please Be Clear!  The EggNog Waffle is so tasty with that Strawberry Butter and the Chicken is Scrumptious, Meaty & Moist. On another day I had the Shrimp( Scampi or lightly fried) To the slap ya momma Collard Greens ( just kiddin) and Cheesy Delish Mac & Cheesyyum yum! Melba is sooo Down to Earth Beautiful when we she's there. Make sure u order the Catfish Appetizer #HOOKED...I want to live next door to this restaurant, I'm greedy, lol"
10/2/2016,4 star rating,"I have eaten here many times, they are pretty consistant, one of the better places in Harlem to eat. I used to actually see the owner there pretty regularly. Back in the day when Muhammad was the chef they had a mac n cheese recipe that was literally out-of-this-world! i miss that recipe. it was definetly one of the best macs I have EVER had (sorry mom) now the recipe is still good, but not as good as then."
12/30/2010,4 star rating,"Alright, alright. I only came here just because I saw it on Throwdown. Okay, I admit the only thing I ordered was the chicken and waffles. Okay, I'm just another stupid tourist. Fine, I'll take it.You know, I must have been watching a different show or something, because the Melbas I saw on TV and the Melbas I sat in were night and day. The one on TV looked like it was just some hole in the wall place and this Melbas was fancy pancy, very modern and chic. Where did I mess this up? Anyway, the ambiance and decor were NOT what I expected but it was really nice either way. We walked in just when the  lunch service was at its end. The lady who sat us down said she'd have to ask Melba if she could take another order and Melba herself said no problem and she'd love to have us. AWESOME. She even came out and was running around saying hello to everyone. I love it when restaurant owners do that.So, of course we had the eggnog waffles with chicken. of course. Duh. Yes, it was delicious, yes, it was everything i expected. It was a little fancier than I thought it would be. I was hoping for a little more homestyle, with big ugly waffles and the chicken right on top. Nonetheless, it was delicious. My biggest peeve when getting fried chicken is soft skin and dry inside. This was CRISPY outside and perfectly cooked and moist inside. THANK YOU. The only thing I didn't care for was the biscuit with the smuckers grape jelly. I figure with the quality of her chicken and waffles, that she would make her own grape jelly. it's not hard, for pete's sake. oh well. I'm not sure if next time I visit Harlem I'll come back, but it was a good experience."
1/7/2011,4 star rating,Their smothered chicken is DELICIOUS and I highly recommend itTheir eggnog waffles were kind of a disappointment but it may have been over hyped. Their service was a bit slow but they were busy when we went. My fiance and I were the only non-african americans in the place and we instantly knew this would be an authentic harlem cuisine experience. =D Not to sound racist ahaha.
1/30/2011,4 star rating,"Went for dinner after finding a groupon for the place.  Ordered Chicken n Waffles, with a side of mac n cheese. Everything was yummy! Chicken was nice and crispy waffles were soft, and the strawberry butter was tasty...  I just wish there was more (Im Greedy..lol).  On the Throw down with Melba vs Bobby Flay  the Waffle she made was Way bigger!!The drink menu is very nice, I ordered the Red Sangria..will definitely return.oh if you go in the winter , and are cold easily (Like me) wear something extra warm, because I sat close to the door (the place is small) and people coming in and out had me freezing :("
10/29/2014,4 star rating,"I went for brunch with 3 other friends last Sunday. It was so freaking good! Totally worth the wait (I'll admit that I got a bit cranky waiting) I got salmon croquettes and grits. Yum. Because we were greedy, my friend and I got a side order of the fried chicken.  The little biscuit they serve when you sit down---delish! The service was good. We had a waitress who was attentive and friendly without being annoying. I don't make it up to Harlem often, but I would go back and suggest it to others. OH and I got to meet THE Melba. She is sort of fabulous and pretty much gave me life. All in all a good experience."
7/17/2014,5 star rating,"If you're uptown in NYC, with out a doubt - make a stop here. Even if you're downtown, the commute will be worth it. I used to work at this restaurant and have enjoyed watching it succeed. Melba is an incredible woman, she was a fantastic boss - and she certainly knows what she's doing. Her team is well educated, skilled, and passionate about what they do.I miss those Chicken and Waffles!! And her red velvet cake?!?! It is impossible not to have more than one bite. It was often the reason I ran a couple extra miles each day living in the city. Totally worth it. Brunch is always poppin' here. The atmosphere is intimate and inviting at night. I love the dark wood and the lighting so much...Having been both a customer and a worker there - I am impressed all around. She runs a clean tight ship with professional people.As I see this establishment, and Melba, continue to succeed - I feel more and more proud that I worked there!"
1/5/2009,3 star rating,"okay, so my friend and i went here for some fried chicken and waffles, and having eaten several times at Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles (Los Angeles), i knew that Melba had her work cut out for her.Well, perhaps it's that Bobby Flay hyped up this dish too much in an episode of Throwdown, where they competed for who had the best chicken and waffles. but then again, i love Roscoe's which lives up to all the hype everytime i go.Okay, on to eating -- the portions are definitely generous, the waffles more on the gourmet side and were crispy and good but what made it better was the great strawberry butter. when the butter melts on the waffles it definitely kicks up the flavor. i ordered white meat chicken and it was cooked perfectly, the chicken was moist BUT had ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOR!having made fried chicken and eaten it plenty of times, i know one thing -- fried chicken is supposed to have flavor -- this had none. And my friend who also had the fried chicken (except dark meat) agree that the chicken had no flavor and was bland. but on the plus side, it was moist and tender -- come to think of it some hot sauce would have been perfect to kick it up a notch.so here's how i distributed the 3 stars- 1 star for some of the most delicious mac n' cheese you'll ever eat, the macaroni was cooked perfectly, it was cheesy with perfect consistency -- not too thick not to thin, and it had bread crumbs :)- 1 star for the best dang cheddar cheese grit cake i ever had in my life, it was so buttery and perfect-1 star for the best sweet potato pie i've ever eaten in my life, my taste buds were swirling, next time i'd order it with vanilla ice cream. it's served warm and the flavors are insane! nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and i think also had maple syrup or molasses -- bottom line is that i'd go to harlem just for a slice of that pie!so would i go back? YES. would i order the fried chicken? NO. but i would definitely try other entrees and make sure to order mac n' cheese, grits cake and sweet potato pie just in case the other dish isn't good."
2/22/2012,3 star rating,I've been here for Brunch and for Dinner.Small compliant: I just wanted orange juice at brunch (was too hungover for more alcohol) and it was low qualityBy far my favorite thing here is the strawberry butter with the Chicken and Waffles.  The chicken (dark meat of course) is juicy and the waffles taste so good with that strawberry butter.everything else on the menu is mediocre to be honest.  Mac and Cheese is decent.
3/14/2015,5 star rating,Went to Melbas with my GF was a beautiful experience nice low key spot waitress and servers were very nice and food was delicious !!!
9/15/2015,4 star rating,The food at Melba's is banging. I've been going there for a few years now and should have given her a review a long time ago. The food is excellent. My favorite is the Mac and Cheese and Southern fried Chicken. The crab cakes or off the hook too! The space is pretty small but the food makes up for it. Thumbs all the way up!
7/18/2016,4 star rating,"Great food. Everyone ordered different meals and no one was dissapointed. They were very accommodating to our large party of 12, even more so considering the size of the restaurant. Will definitely be back soon."
1/1/2015,4 star rating,"I don't know what's better, the service or the food. This place is amazing. Definitely try the spring rolls, you will not regret it. Like many NYC restaurants, it is quaint so expect to wait. But it will be worth it."
10/5/2014,4 star rating,"Sunday is one of their busiest days of the week! So plan accordingly, it is definitely worth it. A must try is the Egg Nog Waffles and the French Toast for brunch. The Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass and the Grilled Salmon are delicious. The hostesses and servers are attentive and accommodating. It is a small intimate space so seating is limited but you will have an excellent dining experience."
11/11/2012,3 star rating,"Had the southern fried chicken and eggnog waffles, which is what our server told us was the most popular dish. I was really disappointed by it. The waffles were soggy and I couldn't taste the eggnog. The fried chicken had a tasty seasoning, however,  it was a bit on the dry side. We also ordered the mac and cheese. It was okay. Maybe we just had an unfortunate dining experience, because this place got packed really fast by noon."
5/28/2012,4 star rating,"Walked into Melba's on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty busy. Our host let us sit at the bar until a table was available. I ordered the salmon with collard greens and macaroni and cheese. They asked how Id like the salmon cooked...ummm so there's no salmonella? I never knew there was an option. The portion size was perfect. The salon flaky and light. I couldnt eaten a vat of the creamy, cheesy macaroni. The collard greens were interesting..never had them before..they were kind of bitter..but maybe thats how they should taste. The service was a tad slow, but helpful and friendly. Considering how well priced the menu items were, most of the drinks on the menu quite expensive...$11 for a glass of sangria?!"
8/22/2015,5 star rating,"This place is Great for Soul food! Best place in Harlem , although it Gets very busy make sure to always have reservations"
8/22/2015,4 star rating,"One of the best Soul Food restaurants in Harlem. The food was phenomenal! I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken wings, candied yams and Tres Mac & Cheese. Excellent! Although, I agree they could use a hostess with a smile, I still thought the service was good. On a down side, the drinks were a little pricy and at times can taste watered down. I think it's safe to say, I would visit again."
6/26/2014,2 star rating,"Came here after Food Network gave it such great reviews but I was greatly disappointed. We got here around 9:10 pm to a packed restaurant; after about a 40 minute wait plus a 10 minute set up of our table, our server arrived another 5 minutes after that...without menus. The food took another 25 mins to come and was okay but not exactly worth the wait (we got the chicken and waffles and ribs). We would have been better off just ordering sides which were really good (Mac and cheese/collard greens). Super slow service, okay food...I would not return."
3/15/2010,4 star rating,"I was wondering around Harlem 1 night for a late dinner, came upon this restaurant first when I saw Gail (Oprah's best friend) outside the restaurant taking pictures with fans. On that very night I said that must be a good sign Service was great, crowd was busy for a Friday night (maybe they thought OPRAH was there too), & the food was fantastic. The venue & decor was intimate, but could still be enjoyed in a group setting as well. I ordered the southern fried chicken (grilled with yams & mach & cheese). I have to say I was impressed with the preparation & the seasoning, expect a bit of wait.....nothing a few glasses of wine wont help conquer though. My lady had turkey meatloaf which said seemed to be cold & lacked consistency (she's a snob)....it was above average meatloaf with a BBQ glaze. Also had some appetizer the crab cakes, I've had better but they get a B-. Otherwise this place is a great dine, on the upper end of prices but if your looking for a great meal & ambiance, with some Harlem soul this is a good start."
8/16/2013,3 star rating,"The food was absolutely delicious but the portions wasn't. My parents and I went there to celebrate my mom's 48th birthday and when she ordered the crab cakes, they were so tiny that you could finish them in one bite. Only two little ones came on a plate and even that cost $9.95. Waste of money. I ordered the southern catfish with candied yams and tres mac and cheese. That was of course delicious but it still left me hungry afterwards. Not to mention how long it took for the food to get there. Then the restaurant was so small and it only had one floor with the tables so close together that you have to turn sideways to get by and I'm not a big person either. I'm just saying you would get more for your money at Amy Ruth's. Delicious food, really great portions with reasonable prices and amount of waiting time and there are two floors so there is plenty of room.Amy Ruth's over Melba's :/"
4/3/2015,2 star rating,"This place is legend and the first two times we went was like BAM delicious. So maybe I should give three stars but our third visit was not the charm. nope, naw. The chicken-- a source of pride for the brand-- was dry and ornery and rubbery and sort of skinny like those chickens in the cartoons running in the desert. Gamey. And the greens, usually perfection were kinda soggy and seeped weird maple juice into my mac and cheese. Listen if I am gonna pay 70 bucks for two chicken dinners it sure as hell better be GOOD GOOD GOOD. Or at least better than the take out at Best Market which by the way is awesome."
3/27/2016,4 star rating,This place was pretty great. I have to say that their biscuits are amazing and I really appreciated that they had veggie options (I am vegetarian) since a lot of it is comfort food. I had an omelette w spinach and cheese and it was very good. It is a nice place to come for brunch and I would definitely go back.
5/28/2017,3 star rating,Great food! The catfish was hitting!  So were the greens. Our waiter was terrible (to the point where we had to walk our check to the manager in order to pay cause he never came to our table) but not an overall indication of the restaurant because the waiter for the tables around us was really good and attentive. Worth checking out.
6/2/2014,4 star rating,"Have always wanted to check this place out. While we had to wait a bit to get served, the waiter was nice and explained that a lot of people had arrived at once. And, the food was WORTH the wait. I tried the catfish strips, the turkey meatloaf with black-eyed peas and rice and they were delicious. I also had a bite of the collard greens a they were great too. I can't wait to try the sweet potato pancakes for brunch!"
5/1/2014,5 star rating,"YES! I love Melba's I go there so often it's actually quite ridiculous.  The service is great, the ambience is cozy and the food is PERFECT!  My personal favorites are:1) Braised Short Rib - 102) Fried Catfish - 93) Spring Rolls (odd but perfect) - 104) Garlic Mash - 105) Collard Greens - 10++++6) Eggnog waffles (ask for them well done) - 87) Salmon - 10I'm not a big fan of fried chicken and Melba's doesn't wow me in the category though they're famous for it.  The mac isn't the way I personally like it but it's okay.  And under no circumstances should you order that turkey meatloaf, it's suspect.  But overall. Melba's is the only place in NYC where I feel like I'm getting good comfort food.And Melba is the absolute best! If she's in the restaurant she comes by to make sure everyone is enjoying the food and chitchats with them."
11/29/2013,4 star rating,"When I was in Harlem, I was starving and remembering seeing this on the food network. Im used to eating at chain breakfast places so I was expecting a somewhat generic experience, boy was I wrong. The food is devine!! Everything tasted homemade and was on point. I am a southern gal at heart. The grits are on point!!! These arent your cream of wheat grits that are watery like at Bob Evans. Yeah, dont ever order those at B.E, the chicken is sooo good... Damn good.. So good that it will make you smack your momma!! All the food is good and will increase your blood pressure..lol. The service rocks here!!"
3/4/2017,5 star rating,"I had the oxtails, collard greens and peas and rice. The best decision I made that day. Amazing meal. The service was excellent. When I arrived, I sat at the bar to wait for the rest of my party. The bartender, Moses, was excellent. Very attentive and polite. Our waiter, Daequan, was equally impressive.  Attentive, polite and timely.  I'm going back."
7/14/2015,4 star rating,"Delicious soul food.The catfish nuggets:  amazing.Turkey meatloaf:  amazing.A bit cramped and loud inside, though the same can be said for nearly every NYC restaurant.  But I would definitely recommend."
8/14/2012,4 star rating,this is a dope place for brunch. didn't wait at all around 1pm although a small wait formed while we were eating. We were greeted kindly enough and service was decent. the chicken and egg nog waffles were PERFECT! and the Harlem iced tea gave me a nice buzz without  being too strong. Definitely a nice twist on the classic long island.My only knock is that is was hot as hell in there... need better AC. But I'll be back for more once I explore Harlem for a bit.
9/30/2012,3 star rating,"I ordered the chicken and waffles. After standing in Morningside Park enjoying a DJ set and eyeing a group of revelers sharing a box o' chicken I declared my friend and I needed to find a spot to dine. I was famished. She suggested Melba's and after circling for parking we lucked up on a spot  a 1/2 block away. A sign outside bragged that Melba's had won against Bobby Flay in a thrown down (I'm sure I could win against old Bobby) but that enticed me to try said winning chicken and waffles. I found the chicken tasty but that was a baby chicken. The waffles were not in the least bit crisp. The art of waffle making is gone. I don't know what egg nog waffles are suppose to taste like so I assume they were good but I don't do doughy.The best part of our visit was sitting next to a pair of gentlemen and discussing current events and spying a lovely oil painting of Marvin Gaye. This place is small and patrons at the bar may burst out into a fit of laughter that will startle you for perhaps say, oh 3 seconds. And then you realize this place needs about another 35 square feet. Perhaps I will return and Melba can earn another star. For now it rests at 3/5. Boom."
12/26/2016,5 star rating,Oh yeah. Who doesn't love a little soul food in Harlem? Fried chicken. Rice and peas. Sauteed shrimp. Mac and cheese. Collards.
3/22/2010,4 star rating,Food:  Good food for a good price.  Had wings and mini-burgers for appetizers.  Mini-burgers were great.  Wings were flavored great but were dry and very small.  For an entree I had the salmon and it was delicious as were the onion rings and smashed potatoes.  Ice Cream was okay...more icy than creamy and a very small portion.Service:  Excellent!
3/20/2014,4 star rating,"I went here with a good friend in January after being denied form Freda's and their private holiday party. Luckily Mellba's wasn't a far distance to walk to. We came in and sat immediately. We ordered lemon honey chicken strips and mini burgers for appetizers. The chicken tenders were ok, could've used some more seasoning. The sliders were cool. I ordered the southern fried chicken with collard greens and tres mac and cheese, my friend ordered the fried catfish with grits and an eggnog waffle and we both got their long island iced tea for drinks. The chicken was fried well, I would've liked a bit more flavor on the chicken itself but the batter was good. Collard greens were pretty good, even though my dad makes better. The mac and cheese was really good. Cheesy, yummy, gooey. I'm not a big fan or pepper jack but the mac & cheese hit the spot. My friend shared her waffle with me and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a little sweet and went well with the fried chicken. The drink was strong, just what we wanted. The space is pretty small and cozy so be prepared to be close to other patrons. The server was nice. He helped us with our drinks and checked on us periodically, while allowing us to enjoy our food. From a Brooklyn girl, worth the trek to Harlem."
6/30/2016,4 star rating,"Learn about this restaurant on a tv show based on restaurant so i figure i give ot a try. Was not dissapointed at all. Tried the fried chicken, greens and mac cheese along with sweet potato pie. Was very pleased and the server stay on top of everything and was very pleasant."
6/25/2017,2 star rating,Well where do I begin.  we had an 845 reservation we were seated at 9 o'clock upon being seated at the table we will brought water we did not get our drinks until 955 our food did not come till 1030 the food was tasty but the service sucked. The host wound up being our server he was very nice but unfortunately he wasn't working with the adequate tools to be a server.  When I spoke with the manager prior to us getting our drinks she said she would take a little something off the bill at the end when we got the bill sheets of temper sent off I felt that was unacceptable so we had a conversation about it and she wound up taking 25% off in this day and age is unacceptable for a customer to sit in a restaurant for 55 minutes before getting a drink. They did some renovations and expand the other side of the restaurant which was nice but unfortunately it was hot as hell in there no air-conditioning two fans set up needless to say I was quite disappointed having been to the restaurant on multiple occasions before this was my absolute worst visit they need to invest in an air conditioning system that will keep the restaurant at an excellent or adequate temperature and work on getting a waitstaff that will show up for work.  They only had one waitress quite disappointing
6/16/2014,1 star rating,"Awful food. Just awful. We ordered the southern fried chicken and eggnog waffle with strawberry butter and maple syrup, supposedly what this place is known for, what they do Really Well. We also ordered a side of peas and rice.   Well. The chicken (dark) was stringy and overcooked, and smelled of old oil. The waffle was wet and undercooked. The strawberry butter tasted like a jelly bean instead of like strawberries had been melded with butter. We were brought a big bowl of... room temperature crunchy rice, and we had to hunt in it for the peas. And come on, y'all, blackeyed peas are Not Expensive.   And to add insult to injury, just what WAS that scungy black stuff inside the bottom of my water glass?  Slow service, awful food, hygiene issues. Can I give 0 stars?"
1/31/2015,4 star rating,"If you want grits, get the cheddar grits! Attentive, good food and  cool atmosphere. Also, the eggnog waffles were delicious!"
12/7/2014,4 star rating,"Great food, friendly staff, long wait. The things done well here are done to perfection, but they could use a little help in the less important areas.Melba's does not take same day reservations, but told us they wouldn't have much trouble seating 6 of us around 8. Our party of 6 showed up at 8:20pm and were told it'd be 40 minutes to an hour. No problem, put our name in and went a block down to get some drinks at Bier (would not go to Bier again - another review). Come back 40 minutes later and was told another 20 minutes. Cool.We are seated at 9pm by a very friendly waitress who was prompt and helpful in our selections. Drinks took awhile to show up and came after our appetizers did. To be fair the place was packed, but I think they could use an extra waiter/waitress on a Saturday night. My Harlem Iced Tea and Old Fashioned were on point.Spring Rolls are nothing special. Crispy skin, bland filling. You get two rolls sliced in half per order. Would not order again. We also ordered the Crab Cakes but they didn't come out until we reminded the Waitress. We are Crab Cake snobs and I thought these were flavored well but completely defeated by the texture which was mushy exterior and mushy interior - no crisp to the skin. There is certainly no lump to these Crab Cakes. Amy said the flavor wasn't there either. The online menu has Cheddar Grits Cakes, something the actual restaurant no longer serves. I love grits and I was very disappointed to see they didn't even have Corn Bread or Biscuits. Isn't this place supposed to be southern comfort food?Fried Chicken (white meat) and Egg Nog Waffles were god damned delicious. Crispity crunchity skin with juicy tender meat served atop a golden Waffle with a dollop of Strawberry Butter and a side of sizzurp. Waffle was cooked well, but I prefer mine to be a little more on the crunchy side which this was not. Something to consider if you prefer your waffles done a certain way, I am sure they can make it however you like. Melba's has what you need if you want Chicken & Waffles done right. The only downside to getting the C&W is that you don't get any sides. All the other entrees come with a choice of two sides. They're not expensive and they're definitely worth ordering. The Candied Yams, Collard Greens, and Mac & Cheese were all perfect. Sweet yummy Yams, juicy green Collard's, and creamy cheesy Mac were equally impressive, and these are three foods that I have shoveled into my gullet many a time.Fried Catfish is another masterpiece. Crispy battered catfish with little to no grease and juicy tender fish. Would definitely recommend this dish. The Beef Short Rib is the only dish that underwhelmed. It wasn't cooked for long enough and the result was a slightly rubbery consistency. Great flavor on the reduction they braised it with, but it needed to be cooked another few hours or at a lower temperature.The Peach Cobbler was fantastic. Buttery sugary sweet goodness - though I'm pretty sure the peaches are canned - this was a great dessert and definitely deserves to be accompanied by the Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream which had a great consistency and good flavor. Homemade Chocolate Ice Cream was frozen and had ice crystals in it. It was like eating pure frozen cocoa - which I like the flavor of, but not the texture. The Sweet Potato Pie is ok, but it needs some seasoning love like some more warm spices to really make it pop.Add Cornbread, Biscuits, and Grits to the menu and redo those Spring Rolls and Crab Cakes. Toss your old Chocolate Ice Cream and make fresh batches more often. Add another server/waiter to your weekend staff. Give cooking options for your waffles (more done/less done for crunch vs doughiness). They're already a classic, but take care of these things and Melba's is a 5-star shining beacon of southern perfection nestled in Harlem."

5/17/2014,1 star rating,"I have never had a worse dining experience. This evening, a friend and I went in to grab a burger at the bar at 9:45. An hour later we still did not have our rare and medium rare burgers. An hour and 45 minutes after we ordered them, two ice cold pucks of raw meat came out. The very kind bartender took them away while the inefficient manager made pathetic excuses about large parties. Unacceptable. The restaurant is TINY. Finally, I got my burger back. It was so dried out and over cooked I took one bite and couldn't eat it despite the fact I was ravenous. Worst service, worst burger, ever. I won't be back. The manager made sad excuses but clearly did not care about the quality of food at his establishment."

It's neither, but it's more than just A-OK so I give it a 4.I went here with some girlfriends on a Friday for brunch. We thought we were going to have to wait a while because that's what all the reviews said. But we got there at 11:30 and were seated right away. The place is cozy, and the decor inside is really modern and classy. We all got the chicken and waffles (which did not disappoint!) and it came with this wonderful strawberry butter. Delicious!And the service! Our servers were absolutely great! They were friendly, attentive, welcoming, and made sure everything was alright (but not in annoying, intrusive way). I actually think I liked the service better than the food, which is hard to beat because the food was really good! I would definitely come back here again to try some of their other dishes. Oh! And the table next to me ordered drinks, and I remember being able to smell the alcohol from where I was sitting. Must mean they make some pretty mean drinks as well :)"
8/7/2011,4 star rating,"Brunch at Melba's is amazing. They have numerous items,, all or which sound lovely, however the eggnog waffles are the best thing on the menu. Accompany your waffle with a crispy, flaky, piece of catfish and you'll have the best brunch in life. Also, if you're a boozer like myself, I highly recommend the mango mimosa.  The bartender isn't stingy on the pour, so you get a nice bang for your buck.Service is here is friendly and the atmosphere is great!  Definitely one of Harlem's best restaurants."
5/20/2017,2 star rating,"I ate at melbas in march, this time around the chicken was over cooked, dry and had no taste, the yams taste bland like it was from a can, collard greens was ok. I don't know what happened. I hope they are not going down hill."
4/10/2016,4 star rating,"I eat here Saturday evening and let me tell you, the best soul food. I have fried chicken white meat, collard greens and Mac & cheese. OMG the chicken was so good seasoned very well and fresh. I got the red velvet cake to go. I ate once I got home, was so good and fresh.I will try the eggnog waffles next time"

11/30/2008,4 star rating,"My buddies and I hit up Melba's for a laid-back dinner on a Friday night, and we were pretty impressed. The place had been decked out for Christmas, and I've always been a sucker for the aesthetic appeal of holly and Christmas wreaths and candle-lit tables.The atmosphere was chill, and the size of the space kept it from getting too loud, even though the place was nearly full.  The food was great: I recommend the mac and cheese (it's fantastic).  It wasn't quite what I planned on eating the day after Thanksgiving (I had to gym it the next day...), but it was worth it.  Service was attentive, and we all left with plans to come back soon.The full bar is definitely a plus.  I didn't get to sample the cocktails, but I plan to do so when I go next."
10/1/2014,5 star rating,"Everything about this place was excellent. Quaint ,small neighborhood spot that you can tell is filled with locals. I had the chicken & waffles (since I watch throwdown with bobby flay) and it was absolutely delicious and ironically it was the worst thing I had here, if I can say that because everything was great. The waffle is amazing. I forgot it was an eggnog waffle and as I was eating I was thinking to myself, ""why does this waffle taste so different than a normal waffle?"" Then I remembered why. I also had the chocolate girl martini, which was embarrassing to order since I'm a guy but it was strong just how I like it. I had the catfish with mac and cheese and potato salad the next day for lunch. It was even better than the chicken and waffles. The two sides were about as good as it gets, no exaggeration. This place really knows how to make soul food. Lastly, I had the peach cobbler, which comes deconstructed in martini glass. You can tell this was made when I ordered it. Although it came presented new age, it was so classic in taste and delicious. Best peach cobbler I've ever had. That's what I loved about this place. Everything was made fresh and with care. You can see all the little veggies and herbs in your food. The service was the best! My server Daquan was the man. Beware this place is always busy. Went on a Monday night at 830 and there was a 45 min wait. Came back tuesday around 6 and was seated right away but when I was leaving there was line out the door."
6/26/2014,2 star rating,SERIOUSLY THE DATE IS JUNE 26th 2014 8:02 I'm really hungry but anyways... I must WRITE HOW IRRITATING THE DJ WAS . Like Melba's food is always good but SERIOUSLY this place is TOO SMALL to have a DJ in the corner BLASTING music SO DISTASTEFULLY ! I mean I am disgusted and irritated with the noise level it is above tolerance and it's very chaotic . This is NOT a night club it's a freaking small restaurant . People should be able to HEAR them selves speak people should be able to HEAR the WAITOR . PEOPLE ARE SCREAMING BC THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD . I am BEYOND PISSED . Literally I want to leave and take this order to go . Extremely distasteful ! This place WILL NEVER see me again on Thursdays . I'm taken aback . Truly
11/19/2008,4 star rating,"Melba's is the kind of place that doesn't make you mad when you go out. Some places have poor service, poor drinks, a terrible staff, but Melba's is none of those things. Melba's is just a simple and comfortable spot and has THE best mac and cheese in all of Harlem. If you can't decided on where to go in Harlem then Melba's will never disappoint you."
11/13/2011,5 star rating,"I went to this restaurant last Saturday for dinner. The food is awesome! I felt like I just sat down and had dinner at my own home. I had the fried chicken with collard greens & macaroni and cheese. Everything was flavorful. My friends and I couldn't stop talking about how good the food is. Everyone was very satisfied with their dinner. Kudos to the chef and the staff at Melba's. The only thing that was missing from the menu was cornbread. That needs to be added ASAP. Other than that, everything was perfect! Will return soon!!!"
2/11/2017,3 star rating,"So this review is more about the service than the food.  In short, I would rate the food three stars.  it was served hot, but the meat portions, in my case the fried chicken, was very disappointing.  I didn't realize that by default they would serve you the breast/wing portion of the chicken without even asking if you would prefer the leg/thigh.  Moving forward, I was served a very small leg/thigh with collards that were full of stems.  The party I was with, we were told that they did not have any diet soft drinks.  How is that possible on a Saturday night and we were the FIRST guest arriving through the door??  I able to taste a piece of the catfish which was very nice and the jumbo shrimp.  Both were well seasoned.  Overall, if you know what good soul food is from your mama, grandma, or auntie..this will be acceptable.  For those who do not know or have ever experienced HOME COOKIN' Soul Food, you may think this is the best thing smoking'.  So either way...as far as food is concerned, I would say it is worth the visit.  Now onto the service...I was very disappointed.  We went for my sister-in-law's birthday dinner.  I could not believe how SLOW the service was!!  When I say slow, I mean appetizers, entree, dessert....TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!  In fact, I didn't even get to have the dessert because I had to leave so I wouldn't miss the train home!  No, it wasn't the kind of slow that is meant to be smooth and relaxing as you move from one part of the meal to another.  This was the kind of slow where you are sighing under your breath and taping your fingers on the table like ""where is our food!""  Overall, this place did not seem like they were prepared to receive guest; almost like they didn't even start cooking until you walked in the door.   The staff was pleasant, but seemed confused and disorganized."
4/22/2017,1 star rating,"We put in our order and asked where it was 30 mins later. The waitress got very annoyed and curtly replied that it was coming. 30 minutes after that, we saw tables arriving after us getting their food and we asked again where the food was. The manager came over and tried to apologize for the mistake, but we were too hungry and left. He insisted on sending a coupon/voucher to our address but it never arrived."
2/24/2014,3 star rating,I went to Melba's yesterday right when they were opening for dinner. We couldn't decide what to order so we ordered the chicken and waffles and catfish with mac & cheese and collard greens and split them. The chicken and waffles was very good but I wouldn't say award winning. My friend specified several times that she wanted the fish fried hard. The waiter said we always make it that way and it came not only not fried hard but underdone and barely edible. The macaroni was also under-cooked but I really liked the greens. My friend also ordered an iced tea that never came. Melba was at the next table which was cool but the food left a lot to be desired. Might return if in the neighborhood but would not recommend.
4/25/2016,5 star rating,I had the Cat Fish with greens n Mac n cheese...  My babe had chicken n waffles...  It was the best experience I had n a long time wen it came to eating out..  The food was hot n fresh...  I will be eating there again...  Thanks Melba!!!

9/7/2014,5 star rating,Good drinks and food. Try the chicken and waffles. Better than Roscoes Chicken and waffles in LA.
3/27/2016,4 star rating,My husband and I was there on Saturday and I must say the food was absolutely delicious not only were we there to have a nice dinner to honor our 11th wedding anniversary but there were about 4 birthday celebrations as well. .our waiter Trent was very attentive and the manager made our seating as comfortable as can be being that the restaurant is quite small. .I'm already thinking of what to order on my next visit..
10/7/2014,4 star rating,I am so glad I had a groupon because I was able to try different things. I had the pan fried basa and the grilled salmon. Fish was fresh and it was very lightly seasoned. The mac and cheese was SO DAMN GOOD! the garlic spinach was yummy the beans and rice was also very tasty and the cat fish filets were very good...will go back for the mac and cheese and cat fish fillets. wan to try the potato salad and the fried catfish dinner..
4/13/2014,2 star rating,"I woke up on a lovely Sunday morning craving chicken and waffles (pregnant woman issues), so my boyfriend and I decided we should try Melba's. I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I was really surprised that after my visit I decided never to go back. The two stars were given based on the wait time or lack of a wait time. For anyone who is familiar with the Harlem brunch atmosphere, it's a well known fact that you should be prepared to wait to be seated. Fortunately for us, we were told it would be thirty minutes but we were seated in less than five. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of grits. The waffle was amazing (this is the reason for the second star). The chicken lacked flavor although it was fried well. The grits were good but nothing to call home about. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed to find out that during brunch hours they don't offer the full menu. He settled for chicken and homefries, which he didn't care for too much. Melba's lost stars because of the waiter, who walked passed out table multiple times before taking our order, then served us hot juice. They also lost stars because it was really loud and the tables are way too close. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with Melba's I would've liked to try their dinner options at another time but based on my brunch experience I'd rather skip it."
4/8/2017,2 star rating,"The new addition to the restaurant is nothing like the original restaurant, feels like two separate restaurants mashed together.  Different lighting, paint, furniture, feel, everything.  The music from the restaurant couldn't really be heard in the new addition. There was no heat, so we froze all throughout dinner.  Couldn't take part in the excitement in the original restaurant.  Felt like we were sitting at the children's table when we really wanted to sit with the adults.  Catfish, collards and sweet tea were AMAZING!!!  Yams clearly came out of a can.  Mac & Cheese needs to be completely revamped.  Our waiter made it all tolerable.  He needs a raise. Kudos to the staff."
7/16/2014,4 star rating,"FANTASTIC FOOD. I had the pecan crusted tilapia with mac and cheese and sautéed spinach for sides. A lot of food and great quality. My dining buddy had the fried chicken and eggnog waffle and I couldn't stop stealing the waffle off her plate. Loud environment but still easy to chat. Fast service, we were in and out in under an hour without feeling rushed.  Only detractor (and it was minor) was cocktails were kind of pricey. But beer was reasonable and complimented the meal! Highly recommend Melba's."
11/15/2013,4 star rating,"This is probably the best comfort food restaurant I have ever eaten at. I live down the block from the place and am a loyal customer. The bbq turkey meatloaf with candy yams and garlic mash potatoes is to die for! Finger licking good. I also tried their chicken and waffles, which was also amazing. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the meals can be a tad pricey."
6/14/2013,1 star rating,"I've been hearing about how great Melba's was for years and for me to be a Harlemite for my entire live I was ashamed that I had never been. My stepfather and I decided to take my mom for dinner the Friday before Mother's Day (to beat the rush). Our reservation wasn't until 7 so we enjoyed an appetizer (calamari; of which the portion was so small it afforded each of us one and half bites) and drinks at the bar on the HAPPY HOUR MENU, which were paid for at the bar. Once we were seated we ordered. My step-father and I both had the chicken and waffles and mom had the catfish. As a woman whose bones were bred on soul food, I'd expect a soulfood dinner exceeding $15 to be finger licking good...this was not. The chicken was bland and average, the waffles were nothing special and I don't understand what the hype is about that berry butter...nothing to write home about. My mother said her catfish was dry, yet well seasoned. Needless to say we were ready to go. We ordered two slices of cake for desert, to go and asked for the check. Here's where it got messy:First they gave us the wrong bill. They combined our bill as well as the table's next to ours. We asked for the manager and had them correct it which they did. Annoyed we just asked for our desserts, paid and left. When we got and to our suprise and disappointment we realized that instead of packing our desserts we were given the table next to our's left over, half-eaten meat loaf and chicken. We immediately called and were advised that we would be receiving a free dinner coupon in the mail (that to this day I have not received). A week later my step-father noticed on his credit card statement that the restaurant charged us additionally for the appetizers and drinks that we had at the bar even though we paid prior to being seated. We called and were told that the woman who ""handles"" these things, was hosting an event, REALLY?! Never got a call back, never got a coupon. So now we let the Credit Card company handle it.I am an avid supporter of Black owned businesses in my community and will give as many as I can a chance, but Melba's will never get my money ever again. I live in Harlem! And anyone that asks me where to go for Soul Food in Harlem I will emphatically dissuade them from spending a dime at Melba's. Maybe if Melba, herself, didn't spend all her time catering and entertaining the ""tourists"" who dine at her restaurant and employed the same respect and hospitality to the locals who have the potential to be repeat costumers more of us wouldn't venture to dine OUTSIDE of our own communities because the poor costumer service that is often received by businesses in our own neighborhoods."
12/20/2010,5 star rating,"We came on a pretty busy Sunday night and we (party of 2) didn't have to wait for a table. They even moved us to a more intimate spot once one opened up. The decor is lovely , high ceilings with beautiful cream lamp shades and wrought iron chadeliers. It has a very cozy, but not cramped feel to it. The drinks and food are very reasonably priced. There semed to be only one waitress, 2 managers, and a food runner. But we didn't have to wait too long for anything. The fried catfish fingers were delicious with a spicy remoulade, an appetizer or perfect portion of you just want a little something to nibble on, and to save room for dessert. My friend had the fish and chips, which were pretty standard, nothing out of this world, but good and reliable. I had the coconut/pineapple cake. It was pretty good, the icing was a little too sweet, but that's my only complaint about the entire night. I'd certainly have the cake again.I will absolutely be back, and possibly on my birthday because twice while we were there the owner/ manager erupted into a jubliant rendition of Stevie WOnder's Happy Birthday and encouraged the whole place to join her and brought out red velvet cake for the 2 birthday people. It made me feel special and they weren't even singing to me.My date was a bust and he spent half the night on the phone, FAIL.But dinner at Melba's definite, WIN."

12/22/2010,4 star rating,"Yes, come here for the chicken and egg nog waffles! It will set you back about $15 or so, but it is worth it for a nice brunch. ~Chicken and Waffles Atlanta style, with a Harlem twist. ~Drinks are high in price, but great!"
5/2/2016,2 star rating,"I went here on sunday for my girlfriends birthday. I have to say I was very displeased with the service. We were sat in a corner which was extremely tight, our waitress (diamond) was nice but unattentive. The only time we saw her was when she took our order and when she was dropping the check. We never received the cornbread which they normally serve before your entree comes out.Another waitress  brought our food out.Now as far as the food I had the catfish with French fries ughhh... The catfish was chewy and over salted and the fries were over cooked and oily. I have been here twice before where the food was on point!!! I'm not sure if they hired new cooks but something needs to be done"
10/23/2010,2 star rating,"So my friend is in town for a wedding so we stopped in for  a quick visit. The restaurant was really nice, it had a great atmosphere and some nice art on the wall. We sat to order and before we knew it 30 minutes had passed and we didn't have our food. There was 2 other tables that came in and had their food before us...I don't know if they forgot to put in our order or what but we were waiting entirely TOO DAMN LONG. We ordered the sweet potato pancakes, a side of beef sausage, a side of home fries and we had the fish and cheese grits. Nothing was piping hot....we didn't say anything because we were in a rush and the waiter and waitress were nice but DAMN  it took too long!!!!!The fish was good...I don't like cheese grits but my friend enjoyed themThe beef sausage was sooo small they looked like little vienna sausages...wthThe potatoes were really good I think there were sweet potatoes mixed in.I am not a fan of the sweet pancakes its just not my thing I guess.I think I will go back again and see what happens during dinner but I main problem was the wait time....they were not busy when we went so yeah...idk. But everyone was really nice and pleasant. So yeah if they could speed up the service time ill be back."
1/17/2011,4 star rating,"Tasty fried chicken and eggnog waffles! The cheese grits were solid, though a tad too peppery. I like pepper though, so no complaints. Turkey bacon was okay, it went well w/ eggnog waffles. The actual fried chicken was pretty difficult to eat (which explains the turkey bacon).Nice setting, really friendly and helpful servers."
8/17/2018,2 star rating,"Very disappointing experience. It seems service and food has deteriorated.... what's going on here? I was just here in March and the food was pretty good, today the food was mediocre. Made reservations to celebrate a friends birthday and I ordered the sea bass which is a dish on the menu however I was brought red snapper. I informed my waiter that I ordered the sea bass and he says ""oh we don't sell it anymore, try the red snapper it's amazing."" How do you not tell me that when I order? All of our dishes were served luke warm, nothing was hot. The rice wasn't seasoned and the macaroni and cheese was okay. My red snapper was okay, it was really a mediocre experience and I can't stress how disappointed I am. There was an awful smell when we first walked in, don't know where it came from but it wasn't pleasant especially in a restaurant. To make matters worse I was seated close to the bathroom so when the door was opened I smelled all the urine that was probably on the floor.  also there are stains on the cloth covering the benches near the wall, I mean deep down dirty stains. The other thing that was disappointing was our waiter, or maybe the busboy. He didn't take our order but he brought our drinks and food, he would slide across the bench to give me my drinks or bring my food. I thought that was unprofessional... Melba's seem to have a young group of employees working for them which is great but they have to school them a little more on professionalism..."
4/18/2015,4 star rating,"Went there for a friend's birthday, and I actually really enjoyed it!

12/3/2008,5 star rating,"Completely worth the 45 minute wait.  Tiny, tiny place with live music.  Freddie Jackson was in the house that night!  I also thought it was cool there was an Asian woman singing some soul songs throughout the night.I ate the wine braised beef short ribs with yams and sauteed spinach.  Really, anything on the menu looks good and probably is good.  You can't really go wrong with mac and cheese, greens, catfish, and the like.  I like that the menu is not overwhelming.Nice big goblets of sangria -- really refreshing.  Be careful!  :)"
6/30/2010,2 star rating,"Mediocrity, thy name is Melba's.We ended up here because the restaurant we really wanted to go to was closed for a private event.What a disappointment. The water and the pecan-crusted tilapia tasted like a dirty dishrag -- you know, that kind of mildewy aftertaste? The macaroni and cheese was lukecold and gluey.The service was slow, and the waitress never asked if we wanted a second drink. And the restaurant was so loud, between the background music and the tables that were too close together, that it was hard to hear my dinner companion.Pluses: the sauvignon blanc was pretty good, as were the collard greens. And the portions on everything were generous.Still, I won't be back."
11/23/2010,2 star rating,"Eggnog waffles were rock solid, but the fried chicken was a little weak.  It would have been nice to have a juicier piece of chicken.  We also had the spinach omelet with home fries.  The omelet had plenty of well cooked greens and the home fries were well seasoned.  The lone biscuit between our order and the delivery of the meal, 25 minutes later, was boring.   The packaged butter and cheap jam didn't help either.Great concept, but missed on little, nevertheless important details."
2/7/2011,4 star rating,Oh wow! Amazing smothered chicken and eggnog waffles. Amazing.Bloody Mary's were awesome too. Just the right amount of pepper.The smothered chicken was amazing.

9/2/2011,5 star rating,"Where do I start about Melba's? Soul-food with a twist and homely service, gets me every time! In the whole neighborhood, Melba's was probably one of the few proper sit down restaurants open after hurricane Irene! Seeing Melba in the restaurant and chatting with her is a whole another experience, she really treats the place like her home and you are Welcome!I started with the Pan Seared Salmon with  side of Macaroni (the best i've had so far) and ended with their Green Apple Sorbet. You could taste chunks of green apple in the sorbet and we couldn't stop. Everytime im in Harlem, Melba's is becoming my go to place."
9/14/2011,4 star rating,"If you go to Melba's, do not expect 5-star (or even 4-star) service. You will wait for a table, and the people will move slower than you want them to. That said, the food is WORTH THE WAIT!I came to Melba's last Friday night with some friends, and we waited nearly an hour for a table and had to be seated separately at first (they put our tables together once another party got up). Once we ordered, however, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.My friend and I ordered the catfish strips as an appetizer, which she enjoyed so much that she ordered them again for dessert! The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and incredibly flavorful. The side dishes were also really good. I normally hate the mac n cheese at soul food restaurants - texture and taste are usually off - but I really enjoyed Melba's tres mac.It is still a restaurant, so it doesn't quite reach grandma's kitchen level, but it comes close! Also, this is not a hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon! The prices are very reasonable for trendy - and delicious - restaurant."
3/19/2012,4 star rating,"Came here for the first time with my close friend for dinner. Ordered the catfish...which was kinda too salty for me but still oh-so-good.

We were very happy with the quality of food and service we received. The server was very pleasant and the food and drinks were delivered promptly.The food was delicious. I had the fried chicken wings and eggnog waffle. YUM! My boyfriend has the fried chicken with greens and potato salad. He was pleasantly surprised, being the soul food snob that he is. We also shared a side of Tres Mac & cheese. For dessert we shared the sweet potato pie and it was extremely tasty as well.We enjoyed the food so much we are considering having Melba's cater an upcoming event we are having. Either way, we'll definitely be back!"

2/13/2012,4 star rating,"I have been here a few times for brunch, and what a great experience for so cheap. The place itself is very nice. I love the free scones that you start with... I typically get the fried chicken with waffles. The chicken is just right and juicy. I wish it were a little spicier or that they had some dipping sauce, because I am sure that I shouldn't be dipping it in maple syrup. The waffles are okay - I do like the raspberry/strawberry butter that comes with it."
1/18/2015,2 star rating,"I had been to Melba's for a drink a few times and tried a few appetizers.  I had enjoyed those experiences and decided to have dinner with my wife in the restaurant.  The night we came the waiter brought out the food but unfortunately had dropped both plates and broke them in the process while spilling water and some food on me.  My wife fortunately did not get anything on her.  I honestly felt bad for the waiter so I did my best to downplay what just happened.  The waiter did apologize.  Our new meals came out about 15 minutes later.  We ate, paid the check and then left.What stood out is that no one on the staff came up to my wife and I and offered a complimentary drink, dessert, whatever which would have been a nice gesture.  It just felt strange because with all the other soul food spots to choose from in the area, service should be memorable at all times for the right reasons.  I wrote an e-mail to Melba's to not put them on blast about my experience which happened in the fall but never got a response so wanted the public to know since the restaurant didn't feel the need to reply."
11/24/2013,4 star rating,"Excellent food, with a younger/ sexier vibe than Amy Ruth's and Sylvia's.  Downside, they serve smaller portions. Food also (while great) isn't as good as Amy Ruths up the block.  I'd say Melba's is better for a sexier evening date, and Amy Ruth's is better for families because it is LOUD!"

11/27/2008,4 star rating,"Mac & Cheese, Country Yams and Coconut Cake  5Stars!!I often get the above with Pecan Tilapia, and it's really good.  The chicken & waffles are fun if you haven't had it before, but that doesn't come with sides and if you leave without having the M&C... well, just don't.  Personally I'd like to see them pan fry the chicken(vs. deep fry), but hey that's easy for me to say when I'm not running the kitchen...     It's a little sense of pride that they are two blocks from our place in Harlem...  When the parents visit, it's a must go...  the place is small but really well done.  If you want to go it's best to call ahead...it's noisy on Friday night, but no different than any other place in NYC.  enjoy  the mac!"
4/11/2009,5 star rating,Great Soul food - Great Spot We really enjoyed brunch here on Saturday.  The biscuits were so good and buttery.  My husband had to have the chicken and waffles after seeing the Throwdown with Bobby Flay and he was pleased.  My sister really enjoyed her sweet potato pancakes.  The music was nice and we loved the atmosphere in this modernly decorated restaurant.  We'll definitely go back.
3/8/2010,2 star rating,"Like many first-time visitors to Melba's, I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was disappointing. Like other reviewers have noted, the chicken was poor. It was devoid of any kind of seasoning and therefore completely bland, requiring a healthy dose of salt to bring out any flavor. It seemed to be lacking a proper coating of batter, so instead of a light crispy fried coating, it was too dark, too crunchy, and ultimately unsatisfying. The waffles were quite heavy and somewhat mealy as from a mix, certainly not from freshly beaten batter. At least the strawberry butter was a nice accent.I also tasted the Tres Mac & Cheese, which was pretty mediocre as well. The cheese was bland, the texture was lacking, and there was an unappetizing pool of cheese grease left at the bottom of the dish - nothing like a good mac n cheese. The Sauteed Spinach was extremely garlicky, but not in a good way. On the plus side, the Cheddar Grits Cake was pretty good.All this mediocrity would have been more forgivable if Melba's were cheap, but it isn't. At least the decor is nice."
12/17/2010,5 star rating,Although it was small crowded and the hostess could not find my reservation that we placed a week in advance for a table. We Had an excellent time for my past birthday dinner . We was a party of 10 and the wait staff was amazing the food was traditional hands down the best time I had in a long while.
12/3/2016,2 star rating,"Very disappointing first experience.   The place was so loud, my dinner guest and I could barely speak to each other across a small table.    Of course I ordered Fried Chicken, mac and cheese, and greens.   The greens and mac were quite tasty.  The chicken had good flavor but was so over cooked, it shredded into fibers when cut.    The servers were very friendly and attentive."
4/1/2014,4 star rating,Definitely try the chicken and eggnog waffles. And make sure the person you're with orders the collards as a side dish.
6/18/2013,4 star rating,"One of the most filling brunches that I have had was here at Melba's. I ordered the pancakes and fried chicken along with a side of grits and I was way too stuffed to finish either. the food was absolutely delicious and the sangria was yummy too!The downside was our service was terribly slow, we sat and watched people come and go while we were just being handed our food."
9/1/2013,2 star rating,"I've always been a big fan of Melba's.  I come often, so this review is just on my recent visit.  Not overall.  I came in today at 1pm for brunch with friends from Boston.  I talked up the place so I was hoping Melba's would impress.  We were seated within ten minutes, so great start.  I was disappointed at 1pm they were out of champagne, so no Mimosas today.  There's 2 drinks on special during brunch.  Brunch is twice weekly and you're closed Monday.  You should never run out of your signature drink during the special period.  That's like MacDonalds running out of Big Macs.  Just doesn't happen.  There were delays in getting service for drink orders and getting the drinks.  The food arrived prior to the drinks.  Then a gentleman started mopping the floors.  It made me notice how dirty the floors were.  I would think whoever closes prepares the restaurant for opening.  That means ensuring the place is spotless.  Sorry if it sounds anal but its the restaurant business.  Employees should be anal and run things tighter.I rated the restaurant based on my most recent visit. I've enjoyed great times there but today wasn't one of them unfortunately. Also my friends suggested we try something else next time.  Sorry."

8/13/2014,3 star rating,"The food is great but place is noisy as hell. It's not a place where you can hear yourself think and enjoy your food. It's like eating at Webster Hall. Not to offend gay people but it's not a place to take your 15 yo kid to watch men grind and kiss on each other. If this post offends any gay people, it wasn't my intent to do"
9/12/2008,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Its one of the best meals I have ever had. The fried catfish app was delicious -seasoned and battered perfectly. Its a must. I had the chicken and waffles and its everything and more. Best syrup, best butter, crispy chicken and waffles. The mac and cheese, onion rings and yams all perfect. So much flavor. Nothing was greasy.we were able to make a 9:30 reservation and were seated immediately. staff was attentive, polite and friendly. The music is a throw back mix of soul and r&b that's a great compliment to the food. All amazing I cant say it enough -for a great price!"
1/24/2009,3 star rating,"Nice place, upscale for the neighberhood. Of course you go there for the fried chicken that Bobby Flay competed again. it is good but not amazing. the waffles that come with it and the strawberry butter are good but again no big wow.we were a big group (12 people) and we were suprised that they added a 25% service charge. I mean adding service to a group is obvious, but 25%?? come on!Most of our group had the fried chicken and waffle, a couple of other had a omlet and salad but didn't have any special comments on it.If I would live around there i would probably go often for brunch, otherwise can't see myself going again"
5/29/2009,5 star rating,"When we paid the check and stepped out onto the street, I wept a little. It was that good. It was a higher truth. It was the breakfast of demigods. Tender yet crisp fried chicken and egg nog waffles with strawberry butter, thick real bacon, coca-cola with ice, and non-stop fresh warm biscuits with yellow ribbons of butter already in the dough. And our waitress: I almost kissed her. She was warm and pleasant and attentive and she had all fine qualities that my ex-wife lacked."
6/2/2009,4 star rating,"We had a delicious dinner at Melba's on Saturday night.  We walked in without a reservation, but they were able to accommodate our party of three at around 8PM after a 10 minute wait.  This was our second trip to Melba's, and both times we have been impressed with the quality of the food and the warm service.  I agree with the poster below on the Mac and Cheese, too.  Think it might be the best I've ever had.  Same accolades for the yams."
10/24/2010,2 star rating,"I went here this past weekend with Kailee P.  She pretty much summed up our experience.  I like the decor and the waiters were nice (one was training...first day on the job).  We were there for about an hour and a half.  I honestly think they forgot our order.  What bugs me is that, if you did, just admit it, instead of continuously saying ""it'll be out in a minute.""The food wasn't hot at all.  The sweet potato pancakes were quite mushy.  The fish and grits were good, but again, the food was cold."
1/17/2011,5 star rating,"Ok, fair warning, 5-stars may be hasty because 1) I was very hungry and 2) I don't have other soul food restaurants to compare it too.With that said, I loved it.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere very hip without making me feel out of place.  Everyone was friendly (including other customers).  The servers really went out of their way to please and it made a difference.  This was my first time, but I definitely plan on coming back.Thank you, Melba's!"
9/7/2011,4 star rating,"Overall, this was an excellent restaurant.  However, you can't have a soul food restaurant that serves lunch and dinner with no cornbread or corn muffins.My meal was incomplete without my daily southern bread!"
4/17/2012,5 star rating,"Melba's is still the champion in Harlem on Frederick Douglass Boulevard.  I try and go at least once a month.The menu has not changed much over the years but it doesn't need to.  In a way that is a good thing when you are hungry for something in particular and you know that it is going to be there.  You cannot go wrong with the catfish strips appetizer, either the wine braised short ribs or the famous chicken and eggnog waffles entree's with the tres mac & cheese and collard greens side dishes.  The whole menu is good but these are the dishes that keep me coming back.  The service is good and the waiters, staff (and Melba herself) are very friendly and professional.The place is small but has a great vibe, cozy and inviting.  If you have to wait it's worth it!  Just grab a drink at the bar.  They have a good drink menu as well including the Rose Of Harlem.. kind of a margarita with a twist. I predict Melba's will be around for a long long time."
10/7/2014,2 star rating,I must say that over the years that I've been going to Melbas.. this last time that I went couldn't have topped the other horrible experiences in the past. The service was lacklustee... the food lacked so much seasoning that I swear it was a diabetic eatery. The greens came from a can. . The mac and cheese tasted JUST like the name. .. the noodles weren't salted.. just awful... the catfish tasted like a huge chicken strip.. this is coming from a true southerner. Get Chef Roble In there!
4/8/2013,4 star rating,"So I'm a soul food snob, and proud of it.  I'm under the impression as a traditionally raised African American Southern Belle I can make anything a NYC soul food restaurant can make and probably 10 times better.  So what's the point in even going to these places?  Melba's knocked me down a peg, because these people can Cook!!! If you want a taste of home without locking yourself in a hot kitchen for 3 hours, this is the place for you. I'm really impressed and that's really hard to do.  Chicken and Waffles was on point.  The hostess was very personable and made me fell like I was at her own table in her home not a restaurant, this is what other soul food restaurants miss...soul."
9/25/2016,4 star rating,"The food was really good, I had the Southern Fried Chicken and Egg Nog Waffles which was really good.  Their Long Island Ice Tea was strong and taste real good.  My friend had the Catfish which was good.  My other friend had the beef short rib it  missed one ingredient that would of made it amazing, but was good none the less.  The red velvet cake also good, it had a West Indian taste to it I cant put my finger on the ingredient lol.  I would definitely come back."
9/22/2014,5 star rating,Very good comfort food- however u can also find healthy salads on the menue.Very friendly service and absolutely amazing music-I was shazaming throughout my dinner.
3/9/2009,4 star rating,"Was in the mood for an uptown spot with my  favorite and oh so puro uptown Italian homegirl ...the vibe is molto sexy (lighting is low) and tight in Melbas with only 25 tabletops and a roaming (big poppa) live singer belting out those r&b jams that get you in that silky sweet Harlem mood (e.g. Close the door by Teddy Pendergrass ) 'so good... so good.. come here baby.'Order the mini cheese burger, great quality meat in a small package, a order of non-leaden crab cakes , some empanadas all nicely washed with Sugar Hill Brewery Beer ( f'ing genius marketing/name ...) and you have the makings of a phat night courtesy of Melba's. Next time will have the mac n cheese please ..... This will my preferred uptown dinner spot for some time I suspect..."
7/14/2009,2 star rating,"I took the A Train all the way to Harlem to seek this place out, and I was majorly disappointed. The service was super slow and getting a refill of my coke was impossible! When I decided to cut my losses and get the heck out of there - it took 10 minutes to get the bill! I tipped the waiter because he looked like he needed the money, but I should have followed my first mind and went to Sylvia's instead. Yes they have strawberry butter and egg nog waffles - but it's not worth the effort. My Mama makes better chicken, greens and cornbread."
5/25/2012,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's for Brunch it was very tasty and moderately priced. I had complimentary maccaroon, a Salmon and spinach omelet with a side of waffles with strawberry butter and coffee for less than 15 bucks. Need I say more?"
5/9/2012,4 star rating,"Went in for dinner this past Sunday and I must admit I was about to write an unflattering review based on the lackluster service we received, but after speaking with the General Manager the following day, he took swift and meaningful action to make up for our experience (THANKS MATT!!!!). So instead of a 1 star review based on service...the 4 star review was based on EXCELLENT food. I had the Salmon, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach...company had Fried Catfish, Mac & cheese and greens.  My salmon was a bit dry, but that was my fault for ordering it med-well...but the flavor profile was delish.  The catfish was heaven, light, flaky, crispy and perfectly seasoned...sides were great as well.Thanks to Matt, we'll be back:)"
4/26/2012,4 star rating,A friend recommended this restaurant to me a couple years ago.  I have the I'm not going uptown mentality when there are so many nice restaurants in Brooklyn. I am so happy it took some out of town friends staying in Harlem to get me out.  I suggested Melba's and it was an instant hit.  The atmosphere was very friendly.  The food was satisfying and the sangria is delish.  I will be back!!
4/23/2012,4 star rating,"Man, a good breakfast all the way around. Loved the flavor of the waffles with the egg nog batter, man that works! Fried chicken was good. Really liked the atmosphere.

3/31/2012,3 star rating,"I experienced Melba's for the first time last night with friends. First of all it is very loud so this is not the place for a quiet dinner (at least not on a Friday night) but we did enjoy the 80's R&B music playing. I made a reservation so the only table left open when we arrived was ours. It took a few minutes longer than it should have to get menus but once we did things progressed nicely. We ordered the spring rolls and the buffalo wings for appetizers which were both good. I had the BBQ turkey meatloaf for my entree which I am sad to say I did not like at all. It was a very strange consistency and shape. I sent it back and got the catfish instead which was fine. The Mac & Cheese is very good but the collard greens were a bit salty. We ordered the sweet potato pie and the red velvet cake for dessert which were both just ok. So overall, I wouldn't run back but I wouldn't discourage anyone from going either. Also, it would be nice if the bar area was bigger. People waiting for a table have to stand in the doorway and just gaze at the people seated since there are very few seats at the bar."
3/28/2012,4 star rating,"One crisp, Fall afternoon my girlies and I headed north to Harlem to fill our tummies with soul food brunch. We walked in Melba's and immediately fell in love. It's a warm inviting atmosphere, while keeping an element of coolness with it's exposed brick and marble bar. The chicken and waffles is world famous and delicious. We did sides of grits and sweet potato pancakes and they were also fantastic. FFF (my fav foodie friend) is from the South and her Daddy whips up some stellar grits. Well, Melba's grits were just as good. I had an omelet that was good and with lots of fresh veggies, but no where near as tasty as the chicken and waffles I stole some bites of (rookie mistake I know - should have ordered the specialty). Melba herself made an appearance and chatted up the table next to us before we rolled all the way back downtown, full and happy."

3/20/2012,2 star rating,"After hearing good things about Melba's me and my girls finally decided to check it out   We decided to go on tuesday since they have open mike night and figured it would be a fun thing to do.  First the good stuff:  We had reservations and although we got there late, they sat us right away.  The service was average but not so bad.  The waitress could have acted like she knew more about how foods were prepared on the menu  Now for the rest:  I ordered the catfish and waffles, my other friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the smothered chicken (which they decided to change to fried chicken) that came with collard greens and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered the pulled bbq pork sliders and a side of candied yams.  the catfish was not so good.  it tasted like it was dipped in egg whites and then fried too hard or had been sitting long before it got to my table.  so was not crispy and was hard to chew the skin.  It also lacked seasoning.  Waffle tasted like a regular ole waffle-not impressed.  My friend's replaced smothered chicken was dry oh so dry and had very little flavor.  However, not good enough for her to eat even half of itl.  Even she left most of the chicken on the plate, which is not normal for her when it comes to fried chicken!  Her mashed potatoes were also dry, like they were sitting around for a while before it got to our table and had crisped on the top.  She didnt like the collard greens although I didnt think they were so bad.  My other friend was just hungry.  so she ate all of it.  event hough she said it was just ""alright"".  The yams werent so candied and the sliders seemed to be the only hit of the night.  Other annoyances during the night:  the extremely loud music!  Too hard to have a conversation.  furthermore,  I thought that open mike meant a variety of people singing, however, we were privileged to be entertained by a large black man.  who, along with other customers kept using our table to hold their drinks when they were tired of holding them-pretty ghetto.  But whats even more ghetto is the large black man texting in the middle of his performance.  Hilarious.  this place is not intimate, its tiny.  I really hate that the food wasnt so good, really like to support southern restaurants,  We still dont understand what all the hype is about this place  but we wont be going back for sure."
3/20/2012,4 star rating,"Since my son was born, I have been generally too busy to write lots of reviews here.  But the service we got at Melba's on Sunday was too exceptional to not write about.  I don't know the name of the server, but she saw that I was coming in with my 2 year-old son to have brunch with a couple of old friends, and she anticipated everything.  She brought him a fruit juice concoction right off the bat.  Then she brought him a scoop of ice cream at the end of the meal when it was obvious that I was still visiting with my friends and my son was getting antsy.  She was great, and it made the entire meal much more relaxing for this harried dad.  Oh, and the fried chicken and waffles were delicious."
4/21/2013,5 star rating,"I'm a big fan of soul food, which makes me very critical of every soul food restaurant, but I have to say I'm a huge fan of this place. In particular, I'm usually very skeptical of ""upscale"" soul food restaurants, because they usually end up sacrificing taste for ambience, but this place did both very well.  I had the fried catfish, rice and (black eyed) peas, and mac & cheese. Everything was delicious.  Usually, fried catfish is too greasy, but that was not a problem here. It was the perfect level of crispy, and all the flavors on the plate blended very well with it.  The mac & cheese wasn't too cheesy, and the black eyed peas were also very well done.  My friends had the chicken and waffles, which, as you would expect since it's their specialty, is also very good.  Another friend tried the BBQ turkey meatloaf, and yet another had the tilapia; both had nothing but great things to say.  The prices were very reasonable, and the service was good.  We live nearby, so we will definitely be coming back."
3/16/2014,4 star rating,"My second visit to Melba's was to celebrate a friend's birthday. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly. We were instructed to sit at the bar until our party was complete. The bartender offered us drinks and we declined. Within a matter of minutes he had poured us mimosas, compliments of a chef who complemented us prior to entering the restaurant. Once we sat down, our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. The food was great, as expected. The best part of the entire experience was the way my friend was celebrated. When I told the waiter that we had a cake in the fridge, he went to retrieve it. Before returning, they played Trey Song's ""Say aah"" and once the waiter came back with the cake, he was accompanied by the rest of the waiting staff. The music was turned down low and the waiter announced to everyone in the restaurant that my friend was celebrating her birthday.  They requested for everyone to join in singing the Stevie Wonder rendition. Another waiter put his arm around my friend as they sang. When the singing was over, our waiter hugged her. Needless to say, they did an incredible job at making my friend feel special for her birthday. I will certainly be returning and recommend others do the same!"

4/11/2015,4 star rating,"My family wanted to go to a restaurant to celebrate Easter Sunday this year. We were a large group of 17 people ranging in age from 13 - 55 so we needed a menu with a variety of options. We went to a local soul food buffet - way too small and way too loud! Decided to try a chain restaurant that was new to the area - wait was too long and they couldn't seat us together. My niece called Melba's and the manager said if you can get here in 1/2 hour we can seat all of you. It was 4:30 we needed to get from 125th and 3rd to 114th and FDB by 5pm all traveling in different cars. We arrived on time and was seated immediately! We were not disappointed! Our waiter Trent was the absolute best. Very patient and accommodating. The food was excellent! I had turkey meatloaf, collard greens, peas and rice and a side of yams. Everything came out hot and fresh. Their macaroni and cheese was the best I have had in a restaurant. Their crab cakes, although small, were excellent. I would have given them 5 stars but it seemed like it took a long time for the appetizers to come out. I will definitely be back!"

2/10/2011,5 star rating,"What's not to say about Melba's?  I went there for drinks after class one night  with some classmates and friends from grad school at Columbia.  We had a big group, so we waited at the bar for a while until we could get a large enough table (we didn't make a reservation, but the wait wasn't too long).  The bar looked great anyway, so we convened there for a while and enjoyed wine and sangria.  Great drinks!When we sat and started ordering some appetizers and food, we knew it was going to be good, but I don't think we REALLY knew what we were in for.  We each ordered something different so that we could try a little bit of each one.  Whoever ordered the chicken and waffles probably had the least of their dish lol...it was TOO tasty!  The waffles came with a maple syrup and a strawberry butter which added a really interesting (in a good way) tangy-sweet taste to it all.  I'm typically sort of greedy when it comes to food, so I asked the waiter if I could order the grilled salmon with a side of mac & cheese and a side of sauteed spinach...and ONE piece of the fried chicken, just so that I could try it.  (I was trying to be really healthy, but I just HAD to indulge at least a little bit, it looked too good).  To my delight, he was happy to oblige!  It was a greedy girl's dream come true.  We all dined and had a great time as our waiter kept coming back periodically to check on the group and see if everything was okay.  After dinner, he brought out some of the various desserts that Melba's has to offer....pumpkin pie, red velvet cake, chocolate mouse cake, and there was one more that I'm forgetting.  We all shared them (for the same reason, to try a little of each one), and they were all divine.  It was definitely a fun time.  A great place to go for drinks, lunch, dinner, you name it.Since then, I had been back a couple more times.  Took a friend to lunch there for the chicken and waffles, and then took my boyfriend there for dinner.  Melba's will always have a place in my heart -- not just for the good food, but it's also where my boyfriend first told me he loved me!  :)  So  I'll be there for this upcoming Valentine's Day and I can't wait!  I love that I can go there and be as indulgent as I want or eat as healthy as I want.  The salads come with a great homemade balsamic vinaigrette that I wish I could have at home.Much love to Melba's.  It's the perfect size for a large group or dinner for two, very well designed and decorated. I love the dark wood walls and the ceiling lamps, creating a very intimate and comfortable vibe.  Great for a date!***Update***Valentine's Day dinner at Melba's was wonderful.  It was a pre-fixe menu so it didn't have the typical dishes that Melba's is famous for, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  And with live music (from Petamane [I think that's his name]), it was very romantic.  :)"
2/24/2011,4 star rating,"The food is delish. Chicken and waffles, salmon, greens, mac and cheese are on the money. The bartenders make the drinks strong and good. This isnt your typical Harlem soul food spot. I would consider this upscale soul food. Plus Melba the owner is always there."

The greens were watery and the Mac and cheese was pathetic straight NO FRILLS box, cheese and noodles tasted inferior. Canned yams were straight YUCK.

2/5/2011,4 star rating,"While nursing a nasty hangover, I decided to roll into Melba's. The place was hopping! The coffee and biscuits were the immediate comfort I needed. I was a little taken back when my server let me know that the Egg Nog waffle with Strawberry Butter, as a side order was a dinner item. The four year old inside of me wanted to give him a 'strawberry'.  The Salmon omelet was tasty.The grits were buttery. The side order of Beef Sausage only proved that I am a piggy.  I will probably hit them up next weekend, as well. Just to prove that this piggy can go ""weee weee weee"", across the street and back home."

I ordered the red velvet cake and my friend ordered the sweet potato pie. Must say I loved the sweet potato pie and I wish I had ordered the pie instead of the cake. The red velvet cake was not bad but it just was not very sweet. The desserts are homemade and both desserts came out warm! Overall, it was a fun place to grab desserts and would definitely return to actually try the food or have drinks with friends. The atmosphere is very warm and cozy and its a nice space to relax and have a comfortable meal. Good experience but I would just order something different the next time I return."
2/9/2015,1 star rating,I went to Melba's on Sat. during brunch. The sweet potato pancakes were gummy. The salmon was plain tasting. It needed seasoning. The mango samosa weak with an imaginary taste of mango. The servers needed more training.
4/16/2014,4 star rating,I have been here a few times.  The food is very tasty.  The atmosphere is nice.    Its a hole in the wall spot so don't expect to see much.  Maybe one of these days I'll get up early enough for brunch.
10/1/2013,4 star rating,"Amazing!! I love the spinach and shrimp, usually I dislike fried foods but I had a taste my bf fry chicken and it was soooo good. I will definitely bring my mother here. The waiter we had she was ok and no one greeted us, but the food made up for that."
12/16/2008,2 star rating,"This place must have really let itself go since they were featured on Food Network or when they managed to rack up 4 stars on Yelp.  I wandered in and hesitantly sat myself down at the mostly empty bartop, passing a huddle of confused looking people standing in the entrance. I stayed for fifteen minutes, completely ignored. A few disgruntled would-be patrons stood outside and complained, ""This is the last time I try coming here. They go changing things up every time, 'Kitchen closes at 3'? We were here before 3. If we had reservations this would be a different story."" And off they went in a huff to walk the couple blocks over to Amy Ruth's, another stalwart in Harlem comfort food.I went back in and flagged down one of the harried waitresses behind the bar, ""Can I make a reservation for tonight?"" She nodded enthusiastically and disappeared with a quick, ""Hold on."" The minutes ticked on and she was nowhere to be seen so I finally admitted defeat and went across the street to Society Coffee where I was greeted immediately at the door...Determined to give Melba's another chance--after all busy is good--I returned a few weeks later with friends in tow and a reservation.  This time there were empty tables and no wait.  Despite this, the noise level was incredible. We could barely hear each other or the server. As you will discover in a moment the server evidently could not hear us either.  I asked about the salmon croquettes which she described in a manner that suggested she had never tried them herself, ""I think they're fried... umm.. like crab cakes except with salmon.""  Naturally I decided against those and ordered the salmon omelet instead.  When our orders finally arrived about thirty minutes later, they brought me the salmon croquettes. Thankfully, they did not give me a hard time and took it back immediately to exchange it. Looking back I realize I should have just ordered the chicken & waffles. The salmon in the salmon omelet was dry and too salty and there was nothing to pull the flavors together with the egg. The home fries were good if cold, and portions so small that at the end of the meal I was still hungry. Normally I can only finish half of the standard American-sized portions served everywhere these days and take the rest home. My friends who were starving were clearly not impressed either. One of them ordered the smothered chicken, and the chicken was so dry he could barely scrape it off the bone with his fork and knife. Another ordered a $3 glass of OJ that had so much ice in it that it was gone in three sips. But the worst of it had to be the coffee. A place with $10-14 entrees at brunch should not be serving coffee that tastes like the watered down swill you find at highway filling stations. Especially when just across the street is a place that's serving the good stuff for the same price.       I will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that it's just their brunches that are completely hopeless, but it's unlikely you will ever catch me in there again."
2/5/2012,4 star rating,"I first met Miss Melba @ a small but well popular mom & pop bakery on the upper west side. and when she would come to visit, so many people were either happily familiar or just very grateful in meeting her. I then learned of who she was and visited her restaurant soon after. and I love her spot! granted, I went to meet with a friend & was stood up (the day before the Super Bowl).. but the staff was so friendly with tending to me. and the bartender was so on point with his mango mimosa & the atmosphere is always warming. the menu speaks for itself and you can not go wrong with any selection. I'm going back there tonight, and enjoying another beautiful meal, while watching a great game! I recommend the chicken & eggnog waffles (but then again, you can not go wrong with anything on the menu)!"
3/26/2011,1 star rating,"Rating explanation: We ate here once, a few months ago. We had ""sliders,"" a salad, and then I  had the dinner salad with grilled salmon. My significant other had fried chicken. We both thought the food was fine if unexceptional; two-star quality. The service was terrible, quite unprofessional to an extent that should be shocking but somehow is not in Harlem. Thus, a star is lost for the poor service. Friday evening, around 8 PM. We decide to give Melba's another try. We arrive and the restaurant is around two-thirds full. We wait. We are not acknowledged, greeted, nothing. Other than a female bartender, not a single service person is in evidence. We wait. Ten minutes. Waiting. Several times, the bartender, deep in conversation with a bar patron who looked and sounded as though she had already indulged in several stiff cocktails, directed a haughty gaze in our direction,  quickly looking away before we might demand, I don't know, a table ? service ? My opinion of Melba's was sinking by the moment. This establishment would be smart to divest themselves of this individual, clearly not a ""team player."" As we waited, a woman sitting at the bar let forth blood curdling screams at regular intervals. No idea what that might have been about. It was tremendously annoying.  We decided to leave, and just as we turned to do so, three waiters burst from the back, chatting with each other. We were halfway out the door and while all three saw us, none tried to stop us. Indeed, one of the waiters, as I paused to ask, Do you have a table ? Deliberately looked away. It was clear that he thought he was busy enough. A seated couple, obviously kept waiting for some time, were directing angry glares in his direction. Now ... why can't they do better ? Why is this not possible ? Is there no management ? No supervision of these people ? I certainly did not see any. On the other hand, if the bartender was the evening's management, that would explain a lot. We went to Questan's and had a wonderful meal !"

7/29/2013,2 star rating,The service was amazing but the food was not good. My chicken was dry and my sides were cold.
2/19/2012,1 star rating,"I came back for brunch with out of town friends and, yikes! It was very crowded, and we were told it would be a 20 minute wait, it ended up being way over an hour. I understand having to wait on a busy weekend, but the hostess repeatedly told us, ""Oh, it'll be about 5 more minutes..."" which made the wait seem even longer. While we were waiting, one of my guests noticed a cockroach crawling around on the coats in coat check! Why we didn't leave right then is a mystery, but I think our hunger combined with the time we had already invested in waiting, mixed with the amount that I had hyped up the food from my first experience caused us to overlooking that disgusting detail. The food was ok. I ordered sweet potato pancakes, and was disappointed to discover that they were regular pancakes with a little sweet potato spread on top. I also ordered a side of bacon, which was very strange. It was deep-fried, which sounds good, but there wasn't a lot of flavor, and as soon as it cooled, it became so rock hard that it was actually painful to try to choke it down. I will think twice before coming back here. I wouldn't be surprised if they were shut down by the health department at some point in the future."
6/28/2011,4 star rating,"I came here last week and this place didn't disappoint. I had the catfish, which was fried to perfection and came with two sides. I ordered the mac and cheese and sauteed spinach. Both were very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the friend chicken and eggnog waffles, he loved it all. I tried an eggnog waffle, which was delicious. The service was pretty good as well, and we both left as members of the Clean Plate Club.  Not the healthiest dinner, but if you are in the mood for comfort food, this is your place. I would definitely come back."
11/5/2008,2 star rating,"This place is good, but not the best soul food I've ever had (not the worst either though). I had an appetizer size of the catfish with the mayo sauce and a side of mac and cheese. It was good, but it's not a must visit for me. The service was very poor. The hostess seated us while talking on her cell phone and there was only one waiter for the whole joint and it took forever to get our food. After we finished he came to clear the plates away the waiter dropped off the dessert menu. We planned to get the butter pound cake to share for the table but he didn't come back for a good 1/2 hour and at that point we came to our senses and realized we didn't need the pound cake after all. So minus 1 star for the service."
5/20/2008,4 star rating,"Can't beat this local hangout.  Stop by on Tues and get some great music with the food.  My favorite waiter Marlon got promoted to Manager...so things are looking up.  My favorite:  Short Ribs, Macaroni/Cheese, and the sauteed spinach.  Hmmmmmm.  The tilapia is also a fave."
11/15/2009,5 star rating,"I have been to Melba's on two occasions-once for dinner and another time for brunch. Both times did not disappoint. On both occasions, we did not make any reservations, and we were seated immediately after we showed up. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting with dark brown and black tables and chairs. The lighting is dim, so it's a great spot to bring a date or some friends.  Old school '70s and '80s R&B playing in the background. Grown and sexy-my kind of spot, lol!  When I showed up to Melbas the first time around for dinner, I had the fried chicken with the yams and tres mac and cheese, and a white sangria to wash it all down. Everything was delicious, and what 's also important is that the food arrived quickly. I also tasted my friend's turkey meatloaf, which ALMOST made me regret that I didn't order it, but since my food was pretty amazing as well, I figured that I would make a mental note to try the turkey meatloaf next time. For dessert, I had the red velvet cake, and my buddy had the sweet potato pie. Delish, to say the least.     On my 2nd time at Melba's with a different friend, we arrived for brunch. I had the chicken and waffles, and my buddy had the country pancakes. Both dishes were served with a cute piece of strawberry-flavored butter and a side of fresh fruit. I also can't forget to mention that while waiting for the entrees, we were each given a plate with a buttermilk biscuit on top with 2 packets-one butter, and another grape jelly.     As with my first time at Melba's, my guest and I didn't have to wait long for our food. My chicken was yummy, The skin was warm, crispy, and sizzling-Just like I like it. The waffles were good but a little bit dry. I thought the flavored butter was a cute touch. My friend's pancakes tasted pretty good. All in all, brunch at Melba's was good, but if I could choose, I would come for dinner to get the full Melba's dining experience!"
7/6/2013,5 star rating,Great soul food and quicker to get in and out than Sylvia's . Short ribs and collard greens were awesome!
10/10/2007,4 star rating,"I literally live right around the corner from this place, so this place is pretty much my default date spot.  The restaurant boasts southern comfort food for its cuisine, but the food is more inventive than that name would suggest.  As a lineup I would certainly recommend the Soul Food Spring Rolls, Short Ribs, Mac & Cheese, and one of the vegetable sides, none of which particularly stand out.  While all of the food is good, there is better soul food to be had, but for an overall experience and for the innovation in some of the dishes, Melba's is one of the best.As far as the ambiance goes, the place is small, but quaint and has a quasi-church pew setup inside.  All of that makes for a very comfortable eating experience, and I've never had an issue with the service.  My only complaint would be the live music that is sometimes offered.  For my taste, the restaurant is far too small to support live music, unless your into struggling to keep food on your vibrating fork. Overall, avoid the live music and you're guaranteed to have a good time."
9/19/2010,1 star rating,"I had the misfortune of going to this restaurant for pancakes. They were swimming in frying oil, all shiny. They were very very disgusting. I ordered tea, which meant Lipton in lukewarm water. Before ordering pancakes, I asked for eggs but changed my mind when I found out that they do not have whole wheat toast. What kind of breakfast place only has white bread? My server was nice. The ambiance was stuck up and pretentious. With nothing good to show for it. I live above this place, and I'm never going back."
10/25/2013,4 star rating,"Truly amazing southern / soul cooking in a ""cozy"" settling. I know everyone raves about the chicken and waffles but my friend and I settled on the BBQ turkey meatloaf & braised short ribs. Equally outstanding and worth the trip. Mac & cheese, chilly onion rings, & spinach sides were quite tasty! Wait staff was attentive even with a full place. Now that I have the ""I-dsis"" all I want to do is lay on my couch and watch the Knicks. LOL! Next time it will be the chicken & waffles, for sure!"
8/22/2015,2 star rating,"Was dissapointed 5 years ago, and still dissapointed, tho decided to try again based on reviews....Placed was packed at 6:30pm so expected good  food based on attendance, though not true --big after hour bar crowd...As  mentioned in so many reviews wait staff was great.  Food: Melba egg rolls were nothing special, almost like salty spinach pie in egg roll shell..Had ""dark"" fried chicken without waffles plus mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes -nothing unusual for menued food in Harlem,..Fried chicken ""dark"" was very small  (pix are deceiving)  and the flavor of oil overcame flavor of chicken --.my friend order white fried, and appeared larger in size..the massive mac n cheese was  lukewarm, very cheesey, not flavorful, and  so so  gluey..the garlic mashed were lukewarm, a bit more flavor, though not enough to use the word garlic -large portion...Maybe I've been ordering wrong food at Melba's, due to crowds and reviews..though again fried chicken is my barometer for southern type food in Harlem, and Melba's failed !"

3/14/2011,3 star rating,"Made a reservation for my birthday, party of 10. The original reservation was lost, so it's a good thing I called three days ahead to verify - though they had to push my time back an hour. Once there, it took 35 minutes to get drinks after ordering, the staff was rude, and.. well, noone wished me a happy birthday OR gave me any cake :(If it were not for the fact that the chicken and waffles were freaking amazing, this would get nowhere near the 3 star rating I am giving it.. but, there you go. The food wins it."

3/5/2008,4 star rating,"Went here for brunch on Sunday to celebrate my roommates entrance to grad school.  Brunch was delicious....warm biscuits and those super yummy chicken and waffles.  My only gripe was that it took us a long time to get seated...and not because of the crowd, but because the overwhelmed servers couldn't clear two empty tables with any due speed."

The staff however was so gracious and friendly that I grabbed a few friends and we returned a few weeks later. This time, I was pleasantly surprised. Have you ever even heard of barbecued meatloaf? I hadn't, but I'm happy that I tried it. Delish! The restaurant has a nice vibe, friendly, but still a little exclusive. Just the way I like it!"
8/9/2011,4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite local Harlem spots for brunch. The homey vibe inside is just the tip of the iceberg. Do yourself a favor and order the chicken and waffles. Oh my God! It melts in your mouth, seriously--remember the way you used to wait for cotton candy to melt on your tongue when you were a kid? These chicken and waffles take you back to that. I've had the catfish as well, which is equally as heavenly, but I will sell my first born for a lifetime supply of that chicken and waffle dish!"

The tables are so close together that the waitstaff walked sideways. We had a really nice waitor, and the host was friendly too. I was not thrilled with my southern fried chicken, could def have used more seasoning!! However, the 3 cheese baked macaroni was delish! Oh, and I would stay away from the candied yams too...but hey that's me lol. On a positive note, my drink was veryyy strong, and the bathroom was super clean!"
3/9/2012,2 star rating,"I've gone here several times and it's always so crowded that I refuse to wait 45-60 minutes for a table.

And it appeard to be something they were well aware everytime someone pointed one out to the manager he would say very loud ''WATER BUG""... and called some poor guy from the back to sweep it out to the sidewalk, i guess they dont believe in killing roaches... MELBA i hope you read this, i loved your fried chicked and used to go to your place all the time.  PLEASE shut down for ""repairs"" and fumigate, before the the board of health does it for you.  I will now have to travel to Peaches in brooklyn for  my fried chicken."

5/26/2009,3 star rating,"I'll admit that I only came here because I saw it on the Food Network. I also wanted to see if they stood up to my beloved Roscoes. Melba's has Roscoe's on the texture of the waffle but they can't compete with that special syrup. The chicken was of a better quality but it was pretty dry. We were also given lots of free things like a biscuit, a red velvet cupcake and slice of sweet potato pie. We also weren't charged for all of our drinks. So it was great value."
7/6/2009,4 star rating,"i wasn't expecting such a shiny establishment for chicken and waffles.  i'm used to the greasy spoon dive to get my southern breakie helpings.  so my old roomie pointed me towards the spot because it was featured on food network.  once you sit down homemade biscuits are quickly served.  they have a nice sweetness to the crust.  moist and not to crumbly.  i just wish they were bigger.i went straight with the egg nog waffles and fried chicken.  let's just say i devoured it.  the waffles reminded me of the crisp exterior and moist insides of a bioche.  the chicken also was good though i wish they were legs for easier eating.  you do have the choice of white or dark meat, which is nice.  if you aren't a glutton like i am i recommend the smoothered chicken.  the gravy is nice and home fries are a nice side.  home fries include sweet potato goodness as well."

1/22/2011,2 star rating,"Melba's was OK. I was freezing so immediately ordered the hot chocolate...except it wasn't hot. I split a spinach and mozz omelet and cinnamon, raisin french toast with a friend. The omelet didn't have a lot of taste, the home fries that came with them were way over salted and didn't have a great texture. The french toast was the best part expect it was a little extra soggy in the middle. It was an OK brunch but I would not go back, nor recommend it to anyone. Also, there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke which totally turned me off."

5/31/2015,4 star rating,"the chicken and waffles (and strawberry butter - adds a perfect touch of sweetness!) were so good that i scarfed everything down, much to the chagrin of my mother who was planning to sample some of my meal and then never got a chance to. she still brings up this insult to her person whenever she gets a chance. she had an omelet and an extremely spicy bloody mary. a relatively small restaurant, but we were there right at opening (this place seems to open earlier than most of the brunch spots in the neighborhood which is why we picked it, as my mom wanted to head home early). lovely place and excellent food!"
3/4/2013,2 star rating,"Don't buy the hype. The service was fine. The place looks nice on the inside. But the food was ok at best. Great spring rolls, by far the best part of my meal. The fried chicken was bland. I had always heard rave reviews about Melbas fried chicken. Maybe I went on an off night. The mac&cheese was cold and tasteless. Not at all impressed with this place. May be willing to give it another shot some other time."
2/11/2014,1 star rating,"I just waited on hold for 13 minutes trying to put in a take out order.  When I called I asked if I could put in an order to go and the man said I sure could and then put the phone down without even telling me to hold.  I assumed someone else was going to come on and take my order but it never happened.  It wouldn't be so bad if I thought they were just busy but I could hear all of the different conversations that the staff was having with each other, including the man who set the phone down, about nothing to do with customers.  The menu looks great but unfortunately this VERY poor customer service trumps nice looking menu."

3/7/2011,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I had been meaning to make the trek up to Harlem to try Melba's for a few months (yeah yeah ever since we saw the Throw Down episode). Anyway, we finally made that highly-awaited journey last night in the middle of the rain storm.The first thing I thought when we sat down was that the restaurant was very pretty. NYC is filled with trendy/quaint/cozy/hip/cute/etc places, but this one was simply pretty. Dark, somewhat-romantic lighting. It was nice.We split the chicken and waffles dish (of course) with a side of the tres mac and cheese, accompanied by the passion cosmo (good, but something anyone could make), and we finished with the red velvet cake a la mode (choosing the vanilla ice cream over chocolate, so that the cake shined).We opted for white meat and next time (because there will definitely be a next time) we'll go with dark meat. The meat was moist, not the moistest I have ever had, but certainly cooked well and moist enough. The skin was lightly seasoned and had a great crisp, just as fried chicken should. The eggnog waffles were very well done. Moist and fluffy, with a light crunch on the outside. I didn't think the flavor of eggnog was extremely noticeable (maybe it's just been  too long since Christmas), but the waffles certainly had a unique and tasty flavor. The sweet strawberry butter added a touch of fruitiness, but it didn't have a strong strawberry flavor, so I don't think I would have really missed it had it not been  used, but I definitely did not dislike it by any means. They don't use real maple syrup which can be a huge disappointment for some, but, regardless, the chicken and waffle combination was still great. Sweet and savory! Definitely worth the trek.The Tres mac and cheese was good, not amazing, but good. It lacked the breadcrumb crunch that I have come to expect with every mac and cheese, but the cheesy combination was flavorful without being extremely bold. Worth having. I've come to be a bit of a red velvet snob after a lengthy quest for the best red velvet cake. The cake at Melba's was dense, almost the texture of a pound cake. I'm used to a fluffier texture, but I didn't mind the denseness. The flavor was acceptable, but not amazing. There wasn't enough cream cheese on the slice for my liking, but it had a hint of citrus, which was unique. All in all, a fine slice of red velvet cake, but if you want the BEST red velvet cake, go to Cake Man Raven in Brooklyn- that's where it's at!We'll be back Melba! Next time I'll try the southern-inspired egg rolls. They sounded very intriguing... I'd also like to go for brunch one day- the chicken and waffles dish would be great for a late brunch!"
1/26/2012,4 star rating,"Thus far, the best Southern-style food that I have had in NYC.  The short ribs were tasty and tender and the fried chicken is Umm. Umm. Good. The only downside is that you have to go there at an unconventional day/time to get a seat but it is well worth the wait!"
1/9/2015,5 star rating,The customer service from Daiquan was amazing. He tended to every need from taking our orders and giving suggestions to giving us extra strawberry butter for our waffles. He even somehow knew I was gonna call him even when he wasn't looking my way. Never had to look for him because he was right there   And the food?!?! OMG it was beyond amazing. The southern fried chicken and eggnog waffles went great with the strawberry butter and maple syrup. Melba's spring rolls was really good. It's actually better than regular spring rolls at a point. Wished the spinach and cheese empanadas didn't take 40 mins to cook but Daiquan kept us updated on wether they were still coming or not. The Mac n cheese and candied yams were suggested as sides and damn good as well. Now for dessert we haven't ordered that yet but I'm sure it's on the high horse. Definitely will be coming back. When coming in though it's either a hit or a miss when it comes to seating considering its a small venue that seats 36 ppl comfortably. It can get crowded quickly.
8/6/2016,1 star rating,"We been to Melba's many times on a dinner date with my partner or with friends. I understand, restaurants can be busy Friday night or the weekends.  What really annoyed me is that we waited for 1 1/2 hour for a table as we were told it would take 40mins.  So we decided to wait because we were craving for southern food.  As we were waiting, we were past on by other,  two and four guest, after the 40min wait as they were not present as we arrived at the restaurant and we were at the front, to be observant who was being checked in.  These guest did not have reservations.  It did not take an Einstein to figure out what transpired beyond my annoyance.  The maitre D, Michael, literally past us over for two and four guest because we were not black.  At that point, I had to VOICE out my concern to Michael why guest were being seated while we have been waiting for an hour, which he apologized that he overlooked our presence in small pack entrance.  Okay-sure, really?  At that point, my annoyance from his lack of customer care was so un-excusable.  I did not mind for being past on by an elderly ladies, but with group of young additional guys, that's not acceptable.  Especially waiting for the last 1 1/2hour was my last draw, and finally, we were seated.  Don't get me wrong, Michael offered to buy us dinner because I know his action implied, ""RACE FACTOR,"" because I knew it was.  It was felt and conveyed.  Thank you Michael for buying our dinner but we can afford to buy our dinners and our tip should suffice our entrees.  This was the worse and annoying service at Melba's as I was not the only guest who had different complaint.  I couldn't wait to get out of Melbas and the food is always tasty but the bad taste of the service will deter me from not coming back, and we rather spend our/my money else where, around the neighborhood.  I was literally disgusted and appalled by the racial favoritism."
5/25/2012,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's for Brunch it was very tasty and moderately priced. I had complimentary maccaroon, a Salmon and spinach omelet with a side of waffles with strawberry butter and coffee for less than 15 bucks. Need I say more?"
3/6/2013,3 star rating,Don't get me wrong.. Melba's has great food but the service sucks !! Especially on a Saturday night. In more need of host and servers. I'd like if they expand the restaurant as well.
7/9/2013,4 star rating,"Relatively small. Always packed and the food is probably one of the best on Harlem's Restaurant Row! The staff are friendly and the food comes out quickly and hot. Music selection is catered to a mature, sophisticated crowd...that likes to have a good time!"
10/25/2011,5 star rating,"I was in town visiting my cousin, and she said that we had to go to Melba's. I was skeptical of how good a chicken and waffles place could be, but Melba's blew me away. The fried chicken had so much flavor and was not oily or greasy. The eggnog waffles were AMAZING, especially with the strawberry butter. I also love that it feels like home in a small, nice restaurant. The staff were friendly and, even though we had to wait for awhile, they didn't forget us. The waitress that we met at the door remembered my name about 30 minutes later when she sat us (not from writing it down). There were also two birthdays, so the whole place sang Happy Birthday ""Stevie Wonder style"". It was like good, down home cooking, with an upscale flair and quality to it. I will definitely go back when I am in NY."
12/21/2014,3 star rating,"Although the location is quite small, great service and ambiance is a rare jewel. Went there a few months for a friends birthday. The manager and staff were very friendly and understanding to our needs, as we had a very large party.  As for the food, I was not impressed. The mac and cheese tasted like boxed school lunch and the chicken blah! To be fair, I also sampled some of the food from my party and was meant with the same result."
3/18/2012,1 star rating,"I was sorely disappointed by this spot, which clearly is coasting on the national exposure it has received of late as opposed to what the brand should be about -- good service and good  food. In terms of the service -- when we were finally seated after a 45 minute wait it took the hostess another 10 minutes to bring out menus, and this only happened because we asked for them. Meanwhile a couple who arrived after we did were given menus as soon as they were seated. Another 10 minutes passed before our waiter arrived, and although we stated we were ready to order drinks and food, his 'welcome' consisted of refusing to take our order until he went back to get us water. When he finally reappeared -- about 5 minutes later -- we place beverage and food orders together, and then we proceed to wait another 15 minutes. No drinks, but here comes the entrees. When we inquire we are told, 'they are coming'.  No apologies, just 'they are coming, as if this makes any sense. All of this after waiting nearly an hour for a table in the first place -- a fact that would have been okay actually, since we were aware of the 'no brunch reservation' policy. But I have been to other establishments with a similar policy and the staff work hard to make you feel like they want your business. At Melba's I felt certain that they would have been just as pleased to see folks walk out the door just to take the pressure off of their staff.  Dreadful. And then there was the food. I ordered something called a 'gourmet omelette' although when I asked the waiter what made it gourmet he couldn't tell me. I surmised that it must have something to do with the 4 eggs the menu says it contained and so I ordered it with spinach. Since I eat egg white omelette's a lot I was expecting something fluffy and light, but what emerged was a greasy, flattened, over-cooked  slab that I am certain contained only one egg. It didn't taste bad, but again hardly worth the now 90 minute time suck. My friends ordered the more usual Melba's fare -- chicken and waffles and salmon cakes. The chicken was dry -- clearly an old batch -- as I saw folks right next to us tuck into more juicy and clearly steaming pieces, Ditto on the salmon cakes, which had a decent flavor, but which were as dry as the Sahara desert. The drinks -- or at least mine was also a disappointment. I order white sangria which was devoid of fruit, and cloyingly sweet owing to the addition of some noxious fruit flavored sugar syrup. Yuck.At some point during this awful meal our waiter reappeared and I complained about the nearly eggless omelette. He apologized and removed my plate as if to make amends, at which point the hostess  appeared in this stead, insisted that I had a properly made omelette, and then asked me if I wanted another drink or dessert since by this time I sitting at the table without any food in front of me while my companions finished their meals. Did I say that I had only taken about 4 bites from the omelette when the waiter took my plate away? Seriously? After this we received no additional attention from anyone at all -- no offer of water refills, no dessert menu, no asks about additional drinks, just the wrong check and then our actual check several minutes after that. Needless to say I will NOT be returning to Melba's EVER. There are plenty of other eateries in the immediate vicinity. I have been happily passing over Melba's for these other options. I will continue to do so."
9/5/2012,5 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I am not a soul food fan and I never understood the concept of ""chicken and waffles.""  Melba made me a believer!  I knew we were off to a good start when we walked in at 1:30 on a Sunday and were seated right away.  I had the chicken wings and waffles and my partner had smothered fried chicken and pancakes.  Both dishes had us doing the happy dance in our seats.  My chicken was crispy outside, juicy inside and sooo flavorful.  And her smothered chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The waffles were light and airy and super yummy. And what I liked most was that there wasnt a ridiculous amount of food.  There was just enough to make you feel sated without feeling stuffed.  Loved it!"
8/12/2009,4 star rating,"I first went here after I saw Melba beat Bobby Flay in the chicken and waffles throwdown.  My friends and I are regulars and I always bring out of towners here.  I find the dinner menu lacking and have only really like the chicken and waffles from it but the brunch menu is the real star. The sweet potato pancakes on the brunch menu are great. The service needs some help. Even when the place isn't busy, they just can't find the time to be attentive. I must be a glutton for punishment because I keep going back. It's a nice place to go and hang out with friends after church. I'm a fan."
3/29/2014,4 star rating,"I went to Melba's for the first time today for brunch. My brother and his gf are foodies and have been there before so I trusted their choice. I wanted to order something I dont really have at home so I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. You could choose dark meat, wings, or white meat(which is what i chose). The portion size was perfect. You get one full sized waffle and your piece of chicken of choice. There is a side of syrup and the waffle has strawberry butter! I dug in and the waffle was perfectly toasty on the outside and fluffy and warm on the inside. The combination of syrup and strawberry butter was perfect. I was nervous about the fried chicken breast but it was crunchy on the outside and juice and tender meat on the inside!! Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. We also got a delicious and warm scone before our meal. Overall a very delightful brunch experience. Get the chicken and waffles!"
9/29/2012,3 star rating,Friday night must of been the worst night to go because it was crowded. My table was so close to the ppl next to me I bumped elbows a few times. I waited 30 minutes at the front for a table. There is no waiting area so as soon as u walk in u walk directly to the dinning area. The spinach was salty n garlicky . They were out of certain dishes like collard greens and rice &peas. It was very dark  but the music at a good level. I will return on a weekday n try again
3/20/2012,4 star rating,"Since my son was born, I have been generally too busy to write lots of reviews here.  But the service we got at Melba's on Sunday was too exceptional to not write about.  I don't know the name of the server, but she saw that I was coming in with my 2 year-old son to have brunch with a couple of old friends, and she anticipated everything.  She brought him a fruit juice concoction right off the bat.  Then she brought him a scoop of ice cream at the end of the meal when it was obvious that I was still visiting with my friends and my son was getting antsy.  She was great, and it made the entire meal much more relaxing for this harried dad.  Oh, and the fried chicken and waffles were delicious."
8/26/2012,4 star rating,Went here for dinner and the Chicken & Waffles were delightful. Didn't feel like we were gorging ourselves because the portions were 'just enough' and the chicken was not greasy...a pleasant surprise. The strawberry butter complemented the waffle perfectly! The service was very friendly and our waiter didn't rush us (we were catching up with an old friend and lingered a while after we were finished). Definitely recommend if you're in Harlem!
5/28/2017,2 star rating,"Hi everyone i would give this restaurant a 4 star if the waitress didn't charge my card someone else's bill. I tried not to dispute it with my card but after 5 business days of just getting the run around for all of the employees I had no choice but to dispute the fraud activity. The server I was told was a new worker but it still doesn't excuse the fact the General Manager didn't refund my card still till this day. It was the Saturday before Mothers Day and still nothing no call no nothing and its Memorial Weekend. I spoke to three different people. Yvonnea, Willo and Nadian. Nadian is the General Manager who did speak to me after the 5th day and claimed she will leave a $25 gift card for me to pick up that weekend and when I came to pick it up no one can reach her and there was no card in the front. At the end of the day there very unprofessional and I'm very displeased. Go at your own risk. PAY CASH DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CARD!!! Food was good but the collard greens had sand on them like they didn't wash them first. Never going back!"
4/4/2013,2 star rating,"Attended my sister friends birthday celebration at Melba's,we where a party of 20 people. I must first state that this establishment isn't equipped to handle large parties.We all where seated 4 people to a table that was meant for 2. The entire situation had me annoyed from the start.  We didn't eat until midnight  and we had a 930 reservation.  I wanted the catfish, potato salad, and collards and when I placed my order the waitress said and I quote ""order something else because the potato salad is salty tonight"" so I went with something else. My husband didn't receive his food at all until the majority of the party was done eating.What appalled me the most was the fact that the owner Melda was standing at the bar the entire time and not once did she come over to greet or ask if everything was satisfactory. It got so bad that my girlfriend had to ask another waitress to let her know that she wanted to speak to her.  Finally as she was leaving or home she came to our table with her pocketbook on her shoulder to hear our complaint. She gave the standard practiced  apology & threw in a cheap bottle of champagne.Our waitress was adamant about not splitting the 100 dollar tip that she wouldn't let anyone help her so we had the longest dinner in the history of dinners. There was one waiter who was trying to help but every-time he came near the table she would tell him to move. At one point he said "" I want to help but she doesn't want me to.""  I guess Melda pays so little & the hell with customer service.  I will never go back to this restaurant again. You would think after her appearance on tv she would run a tight ship. But as with most things. When your just starting out standards have to be met and after you make a little money there are no standards. And for the record, the food was ok and the service was horrible. And the cheap champagne made my throat hurt."
1/19/2013,5 star rating,I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everyone there was so nice and the food was beyond delicious. The mac and cheese was to die for. It was my first time trying chicken and waffles and it was the most amazing thing ever. I wish I lived closer so I could go there more often. Only downside is there was a pretty long wait. But it was worth it.
4/6/2014,1 star rating,"DON'T BOTHER.......Attempted to have dinner there on Thursday 4/3/14.  After being seated we waited 20 min & was completed ignored by the entire staff, and when we inquired about being served no one would come over to take our order so we left. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!"
7/13/2012,4 star rating,"Chicken and waffles yummy! My personal fave are the slow cooked short ribs! Omg! They are jus everything you want in a short rib well seasoned, fall apart and juicy! The salmon and sea bass is good...different but good. Sides are good also. Drinks, vibe and good people! I'm IN! A small place, but when something is that good you'll wait! So I wait! Lol"
6/5/2010,4 star rating,"We know the famous chicken and waffles combo over here on the west coast from Roscoe's. Apparently on east coast they have this place, Melbas. It's located on the outskirts of the Harlem neighborhood so I was expecting a really ghetto place. But when we walked in on an early Saturday morning, we were pleasantly surprised by a nice, new, upscale, small place with wonderful natural lighting. It's pretty much the opposite of Roscoe's - quiet, not full of people, and trendy. I actually only heard of this place through friends. And they only have their chicken and waffles on the weekend. I was again surprised to see that this dish had been featured on the food network (as stated on the menu). Since I'm an avid Food network believer/trustee, I really should look up what program it's been on. Anyways Food network's endorsement just reassured me that this place was going to be good. We got the fruit salad to start, just because we were on vacation and in dire need of fruits/veggies. But there's really no need unless you really love fruit. The chicken and waffles comes with a side of the fruit salad and the appetizer version is just more fruit in a giant bowl. Then my friend and I split the fried chicken and waffles plate. The chicken came out almost still sizzling and really hot. You get your choice of white or dark meat when you order. So two large pieces come on the plate. The waffles (3 of them) came out fluffy and warm as well. They were dollar sized-mini ones. And were topped with a weird berry butter thing, which I wasn't a fan of.  And then there's the side of fruit salad like I mentioned before. They also have brunch cocktails as well. Overall just a little bit pricey for what you get. But I'm glad I got to experience it and the food was quite delicious."
9/6/2012,3 star rating,"I concur with the other reviews they need to add more seasoning the fried chicken. However, I think the eggnog waffles and strawberry butter are worth the trip there.  I also enjoyed the black-eyed peas and collard green spring rolls. The red velvet cake was also excellent.  I will return and try a different protein.  Owners if you check out yelp, take the customers' advice and add more flavor to proteins."
12/25/2012,4 star rating,We took the whole family to Melba's for Christmas dinner and it was worth the trip. Coming from Brooklyn on Christmas day I crossed my fingers that the food would be good and was. My girls had chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter. My husband had the fried chicken with greens and yummy potato salad. I had BBQ turkey meatloaf with the buttery mash potatoes which was great! We topped it off with holiday desserts of coconut and red velvet cake. Scrumptous. We love the nice wait staff too. We will be back soon.
8/8/2010,3 star rating,It was just an okay place. Food weren't that great there was very little of strawberry butter on my pancake which was the best part of the food. Food came out fast but our waitress was very slow. Their chicken with eggnog waffle was just okay. There wasn't much meat on it the skin was crispy but the meat was dry. Also the sweet potato pancake tasted like just any regular pancake at a diner. The interior was nice and people are nice. But overall I think Spoonbread on 110st has better food although it's less friendly and the service is much slower. If you want to experience upscaled brunch in Herlem it's a good place since they even take reservation over the phone or via email.
9/10/2009,4 star rating,"Great service. Good looking wait staff. I had crab cakes and a side of spinach. They were absolutely delicious.  There's a fabulous portrait of Marvin Gaye hanging on the wall by the door that I couldn't help staring at. When I'm back in NYC, I will definitely go there again."
1/31/2010,4 star rating,"I felt a little bad that almost everyone in my group ordered the chicken & waffles.  The waitress very nicely tried to tell us that there were a lot of other delicious options.  And there were some intriguing items on the menu.  But I'd imagine most people, and almost every first-timer, will go for that distinctive combo.  Oh well.  It really did the trick to fill me up for a late dinner.  Very tasty, savory chicken (and beer if you so desire) with plenty of sweet flavors -- eggnog waffles, maple syrup, strawberry butter.  Not the best I've had, but worth the trip uptown."
11/8/2010,2 star rating,"Similar to others, I went to Melba's after seeing Bobby Flay's Throwdown and thought it would be fun to try her food.Went on a Saturday night, minimal crowd since we got there relatively early. Small place, but I liked the decor. Simple and classy. Ordered the grits, and catfish appetizers, then obviously the fried chicken and waffles. Everything tasted good, grits were cheesy and delicious, catfish was crisp and seasoned well. The chicken was great, the batter they used was light and the chicken was tender, warm, and not oozing grease with every bite. Waffle was your  standard waffle.The main downside to Melba's would be there proportion size. I think for the price your paying for the fried chicken and waffle dish, you could get more for your money. The chicken piece was very small as was the waffle. I'm sure after reading this review you can tell that I'm not crazy about this place, it was good, but not as spectacular as it seemed. But, nothing was horribly wrong with the place either. It sits in the meh, it was pretty decent zone."
10/9/2011,4 star rating,This was my second time in Melba's and I have to say this time I left a happy customer. I ordered the pecan crusted tilapia and it was sooo good.
4/25/2011,3 star rating,Okay...The signature chicken and waffle wasn't that exciting as it seemed to be. The strawberry butter was frozen and I couldn't spread it on my waffles. You'll want to have reservations to have a good seat here. I didn't and had to have my brunch at the bar.

1/12/2010,4 star rating,"I was initially very surprised the size of the dining room. I had no idea it was that tiny. I tried the egg nog waffles and fried chicken. Waffles were delish, I'd definitely go back for more. The fried chicken however, was much like everyone else said: not that good. I ordered white meat and the chicken was just too dry and lacked flavor. Seriously, I have better fried chicken at Kennedy Fried Chicken. Our server was great, we asked to be moved because the place was so small everytime the door opened we'd get the cold draft. I tried everyone else's food at my table, and it was delish. The mac n cheese was fantastic. I'd def visit again."
2/26/2011,3 star rating,"I wasn't too impressed with the food at Melbas. However, I do like the atmosphere. I prefer Amy Ruth's food as opposed to Melbas food-wise. Didn't feel like there were enough options on the menu at Melbas. I've only gone to Melbas for dinner, though."
4/17/2011,4 star rating,"Food and service was very good. Beware some dishes were very salty but overall we really enjoyed our meal and they were Cool enough to play Stevie wonders ""happy birthday to ya "" and bring out cake and candle. Recommend  the pound Cake and the spring rolls"

2/6/2009,3 star rating,"It's a very cute restaurant.  The music was a bit too loud while my friends and I were dining.  We split a mac and cheese which was pretty good.  Maybe I was OD-ing on cheese, but I thought the cheddar grits cake was bit too much.  It was a bit too dry.  My entree was the chicken and waffles.  The chicken didn't taste very seasoned.  I could have done without them.  The eggnog waffles, however, were very good.  I would go back just to eat them."
4/2/2011,4 star rating,"I've been here about 3 times and each dish I tried was really good.  My fav is the catfish dinner. The red sangria is also an excellent drink.  My only compliant is that I recently tried the maragrita and although it was good not impressed that it was in a small glass and it was $11.  Stick with the sangria, you get more for what you pay for.  I'll be back again soon."

2/11/2012,5 star rating,The space is small but intimate.  Great service & the soul food is so comforting.  Some nights there live music.  The plating is nice & everything I've tried is so flavorful.  Love esp the Honey chicken & the cod.  The cocktails are delish & you must have their warm red velvet cake a la mode....To die for!!!
4/26/2012,4 star rating,A friend recommended this restaurant to me a couple years ago.  I have the I'm not going uptown mentality when there are so many nice restaurants in Brooklyn. I am so happy it took some out of town friends staying in Harlem to get me out.  I suggested Melba's and it was an instant hit.  The atmosphere was very friendly.  The food was satisfying and the sangria is delish.  I will be back!!

5/24/2010,3 star rating,"Did the waffle propose to the chicken or vice versa? Do you suppose the food priest said the following?""Chicken do you take waffle to be your plate partner until teeth do you part?""Both chicken and waffle agree. Strawberry butter is exchanged.""I now pronounce you a delicious food pairing, you may now be drenched in syrup."" This was my first ever chicken and waffles experience and it really gets about 3.4 stars.Both chicken and waffle, but both just seemed to have been a bit on the drier side. That strawberry butter was something else, tasting freshly of strawberries (more so than butter). I actually liked taking bites of just the waffle with that and syrup (and bites of just the fried chicken and hot sauce, sorry it's the Korean in me). I went with a group of five on Saturday at about 12:40ish and we were happy to have no wait. The waiter did get upset with us since we paid with 4 cards (I was a server once, it really is annoying). I know this beat Bobby Flay in Throwdown, but I'm convinced there may be better chicken and waffle marriages elsewhere. Got suggestions? Send them!"
5/3/2010,4 star rating,"I have gone to many a date here and many a late night weekend bite, and I have never been disappointed.  Never even close.The highlights for me are always the catfish (which is amazing) and the fried chicken with eggnog waffles.  And the cocktails.And also the way that they're able to serve you food that it's clear has been freshly prepared, but at the speed of light.  Sometimes I feel almost as if the kitchen staff must be telepathic.  But I love it.  Because even though the food comes out almost before you order it, you never feel rushed.  Never."
3/22/2010,4 star rating,Food:  Good food for a good price.  Had wings and mini-burgers for appetizers.  Mini-burgers were great.  Wings were flavored great but were dry and very small.  For an entree I had the salmon and it was delicious as were the onion rings and smashed potatoes.  Ice Cream was okay...more icy than creamy and a very small portion.Service:  Excellent!
3/15/2010,4 star rating,"I was wondering around Harlem 1 night for a late dinner, came upon this restaurant first when I saw Gail (Oprah's best friend) outside the restaurant taking pictures with fans. On that very night I said that must be a good sign Service was great, crowd was busy for a Friday night (maybe they thought OPRAH was there too), & the food was fantastic. The venue & decor was intimate, but could still be enjoyed in a group setting as well. I ordered the southern fried chicken (grilled with yams & mach & cheese). I have to say I was impressed with the preparation & the seasoning, expect a bit of wait.....nothing a few glasses of wine wont help conquer though. My lady had turkey meatloaf which said seemed to be cold & lacked consistency (she's a snob)....it was above average meatloaf with a BBQ glaze. Also had some appetizer the crab cakes, I've had better but they get a B-. Otherwise this place is a great dine, on the upper end of prices but if your looking for a great meal & ambiance, with some Harlem soul this is a good start."
3/8/2010,2 star rating,"Like many first-time visitors to Melba's, I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was disappointing. Like other reviewers have noted, the chicken was poor. It was devoid of any kind of seasoning and therefore completely bland, requiring a healthy dose of salt to bring out any flavor. It seemed to be lacking a proper coating of batter, so instead of a light crispy fried coating, it was too dark, too crunchy, and ultimately unsatisfying. The waffles were quite heavy and somewhat mealy as from a mix, certainly not from freshly beaten batter. At least the strawberry butter was a nice accent.I also tasted the Tres Mac & Cheese, which was pretty mediocre as well. The cheese was bland, the texture was lacking, and there was an unappetizing pool of cheese grease left at the bottom of the dish - nothing like a good mac n cheese. The Sauteed Spinach was extremely garlicky, but not in a good way. On the plus side, the Cheddar Grits Cake was pretty good.All this mediocrity would have been more forgivable if Melba's were cheap, but it isn't. At least the decor is nice."
2/28/2010,3 star rating,"The service was good, bartender nice, food just ok. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles...chicken good, but waffles tasted like a box mix. The grits were delicious and so were their sides. My friend and I had egg dishes and they were good, pretty standard. If your looking to hang out and relax without the pressures of a scene or breaking your wallet, take a chance."
2/27/2010,4 star rating,"2015 update: Featured on CNBC's Consumed.Wanted to come for Harlem RW but caved and got some dinner takeout instead. Called in and picked up an order (no desserts, though? Really now? I know I should be happy, but I'm not.)Ambiance/service: I'm sure Food Network helped the business out (though I didn't get the chickeneggnogwaffleswithstrawberrybutter). The interior was different than I'd expected (but nice) & the music was too capricious even in the 5 minutes I was there. The guy who greeted me at the bar was clearly ripped and brought out a bag with one item inside and asked if it was OK they didn't have a fork to go in said bag. I said it was fine but made sure both of my items were inside--they weren't, good thing I asked. When he returned (within 20 seconds), crab cakes and a fork/spoon/napkin packet both magically placed themselves in plastic and materialized in my bag.Food: The cheesy grits, with which I don't have much experience, were merely cheese holding together grits at the bottom. That's not to say they weren't good, they were damn good. The crab cakes were enormous and incredible, as was the dipping sauce. The bed of greens on which they sat was also good, an aspect of a dish some places often overlook when it comes to appetizers. The mac & cheese was a bit dry but still very very tasty, and the pecan-crusted tilapia was full of flavor (though the pecans must've escaped my tray before I got to them). Overall, it was expensive but definitely a lot of (really good) food."

2/14/2010,3 star rating,"Had a difficult time deciding how many stars to give this because there were certain elements of the restaurant that was stellar and others that were underwhelming.  If you take my advice you will be fine.Recommendation*Severely disappointed in the eggnog waffles. It tasted mushy and not fresh :( I got the feeling that they mass produced it then serviced it--Not served to order :(*I disagree with the other reviewers in the fried chicken though, it definitely tasted flavorful and krispy, and I don't even like fried chicken.*GET GRITS and SMOTHERED CHICKEN.  Do I dare say it's the best grits and smothered chicken I ever had? *Gasp* YES! :D  *Get a reservation because they definitely are busy during the weekends*Service is EXTREMELY slow, but if you bring good company the poor service won't seem so bad*Definitely a great place to bring a date or girlfriend.  The decor is beautiful an soulful :)CHALLENGE: Fried Chicken and Waffles"
1/31/2010,4 star rating,"I felt a little bad that almost everyone in my group ordered the chicken & waffles.  The waitress very nicely tried to tell us that there were a lot of other delicious options.  And there were some intriguing items on the menu.  But I'd imagine most people, and almost every first-timer, will go for that distinctive combo.  Oh well.  It really did the trick to fill me up for a late dinner.  Very tasty, savory chicken (and beer if you so desire) with plenty of sweet flavors -- eggnog waffles, maple syrup, strawberry butter.  Not the best I've had, but worth the trip uptown."
7/24/2010,4 star rating,Great classy restaurant. Beautiful inside. Chicken and Waffles are delish.
6/5/2011,3 star rating,"Been here twice.  Their sangrias are the best!   Waffles were a bit soggy in my opinion,  chicken was okay.  i personally liked the catfish from the appetizers and the turkey meatloaf is great.     I would come back over and over just for their sangria, its about $12 but size is generous."
8/24/2011,4 star rating,"I've loved Melba's ever since we moved to the neighborhood 4 years ago when it was the only decent restaurant in the area (now it's practically restaurant row) - I attempt to get something different every time but usually end up with the mac and cheese with a side of collard greens (really terrific) and red cake for dessert.  With a Guiness and coffee after it is pure comfort food.  Everyone is always very nice, but service can be spotty, really depends on who you get as a server, and the noise level can sometimes be almost deafening.  Still, the amazing food keeps me coming back for more!"
8/25/2014,4 star rating,"This was my first time dining at Melba's and I have to say that I was mighty impressed. The food was cooked to perfection. The ambiance however, left a lot to be desired. For a place of such amazing food it's terrible that they have to turn away so many customers due to the limited seating. If you are fortunate to grab a seat, you surely won't leave disappointed."
11/11/2013,2 star rating,"So, yesterday 11/10/13 was my 1st time at this eatery. Every couple of weeks me and a couple of my girlfriends meet for brunch to catch up on life and such. After reading the reviews, we wanted to try it. PLEASE heed to ""don't be late for your reservation"" or ""this place is tiny"". It is, if you're claustrophobic STAY AWAY. So I got the famous eggnog waffles with fried chicken. It was good, not going to lie, I totally cleaned my plate, it was great, but I was not ga-ga over it. But it was great! So I did have a problem with the hostess not allowing me and my party o move over one table. It was the same size and everything. I know you are asking, ""Then what was the fuss?"" One of my friends is pregnant and I have learned to never question a pregnant woman. I think she just wanted more elbow space. So we weren't able to move and again, I get this place is tiny and popular, but what really got me was the rush to get you out. The waiter was a little pushy, eh I can handle that, but what I thought was rude was the hostess literally cleaning our table while I was writing on my receipt. I'm leaving because clearly I have the receipt, but I felt seconds away from getting the bum's rush. Me and my table spent a nice amount in there and even if we spent a dollar, to rush us out was rude. My friends don't plan on returning, I might to get something to go. BTW I did see Melba, but she was talking to someone and appeared to be super nice."
1/22/2008,4 star rating,"A nice sunday brunch spot, but get there before the church crowd fills all the tables. The perfectly crisp homefries are half yukon gold and half sweet potatoes. Nothing is too greasy and the buttermilk biscuits are pipin' hot. For a special treat you can't find south of Catherdal Parkway, try the fluffy sweet potato pancakes."
7/8/2010,4 star rating,"I enjoyed a late dinner I had there. The space is tight, so if they are having a party chances are you will be turned away, as many were when I last went.  There is great variety and a nice atmosphere.  The space is well decorated but unassuming from the street.  A credit to the neighborhood."
9/20/2010,3 star rating,"Was going on a Saturday so I decided to make reservations because the place is small.  I went to their website and there was a link saying you could email to make reservations so I did and never got a response.  I called the next day, left a message and never got a call back.  Called the next day (Wednesday or Thursday) and made the reservation with the person on the phone.  When part of my party got there of course they said they did not have a reservation for us.    It turns out that the person I spoke to did put it in the book but by the time the waitress figured it out she gave away the table with the reserved sign on i to tourist who walked in.   We finally did get a table but we never got anything comp'd for the inconvenience.Pros:  Food was banging!  We started with spinach and cheese empanadas (fantastic).  People at the table had fish, chicken and short ribs...all very good.  Tres mac and cheese a don't miss, wish the portion was larger.Cons: Besides not getting the reservation correct and beside the friendly staff...service is slow.  It took awhile to order appetizers, then when we finished eating those and only then were we able to place our entree orders.  We were in there almost 3 hours and 45 minutes of that time was eating.  I'd go again but next time I will clear my schedule."
4/3/2011,4 star rating,After waiting 20 mins on a Sunday night we were seated and Juan Carlos took care of us. His service and care was clearly outstanding and covered the fact that the food was nothing really special. Fried chicken was lacking salt while calamaries were ok. Ambience was superb thanks to well balanced music and delightful lighting!
12/10/2011,2 star rating,Disappointing....Eggnog hype. The waffles were small palm size dry cakes. Chicken was fresh and hot. Mac n cheese (gummy and horrible) and yams (excellent) were my waffle replacements. Otherwise small nice intimate location and great cocktails. -k

The food is always always incredible!The atmosphere is beautiful,the staff is super super friendly (without being annoying) The customers you meet there are soon to be friends,everyone is so friendly. And what a hostess/owner......the most gracious beautiful lovely woman! You go there once and Miss Melba Wilson will remember you and make you feel like you are invited to her home for a family gathering, before you leave ,you will know the people sitting around you and make plans to meet them there again.The young lady sitting at the table next to me even said ""You have got to try this ""and gave me a bite of her sweet potato pie. I almost died in my seat!! Don't leave without trying that,and be kind to your neighbor....ask for another fork to share with the person next to you!"
6/19/2011,4 star rating,"Went to Melba's based on the relationship to Sylvia's, but it can truly stand on its own merit.  We ere greeted immediately as we entered the door, and got an immediate seat at 5 p.m. on Father's Day.  The waitress took our drink orders, and since we were hungry, asked that she take our food orders as well.  We both had fried chicken which was delicious, as were the greens and yams..  The pound cake and homemade ice cream were a perfect ending.I am not sure what affected some of the previous reviewers, but I certainly intend to return"
10/9/2012,2 star rating,"I had been to Melba's many years ago for a friend's birthday and enjoyed the experience.  I decided, last minute, to celebrate my birthday this week at Melba's to finally try chicken and waffles (my husband and I have been receiving some shocked expressions when we tell friends we have never had chicken and waffles despite being black and my mom hailing from North Carolina!).  The service was AMAZING!  The host and waitress were super friendly and welcoming.  Despite not having a reservation, the host made space for us (including finding room for my daughter's high chair).  The other patrons near us were so friendly and outgoing.  The ambience of the restaurant is perfect - nice and small with good lighting and fun music.Unfortunately, the food was awful (overall).  The waffles were out of this world - never tasted better waffles in my life!  The garlic mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was terrible.  I would never expect a southern restaurant to mess up on fried chicken because I think it is something very difficult to mess up.  The chicken was dry, tough, and bland.  The collard greens were completely bland.  The macaroni and cheese tasted terrible.  My daughter threw up her food on the way home (she mostly ate the mac and cheese) and what reminded me to write this review is that this morning, I was still cleaning stinky chunks of mac and cheese from her car seat :(  One of the patrons next to me asked us what we thought of the food and she said her friend thought the same thing about the chicken.  She explained that about a year ago, they hired a new cook and the quality of the food went down.  She went on to say that she still comes to the restaurant because she believes in supporting black businesses.I was so disappointed, particularly because I was celebrating my birthday that night and opted to try a new place over the same place my husband and I always go to for special ocassions - a little sad I made that choice.  But, as you can see from the review, it was definitely not an all bad experience.  Even though quality of food is more important than service, I still very much appeciate excellent service.  I won't be returning, but if you do try it, see about getting the smothered chicken as the patron I spoke to said she thought the smothered chicken is better than the fried chicken."
3/28/2011,1 star rating,"The only thing that keeps people coming back to this place is the food itself. Atmospher is okay, price is ok. I only went because I had a groupon. The wait staff is sub par and they are very slow. Most dissaspointing is their customer service skills on the phone. I called around 4:30 pm to make a dinner reservation and was put on hold for 8 minutes. But they didnt press the hold button, they just put the phone down for 8 minutes so I got the pleasure of listening to them giggle and crack jokes at one another. Then someone hung up the phone without speaking to me... I called back immediately, the same girl answered in her monotone/unfriendly voice, like she couldnt be bothered. And she didnt apologize for her mistake in putting me on hold for 8 minutes, then hanging up on me. That's just inconsiderate and disrespectful. I wont be going back."
3/3/2008,5 star rating,"This quaint yet trendy surprising find in Harlem was the highlight of my weekend.  Not only were the crispy and juicy fried chicken the most amazing thing I've had up in the northeast, the warm, sweet, and slightly crunchy waffles served with the strawberry flavored butter accompanying them were absolutely divine.  The wait was well worth it.  Keep in mind that this place gets super crowded ever since the restaurant was featured on Bobby Flay's Throwdown so go early or call in before heading out.  Also, if you get a chance to talk to Melba, she is quite the warm and spunky hostess as she seemed to be on TV."
1/13/2014,5 star rating,"I just love Melba's.  The food is exquisite.  I highly recommend the catfish, collard greens, and mac and cheese.  The yams are also to die for.  For those of you who'd rather drive there, there's a parking garage about 1 block away.  The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent.  I'm living outside of the city now, but every time I return, Melba's is as must."

When our food arrived I was very happy because I love wings and couldn't wait to try theirs.  I took a bite and noticed that the wings were not fresh.  They were dried out and hard.  I even have my friend taste it and he thought the same.  I could not take another bite they were horrible.  His catfish was bland, nothing to praise about.  The thing that got me was that the waiter asked if I didn't like the wings and I told him they were stale and dried out and he didn't offer any apologies.  And to top it off, I was charged for the wings I didn't eat.  We've had way better!!!!"
5/9/2011,1 star rating,"I took my mom and my children to Melba's for Mother's Day dinner yesterday because i wanted to stay in the Harlem area, and i heard from reliable sources that the food was delish. I understood that dinner started at 5pm which my mom didn't mind, but once we were seated, it took 45 minutes before we were given menus.I saw Ms. Melba seated with her guests of about 8 folks that were extremely loud. I mean that's fine but not when there's a crowded dining room and people are waiting to be seated. I motioned for a waiter to come and assist us and he told me he was off and that he was just ""helping out"" . Meanwhile, He and another staff member catered to Ms. Melba and her party the whole time.My mom had the organic mesculin greens with grilled salmon, she wasn't satisfied, she said the salmon could've been cooked more. The food was okay, i 've had better.My experience at Melba's was horrible, and if i decide to go back maybe on a late night stroll, I'll sit at the bar and order dinner!Thumbs Down......."

4/14/2008,5 star rating,I have dined at Melbas many times in the past few years. The ambiance is elegant. The service is polite and prompt. The food is the prize. The Sea Bass with Garlic mashed - superb. Short ribs lip smacking good. The fried chicken with waffles her specialty. You will be very lucky if Melba herself is there to greet you.. And OH! don't forget the red velvet cake or sweet potatoe pie with home made ice cream. Bravo Melba!     Karen L
2/27/2013,5 star rating,"Ok so my job is temporarily located in Jersey City, NJ so food choices is slim to none and i'm stuck with whatever doesn't make me sick that is offered in the building cafeteria. Well this week, Melba's Restaurant is being featured. Since Monday the line for the food from Melba's has been long and the price ($10) for a plate discouraged me. However, today with the food choices available really disappointed me I decided to go ahead and get a plate (oxtails, tres mac and cheese, and steamed cabbage and carrots). Let's just say.....lay out the blanket, because i am taking a nap!!! The food was excellent...oxtails were tender, cabbage on point and the mac and cheese to die for! It was definitely worth it. The restaurant also offered their signature 4 layer red velvet cake and 3 layer coconut cake. I would have gotten the cake but i wanted to be sure of the food first. So now that I am convinced that the food is definitely worth the $$ I paid..I will try to venture to upper Manhattan one day for brunch or dinner...to go of course. I wish they could stay in the building for as long as my company is here..."
7/4/2014,3 star rating,"As soon as I was introduced to Melba's, I loved the food. Their chicken and waffles has been a personal favorite for a while. However, it seems their minor television fame and other attentions have led to a decrease in quality.  The wait is insane. Once, I was told on the phone that reservations were no longer made or taken at the restaurant, only to get there and find it to be untrue. And, was particularly annoyed during a visit when the hostess allowed someone with a 9:30 a.m. reservation to be seated before everyone else who was waiting, though they were almost two hours late.  Service, in general, has become annoyingly slow, inconsistent, and reckless. On my last visit, the cleanliness of the dishes was severely tested when my gf found red lipstick on the rim of my cocktail glass as she attempted to try my drink (note: neither of us were wearing makeup nor had even touched the glass as yet), and the food itself was just okay, at best (her eggs were swimming in oil and didn't come as requested, while my strawberry butter was somewhat frozen in the middle and tasted more like freezer burned ice cream). Fortunately, the chicken and waffles were decent.  So far, I still love the food, which is why I assume most people continue to frequent their restaurant.  Will I keep visiting?  Sure...but only on days when I have high patience and little to do."
2/28/2010,3 star rating,"The service was good, bartender nice, food just ok. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles...chicken good, but waffles tasted like a box mix. The grits were delicious and so were their sides. My friend and I had egg dishes and they were good, pretty standard. If your looking to hang out and relax without the pressures of a scene or breaking your wallet, take a chance."
7/6/2013,5 star rating,"I have eaten here twice and was disappointed I couldn't get in the third time, needed a reservation for a Saturday. The food is so delicious, had the waffles and chicken because I had seen the Throw-down with Flay. UMMM ummm, my NY family was so happy I wanted them to take me there, they had eaten there and really liked the food. I tell all my Ohio friends going to NYC to go to Melba's. Everybody was so friendly and you really feel full when you leave, and satisfied."
4/9/2013,2 star rating,"4/3/2013 Edit ""For my birthday, I planned a dinner at Melba's for a group of 20. When I called to make reservations, they told me they could definitely accommodate a group of my size, especially since they were seating a party of 25 a few hours prior to my reservation. When we arrived, they had a table set up for 14 people. Worst of all, these tables can only fit 2 standard sized adults, but they had seating set up for 4 people at a table! Maybe if we were 4 years old and in preschool! We had to wait for another table next to ours to open up in order to seat the other 6 guests. These tables weren't even connected and it was as if we weren't even part of the same group. There excuse was that our entire party wasn't there all together. This didn't matter because it was no way that the people sitting at the table we were waiting for came in during the 20 min we were late and miraculously ordered their food, ate and was done in 30 min. Once we were seated,  there was one waitress for 20 people.  Ridiculous. We started to order at 10:15 (9:30 reservations), didn't eat until 11:30 pm. The table with 6 people had eaten before the larger table even received our food. The waitress wouldn't allow any of the other workers to help because she was trying to get the entire tip. Really Melba , does your staff make such little that they have to fight for a $100 tip at the expense of your customer satisfaction?? I would like to say that the food was good, once we finally received it. Would give them 4 stars for that. That's where it ends. I did not expect to eat at 11:30 pm and have the worst service ever. To make matters worst, Melba was there the entire time. I saw her walking around and speaking to customers. With a group as large as ours, you would have thought she would have come over to introduce herself and see how we were doing. NOT ONCE. She also saw that there was ONE server for our entire group and didn't think it was necessary to send her help. And at the end, when I had finally had enough, I spoke to her and she ever so graciously gave us a glass of some cheap champagne. Whatever! Since the majority of us came from Philadelphia to celebrate my birthday , this is a place we are sure to NOT visit again. The only saving grace for this place is the food is pretty good. Definitely do not go with any group larger than 6 people. Would recommend the Mac n cheese, the greens, the spinach, the catfish and the meatloaf. Thank goodness for Red Rooster's being fun that night at Ginny's supper club!"

2/17/2011,2 star rating,"Took my family out for a celebratory dinner, after being told about this place by someone I love and trust. Fortunately, they were right about the food, which is fantastic. Having said that, the service left a LOT to be desired. The waiter was mediocre at best. Never got a handle on us or the other guests he was serving. Drinks weren't refilled until he had to be waved down, entree plates were cleared for over 20 minutes and were never offered a dessert menu. Even after ALL of that, and pulling my wallet out to hint that we were near end, he still never checked in with us. Then, to top it off, the manager on duty, clears a dirty plate from another table, while sitting guests at the table next to them, takes the dirty plate, and places it on our table to seat another guest. How can you expect good service when the incompetence comes from the top down?!? Smh!"
11/28/2011,4 star rating,"I recently saw an episode of ""Kitchen Nightmares"" were a former customer of an establishment told the owner they created a Yelp account just to rebuke his place; well I too have created an account just to make a comment-but a very positive one for Melba's in Harlem. To begin, the decor and ambience departs from a traditional southern food restaurant, it conveys an aura of a sophisticated bistro-while being intimate. The food, was quite splendid, a friend and I both had the Southern Fried Chicken and Eggnog Waffles topped with strawberry butter-sublime. The chicken wasn't greasy, it was cooked to perfection, a duality of tender and crisp. Our delight was magnified when we experienced, yes, experienced perhaps the best Mac and Cheese; my companion remarked, ""If I died right now, I would be happy."" So delectable, was the Mac that we were compelled to order the entree size, we gorged ourselves on the luscious Mac with gluttonous glee. One final remark, the service was personable, affable, and charming-thank you Juan-Carlos. I look forward to again dining at Melba's. Thank you Melba."

8/20/2014,3 star rating,"I came here yesterday with a chef friend of mine because others have told us so much about this place and as a harlem resident I felt like I HAD to go see what it was about. I was surprised Melbas was a small cozy place. Small so it can easily be crowded or too noisy by seating only 4 tables lol regardless our server was nice despite what other reviews say.( Natural girl with locks in her hair) and so was the busser who helped. But we came for the groupon foodie experience. I want to say Melbas is much better than ALOT of other harlem soulfood places but it wasnt GREAT, didn't make me want to call my southern grandma and tell her she had competition. I had chicken, mac, and yams my friend had ribs, mac and potato salad. Fish bites for appetizers was the highlight of my whole meal. I wouldn't mind buying the fish again. Chicken wasn't dry, good seasoning to the white meat. Yams were just Ok, my mac was heavy on the cheese and a lil oily I guess from the mix of many cheese but it was OK also, it has much potential..i noticed my friends portion of mac was also ""oily"" from the fatty dripping...im on no diet and I love fat lol I just don't want a puddle of fat on my plate that's all. Again pointing out they are better than a lot of other places in harlem that over the years dnt even taste the same. my friend only received 2 small short ribs when the server said it came with 5 or 6 when asked ?! she told me it was tough and she didn't finish her potato salad so I didn't ask. Its hard to be from southern decent and be pleased going to a southern restaurant, Im not in a rush to go back. Service was a 3 outa 5 and so was the food. Maybe I shlda got the waffles. If you go..please get the FISH."
2/26/2013,2 star rating,"Maybe me being from Texas has alot to do with me NOT BEING IMPRESSED! I'll start with the good.  1.  The drinks are wonderful.  I had a Melbas hit Harlem Iced Tea.   2. The spot is very nice.  Inviting atmosphere. 3. Our waiter was great. I just can't recall his name.  Now to the bad part.   We had to make reservations to be guaranteed a table.  Yet when we got there we still had to wait 20 minutes for a table .  What is the point of a reservation?   The food..... EHHHHHH.  From all the reviews I knew we'd found a winner.  But that wasn't the case at all. I've heard so much about this chicken and waffles; so that's what I ordered along with their famous Tres Mac and Cheese.   At $5 for a scoop of mac and cheese I knew I was in for a treat.  Not so much.  The mac and cheese is SOOOOO dry I was very disappointed.  Sent it back.  My eggnog waffle was pretty tasty; my chicken had no seasoning.  My cousin ordered the smothered chicken w/ greens.  She said the chicken was good could use more gravy (that's what smothered means) her greens tasted like they came out a can.  She also had to send her Calamari back cause it was nasty.  My other cousin ordered fish w/ mac and cheese.  She didn't like her fish and ordered a side of brown gravy to put on her mac and cheese to give it some flavor and moisture. When that didn't work; she sent it back and asked for a side salad. Our friend ordered meatloaf and greens, he said it was blah...and he's from NY. So maybe its not just the Texas thing.  But in Texas we love food with flavor and Melba's had none.   It was disappointing cause I'm the one requested we go here and my family looking at me crazy when Melba's didn't deliver.   I'd visit again. ONLY FOR DRINKS"
10/14/2012,3 star rating,"Hmmmm. Decor for Melbas is nice enough using darker browns and blacks of the color palate, that exude small space, they livened it up with mirrors to make the space ""feel"" bigger. I made reservations for Melbas even though I had my own reservations about any ""soul food""  spot in general. Why do I have reservations for soul food ? Im glad you asked.....because Soul Food is home cooked family food that is big on taste and low on plate presentation, often-times with the same flavor components you get at home....BIG WHOOP. Melbas was exactly that, big on flavor and little plate presentation with immediately recognizable flavor components that can be recreated at home with minimal skill in the kitchen. The pricepoint of said food was to be expected especially in the city....I wouldnt ""ding "" them for that.  So now you have food you can make at home with minimal wow factor but how was the service? Glad you asked that too. My server who worked the whole floor was efficient but light on decorum, very to the point and not personable. The Host worked the room and made sure any and everyone who was eating was satisfied which was good. Overall I wouldnt go back to Melbas because it wasnt bad persay but because it was .....average at best. I want Soul Food that is recognizable but different....with some nice plate presentation and for godsakes if you are soul food or southern have some damn cheese grits with some type of seafood on your menu!"
2/7/2013,4 star rating,Good food. Went last Tuesday. People were celebrating a birthday. It was wild. Felt like I was in a prison cafeteria. it's usually much quieter though. There was a guy singing. He was AWESOME.  Our waitress was Sherry. She's so lovely and attentive. She brings the rating up to 4.
12/12/2008,4 star rating,"awesome chicken and waffles! the restaurant has a beautiful decor and has a wonderful atmosphere.  the fried chicken is crispy, has a light batter that is seasoned to perfection - the waffles were crispy and fluffy, served with a yummy strawberry butter.  you must try this place if you haven't been there yet!"
6/5/2014,5 star rating,"this place just has a great environment--everyone's super nice, service was excellent and the food was delicious! the spare ribs just fell right off the bone and melts in your mouth. and over mac and cheese and collard greens makes for a perfect combo. The chicken and wings were some of the best-the chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. we were all very impressed.  the eggnog waffles were a great complement, and although the strawberry butter looks very artificial, it's pretty tasty."
12/12/2009,5 star rating,"I actually stumbled upon Melba's after attempting to have brunch at the restaurant across the street (I left because once again it was taking cash only). Boy was I in store for a treat! I absolutely fell in LOVE with Melba's!! From the moment I walked through the door, the warmth and spirit (literally and figuratively) of this restaurant greeted me with open arms. Melba was at the door ready to take my coat and the place was packed with happy, bubbling people, it was almost like walking into one big family Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma's house. The music was the perfect combination of jazz and soul and everything down to the christmas decor and art in this place just made you feel so at ease. The food was impeccably good and the drinks were divine. The fabulous service was simply icing on the cake but our waitstaff was incredibly attentive and welcoming. This place is the true essence of what Harlem dining should be, I love it!"
1/21/2011,4 star rating,Good food; not overpriced but really small inside. Expect  to wait about 20-30 minutes before being seated and not have much elbow room. They do accept credit cards and there is a small bar inside. Offers a limited menu but there is something for everybody- even vegans. Added bonus the bathroom is beautifully decorated  and spacious. Don't be surprised to catch Melba in the restaurant all day on holidays that they are open and on some Sunday afternoons. Worth checking out when in Harlem.

I know on Sunday mornings get there early! Once church service is over it get's really packed. We waited for at least 25 min. but it was worth it! Will be back again and again!"
12/2/2010,4 star rating,Tried the mac 'n' cheese the last time I visited. The best I've had in a long time. And the service was just as friendly as when I first visited several years ago.  Yay!
3/20/2012,2 star rating,"After hearing good things about Melba's me and my girls finally decided to check it out   We decided to go on tuesday since they have open mike night and figured it would be a fun thing to do.  First the good stuff:  We had reservations and although we got there late, they sat us right away.  The service was average but not so bad.  The waitress could have acted like she knew more about how foods were prepared on the menu  Now for the rest:  I ordered the catfish and waffles, my other friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the smothered chicken (which they decided to change to fried chicken) that came with collard greens and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered the pulled bbq pork sliders and a side of candied yams.  the catfish was not so good.  it tasted like it was dipped in egg whites and then fried too hard or had been sitting long before it got to my table.  so was not crispy and was hard to chew the skin.  It also lacked seasoning.  Waffle tasted like a regular ole waffle-not impressed.  My friend's replaced smothered chicken was dry oh so dry and had very little flavor.  However, not good enough for her to eat even half of itl.  Even she left most of the chicken on the plate, which is not normal for her when it comes to fried chicken!  Her mashed potatoes were also dry, like they were sitting around for a while before it got to our table and had crisped on the top.  She didnt like the collard greens although I didnt think they were so bad.  My other friend was just hungry.  so she ate all of it.  event hough she said it was just ""alright"".  The yams werent so candied and the sliders seemed to be the only hit of the night.  Other annoyances during the night:  the extremely loud music!  Too hard to have a conversation.  furthermore,  I thought that open mike meant a variety of people singing, however, we were privileged to be entertained by a large black man.  who, along with other customers kept using our table to hold their drinks when they were tired of holding them-pretty ghetto.  But whats even more ghetto is the large black man texting in the middle of his performance.  Hilarious.  this place is not intimate, its tiny.  I really hate that the food wasnt so good, really like to support southern restaurants,  We still dont understand what all the hype is about this place  but we wont be going back for sure."
7/30/2012,4 star rating,Went with a large group for a b-day party dinner... The mac n' cheese and catfish strips were amazing... Nice ambiance.  Small spot so not great for the large party we had even though their staff was very accommodating!
9/30/2012,2 star rating,"It was our first visit to Melba's and we were expecting some amazing food.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. We had the rib sliders for an appetizer, and those were delicious, but  very small.  For the entree I had shrimp, mac & cheese, and fries.  The best thing was the shrimp, they were large and cooked well, but the fries were too thick,and the mac&cheese was not very good.  My husband had the fish, yams, and mac&cheese.  His fish was soggy and chewy, and the yams tasted like they had a little too much nutmeg and cinnamon. The best thing was the pound cake.  It was delicious.  I guess I was just expecting more."
1/6/2012,3 star rating,went there on new years day for brunch...the food was fine...nothing exotic..very small place...very long wait for a table (party of 4) ...location was fine..parking was easy...staff was nice just a little too passive and disorganized...but overall okay experience...
8/26/2012,4 star rating,"The food and the staff are outstanding! The service however when busy needs some work. I have been there several times and have seen people walk out because of either standing too long before being acknowledged or sitting too long before anyone came over to provide service. There simply needs to be someone there at busy times to direct and guide staff to ensure all seated are being waited on in an appropriately timely manner! The fix? Add another server! Not the great bartender; not the greeter or  host, not the busboy; add another waiter or waitress and split the restaurant in two."
10/18/2010,2 star rating,"Saw it on the Food Network - finally got a chance to try the egg nog pancake and fried chicken in their brunch menu - I have to say, I didn't taste anything special.  There was not a hint of egg nog in the pancakes, and the fried chicken were fried, but that was pretty about it.  Althouth I liked the decor a great deal, and people dressed very chic for going to a brunch - but, the service was slow, and space was very tight.  My husband ordered the sweet potato pancake - it was decent, but again nothing special. I was also very disappointed that there was no hot sauce and no collard green available as a side dish."
1/19/2011,5 star rating,"My husband and I took a trip to NYC last year and reserved for Melba's before we got there. The whole experience was fantastic! The restaurant is small with terrific ambience, music and staff. We did have chicken and waffles (based on Melba 's winning experience with Bobby Flay. It was delicious, and I don't even like fried chicken.) Melba came in and came to our table -  she's a wonderful lady and very gracious hostess. We enjoyed our visit with her. We give it a strong recommendation and we'll go back when we are in NYC again."
2/13/2011,5 star rating,"I love this place! Fabulous brunch on weekends and great Southern food for dinner. There are big servings, but the price is right. The service is usually good, even when it's crowded. The drinks are great too. Only downside? It's a bit on the small side, so sometimes it's hard to get a table. My favorite thing to get here is the catfish...yum!"
11/29/2011,5 star rating,"I love this place! Melba is amazing, and comes to your table to chat and to make sure you're enjoying yourself. Our server was the nicest guy in the world. We had Thanksgiving dinner there, and it was the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had. Full stop. I'm glad my full name's not up here, so my mom doesn't know I said that! Go. You'll love the food and will have a great time."
2/10/2014,2 star rating,"Melba's food is great I have recommended the restaurants to others my first two experiences at Melba's were great staff friendly and knowledgeable about the menu my last few experiences with Melba's was one for my birthday in September food was great but the service really lacked this time my brother order a vodka cranberry we waited over forty minutes for his drink asking the waiter several times just to be told oh its coming sorry then to be told oh we don't have cranberry juice sorry WHAT you have a full service bar but you ran out of cranberry juice that is unacceptable we were given desert on the house but that doesn't make up for the forty minute wait just to be told we don't have cranberry juice in November I went to order take out and was told they didn't have beef ribs that night I don't understand how you're out of ribs and you have been open for less than one hour  my last two and final attempts I was told oh we have no sitting right now by the rude waitress that clearly doesn't know to give customers the option of dining at the bar or giving them a wait time to tell customer ""we ain't got no tables"" is unacceptable  and rude even though the food is great at Melba's I will never go back taking my money back to Sylvia's , Amy Ruth's or Soul Fixins where the waitresses know to give the customers options for dining I've sent friends and family there and they too have had complaints about lack of service from the same female waitress. I would give five stars based on food but because of the other issues Melba's gets two stars"

4/3/2013,2 star rating,"We had birthday dinner reservations for 20 people @ 9:30PM and upon arrival the seating was not available until 10:30PM. Only one table was set for the party which was not adequate and comfortable seating. We were bumping elbows! The other table was not ready and waitress would not allow us to sit until table was ready...there was no space to stand but almost out the door. There was only 1 waitress for the entire party! She was greedy to receive the one tip and not share the responsibility to serve a party of this size! She took 45 minutes for drinks and appetizers and tthen @ 11:10PM states,""I need to get your entree orders because the ktchen closes at 11PM!"" WTH!!!  So in a hurry our entrees were placed and en were not served until 11:30PM and one appetizer came out with the dinner (catfish strips..did they go catch the catfish and cook it)  The venue is much too small!  Melba the owner not once came to our tables to inquire how was everything!!! The food was just ok..Popeyes has a better flavor than their ""fried chicken and waffles"". This venue is over-rated and not great portion sizes. Most of all very disappointing for a pre-scheduled birthday rerservation! Their waiter/waitress staff needs better training to provide quality service and welcoming!"
3/17/2012,4 star rating,"it was good. i got teh fried chicken, sweet potatoes, and greens. it was pricey but it was good. the space was small inside so you are basically eating while people are hovering over you waiting for you to get up from your seat. if u like people watching this is a great spot for it. would i come here again...sure i would try it, maybe not on a weekend night because it was too packed but it was good. hopefully they expand if possible and knock a wall down so there can be more space."
3/31/2012,3 star rating,"I experienced Melba's for the first time last night with friends. First of all it is very loud so this is not the place for a quiet dinner (at least not on a Friday night) but we did enjoy the 80's R&B music playing. I made a reservation so the only table left open when we arrived was ours. It took a few minutes longer than it should have to get menus but once we did things progressed nicely. We ordered the spring rolls and the buffalo wings for appetizers which were both good. I had the BBQ turkey meatloaf for my entree which I am sad to say I did not like at all. It was a very strange consistency and shape. I sent it back and got the catfish instead which was fine. The Mac & Cheese is very good but the collard greens were a bit salty. We ordered the sweet potato pie and the red velvet cake for dessert which were both just ok. So overall, I wouldn't run back but I wouldn't discourage anyone from going either. Also, it would be nice if the bar area was bigger. People waiting for a table have to stand in the doorway and just gaze at the people seated since there are very few seats at the bar."
