2/6/2022,5 star rating,"The service & food was outstanding. We ordered the Crab Cake Plate with Cabbage & Mac. Lobster Fries, Shrimp w/ Wings, & One of their Juices. All of the food was fresh & delish. Large portions of food, worth the price. Cash Only so bring your Dinero."
6/1/2021,5 star rating,"Passed this spot while walking back to the brownstone I'm staying at and saw this guy holding a bowl full of big beautiful crab legs. I instantly went to Yelp lol. Saved it to view once out of the rain. Decided to eat dinner here tomorrow. First night in New York and I think I'm in love. Did the create of own fresh seafood boil. You take a bowl and pick your items YOURSELF. Jumbo Prawns, Scallops, Snow Crab Legs, Corn, Cabbage, and Brussel Sprouts in Old Bay and Garlic Butter. Also added a side of Mac N Cheese because the reviews highly suggested it. The peach cobbler was sold out. The wait was lengthy but it was crowded and you have to allow cooking time so no complaints there. The garlic butter is COOKED TO ORDER!!!! That alone speaks volumes. They have a sauce rack/area where you can fix your condiments to take with you so I took lemon juice, cajun seasoning, and hot sauce. The food was beautiful as she ladled the garlic butter on top. Once back inside I found the seasoning lacking a great bit for my liking so I added a good bit of Cajun seasoning and the hot sauce for spice. The prawns were over cooked and that made me very sad bcus of their price lol. But it's a risk when cooking it all together like that I know. The scallops were fine and the crab legs and corn were perfectly and fresh. The brussel sprouts were done and so was the cabbage. The Mac and cheese is definitely scratch made and you can tell. It's full of cheese and made just the way you love it from a good ole southern kitchen like my own lol. (Visiting from Alabama) I love the fact that you can pick your own seafood yourself and that it's steamed fresh. I just need more flavor and spice personally. Would definitely recommend and would definitely return to try more of the dishes I watch them prepare while waiting."
10/3/2021,5 star rating,"I ordered the loaded lobster fries online. The line to order in person can be very long. The loaded lobster fries are so good. The amount of lobster and shrimp you get is insane for the price. The only thing I wish they gave more of were actual fries. It wasn't an issue for me, I just made more fries at home to add to the batch. This is also a meal you can share. I normally eat a lot but it's definitely something I suggest sharing because it's a lot!"
11/12/2021,5 star rating,Everything is delishes ! Highly recommend Greens are especially good Also I went to the 2nd location near 116th.. cool hookah bar connected to it if you wanna sit down and eat maybe smoke some hookah and have some drinks
7/26/2021,5 star rating,"Video Review Here: vm.tiktok.com/ZMd7BN629I've been highlighting black owned NYC restaurants on my food vlog, and came across theinfatuation.com's list, where I found Lighthouse Fish Market. I'm officially a New Yorker, but a Maryland native at heart, which mostly means that I know and love good seafood. Maryland does seafood well! Here in NYC, I've had amazing seafood, ok seafood, and terrible seafood. It's always a toss up, and a risk, even. Today, when approaching Lighthouse, I just had a feeling. I had the feeling that they'd get it right....I walked in to find a line of people. Some of which, I could tell were regulars. They just had that ""I've been here before"" energy. It kinda excited me to see their excitement. I saw some of them walking out with their orders, which looked really good. I noticed that they only accept cash, so had to step out to go get some. Once I came back, I knew that I wanted a fish and shrimp and chips platter, but was unsure of which fish. I asked the cashier if she prefers the whiting or the catfish. She says she doesn't eat fish lol, but said that they're both quite popular. I went with the catfish, shrimp and chips. I placed my order, and waited maybe 20 minutes, which is fine. I saw them hand-battering the fish on sight, which honestly makes it worth the wait. When they're making your order fresh at these restaurants, it takes time. To me, it's totally worth it to have my food made to order. While I waited, I got a couple dipping containers, and loaded some with lemon juice, ketchup, hot sauce, and tarter sauce. Oh, yes....I was ready to go IN! Lol. So, I get my order, and I couldn't believe how much food it came with. It was huge! It was a big enough portion to feed at least 2 people. It cost me $20, which was amazing. I take my order to a bench nearby in Harlem, and I get down to business! People walked by and told me how good it looked lol. I was makin' the people hungry lol. I started eating the fish, and it was beyond fresh, crispy, and seasoned to PERFECTION! I wasn't expecting it, honestly. I mean, the flavors they developed were perfect. The same with the shrimp. Beyond crispy, fresh, and flavored nicely. Even the fries were nicely flavored. There's no extra salt necessary. They take care of that for you. I dipped the fish in the tarter sauce, and it was just perfection. I'm sorry that I haven't heard of this place sooner. It is extremely well done, black-owned, and produces some of New York's best seafood. My only minor critique would be cleanliness for the kitchen area. Otherwise, I had an amazing experience!"
5/29/2022,4 star rating,"First, I am going to state each time I visited both establishments the food has been excellent.  I truly applaud the owner for growing his business during these uncertain times we are living in.  However, I have a concern with why the establishment do not accept credit cards.  People come in to support this establishment but is required to utilize an ATM machine that charges $3 fee plus the bank fees.  We are living in times where people are using debit/credit cards.  Cash is rarely preferred due to safety concerns, etc.  Consideration to accept credit cards should be considered to improve the quality of service and it will show some care and concern from the owner."
7/23/2021,5 star rating,Harlem. Soulfood.Black Owned.Always Packed.Long Lines. Very Tasty & Flavorful.Order In Advance. I Will Always Support.
8/14/2018,4 star rating,Always Wanted To Come Here For Some Seafood.It Was Worth The Wait. The Food Very Flavorful. Tons Tasty Options. The Customer Line Was Out The Door. This Was Just A Monday Lol.  I Can Image What Fridays Look Like. Definitely Stopped On The Side Of The Road & Body My Whole Plate Of Food. Would Definitely Patronize This Restaurant.Good Job.
4/5/2021,2 star rating,"Food was good but the wait time is insane.  I ordered fish and chips,   I waited for more than one hour. You can not dine in, this is take out only.  I got in line, only to realize after standing in line for 15 minutes that there was a note on the cash register that says, accepting cash only....no debit or credit cards.  This sign should be placed on the door. By the time I saw this there was one person in front of me placing their order.  I got out the line, stepped outside to call my husband who ran a quick errand.  He had cash on him and brought it to me.  I got back in line and waited another ten minutes before I was next to place my order.  This place is super busy and the customers follow the mask rule, but they do not honor space requests at all because it's a bit difficult to do so due to spacing. I waited long enough to see employees openly arguing loudly in front of customers.  I was there long enough to see customers who had already waited over an hour argue with the staff because they were told there was a certain amount of an item available only to find that the product was prepared and given to someone else, requiring that they wait longer.  Overall the food was really good, fresh, chips nice and crunchy, and everything was seasoned appropriately BUT there are other restaurants where take out would be much quicker, with far less drama going on.   If we knew the wait would be this ridiculous we would have opted for an indoor dining experience at a sit down restaurant."
12/6/2021,1 star rating,Went to lighthouse Dec 6 2021 one of my favorite spots in Harlem for seafood WTF the dam food was way off. Told the cashier I wanted whiting and shrimp combo she got it mixed up with just the whiting and shrimp regular order. I ask her where are my frys she said you ask for the combo I said yes the combo come with fries. I was not charged from fries so no big deal I just give them $5 bucks for some fries. FYI their fries are seasoned fries  I hate seasoned fries the food have so much seasoned can I have a option to just get some dam regular fries smh that way us brown peeps have high blood pressure.  So back to the food the whiting and shrimp was horrible the fish was smelly I guess old fish the fish was so small tiny I have never seen such small whiting fish and it was greasy All the whiting was a nice size and shrimp was fried up nice. Well nit thus time my whole family could not eat this smelly small fish and shrimp! They owner of this spot is a smart and sharp dude you better step up your game you have a popping spot but if you keep your quality going down like this you will lose your customer base. You are better closing down then put out wack food ! Bye the way I did see some local Chinese lady delivered you a bag o whiting that day that shows you was not using your normal supply chain. Also I gohot some show crab legs $29 a pound that's crazy show crab legs was way to dam salty how do you make steam crab legs too salty and i had to tell the girl to chill on the butter. At the end of the day I was out $75 for food Me and my family could not eat. I'm usually get great food from lighthouse and they are black own so I try to support but the food I paid good money for was very very disappointing!!
9/28/2021,1 star rating,All i got to say is my friend bought me some food from here and i wish they could get they money back.. i aint lying .. flounder with mac and cheese .. nasty fish has no taste .. tastes like grease mac is 2/5 could use more seasoning
4/10/2022,2 star rating,I was in love this place but theres a new set of people working there and the service has been horrible ever since. I spent a while waiting on a Basa dinner and noticed that everyone else who came after was getting their order even though i had asked about mines. When i got my order it seemed as though my fish was refried from how soggy it was. I absolutely love lighthouses foods but today was disgusting. The fish was also a little on the salty side. Also the last time i went there the business was completely empty one night and staff were just conversing amongst themselves. It wasnt until i interrupted after some time to ask about prices that a skinny red hair girl came to assist me. Service is getting worst and worst but food is usually anazing but todays fish was the worst i ever had from there. Side note i only started eatting fish when i tasted light houses fish so today was very dissapointing.
9/16/2021,5 star rating,"This place goes absolutely NUTS. I'm new to the Harlem area and this is one of the three seafood places I've found nearby and ever since I've come here I haven't stopped coming. Definitely dangerous to live close by because I stay wanting to come here. I've only tried the catfish dinner and haven't been inclined to try anything else since it's so good but every time I come I see other orders ready and I'm tempted to try something new.  It can get (really) busy sometimes but I'd just say that's a good sign? I don't really mind a wait, especially considering they're open pretty late more than half the week (which is also dangerous for late night cravings......)."
10/6/2021,1 star rating,Terrible service and try to rip you off not explaining combos ... disappointed .
11/11/2020,5 star rating,"First time coming to this gem after wife was unable to cook. Upon looking at my food & taking in the aromas of the food I knew right away that I should have came to this Seafood spot a longtime ago. It's open late, they cook fresh food up until closing as there is high demand for the food here. Mike conveyed appreciation to his staff & customers while being swarmed with orders. Thank you for your attention & food quality.Much success to you on all your ventures. You have recipes, dedication, team & personality to win & expand successfully throughout NYC. The lovely young lady tonight was right when she said ""You have more than just real butter to brag about, tell him (me) about all the dishes you make."" No need to tell me anymore you've won me over as a customer with great food, good service & nice hospitality. I look forward to trying out more items on your menu as O proudly support an African American business."
8/6/2020,3 star rating,"Great food. Well prepared and a really good menu. However customer service is a problem. On my first visit here , I checked in on Yelp and I was given a 10% discount as a first time visitor. When I tried to use my coupon I was told that they don't honor Yelp coupons and that "" they just add us on that app! We don't do that stuff!"" Like WTH.. as a first time customer honoring that coupon that would have been the right thing to do. Instead the put their pockets over customer service and long term customer loyalty. It's sad because I support black owned businesses regularly. Unfortunately greed and petty business practices tend to ruin the integrity of many of them."
7/7/2020,4 star rating,"This little hotspot is something that you cannot miss! I was told by one of my roommates to go by this place because it was one of the best places in New York City! She continue to press me, until I had to make the run. This is a takeout joint you cannot call and you must go there and order your food. I had the opportunity of looking at the menu and the prices were great,  they were not too high and the full proportions were astounding! Now let me tell you anytime you can get someone to look at the quality of food or something that they don't normally eat, you know it is a homerun! Let's start with their homemade macaroni and cheese. Now a good cook can look at the macaroni and tell that it's seasonings,  you can see the crackling pepper and you could tell it is two types of cheese. They don't give you just a little bit cheese, oh no child that macaroni makes you want to slap yo mama! I cannot tell you enough on how good the food was and I am just getting started. Next,  I tried their homemade candy yams. Now you know that everybody cannot make good candy yams, these were caramelized candied yams with cinnamon and nutmeg you could taste the sugar.Next let's go to this golden fried crispy flaky hot and tender fish (ooh child), if this food was not good.We cannot stop until we talk about the butterfly fried shrimp. I am talking about the kind when you don't need tartar sauce nor cocktail sauce. The food was seasoned to perfection! Anytime my friends say we have got to go back there again, I'm ready. I wanted to just try the steamed broiled food because the other food just couldn't be that good. Now all of you know I love food, but I must say this has got to be one of the best soul food take out joints in New York City. Come to think of it, I don't believe I have ever tasted food as great as this for takeout ever! I am telling you If you ever come to New York, you cannot miss this spot. Updated message, I had a chance to go back a second time the same day and there was at least an hour wait for your food and the customer service was not as friendly as the daytime which brings them down a star.Also, if you have a coupon from Yelp, and the manager is not there, they will not honor it! I called to notify management but did not receive a response."

Come to think of it, I don't believe I have ever tasted fold as great as this for takeout ever! I am telling you if you ever come to New York, you cannot miss this spot. If it's a long line where your mask do your social distancing but you have got to come and try this food!Wait a minute I forgot one more thing. They had a punch that made you remember old fashion Kool-Aid. Now I don't know if many of you know anything about a good Kool-Aid but when I tried the tropical punch with pineapples in it was so good!"
11/1/2020,1 star rating,"I've lived in Harlem for years and always heard the hype about Lighthouse. So on a Halloween night after a long day of celebration me and my boyfriend decided to check it out. When we got there the inside was super packed with about 20+ people, it was so packed that we had to wait outside but I didn't mind it at all. We finally get in and was hit with a heavenly aroma so we were excited to place our order. We ordered the lobster tail stuffed with crab meat with macaroni and cheese & garlic mashed potatoes and the Herb salmon dinner with macaroni and cheese  and collard greens. After waiting about 45 minutes for our food to cook we excitedly left and went home to try it. My boyfriend loved the herb salmon and the sides although the salmon was dry. But when I got to my lobster tail I noticed a slight ammonia smell but the crab meat and sides I had go with it over powered the smell so I dug in. The stuffing was delicious but when I bit into the lobster tail it had a strong vinegar taste and reeked of ammonia, thinking I was crazy I took another bit and it was absolutely horrible. I was very disappointed, I was finally looking forward to trying this place out only to be served with a spoiled lobster tail. I paid $45 for this meal and it annoyed me that I wasted my money on this. I would've went back if it wasn't so late and far away from where I was at. Another annoying aspect about this place is that they do not accept cards, apple pay or Samsung pay you must have cash.I'm giving this review 1 star because the sides were good."
6/25/2021,3 star rating,This was not the original location and when I come from Atlanta I always want Lighthouse Fish. I was so disappointed... the fish had absolutely no taste lack of seasoning on the fish as well as Mac and cheese. The greens were ok.  The staff working in there was so dry and lacked any form of customer service Lordy. The location by Target is a no bueno please go to the other location in Harlem. It is DEFINITELY worth it (they get 5 stars)
4/6/2020,2 star rating,"As I write this. I'm trying to be lenient as we are in unprecedented times but I was not satisfied with my visit to lighthouse today, especially for the prices that they charge. There was supposed to be a limit of 7 people in their small space at a time. They finally abided by it after we reached about 10 people inside for the second or third time. My steamed food was underseasoned, I received the wrong side - an odd tricolored macaroni salad at that - and they would've forgotten my banana pudding had I not reminded them again when I was finally able to grab my order, 30 minutes after ordering. I've been here a number of time so the disorder while ordering and waiting isn't new but the food used to make up for it. Now, that's not the case. Oh, and to add to the disappointment, they were cash only today."
3/31/2019,3 star rating,"Here are some things you should know before you go... it's virtually a box inside. Don't come in here thinking you could move around and what not because when that line gets long (which it often does), you're pretty much stuck. You will also wait an eternity for your food, so please have some time on your hands. Lastly, I'm pretty sure they just either cook the fried seafood and chicken in the same grease or they don't change the seasoning for it because they all taste the same. Nonetheless, the food at Lighthouse is really good for the most part but for the wait and the prices... there are about five other places I can think of off hand in the area that you can go to and get close to the same things that they offer. Having said that, I love their Mac and cheese and collard greens a lot. Do I love it enough to waste at least 40 minutes of my life when I go there? Nah"
6/13/2021,1 star rating,Food is to salty... please ease up on the salt  when I first came here the food was so good now it's like they are dropping the whole jar of salt in it
8/29/2020,3 star rating,"I had the fried fish and shrimp with a side order of macaroni and cheese.the food was so so the wait time was out of this world there's no reason to take over an hour to fry fish I gave them a 3 because the people who worked there were extremely nice, though no one kept their mask on there was no social distancing in this store what so ever there are these giant containers of what I'm going to call Kool aid and everyone helped themselves once you paid for the bottle would I go back no but it was an experience"
2/4/2020,3 star rating,"The food is decent, yet overly priced. The place was filled  with people. Ignoring just how dirty the place was. Dirty pans, food that looked like It's been left out for days. The oil that they fried maybe 95 percent of the food was black as tar. Oh how we want our small businesses  To do well. Yet, the service sucked! The cleanliness was horrible. This is truly sad! The wait was horrible and the cashier was coughing over the food! Never again even with the yelp discount !"
3/20/2021,1 star rating,"What if during Covid there was a magical place where nobody seemed to care. Where people could cram into a tiny space, shoulder to shoulder, and wait inside for your food. Or maybe you can sit in your double parked car waiting for 40 minutes or more. Don't worry aboit traffic. Nobody does here. It's all good. Just go on in and join the crowd. Yell your number. Maybe someone will notice you. Well friends, there is such a place. Lighthouse. The street is constantly filled with their patrons, flocking to place an order the only way you can - in person. That's right. They believe so much in safety and convenience, that they just want to give you that extra personal touch of being shoulder to shoulder, and bumper to bumper , with as many people as humanly possible. Could they choose to take orders by phone? Sure. Delivery or internet orders? Of course. But in these extra vigilant times of Covid, they choose to put human contact first by giving you no other choice. People are so happy and excited about this method that cars are double and triple parked literally for blocks, causing massive traffic and parking backups, lively arguments, and jovial honking at all hours of the night. They bring so much energy to the neighborhood.Thank you light house, for putting your boutique ordering experience of walk ins only, ahead of needless safety measures and care of your neighborhood. We have all come to be very familiar with it, until 2 AM. Just follow the incessant honking horns and yelling."
5/28/2021,2 star rating,"Food is crazy salty . Salty to the point where you can't enjoy it . Quality of the food is crappy. Younger Woman who takes orders is rude , when I asked her questions about the menu she acted as if it was a pain to answer & her facial expressions confirmed that too . In short she wasn't helpful and had a crappy Demeanor. When you put staff out front to help customers they should at least be helpful. I live in the neighborhood and there are way better spots with tasty food and pleasant staff. You don't have to be friendly but you shouldn't be rude . Better off spending your money elsewhere especially if you like quality food."
6/27/2020,4 star rating,**** updated review****I've give this place more chances and the food is tasty and consistent. The chefs there so friendly and really know what they are doing. Old review: This used to be a great place until the other day when I ordered shrimp with rice and found a HUGE piece of glass in my food. It was buried under the rice so when I took a bite it felt like I was eating ice. I was so taken back because I would never expect something like this to happen at a good place like this. I would've taken it back to address the issue but it was already after 11:30pm and too late. This ruined my experience here forever.

6/16/2019,5 star rating,"Freshest fish spot in Harlem. Guest that ate the catfish, shrimp, macaroni and collards raves about it being the best they've had.  Fish is very flaky and lightly breaded and they loved the tarter sauce!!!"
11/29/2019,4 star rating,Stop back in again for another deep fried Salmon dish. The sides are pricey.. $5 for a side of rice??? I went and got a quart of rice for $2.95 at the restaurant across the street. Other than that... My fish was amazing once again.
10/19/2019,4 star rating,"BEWARE! This spot is super packed. The line is very long. The location is pretty small, and you can not sit to eat in here. Despite those facts, this is a refreshingly great tasting spot. You can walk in and pick your fish for your platter of choice. You have the option steamed, grilled, or deep-fried.  I have never had a pure deep-fried salmon before. This location does it very tasty and flavorful. They season the salmon well and drop it right in the deep fryer. It comes out crispy and juicy in the middle. You choose your sides and let the cooks do their thing. Now you wait on the line or in your car until its ready. You could be waiting for 15-40mins but, it's worth the wait."
6/11/2020,1 star rating,"Waited almost an hour for fried shrimp and flounder. The prices on the menu board do not match what they charge. I was told that they had not change the prices on the board so I paid more than was listed.Cash only,After you pay, there is no cash refund, only exchange or store credit.In the era of social distancing and COVID-19, the sign on outside on their window says NO MASK NO SERVICE. There were customers in there without masks, breathing on everything in the restaurant.Also, there were a sign outside the door  indicating that due to HEALTH REGULATIONS LAW no more than 7 people were allowed in at a time And there were definitely  more than seven people in there ( some without masks)."
6/14/2020,2 star rating,"Giving this place three stars, because the customer service isn't all that great. This is a small fish market/ restaurant all in one. Very busy place, you have people coming in out, horrible wait. However, they have fresh seafood, prices are very reasonable and you get a lot of food for the price."
4/9/2021,1 star rating,"This is my second time visiting and I'd love to give this place a higher rating because the seafood is so fresh and well seasoned--I truly love it! However!! From an operational standpoint, Lighthouse is severely underperforming.....First, there is no number to call! You can not reach anyone at this establishment. By cutting corners, this restaurant offers an extreme disservice to their loyal patrons. For example, somewhere on this post the business owner stated, ""there is a new location on 117th"" and they are now accepting credit cards. However, the hours of operation is not listed on the website and there is no way of finding out prior. I took the chance and drove to the new location but it was closed!  I would suggest updating the info on GOOGLE, the website, anything!So, because I really wanted the food I traveled to the other location which is notorious for the ridiculously extensive wait lines. I was definitely disgruntled at this point.  Secondly, I understand that this location is busy but steps MUST be taken to keep the area behind the counter clean! Whilst waiting on line, through the window I saw cooked macaroni squished all over the floor, and used tissue paper, it was disgusting to see and just further add the experience unpleasant.In all as much as I love this food, I do believe this will be my last time visiting this restaurant."
7/25/2021,2 star rating,"The food here is delicious. I'm not gonna lie, but just to get the food is way too complicated. You cannot order over the phone, they do not offer Uber Eats or Grubhub or anything similar, you must walk in and wait on a ridiculous long line just to order your food. Then you have to wait about an hour for your food to be made. I really enjoy the food, so much but everytime I think of eating it I just get discouraged. It shouldn't be so complicated to just get some food."
4/15/2020,1 star rating,"ABOUT: Last night! I decided to walk all the way to this place since I read some mixed reviews on #Yelp. It says it closes at midnight. I got there 15 minutes before. There were a few people in there.I walked in and stood on line. 5 minutes of waiting to place an order, a guy comes from the back and says ""Did you order?"" I said no. He than says ""We not taking anymore orders we closing. It was 10 min before they were to close. I was pissed, I wasted my time walking 15 blocks and waiting 5 min to order, which I could have if the woman behind the counter taking orders wasn't having a personal conversation with the customer in front of me.I will never go to this establishment again. I have zero tolerance for businesses that treat customers this way. They could have taken my order and it would have still been before they closed. I should have listened to the poor reviews and avoided this place, but I learned the hard way."

I'll only eat chicken, no red meat, fish, goat, etc. just chicken.) I give this disclaimer because I've been doing good at being healthy and it's been a LONG while since I had a ""heavy"" meal. Now, I had this meal y'all. Me and my aunts friend went to this place after finding it on Yelp. It was open until midnight, the reviews were good , there was a 10% discount coupon, so we thought whyyyy not? Off rip the place is kind of small but they had a lot to offer and it got the job done*. What most don't know is that you DONT NECESSARILY have to purchase the meal options on the board. You can certainly go into that glass room and pick out your seafood and other veggie assortments. The room isn't just there for the crew but everyone.My A.F (aunts friend) had a tiny fit when she realized she could get the veggies she wanted after all. The problem with the store being small is that it gets packed easy. And with everyone wanting to wait inside, because they walked and not drive or (I'll touch on this later) they didn't want to miss there number being called so....you know how that goes. We was gon' wait! The system they have in the 'kitchen' is flawed as, tickets can easily slip from where there sticking it, and I've personally witness someone say that they've been waiting for a while for their food and neither the person or the kitchen had the ticket but the food was ready.   To also add, it does take a while for the food to be ready.*takes breathe* As for the food itself:I ordered the garlic butter wings with fries and Mac and cheese (*hides face*) And boy were the wings good. It was crispy and delicious but I shouldn't have gotten them with garlic butter because baby that BUTTER WAS REAL BUTTER or something, it had me immediately feeling like an asthmatic, unhealthy, clogged [which I believe happened as fast as it did because I hadn't eaten that ""heavy"" in a long while]. But the crispyness of the wings beautiful. If you want wings get them naked or try another sauce. The Mac and cheese was alright: thick, very cheese. And the fries were fries. My A.F. Ordered broccoli, carrots, potatoes steamed all together and Flavored in garlic butter (y'all the butter again), with another order of herb salmon, collard greens and yams. We're a sharing family so we all tasted the plate and can I say I did not enjoy 1) the BUTTER (but the veggies were good), 2) how salty the greens were (but the texture was good, and 3) T H E.  B U T T E R. [its too much and it instantly made me and everyone fall asleep after eating]Lastly, the passion fruit and mango juices are good but they need to be diluted a little because it tasted like straight concentrate and sugar. Overall, I think the Lighthouse was a good stop to make, but with the wait and the food choices I made. I'll come back at a later time. For some dry wings or steamed veggies (because growth) lol.Be blessed y'all"

5/9/2020,2 star rating,"Got ON LINE at the restaurant at 5pm. Didn't get to place my order until 5:30. Waited outside until 6:57 for some half assed Catfish, weak Collards and some dry Shrimp. They even left out a side order on each of my orders. Wasn't worth the trip from Westchester County. And they didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for the delay...Don't think we'll be back. Smh."

11/15/2020,2 star rating,"Light house has amazing food and drinks. I cannot deny that. However, I think as business owners there should be a decision made to expand. The location is to small to accommodate the high demand. This has lead to people waiting online for several hours after their money had been taken. Let's not forget the ""NO REFUNDS""  sign largely stamped at the front desk. This practice is unethical and unfair to the patrons who want to take their business else where instead of waiting online for hours on end.  My 2 star rating is more so do to lack of consideration and greed of the business. There are toooooomany vacant store fronts in Harlem to continue to treat people with such disregard."

12/4/2020,2 star rating,"Giving this a two specifically because two of the workers did not have their masks on and one had it beneath his nose. Another girl had on a face shield with no mask. If you're going to be open during a pandemic, you need to make sure you're following all regulations. This is not the time to be doing what you want. I didn't even bother giving my order."
7/26/2021,3 star rating,"I was referred to this place by a lady I met at House of Seafood. She said it was her favorite fish spot in Harlem so I had to check it out. On my first visit they were closed due to an inspection so I ordered from outside. The cashier didn't really tell me what they were known for so I ordered fried whiting and catfish, mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, coleslaw and cabbage. While waiting outside for about 15 minutes another lady walked up and told me that the garlic shrimp linguine was the bomb. When I got home everything was good except the cabbage and coleslaw. They were really bland and almost looked the same dish. I hated the coleslaw so much I tossed it. Those recipes need to change.       Despite that about a week later I ordered the shrimp linguine with garlic butter for $18 (really?) the honey bbq wings which came with a side of yams and collard greens. Everything was nicely seasoned but honestly I felt the pasta dish was overpriced. It was a lot of pasta and about 8 pieces of shrimp although it was tasty. Also the 25-minute wait was a bit of a turn off especially if you are not driving because the area is not one you want to be hanging out in too long. I set my phone timer and walked to nearby 125th street to do some window shopping to pass the time.    That being said the cooks and servers seem really talented and hardworking as I saw them whip up some amazing steamed seafood dinners. I think they would do really well if they cut the wait time to 15 minutes max and kept their prices competitive. There is an Asian market closer to my Harlem home where I can get 2 pieces of steam salmon and mixed vegetables for about $10 less. However I might revisit this place if I want to impress out of town guests or was throwing a party because their portions are generous and food has a soul food flair."
1/25/2020,1 star rating,"Food took over an hour. employees were fraternizing with each other bad customer service, waiting an hour for two dinners, that should have taken 15 minutes to process.when I called before I got there the receptionist said just come in and order because it's going to take 10 to 15 minutes. when I got there it took over an hour for my food I didn't even leave with my food. I ended up canceling because it was going on an hour and 30 minutes. no information on my order, I was just skipped over and given attitude every-time I asked about my order.When a refund was ask for I was told to wait two more minutes for the food, that I was waiting for an hour already. cashier gave a very bad attitude she was very rude and very disrespectful I would not order from here ever again"
5/12/2018,5 star rating,"Small spot. Not the type to order in. Order to go. It has a very southern and Harlem touch and atmosphere. It's a small place, so again, you want to order and then go. I doubt that you can call in an order to pick up. It's quite a very popular spot amongst celebrities and the likes. Parking is a pain. I think I circled around like 4 times or more before I found a place to park. If you're rolling with a friend or two, it's best to drop off the person and have them order, while you place the order, etc. All meals are cooked right in front of you."
3/19/2021,1 star rating,Don't fucking waste your time here you'll wait for 45 minutes and watch your food be dropped and put back into the same plate. The bitch really tried to serve me my food after she dropped it. I waited for one hour and she wanted me to wait again. Fuck this place. Waste of time and money
4/24/2021,3 star rating,food was really good! but the wait was honestly so horrible. i went on my hour lunch while at work.... the food took an hour and a half to make. all i ordered was shrimp and mac and cheese... only go here if you have 2 hours to wait around for food. don't go if you're hungry!
12/29/2018,4 star rating,"Came here on a Friday night after hearing rave reviews from friends. They did warn me that the Wait was long but worth it. I got the loaded lobster fries and the seafood paella. The paella was everything, I got it with jerk seasoning and garlic butter. Brought it to a gathering with friends and it was a hit. I didn't even get much of the fries since my friends devoured it as soon as I got to the door. The staff was super sweet and helped with the wait. I knew the Wait was long and the place was packed but the staff and other people waiting helped the time go by. Will definitely come back here if I dont have somewhere to go immediately afterwords."
9/2/2019,3 star rating,"Warning: Long post. I was traveling to NYC for labor day weekend and I really had a craving for fried shrimp. Thus, I wanted to stop by Lighthouse on Saturday. I wanted to place an order in advance, but when I called the restaurant twice as I was walking there, no one from the restaurant picked up the phone. I thought ""Maybe it is busy in there."" And indeed, the line was long and the staff were preparing bags behind the counter.  When I waited on line and my order was ready to be taken, I noticed 4 colorful drink containers to the right of me. I asked the cashier, an African woman, what the drinks are. She told me the flavor of each drink and when I proceeded to ask my friend on the phone what drinks she wanted, the cashier immediately asked me to move to the side of the counter and off the line so that she could take the next person's order. I felt very disrespected because I didn't know the flavors of the drinks and since they weren't on the menu and I needed time to ask my friend what she wanted. Now, this is where the story gets worse. I make my order for mussels with linguine and Alfredo sauce, 2 fried shrimp with mac and cheese and yams dinners, and 1 order of whiting fish with french fries and fried shrimp. I waited 10 minutes for my food to be done, which was fine. A female staff member called my ticket number and verified that the food matched with the list of foods on my receipt/ticket. Here's the REAL problem: I was so stressed from the African cashier at the front being rude to me, that I wanted to grab my food and leave right away. Thus, the lady behind the counter handed me 1 bag of food and i left. When I got into my Uber and checked my bags of food ordered, I noticed the linguine with Alfredo sauce and mussels was MISSING! I  had the 2 fried shrimp dinners and whiting fish with french fries and fried shrimp, but no mussels and pasta! Thus, I immediately asked my Uber driver to drive back to the restaurant so I could retrieve the last item I ordered which was the mussels and pasta.When I arrived at the restaurant, a male staff member behind the counter saw me and said ""You left your pasta."" I immediately corrected him and stated ""No I did not leave it. That female associate only gave me 1 bag of food and did not think to give me the pasta. It's her fault, not mine."" So the female associate who forgot to hand me the mussels and pasta starts whispering to one of her colleagues as I'm looking at her. And I felt very, very offended.Overall, I was able to have all my orders completed and handed to me. However, I'm not sure I'll go back to Lighthouse given the poor customer service. If I'm paying $80 for 4 dinner orders, I expect to be given the decency and respect I believe I should get because I am investing in the company by eating their food.   But for some reason, Lighthouse is  not as light as it use to be to me. The staff are too abrasive towards customers and need to take some ""Happy"" classes."
7/6/2019,3 star rating,"The food here is very good, which explains their cult following.  HOWEVER, the wait time is obscene (at least an hour)!I love seafood but I really don't have a high tolerance for waiting around at a to-go establishment for an hour.  That's beyond too long and it was hot outside, soooooo you can only imagine the internal inferno that was experienced during this wait.It's also important to know that they have about 3 different systems in place to pickup your order (white ticket, blue ticket and lighthouse ticket).  This correlates to the steam food, fried food and the cooked dinners. I was BEYOND confused as I couldn't keep up but one of the staff members explained it to me.... The likelihood of me returning is minimal, especially at their price points, as I could've went to a sitdown establishment."
9/13/2020,4 star rating,"I have a love and hate relationship with this place.  The food is da bomb! Their food is cooked well! Seasoned well, tastes like some good home cooked soithern food. They also have great juices to try from that are good as well. HOWEVER their service has to change. Their should be no reason why it takes TWO hours to get your food. I'm sorry. They need to come up with a better system or food service line where someone is in charge of cooking this etc. There's no system or routine at all. And the staff memebwes are just confused. The new manager that's a lady doesn't help at all. She just stands there. It's not until the guy manager comes that things run a bit smoother. If you plan on coming here be the first one when they open their doors or plan to spend HALF of your day here. Don't make any early plans if you plan to come and get food here. Overall the food is great but is it worth the wait???!! I'll let you decide for yourself !"
8/7/2020,2 star rating,My biggest problem with Lighthouse is there customer service. It's absolutely horrible!!! I want to support my local businesses but i can't do it any longer. I place my order and the woman tells me it should be ready in 20mins. I wait 25-30 mins my number was never called. It was pretty crowded so i didn't make a fuss. Another 10 mins go by. I ask the security guard if he could check. He returns telling me 20mins . Turns out they give my order to another customer. No apology  or sense of urgency; not even an acknowledgment for the inconvenience (waiting an hour for lobster fries). This is a continued pattered with LightHouse.
9/20/2020,1 star rating,I've been wanting to try this place for the longest. I don't even understand the hype. I ordered fish and chips and fried shrimp. The fish was oily and it tasted old. The shrimp was the same thing. The price is good if you're gonna get fresh seafood the wait was 20 mins. The food just isn't worth it maybe if you're getting seafood pans or pasta but the fried fish and shrimp ain't it.
12/27/2019,4 star rating,"I'm not even finished with my food and Im writing a review  I traveled all the way from Queens and I'm definitely not disappointed!! 15-25 wait (which it totally acceptable for seafood... maybe you can call in to pick up, not sure) I ordered salmon with shrimp and pasta with garlic butter sauce. The blue lemonade drink is a little too sweet for my liking. Still super yummy!!! Gotta come back!"
6/11/2019,4 star rating,"I love their food, especially their loaded lobster fries. The only thing I hate about this place is waiting so long for your food. The staff could be a little more friendly. Smile a little. Lol. But other than that, the food is good."
10/3/2018,5 star rating,"Everything is so so so good here and so fresh. I usually get the crab legs, which are great classic crab legs. The lobster fries are also amazing, but I'd recommend getting them earlier In the day when the lobster sauce is freshly made. They kind of just have the lobster sauce on simmer over a fire all day. The shrimp is solidly good. The sauces they have are amazing. Overall 9/10 food experience. If you live in Harlem and like seafood this is it!"
8/4/2019,4 star rating,Warning TAKEOUT ONLY: I'm so glad that I got to experience this one. We came a little before the dinner rush and we were very pleased. Pick your entree or fresh seafood and the prepare it right then and there in front of you. Do you like lobster? If so please try those delicious lobster fries. Geezus Krice we were stuffed and were not able to finish. The wings were ok but a little wet for my taste. We definitely plan on visiting this place again on our next trip to Harlem. It was a soulful seafood experience that I really appreciate. Will be back!
6/16/2019,5 star rating,MOUTH WATERING FRESH SEAFOOD!!They have a huge menu so you have plenty of options. Seasoned sooooo good LIKE IF YOU DIED AND WENT TO A RESTAURANT IN HEAVEN FOR SEAFOOD...THIS WOULD BE IT!Expect to pay at least $20 for a decent meal.This is a dive type restaurant.. not recommended for eating in.
7/21/2018,4 star rating,"First time here and it was Divine!!!! I always hear the commercials and  figured I'd stop by while in the area. So there's 2 sections of the restaurant. One is a prefix menu and the other portion, you select what you want, pay by the pound and tell them how you would like it cooked. I ordered a salmon filet, corn, red potatoes, onions, shrimp, and broccoli for approximately $25-30. I read the reviews of the butter garlic so i asked the staff to only had on 1 big spoon of garlic butter and i added a bit more seasoning. I gave it 4 stars because i did find a strand of hair. This is strictly a take out spot."
9/9/2019,3 star rating,"9-9-2019: So I checked in to this place where a friend from Yelp advised me to stay away from the fried foods..Lord was she right about that, I ordered fried flounder & shrimps which was extremely bland..I must agree, the fried fish/shrimp weren't good at all..On a GOOD NOTE I also did order Butter and Garlic Shrimp w. Linguini, Mac & Cheese,hot wings and steamed crab legs which I must say was pretty good..You guys redeemed yourselves on this..Simply I would stay away from the fried food and stick to the streamed dishes..."
7/19/2015,4 star rating,"I found Lighthouse on Yelp and was glad it was so nearby. I was hungry. Seems like a fairly new business, still getting their flow in order. The staff was friendly and the top chef has an outgoing personality as he is confident you will love his food! Made the visit fun. I had the Fish/Shrimp combo with Mac & Cheese and Greens then a slice of Red Velvet Cake.  I enjoyed it all. concerns: my fish could've been fried a lil harder (guess I can simply request that next time) and the Mac recipe may need a revamping (more cheese & flavor) Will I return? Yep. There's plenty more on their menu I wanna try. oh and that cake. Delish"
8/24/2020,4 star rating,Delicious good but the wait was over an hour on a Friday night but trust delicious catfish and shrimp the passion juice was good just tasted too sweet but looking fwd to go back

2/9/2019,5 star rating,"The food at light house is good. Sometimes certain dishes can be a hit or miss situation. There is always a line in here, but the food is worth the wait.One thing I dislike is that they don't always answer the phone, so it's difficult to do a call ahead order. There have been moments where I was ""successful"" in placing a call ahead order BUT I arrive to light house and I STILL had to wait so it really defeated the purpose."
3/5/2019,4 star rating,"The only thing I ever have gotten from here is the lobster fries, and I have never been disappointed. There are substantial amount of lobster and it's all saucy and goodness. The flavor is very good too! Obviously I'm in love with them. If you ever looking for lobster fries, this is definitely the place for them!"
6/5/2018,4 star rating,"Perfect place for all of your seafood cravings. They have a wide range of menu items and none of them have failed me yet. From the seafood to the chicken wings, everything is spot on every time. I can't wait to try the 24K wings. (If you try them before I do, let me know how they are). The sautéed shrimp over rice with garlic butter is my favorite dish. Everything has FLAVOR which can be lacking from some steamed seafood places. The portions are ample enough to save some for lunch the day day and that's always a win! The wait can be a little long at times because they're so popular, but it's definitely worth it.  Last, but definitely not least, they are CLEAN which is super important when dealing with raw seafood."
1/24/2019,3 star rating,"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. On one hand, the food is really good and they have a wide range of items to choose from. Fish, shrimp, crabs, lobster, chicken... with rice, noodles and/or vegetables... sautéed, broiled, steamed, fried... with garlic butter sauce, scampi, marinara, jerk... the list goes on and on. My issue is that it's always an extreme wait time, no matter when you go. Of course they're crowded on the weekends (Thurs-Sun), so that's understandable. But even during the week on a random day, at a random time, the wait can be dreadful. Then there have also been instances (numerous) where they have gotten my order wrong. AND ever so often, they'll stop taking debit/credit. Like I said, the food is really, really good but they have some work to do in other areas. I often have to take a break from going there, out of frustration. But the food is excellent."
7/15/2019,5 star rating,"Service was pretty good for a Monday not too long maybe waited about 30-35 minutes I got fried shrimp,fried fish,candy yams and Mac and cheese! Everything was delicious my only complaint was 4 pieces of fish but only 5 pieces of shrimp lol I guess I just really liked the shrimp so next time I'll only order the shrimp dinner combo"
3/4/2017,5 star rating,"Heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to drive from Long Island to Harlem to see what the hype was all about. Let's say, it was worth the drive out there! I heard that the lobster fries with wings were very good and decided to order that. Yes, it does get pretty crowded and you will wait a good 15-20 mins to get your food, but it was worth the wait. Too delicious! Will come back again . So happy to find a place that serves delicious seafood. Don't have to travel to only City Island for deliciousness"
1/30/2020,5 star rating,Love this place. It's so popular we had to wait nearly hour and half for our food. It was worth it . We order seafood and wings along with dessert. Don't forget there's signature drink. Thumbs up from us.
6/20/2019,3 star rating,Didn't enjoy the fried fish and shrimp. I went back to try the shrimp Alfredo and it was great.
7/25/2017,4 star rating,"The light house is a small seafood spot in Harlem. This a fairly new business, about a year old. Not only is it a restaurant but they also a seafood market where you can purchase all kinds of shrimp,fish, lobster and crab.The food here is very good. I got the fish and shrimp dinner. For $18 you get a very generous portion of fish, about 5-6 medium size shrimp and two sides. The fish and shrimp were seasoned perfectly. They Had a Cajun flavor to them but not too salty. For my sides I chose the seasoned fries and the collard greens. The fries seem to be hand cut and are nothing like the freezer fries you get at most fish spots. The collard greens were decent but not great. They were cooked perfectly and were flavorful but they were more vinegary than I prefer. While here I noticed they offer seafood linguini and also steamed and broiled seafood. All of these items looked excellent! I wanted to try it all. I can tell they have some high level cooks in there that really know how to chef up some seafood. Tip: don't bother coming here to dine in. Grab your food and get the hell out of the way. This place is crowded!Light House earns 4 stars from me. The food I tasted was delicious and the serving was more than filling. They can certainly improve in the ordering process and how they manage the line. It was like a free for all with people trying to get the attention of the person taking the order. I judge then too much about that because the place was very crowded and they did get the food out fast. I will certainly be back to try the linguini amount other menu items and could see myself comeback often for a quick seafood fix."
8/29/2018,4 star rating,"It's hard to justify giving them any less than four stars even though our order took about an hour to push out. And that's with my number being skipped AND the argument between two coworkers behind the counter which caused one of the workers to walk away from packing my food and another taking over. By then, I just wanted to leave..but with my food. I ordered the catfish strips, mac and cheese, and yams. Everything was good, especially the catfish. I looked over at the fish market while waiting for my order to cook and felt reassured that my fish was fresh. And if you come here, also order the mango drink (my gawd)."
6/29/2020,4 star rating,Honestly.... they need to expand. YHE ABSOLUTE BEST SEAFOOD MAC IVE HAD FROM A PROFESSIONAL ESTABLISHMENT..... but they've gotta get more organized. Expect a long wait esp during covid like an hour +.... they'd get 5Star if they could organize better and allow uber eats/DoorDash but as far as quality n taste.... unmatched. I  literally go to Harlem Just for the seafood Mac.
2/21/2020,4 star rating,Food is good I drive 30 minutes everytime I come here so it's safe to say I really like the taste of the food here only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the wait time and waiting area wish this place would expand or add more seating if you've ever been here you'll see cars lined up outside all waiting for there food
4/10/2017,2 star rating,"I wanted to love this place, but!. First off it wasn't to crowded for a Saturday night but I was definitely prepared. We ordered our food I got the seafood platter babe got a fish dinner. My seafood platter was ready I'm about 20 minutes fish dinner took another 25 minutes..The food wasn't sitting anywhere where it could have stayed warm just sitting out so my seafood was on the warm side not hot by the time I got home.. Anyway after cleaning up the mess from the poorly wrapped food in car I finally get home to enjoy my food and first bite into my lobster tail I was turned off.. It was so salty.. Way to salty to enjoy.. Which was very dissappointing to say the very least.  I really wanted to like to like this place but I cannot sacrifice my health earing here again."
10/5/2016,5 star rating,I had been jilted by lighthouse before but I am so glad I kept coming back. They've changed their cooks and their staff and Michael always makes sure his customers leave with a smile on their face. Their menu has expanded and the new chefs seem to know what they're doing because the food is amazing. I definitely recommend. Side note: I know this is a seafood spot but their wings are probably one of the best I've ever had (try it with their special 5pc w chips for $6)
5/21/2015,2 star rating,"When I first started coming here, I loved it. The guys working there were very nice and really seemed to love what they do. They knew the menu well and always had great suggestions. But they started hiring new people who would leave my food a little raw and in one occasion causing a few stomach aches around the house and in a house with a Crohn's patient, that's a no-no!But we're masochists and we went again. This time no one got sick but the food didn't taste like anything. Now the third strike was this week there I tried to order a salmon dinner with two sides and they said I had to take a vegetable side after having to help her understand that I wanted two different sides and not just two of the same, I decided on a regular side (Mac and cheese) and the potatoes. The lady at the register told me that potatoes aren't vegetables because they had to be cooked. Which made no sense so I changed my order to a Patrick Ewing, because who has time to argue about vegetables? I waited 48 minutes for some fried fish and fries. Sadly I will not be coming here again, I would rather just walk to another fish market or trek it to city Island until they get their stuff together."
2/22/2020,4 star rating,"Food is always good. However, they never answer their phones. Customer service is lacking some."
3/14/2020,2 star rating,The reason for the 2 stars is because of the wait I waited for almost 2 hours for my food and they were only taking cash. I got the lobster fries and shrimp. I saw people who order way after me get their food before me. I don't know how they decide which meal they're going to do first but they needs better system. Also the food was good.
10/31/2019,4 star rating,"Food here is the bomb!!!!! The wait is horrendous. I wish there was a system in place to pre order. Sometimes when you get there, the place is so full (it's small) and you wait for 25 minutes for your food."

6/13/2016,2 star rating,Disappointed to say the least.1. Thought it was a sit in after viewing the Instagram page for months and drooling at the food but it was only a fish market where you can order food to go.2.One of the employees got fired in front of all the customers.If i were to ever step foot back in here i guess i would do the option where they pick the seafood and then cook it.This review is based on a visit in 2015.
12/31/2018,5 star rating,"I absolutely LOVE Lighthouse. I get the same thing all the time, but it always taste even better than the last. The only con is that the place is really small so the wait is very LONG. The last time I was there was Christmas Eve and spent about an hour and a half waiting. There is no seating area, so you kind of just stand around until your food is done. In the summer, I usually wait outside. It's still definitely worth it. I get the BBQ Shrimp with mac & cheese and yams."
5/11/2020,5 star rating,Wait is unpredictable but the food is phenomenal. The lobster fries ARE out of this world! My favorite late night go to spot. Have even referred a few people here and they are hooked! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the staff is very professional. Definitely a gem in Harlem!
2/2/2020,2 star rating,"The female cashier was rude for no reason. The service is terrible. Placed my order at 4:16pm and my order is still not done @ 4::45pm I was informed to wait another 15 minutes. This will be almost an hour before my food is ready. Only ordered two fish and shrimps dinner. I'm sorry but, black people we go for anything. This makes absolutely no sense. My first and LAST!!!!!!! Time coming here. I will continue to support black owned businesses just not this one!"
11/10/2020,1 star rating,Please do not waste your time or money on this place. The unnecessary wait time is ridiculous. The food is just blah. You can cook better food yourself
12/7/2019,2 star rating,"Many people in my circle was ranting and raving about the flavors of Lighthouse. I even asked for recommendations on what to order and was told the fried shrimp dish was the best option. Upon entering the cashier wasn't friendly, but I continued to order and I should of used that as a sign. I ordered fried shrimp, garlic mash, lobster Mac and fries. The fried shrimp was over cooked and the garlic mash potatoes were flavorless. I would not return."
8/30/2018,5 star rating,"By far the best seafood restaurant uptown! The food is so good, and you have endless choices of how you can have your food prepared. My favorite is sautéed curried salmon, with sautéed rice and vegetables. The food is filling. The prices vary so depending on what you order, it can be inexpensive or expensive. But, regardless of what you order you will be very satisfied. Also, the wait time can be a little long but it's worth it. It's very crowded afternoons and evenings from Thursday to Sunday"
6/16/2019,4 star rating,"The food here is really good! It is very small, and is not a place where you can sit down and eat. It is take out, therefore be prepared to wait a long time for your food. It would be great if a call can be placed ahead of time, or if a grubhub/seamless option can be set up for this place to reduce the time you spend waiting for your food. It would help with the lines."
6/11/2019,4 star rating,"I love their food, especially their loaded lobster fries. The only thing I hate about this place is waiting so long for your food. The staff could be a little more friendly. Smile a little. Lol. But other than that, the food is good."
5/21/2019,4 star rating,"I got fried fish & shrimp wit a side of collard greens & baked mac&cheese. The food here is sooo good & fresh. I just hate that you have to wait 45mins plus for the food, depending on what you order. So don't go if your hungry cause you will have to wait atleast 30mins. I would deff go bck, Its actually worth the wait in my eyes!"
4/4/2019,3 star rating,"Went yesterday with my husband and honestly I get better food ad the fish market by me. We decided to order the calamari, catfish, flounder and shrimps with fries.oh how much I regret it. Everything tasted the same!‍. Not to mention that the fries where nastyyyy! Hollow, full of grease!Maybe the broiled food would of been better. It is all a hype. Firstable, the fries suckkkkkk, the food had no flavor at all and it was beyond greasy. Not a pleasant experience at all. I gave it 3 stars cause maybe the broiled will be better ‍"
3/28/2019,5 star rating,"The food at the Light House is effing AMAZING! It's so good that you will wait the eternity that it takes to make your food. Without even fussing. Sooooooooooo don't go there if you have any time constraints. I had the shrimp with fries. Every morsel was mouthwatering. Facts. And PS - ain't no parking in Harlem so be prepared to double park and wait outside for your food. On a nice day you can always people watch while you wait. I'm in Jersey damn near PA but will travel to this spot for some the comforts of a soul soothing nourishing authentic meal, cooked with lots of love."
3/24/2019,5 star rating,The food was great Place a little small but me and my partner still eat in I would love for Chef Ramsey to come In and give this place a make over Love the service
3/16/2019,3 star rating,Went to the Lighthouse on a recommendation. The place is small. As you walk in the door you walk into the line for the cashier. Wait to place order wasn't too bad. I ordered the loaded lobster fries $20. The wait was real though so be prepared. The dish itself was very tasty and worth the wait.
3/11/2019,5 star rating,Great taste and fair prices. I ordered some Butter Garlic chicken and it was so well seasoned. I ordered it with macaroni and yams and it was amazing accompanied with the macaroni. The wait was long but thats because there was a lot of people. And it's nice to see your people working because it makes you at home  especially with the music they had playing.
3/7/2019,1 star rating,"My first and last time going. I was extremely disappointed with everything about Lighthouse. I've been hearing about it for a while and I've seen their Instagram page and finally decided to try it. What's wrong !? For the hype and the booming business the place is a box. From The moving area to get your seafood, then to wait to pay and to pick up your food is a cram ! I waited maybe 10 mins to pay and over an 1 hour and a half for some steamed seafood!!! The time I waited For steamed seafood I should of cooked it myself! THEN the people over the counter are miserable. They're giving YOU attitude because your asking about the status of YOUR order ! People who ordered after me got they're food before me. My husband wanted a fish sandwich which came 40 mins after waiting and he was extremely disappointed with the lack of seasoning. The Mac and cheese tasted like black pepper why and how ? I'd love to know myself ! It looked better than it tasted . By the time I got the seafood I was even more pissed . It lacked seasoning tasted like sea. My husband had to put his fine touch on it to make it taste like what I should've received in the first place. Overall Waste of time, money and TIME lol !!"
3/5/2019,4 star rating,"The only thing I ever have gotten from here is the lobster fries, and I have never been disappointed. There are substantial amount of lobster and it's all saucy and goodness. The flavor is very good too! Obviously I'm in love with them. If you ever looking for lobster fries, this is definitely the place for them!"
12/30/2015,4 star rating,"The service is great here and even better if your of the female variety. And why not, ladies first!The seafood is fresh and presented well in a secure iced refrigerator. Here are some rules I found out: don't go inside the fridge for the lobster or crabs (someone will assist you), grab a bowl to dump seafood in and have it weighed before leave to the other side to pay or gave steamed. If you are having the seafood steamed,be prepared to wait...patiently!"
7/7/2019,1 star rating,"I went there to checkout this place out, there was a long line and only two ppl working the counter so i was complaining i order what me and my boyfriend wanted i told them i wanted seafood mac and cheese plenty of times!!! Waited half an hour went by and then an hour then another half an hour only for them to tell me that my shrimp mac and cheese was on its way i didnt order that ! But they quickly got it fixed but honeslty it was good at all i could have went to city island and got shrimp and fries that taste way better they put so much cheese i didnt even have but like 4 noodles long story wont be back !!!!!! Ps flys were everywhere"
1/21/2018,4 star rating,"Really good seafood (not going to say it's the best in the city but it holds its own). The wait is usually long but the food is made to order so that's to be expected. I had the Loaded Lobster Fries, which comes with fried shrimp, and was shocked at how much food you get (seriously the box weighed like 7 lbs). Needless to say it's definitely something you want to share. My only issue with it was that I wished the fries were crispier."

3/22/2018,5 star rating,This is my favorite soul food spots. Truly a hidden gem. I tell all my friends about this place. It's a takeout restaurant but the food is beyond amazing. You gotta ty it for yourself. The honey BBQ wings are always on point & the candied yams is to die for .
8/18/2018,5 star rating,This is my fav spot #ShagatRated for the best cooked and seasoned food in town. I drove from Queens to the Bronx to Haarlem to get this.. worth it.
9/22/2015,4 star rating,"I follow them on Instagram and I finally worked up the nerve to drive all the way to Harlem to try it out. BEST TRIP EVER!!! You can choose how you want your food cooked. You can even go as far as picking the pieces you want cooked from the large freezer yourself. It does not smell like the fish market in there and the fish is fresh.The staff was pleasant and the chef was outgoing and passionate about his food.The spot was small, not for dining in, but perfect for take out!I ordered the Sauteed Salmon on yellow rice, fried jumbo shrimp, mac and cheese, collard greens, and macaroni salad. Oh yea and a fried lobster tail lol"

11/3/2019,3 star rating,The wait time too long for the amount of people working there..for some fried fish and shrimp.and too pricey for the amount they give.  I was just hungry so I waited for an hour. But that won't happen again. I'd rather go without than to wait that long.I didn't even enjoy it because it took so long!!

8/20/2019,3 star rating,"I went to this restaurant last night at approximately 11pm there was a line to order. The place is small but cute the staff members are friendly. I ordered shrimps, two lobster tails, mac&cheese and fries. All the food taste good. However, one of the lobster tails had a strong odor of ammonia I had to throw it away."
6/8/2020,1 star rating,Wanted to love this place upset I couldn't .First of all Me and my cousin walked from the East side .We waited an hour for our food And decided to go eat by the water little did we know they forgot my shrimp that was supposed to go with. The shrimp and wings dinner ..They even forgot our ice tea which really sucks because it was 40 something dollars and food was missing about 16$ worth
4/19/2018,5 star rating,"Nice establishment, if you want to eat in, seating is limited. Its a Fish Market so you can pick out your seafood fresh off the ice as well as order from their menu. I enjoyed the food here,  had Crab Alfredo, Salmon, Macaroni Salmon, Yams and Greens.... sooo yummy. I had to wait a while for my order as they were making everything fresh, but it was well worth the wait!!"
8/10/2015,4 star rating,The location is interesting and definitely a bit sketchy but I'm a Brooklyn girl so I was down for the adventure. The seafood is well seasoned and the Mac and cheese is pretty good. I wasn't impressed with the macaroni salad and sweet potatoes.
5/22/2017,4 star rating,Lighthouse is a get it and get situation. They really need to expand! The food was amazing. I had Lobster fries & Wings with Crazy sauce. For a Seafood place they know wings! Also had a piece  of Lemon Cake for dessert that was like a slice of Heaven. Can't wait to return.
5/6/2018,5 star rating,Amazing food. Mac and cheese was great. Fried fish was great. Candies yams was great. And the lobster fries were banging!!! The wait was a bit long but I'd say it was worth it. Will be back next week!!!
1/30/2018,2 star rating,"Let's just say I had high expectations of lighthouse because I've ate here before more than what I've posted on Yelp and I'm very disappointed.. for starters it was very greasy I literally titled my container to the side and the amount of grease actually made me feel nasty, second off the Alfredo clearly has the taste of jar Alfredo wasn't from scratch, third it was wayyyy too much Alfredo sauce other than the cons the pros were the salmon and shrimp were both cooked to perfection! Lastly for 25$ the least they do can is give you a slice of garlic bread! Lighthouse this wasn't your best dish! Hopefully this was just a off day for y'all!"
1/20/2018,4 star rating,"Food is great and fresh!!! Hot, lightly battered but as with most restaurants service can be friendly but extremely slow... Great meal!"
3/4/2019,4 star rating,"I had the loaded lobster fries which came to $20  it was a meal in itself it was the best fries Ive ever had. I also had a steam salmon fillet with vegetables u can pick which fish you want and vegetables they cook it any way you like fried broiled steam sauteed  in diffrent sauces they have crab legs, shrimp and many more options  shrimp alfredo, curry shrimp over rice I called to place an order nobody ever picks up that phone I waited 1hour to get my food all you need to spend is 2 of the most important things you have and that's time and money it's a lil pricey depending ok n who you talk to it also good food the parking sucks and it's a to go place they have an instagram lighthousefishmarket where you can keepnupmto.date with what's goin on"
5/15/2020,5 star rating,best black owned seafood spot i've ever been to. the food is worth every penny! i always go there from jersey & its worth the ride too.
7/24/2019,5 star rating,"I wish I would've taken a picture of my food, but even the picture wouldn't have done the food justice! I've been to Lighthouse a couple of times and each time their food is AMAZING!! Even thinking about the food makes my mouth water!!! You should go here expecting to spend a pretty penny compared to other take out restaurants but it is DEFINITELY worth it. The restaurant is also VERY tight in space and the wait times can be long but i promise, it is alllll worth it. I've had the bbq wings, jerk chicken wings, macaroni and cheese, seasoned fries, shrimp & a seafood platter and they were alllll good. Only thing i wouldn't recommend would be the collard greens."
1/29/2018,3 star rating,"The food when I first went here was good that's the only reason why they got a 3 star, however last night I got food from here and the Mac and cheese was burnt and crispy. I was very disappointed, I know they could do better. It was like they gave me the corner burnt piece of the pan."
9/5/2016,3 star rating,It is now under new management and the service is really hit or miss. They no longer accept credit/debit and sometimes there are odd smells coming out of the place. I'm not in a rush to return but I also can't say I have had a horrendous experience.
10/14/2014,4 star rating,"Extremely quick and absolutely fresh offerings. They also sell fresh, raw fish although I have not tried this aspect of the business first hand.Placed my order of the ""Patrick Ewing"" special (fish and shrimp with hand cut fries) and watched them prepare my food within minutes. I received my meal and had it packaged to go right out of the fryer. Based on this experience I would definitely return.Took my order to go. Was offered condimens but declined to experience true flavors.  Friendly staff and pretty clean facilities. Definite plus was the lack of ""fishy"" odors."
4/11/2020,3 star rating,Ghetto but the food is good. Don't look for superb customer service however the food is worth the wait.
4/22/2017,3 star rating,The food is amazing! however they have to work on rolling the food out faster. The wait time is ridiculous.
1/11/2017,3 star rating,"Poor service. Called ahead of time. Went to pick up a package. Arrived 40 minutes after the standard ""15 minute wait"" and my food still wasn't ready. Very disorganized. Pro: Food is good"
2/2/2019,5 star rating,"So damn good. Worth the wait, true Harlem experience and characters in here. Best part was taking that tray home and enjoying it at my kitchen table. This def going to be a spot I'll coming back too. Those crab legs were..... so damn goooooood. I just got the steamed food though, I'll be back to try the cooked dishes on the menu."
4/18/2017,4 star rating,"Okay, the wait is a nightmare if you want steamed food but....It is amazing! We actually ended up going on Thursday night and Saturday night. I was trying my best to be kind... and I was. I had to remind them about my food in the steamer. Then they were like, oh, sorry. OMG! I wanted to break things. Both times we got steamed muscles / crab legs / brussel sprouts /broccoli. They were seasoned with Old Bay, butter and garlic. SO SO SO SO SO good and meaty. We were going to another place to get muscles and they were so tiny. I am not sure why it took us so long to come here. Again, the wait is a nightmare and so is the ordering line at night but it is definitely worth the wait. Good people watching.Prices are reasonable. Service is slow. Business is clean and well maintained."
8/12/2016,1 star rating,"The worst customer service ever! Unprofessional, disorganized, and ghetto... I hate to use that as an adjective but that's just what it is. I desperately wanted to support this small business but after so many disappointments I can no longer spend money here. They forget orders, they make wrong orders, they run out of food, they are slow, slow, slow, some days they decide they are cash only, different cooks, different outcomes... Don't bother calling an order in, it won't be ready when you get there or they'll just sell it to someone else if they run out of food. Who runs out of linguine??? And they never apologize for sh*tty service. Like they are doing you a favor by taking your money! Avoid at all cost, or at the least until they're under new management.August 2016"

2/13/2017,5 star rating,"Fried shrimp in Honey BBQ sauce over yellow rice. Options are jerk, butter garlic, honey zing, & crazy. Also the wings sauced up, your style, over garlic mashed potatoes are bomb af. You're welcome. :)"
5/22/2017,4 star rating,Oh my god I have never had more amazing wings than the wings I've had here. I've honestly been craving them for weeks since I got them and I cannot wait to go back. I'm truly giving them 4 stars because of these wings. I also had the mac and cheese which has a bit of spiciness to it that gives it a nice kick. And I tried their salmon with potatoes and corn (the special which is only $8) but I was not impressed with this because I have acid reflux and they added Cajun spices to my salmon without asking me so it completely upset my tummy. I guess next time I go I'll ask them to hold off the Cajun and/or simply order my wings and go.
3/15/2018,3 star rating,"Im sorry to say my 2nd experience there sent me to the ER the next day regardless of the fresh food preparation I GOT FOOD POISONING!!!I'm a nurse an very careful what eat! I'm super picky, some people may not take the time to post especially after being sick! No food preparation is perfect and I narrowed down all I ate before coming to assumption of what made me sick. Thank God I'm better now an being super careful and picky about the food I'm ingesting. Everyone please be aware an take note of what you eat food poisoning can some times be fatal especially in children!"
7/8/2017,4 star rating,"Good food, Instagram ad a little misleading, thought they had a sit down area.  Had the seafood platter seasoned well.  Wish I could have tried the lobster fries but wasn't ready as we were early that day.  Overall good prices, good food"

12/9/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down an absolute must when in the city. One of my top 5 favorite seafood restaurants ever and for good reason. From the fresh catch section on one side with an assortment of caught options to watching the magic all go down right in front of you. This place is simply amazing. Now for some the size of the restaurant may be off putting with limited space and seating or for others, the wait for the FRESH, MADE TO ORDER, cooked food isn't ideal but you have to give credit where credit is due. The food is outstanding and there is no argument about it. The menu is generous with so many options and combinations you'll spend most of your time just reciting how everything sounds so good. The chef's are seaseoned veteran's in the game and can pretty much walk you through anything on the menu. The lobster fries are out of this freaking world and to watch it all go down is even greater! The catfish is one of a kind. Well seasoned but not too salty or overdone. You honestly can't go wrong with any sides. They're all good. There are no bad options on this menu and you can't say that you visited NY without making a pit stop in this absolute gem from Harlem.I highly reccomend."
7/12/2018,1 star rating,I have tried to like this place plenty of times. Their food is tasty but the customer service is so poor I can not support this business. The employees fail to properly serve customers. They will give you an attitude for ordering food. I received no utensils with my order when I went back and asked the lady rolled her eyes. Very very very poor service.
1/31/2016,2 star rating,I just moved to Harlem and I'm on a mission to try out the good fish market spots. I follow Lighthouse on instagram for a few weeks now and I finally decided to take a trip there. Everything was going great until I got to the register. Since this was my first time I did not know this establishment does not accept credit/debit. They only accept EBT food stamps and cash. I'm not really the cash handy type I'm more of a c.c. swiper. I was disappointed to hear that and immediately got turned off and didn't follow through with my purchase.However the food did look delicious and the staff was very helpful in assisting me with selecting what i wanted so I plan on trying them out again with cash on hand!
8/28/2019,4 star rating,"I was iffy about eating at this place but OMGAWD most of  what I bought was so good. The Mac and cheese is to die for, as well as the BBQ chicken wings. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star is because their is not that much of space and the garlic mashed potatoes was not a good as I thought it would be."
4/5/2017,5 star rating,"Simply Put...it is Good.I have seen long lines and avoided the crush, knowing one day.  Today was that day...steamed salmon steak w steamed veggies and rice.Just how I needed it.The menu is full and the music is a welvome compliment to warm service.Merci."
11/4/2018,4 star rating,"Visited a few weeks ago and I feel obligated to take one star off because of the wait and customer service. I chose to walk in and place my order. The restaurant was very crowded as space is limited so I was already thinking oh boy this may take a while. The lady taking orders was preoccupied by whatever was going on with her coworkers and myself and the gentleman in front of me stood there waiting to place our orders for at least 5 minutes before she even acknowledged us. It took 10 minutes for me to place my order although there was no line, and I waited another 15 minutes to get my food. I was annoyed by the near half hr wait until I got my food. Love at first bite. I had the fried fish and shrimp with seasoned fries and macaroni & cheese. Every bite was amazing. I can't explain it. I guess it really is worth the wait."
8/25/2018,2 star rating,"Surprisely, I was very disappointed with the food and the service. The staff was not friendly at all and it took them forever to acknowledge me. I ordered fish and wingettes. The fish was horrible it tasted like garlic and the wingettes were not any better.  Definitely will not be back!!"
2/11/2020,5 star rating,Best seafood spot in Harlem. HandS down. It's usually pacKed but the food is always fresh. The fish is always fresh. 10/10.
2/9/2020,3 star rating,The food is good but it's not worth the nasty attitudes they have. The lady at the cash register has a very nasty attitude and the wait time is ridiculous. I love to support black owned business but there's always a reason why I don't. They need to go to class for customer service because they are lacking in that area.
8/8/2018,4 star rating,"Food is DELISH!!!!! You can either have your order steam or fried. It's made to order (can take up half your lunch hour!) but once it's prepared it's SUPER fresh and HOT! I have yet to be disappointed! HOWEVER....Do not even bother try calling your order in for pick up, the woman designated to take orders answers the phone when she feels like it. Once you're in the spot, the girl taking the orders is EXTREMELY SLOW! Once you're at the counter, she'll walk away, to do other things outside of her duties, without taking your order meanwhile there can be a line out the door (another reason why your entire lunch hour might be spent waiting on your food) At the point that she DECIDES to take your order, she's rude! And don't you dare get up there and still be indecisive about what you want (as you might be; because almost everything on the menu looks GREAT), she'll give you the ""I'm waiting"" look. SMH!Otherwise the food is Good! And the male cooks are nice!"
12/24/2015,5 star rating,"This is probably one of my all time favorite fish markets. They'll make it anyway you like either steamed, fried, sautéed, etc. They have a large variety of sauces and butters to satisfy any, and all tastebuds. They're often very busy so I would just suggest you stay on top of your order and to verify before leaving with your food. I've never had a problem, and everything is always so fresh. Whenever in the area, I always pass by. Enjoy!!"
2/11/2017,5 star rating,This is probably my 5th or 6th visit now! I absolutely love the steamed food! I love coming here because everyone is beyond friendly and my food always tastes amazing! I usually get steamed food but today I'm trying their sautéed salmon!
1/2/2017,5 star rating,"Pretty decent for a Harlem fish market! My only complaint was the insane wait time for takeout! Granted I was getting steamed crab legs on New Years Eve so I should've known better BUT, I waited well over an hour between waiting to place my order and waiting to get the food. The crab legs were amazing!"
5/1/2017,4 star rating,Had a combo flounder and Schrimp was delicious flavorful staff was excellent Vegas could use one of these jawns
4/17/2016,5 star rating,So I've lived in the area for 4 years & passed this place tons of time... Well I finally stepped into the establishment & was beyond pleased with food & the customer service... Not to expensive & well seasoned seafood will get 5 stars from me anyway... the sides I had chosen were mac & cheese n their potato salad (weird combo I know ) the staff was very pleasant they were on top of their orders and just really kind....after many months of skepticism I'm not disappointed & I will be making many more trips back to this establishment
2/27/2016,4 star rating,"Yea so their food is ROCKIN! I had a shrimp scampi seasoned very well with a mac & cheese on the side. HUGE Jumbo shrimp. And they make the food right in front of you. The only thing though is the wait time. You have to be patient. Depending on wat you get, youll wait about 25 minutes for your food but Id say its worth it. Jay Z was playing in the background was a plus. Seafood market, mixed with soul food is PERFECT. 1000x times better than the 24 hour spot on 125th. I'll be back!"
1/1/2017,5 star rating,"Lighthouse food is great. If & when in hungry while I'm home lighthouse is usually my only option besides Jimbos for breakfast. Staff is cool & down to earth . Food is always fresh , smelling good & tasting even better ! Yes there is a wait being that the food is fresh . My fave are the honey zing wings , along with the lobster fries. All the steamed seafood is amazing also. They can literally create whatever you may ask for."
8/21/2017,3 star rating,"Now i want to start by saying to really do like this place but i am writing this review due to the inconsistencies i always encounter when i come. The food is great i usually come on Fridays and I pick my fish and veggies and i have it broiled. This past Friday i came in and picked up my somewhat usually order (2 fliets of salmon, just under a pound, 10 jumbo shrimp and my veggie medley). Since this is a custom order is tends to cost more than the usual fried stuff. My order after ordering my side & a drink was like 32, like i said my Friday usual lol. I usually wait for my food so i sat in the corner and wait. This day was a SUPER long wait but i waited patiently as always finally when my number was called there seemed to be an issue. It was unclear on what was mine (not strange this happens ALL the time) so after a lot of back and forth and waiting i was presented with something. Wasn't what i ordered :( ... Apparently the order before mine was a sautee order and mine got mixed up. I didn't even have the pieces of fish or shrimp i order... I ended up leaving with the sautee order because i did not have another 45 mins to stick around and wait ... Needless to say i am disappointed because when you do custom order your items are weighed and you pay based off the weight and i pay extra to have it broiled. So if i pay 26 for salmon and shrimp and then i get something that wasn't what i paid for i am not a happy camper, and too often this happens when i go. I really wish they would get a better system so peoples food are not mixed up. I go once a week and at least one a month my order is correct and its usually because its when the owner is there and if he sees me waiting he remember and will double check but there have been times when my order is lost and then they go pick out what i ordered again and redo it. So while the food is great i really think they need to work on their process or at least have some kind of check process because too often i am wasting time correcting something that should of be clear when i placed my order and worse that i paid for it and didn't get what i paid for. I need you guys to do better as i want to continue to be a customer but its not the best thing when your customers are used to mistakes ... eventually that will lead to us going somewhere else if we continue to be dissatisfied."
8/21/2015,2 star rating,"They only get 2 stars because the candied yams and mac n cheese was pretty decent.  I stood and waited for an hour for my food and it wasn't worth it , fish was not fried hard enough !the Tatar sauce had more seasoning than the fish and shrimp ! I read reviews and also had word of mouth about this place being great , I'm very disappointed ! I will not be returning ! Like where is the rest of the food"
12/4/2018,5 star rating,"I came here last night,for the first time. The only issue I had was with the wait time and the place is so small,but when I tell you that I had the best blackened catfish (paired with Mac& cheese and collard greens)that I've had in years!! I will most definitely be coming back,especially when it gets a little warmer out."
1/5/2018,5 star rating,Dear lighthouse I love you for always coming through in the clutch with the bomb late night eats thank u amen lol
7/1/2016,5 star rating,Heated up the leftovers they tasted better than last night. I just wish they weren't a cab ride away I would love to eat from here more.
9/18/2015,4 star rating,Went here ah few Saturday's ago just on a hunger whim had the fried shrimps and fries. The fries were my fave never had a fry that yummy; the shrimp were season to perfection. Next time I'll get some steamed seafood the wait is pretty long I called and ordered and still ended up waiting almost an hour.
6/28/2016,4 star rating,"I have always wanted to go to this fish market ever since they opened at that location, unfortunately I didn't get to go myself to purchase food from there the times I've eaten food from them so I can't really comment on the store itself, but the food omg it was delicious. Worth every penny, I got a lot of different seafood to steam so my food came up to just about $40 I believe. I was able to use my Yelp check-in discount code which made it a little better. But I honestly feel it was worth it. The steamed clams was soooooooo good, the only thing they are missing is the minced garlic and they will be good. I will definitely keep getting my food from them. Worth a try. I love the fact they put it in aluminum and not styrofoam plates, it keeps the food hot."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"Even though I traveled from my neighborhood of the East Village to HarlemWorld West 131st and Frederick Douglass Blvd taste Lighthouse Fish Market & Restaurant fish dinners. It was worth every minute and every dollar! The customer service is awesome. The fish is fried fresh and seasoned perfectly just like my family down-south would prepare. Man, those collard greens are the best in NYC. Finally, Lighthouse's red velvet cake is so moist and delicious. Lighthouse needs to open a restaurant downtown Manhattan.."
11/1/2015,3 star rating,"Overall the food was good.  I ordered fish, shrimp, yams and Collard greens.  I also ordered the banana pudding. My bf ordered the shrimp with mac n cheese and yams and a blueberry lemonade.  All of the food was good except for the collards.  They were extremely salty.  I didn't realize it until I was home and I wasn't going back. The banana pudding as mediocre but not terrible. The blue raspberry lemonade tastes like a blue jolly rancher.  I for one do not like lemonade so this made the drink a lot better :)The place is very small so don't plan to dine in. There are about 4 stools and a counter where you can sit. I do like that you can pick out your own fresh seafood and have them make it.  The first star I took off was for the customer service.  While the cashier was very friendly and helpful, the rest of the staff was terrible.  The cook and one of the girls were arguing the whole time I waited for my food.  Yelling at the top of their lungs.  It was very unprofessional.  The girl, however, was really trying not to say anything.  It was the older man (cook) who kept on and on. It was a bit ridiculous. The other cook was just being rude to customers in general.  I don't know how long this place has been in business but it seemed to be too busy for them and they were all overwhelmed with the amount of tickets.  The 2nd star was taken off for the portions and price.  For the high prices, they don't give you big enough portions.  I may come back to this spot. It was my 1st time here and I always like to give places a 2nd chance"
10/14/2017,1 star rating,Our second time and thoroughly disappointed. The food was overpriced and OVERRATED.  The fried Whiting tasted like either the oil or fish was old and the Mac and Cheese WASN'T cheesy at all. DONT WASTE YOUR $$$.
6/27/2015,1 star rating,"Please update your hours of operation and answer your phone when possible patrons are calling. I drove all the way here just to find out your business was closed and it's no where near 4AM, it's actually 1:19AM."

5/20/2018,4 star rating,"The fried fish is tasty and the side dishes are real good as well.....you can pick fresh seafood and get it cooked up right the staff are very nice and attentive to your simple request remember there are cooks as well and it's a tight dance from customers needs and them cooking over the fire.....waiting should be outside or in the car but it's worth the wait....I still have more dishes to try like linguini and alfredo sauce but it's worth a second,third go round"
8/6/2018,5 star rating,"What I love the most about this location is that majority of the workers are African American. The food is great the customer service seemed okay. My only complains are the flies, I understand the raw seafood area but something needs to been done about the flies for sanitary and health purposes"
9/12/2018,5 star rating,"Food is always on point!!! Went today and was satisfied per usual! The owner wasn't there yet, would've loved to see him...he's the best!! Truly cares about his customers!"
5/14/2018,4 star rating,Excellent food. Seafood platter to die for. I come all the way from Brooklyn just to enjoy myself.
6/21/2018,5 star rating,"This is the best seafood restaurant in Harlem !! Everything is cooked on the spot and seasoned to perfection. Tried the shrimp linguine, seasoned fries. Mac & cheese and the crab cakes. It's also big portions so I recommend splitting with someone. It's black owned as well.  5/5"
4/22/2015,4 star rating,"My goodness!!! I love it when I find a late night jackpot.. 1 am and I'm getting fish, shrimp and Mac...Perfect!!! The seafood was flavored well. They just need to puncture the Styrofoam so the fried food doesn't lose its crispy goodness.  Also, this spot is super clean because it is take out. Staff are nice. They have a fish market which is open during early hours. And they take credit cards!!! I wish them nothing but success because they are a great addition to the neighborhood."
9/18/2015,5 star rating,"Got the vip platter, 2 actually and it feed 5 of us with some leftovers! Onion rings, Mac and cheese, collard greens are all great! Service was fantastic too! Can't wait to go back!"
8/20/2015,5 star rating,Best fish ever and great desserts too.  You must come and get some. Big variety of seafood to choose from.
8/5/2019,4 star rating,Prepared with care and pride in their dishes.  Seasoned expertly and given attention to the details of putting out a finished dish.  Not just thrown into a fryer or steamer and put up for sale.
3/24/2018,4 star rating,The food is unbelievable. You won't be disappointed. Pick your own fish or let them just make something off the menu. It gets very crowded so go early
9/16/2017,3 star rating,I believe that this restaurant is too small. The pasta of the shrimp was too bland but the shrimp was very flavorful. I did taste my friend's Alfredo and it was excellent. Very creamy. I'll come back though to try the rest of their menu.
7/30/2018,5 star rating,"This place is off the chain, well the seafood is. Omg, the lobster fries is to die for. The portion is larger than I can manage. Love everything. I only wish I could dine in but maybe it's for the best cause food like this should be eaten at home where you can get down and messy.."
3/13/2018,5 star rating,"The LOBSTER FRIES ARE A GOOD, GOOD SIN!  They are absolutely delicious!  And leftovers when heated up in the oven (uncovered)are still very delicious!!"
12/25/2015,4 star rating,The stars are all for the food. They messed up my order 3 different times. I DONT LIVE IN THIS BOROUGH. I was pissed to say the least. Anyway ..they tried to accommodate the mistake. It's very small & takes a while for your food to be ready. But once all that is over & you get your food home (CHECK IT) ...it is very good.
7/15/2018,5 star rating,First off the food is delicious it's like so worth the extra your have to pay for it being a little more on the expensive side of fish market fare. However the cashier here is so freaking rude if your seem confused will just stare at your before rolling those big ugly eyes takes your money without saying thank you. I ordered two fresh juice drinks for which I was told the cops would be brought our I'm waiting on line and just happened to notice the cops had been sitting on the counter this lady is a real bitch thank God she isn't cooking.
3/25/2018,4 star rating,Went here one night to take out for dinner and had the most AMAZING food! I ordered the Shrimp with Garlic Butter over Rice and it was delicious! The portions are also pretty good! It is a little pricey but you're definitely getting good food and good quality! Can't wait to try more off the menu soon!
7/19/2017,3 star rating,So ... the first time I came here the food was phenomenal I ordered the fish and shrimp combo with coleslaw and seasoned French fries .. the food was so good that i decided to get the same exact order again and this time the food was horrible the fried fish was old and dried out and taste like oil the coleslaw was bitter and the fries were not seasoned I guess this place is hit or miss depending on the cook for the day I went on a Monday so whoever cook on that day SUCK! Request for fresh fish!!
9/4/2017,5 star rating,"Great food, great service, great music, great price.  First time there and I didn't realize there were secret menu items like LOBSTER FRIES!  Definitely going back."
4/17/2017,3 star rating,"Tried this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend. I ordered two Whiting  sandwiches on whole wheat bread. I also ordered a side of coleslaw and a side of macaroni and cheese. The coleslaw was just ok, the mac  and cheese did not have any seasoning but it was loaded with cheese. The wait staff was very courteous. Wouldn't go back any time soon."
7/5/2019,4 star rating,"The food is very tasty. It's worth the drive from Westchester county. The only thing that's somewhat frustrating is the time consumption; but when you really think of it, it's freshly made which I appreciate. Worth the wait."
10/30/2014,2 star rating,"This is my second time here,  I don't know what happened seems like everythings changed.  Bad food (too salty) bad service (hard time placing order).     First it took 10 minutes to place my order, and  the place wasnt even busy. Then fried fish whiting had almost no meat on it,  and over seasoned.  and the ""fresh cut fries"" lol I saw them come straight out the freezer then out the bag.  Waste of time waste of money"
6/30/2018,5 star rating,Thanks for the love they put in the food all items are good can't wait to try 24k wing's Harlem rules soul food all day everyday ONLY the southern part of US can touch the northern part USA all the way up
6/27/2018,2 star rating,"This is a takeout joint. There is a counter and four stools and if you sit, people will have to reach over you to get their orders. I can only tell you that the food looked good as we left when told that we would be be better off getting our food to go. I went there because of their misleading radio adds that call this a restaurant."
11/19/2016,1 star rating,"I give the food 5 stars because it is delicious but as far as the organization and speed it gets a one. I first called to place an order (that I would pick up) and was told ""we not doing that right now"". That's annoyed me but o said ok I'll just go in and order in person. Had to wait on line for at least 15 mins while the man at the register spoke to other customers around me and chefs. Finally placed my order and was estimated a 15 min wait, which I was fine with. I came back 20 mins later and my food was NOT EVEN BEING COOKED! All in all I waited 45 mins. Love the food but I won't be getting this again anytime soon."
8/16/2015,4 star rating,"The food is sooooooooo amazing, so tasty, so delicious. Like everything...I had the shrimp linguini and the garlic flavor was so tasty, so good. Now the actual spot is a cute little clean spot....but thats the issue...its little. They should have more seating room at least another counter or something but doesn't look like thats happening...The service...the service is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars. Everyone working there was nice and polite...however...it was so busy that they seemed almost flustered with the business. Orders were slowed down and forgotten and had to tell 3 or 4 people what I ordered before it finally came...and getting the food takes between 15-30 mins thats the only frustration... but great food , nice people....worth the wait and trip to Harlem"
5/29/2016,5 star rating,Love coming here on a Sunday afternoon!!! Food is awesome and service is great!!! Lines are out the door but so worth the wait!!!

11/19/2016,1 star rating,I loved this place when it first opened ! NOW the staff is rude and disgusting!! I will never come here again ! You're a business ! MONEY is what keeps you open so why be rude to your customers!? Idiots I hope they close down.
6/27/2015,5 star rating,Nice small place in Harlem. A friend had there food and posted a picture. So I had to try them. I had the shrimp and fries. It was very good. Thinking about going back tomorrow. It is definitely a must have.
7/11/2016,1 star rating,"I really wish I had read prior reviews before placing an order over the phone. They are SO RUDE! Beyond rude, just annoyingly unprofessional, disorganized, and barely listen to what your order is. They quickly brush you off telling you ""we're really busy I don't have time to go to the register to tell you your total and bring cash, cash only!""So turned off, there are so many places in Harlem to eat. If I want nasty attitudes and bad service I would've gone to any hole in the wall"
10/17/2016,3 star rating,"Went here over the weekend after hearing a lot about the restaurant only to realize it isn't exactly a restaurant. It's a fish market that sells cooked food and seafood dinners but they do have maybe 6 seats so I guess it's a restaurant. I had the fish and shrimp meal with collard greens and the greens were way too salty for consumption. Overall I would say I'd go back but their payment options are very misleading. They have a register with a card swipe and a credit card machine right next to it. Their menu board even says they take cards but they have a paper sign up on the window to the fresh fish area that says cash only. Unfortunately this place is so small there is usually someone standing there blocking it so you get to the register only to realize it's cash only. They ""conveniently"" have an ATM though... go figure."
2/15/2018,4 star rating,Seasoned to perfection..The food is good and the employees are kind of getting better with their service.
6/28/2017,5 star rating,Everything was great food was amazing but almost an 2 hour wait. Wow. It was about 6 people there total. Didn't think it packed at all. But the taste of the food was amazing.
8/1/2016,1 star rating,"You literally stand in there for 15-20 minutes and no one takes your order. They tell you they'll be back in a minute and disappear. Everyone else is like busy so they're also avoiding any type of eye contact with you. I've gotten food from here twice, yes it is good but totally not worth the wait of sometimes an hour after you order. Screw that, I am pretty sure I won't be giving them my business again. If you're willing to wait then don't come hungry because who knows when someone will be tending to you!"
1/14/2018,3 star rating,This place has great fish but i have to say the cashier is acting as if she is doing you a favor. No smile and she speaks as if she is sick and came to work. Unfriendly. We called in to pick up the food and it actually took us a lil longer but it wasn't ready and they started preparing it when we arrived. When I got in and started to say what the purpose is to call in for the order they for faster. I monitored the owner another time when I was there and I know he cares a lot about his business. I'm sorry but I didn't feel welcome this time.
2/9/2017,5 star rating,"The food at Lighthouse is absolutely delicious! Between the great food and friendly staff, they will continue to get my money! You can just taste the love in the food. I recommend anything sautéed. As a matter of fact, I recommend the entire menu! And those lobster fries....OMG!  I can't wait for my mother to visit NYC so that I can introduce her taste buds to all of the deliciousness! This place is awesome!"
8/21/2017,5 star rating,The service and the food were fabulous!!! We all got there at the closing time and they still provided great service :) the trip from Brooklyn was well worth it !!!
2/24/2016,1 star rating,"I would give them 0 stars if I could....So my boyfriend and I decided to go here yesterday, he had the food before and raved about it. So we place our order and after waiting for 20 minutes, half of the order comes out. We wait another 10-15 minutes for the other half of the order to come out.... And nothing. Then one of the people behind the counter, asks what we're waiting for... We tell them, another 5-10 minutes passes and nothing . Mind you were number 21, and they're calling orders 32 by then. So we proceed to inquire on what is taking so long and if we're coming up next. They disregard our questions . So we wait... A few more minutes.. The staff was confused and disorganized and basically gave away our order to someone else. We tried to explain to them that they gave away our order... And instead of them making our order next, they continue to serve those that came way after us.. My boyfriend just asked for his money back because because we had waited over an hour for our food... And it didn't appear like they were going to make the 2nd half of the order. No apologies from them or anything, the WORST customer service EVER! Didn't get to try the food and I won't be because I'll never give an establishment like this my hard earned dollar!"
8/15/2016,1 star rating,"I recently bought the $9.00 Combo special and a Whiting fish sandwich to go. When I got home I was set to enjoy my meal. Well I couldn't eat it simply for the fact that it was beyond greasy. Let me state for the record that I have been a loyal customer, but I encountered a problem once before. Sorry but they will not see me or my business anymore. I believe that this is a business in decline. Seeing it go from an A to a Bit. Rating is not a good sign. The oil that was used to cook the fish was burned. Again not good for business."
6/19/2017,5 star rating,The fish sandwich was big and tasty. Had slaw for the side and it was equally good. I'm used to southern style coleslaw but this slaw had the a vinegar flavor Charleston style. Had the salmon with lobster cream sauce; it was exquisite. For the price you can't go wrong. You select your fresh fish form the adjacent freezer section and it is weighed and cooked while you wait. The seating area is limited to 5-7 bar stools.
1/13/2016,1 star rating,"I've come to the Lighthouse a few times and each time they've gotten progressively slower. Yes, I wrote progressively SLOWER! I entered this seafood spot at 7:52p ... It's 8:52p and I'm still here....................... with no apology or explanation  for the hold up. There's absolutely no reason that a takeout spot should have you waiting over an hour for food. The owner/employees here definitely need a better solution for getting customers in and out. It's sad to say but the horrible service trumps how good this food is."
7/24/2017,4 star rating,"Went to buy some fish from there yesterday and Lenny was very helpful in demonstrating the differnt types of fish that were available. The area where the fresh seafood is being sold is extremely clean!! I am new to the neighborhood  and looks like is this is my go to place to pick up fresh fish, look for Lenny if you need any help, hes usually cleaning fish. Feeling lazzy to cook?  You can just ask them to steam your seafood for free or saute it for $2.00. I have not yet tried the food but I am pretty sure i will soon!!"
1/10/2016,1 star rating,Waited over 40 minutes for a simple fish order. Went here because of all the good reviews but this will be the first and last time I ever go there. Kitchen is unorganized and has no idea how to prioritize incoming orders. To top it off the food wasn't worth the wait or the price.
6/29/2017,3 star rating,Their wings were good but the mac and cheese was dry and nasty potato salad was good also. I'll definitely get the honey zing wings again tho.
3/20/2017,2 star rating,Not a restaurant ... carry out spit. Don't know if food is good or not. Uber here from midtown only to walk in and see 4 bar stools and a line of folks crowded around the counter...  disappointed really wanted to try
9/15/2017,3 star rating,"The food and portions use to be so big . I went recently and the macaroni and cheese is no longer as good, not creamy at all just cheese and macaroni noodles. The yams are still good and the catfish is delicious though they did use to give you 4 meaty piece they now slice the filet in half"
8/29/2016,2 star rating,"I really wanted to be able to say good things about this place. So many of my friends rave about it as if it is amazing, but my experience was not even close to what I was hoping. I had the fish sandwich and my wife had the shrimp dinner which was $18 bucks with two sides and to me just seemed to be way overpriced. Both dishes were underwhelming. My wife had mac and cheese and yams. The mac and cheese had no flavor at all. It was borderline terrible and needs a lot of work. The yams were actually pretty good. Oh yea, and let us not forget the strand of hair that we found in our food! Yum Yum! The fish sandwich was okay. It was edible, but nothing I would desire to come back for. I didn't try the shrimp, but my wife let me know that she was not impressed. Not sure that we will give this place another shot."
9/2/2016,4 star rating,"This is take out only and always a wait. The food makes this place, it never disappoints. I honestly  believe the cooks can battle the best seafood restaurants in the city and win. The meals can be steamed fried or sauteed. My go to is the sauteed salmon or lobster fries with the blue mystery juice....amazing!"
6/8/2016,5 star rating,"Late review. I've been to Lighthouse 3x since the first visit. My aunt who live in Texas told me about this place from someone on Instagram. I live in Brooklyn, every time I'm in Harlem, I stop by. The seafood is so fresh and the braised cabbage is an experience all by itself. I've had the jerk shrimp pasta, Alfredo shrimp pasta, fried shrimp and crab legs. Everything is good. I didn't really care for the coconut cake but everything else makes this a 5 star review!"
3/9/2016,1 star rating,The fish was extra greasy...wont be returning.....maybe they need to change the fish oil because it made the fish greasy and have a linger taste afterwards....
8/6/2016,5 star rating,The food here never disappointed me. I dont always check in but I come for lunch everyday. Great food. I just wish they took credit. I understand they had a problem with people using stolen cards here. Shame. Doesn't hurt that the woman that takes your order is beautiful . Great service
12/13/2015,3 star rating,"The food was good...I like how they sauté as the other option it looked and smelled delicious, however the service can be better....if a 'friend' comes through I notice their order gets bumped up and the guy who bags the food is all over the place he can't seem to focus. When I asked for more than two tartar sauce for my $80 plus order he got out of line and asked if I know how to make my own. If I hadn't already paid I would have walked out. I hope they get more organized, treat everyone equally and be a little more respectful, maybe then they can get a better review from me....I'll be back one day.....maybe"

I have to come back here, might come back every time I'm in New York!

At 10:07pm I was told that my food was about to leave the restaurant... WTF? I thought it was already out. At 10:16pm my food is still at the restaurant and the manager told me he could not comp my meal but would give it to me half off. It is now 10:31pm and nothing has been delivered. POOR POOR POOR SERVICE! ONLY IN NEW YORK."
8/16/2015,1 star rating,Not good at all twenty five minute to find out no flounder and they burn the catfish.  No tartar sauce or ketchup in the bag. They are very unorganized.  Over thirty minutes for a fish and shrimp order.

1/15/2016,3 star rating,Delicious. The chef is great. Sides are a bit weak but all and all great spot open late on weekends. Only 3 stars because seafood is farmed raised. No beuno - unfortunately I'll have to fall back. Plus took me 45 to get my food. Ugh too bad
5/2/2016,4 star rating,"Came in here at 930pm on a Friday night and it was packed. I ordered 2 fried fish dinners with fries and 1 fried scallop dinner with fries to go. It took awhile, waited well over 15 minutes, but it was well worth it! It wasn't like people were not hustlin to turn out food; just packed and busy. Everyone else around me was getting their fresh fish dinners, so I need to come back here for those! Looked so good. Will for sure be back. Scallops were so good! A bit of spice to the batter."
12/21/2015,5 star rating,"I love this place! Best takeout in Harlem! I was referred by a friend, that I had to try it and I was not disappointed! I have ordered three times in a two week period, and that's more than I eat out ever! The seafood is always fresh and tasty!"
6/23/2015,3 star rating,"Brought food from this place for dinner  on  father's day for me and my boyfriend, the reason I gave them only three stars because there's no place to sit and eat, it was packed,I was waiting for an hour and a half for my food, the cashier didn't have change so she said, I owe you $.73, I'm going to get some coins, she went to the back, I stood by the cash register and she didn't even  mention my change again, she just kept taking other people's orders, yes it's $.73 but if it was the other way around, I couldn't get my order if I didn't pay the full amount, I jut thought it was unprofessional, I didn't make a big  deal about it because I didn't want to ruin father's day for my boyfriend, I ordered the sautéed shrimp linguine for both of us,it was really good, I wanted to order a banana pudding and peach Cobbler, but I didn't want to wait on that long line again, I would eat here again, and next time I want all my change back...."
9/24/2016,5 star rating,"Very Very Tasty food! I love the seafood with Pasta Dinners, Shrimps are good whichever way  you prefer fried, steam,sauteed all are very good. Customer service is great!"
7/1/2018,4 star rating,"I love Lighthouse! I travel all the way from the Bronx to Harlem to get the delicious fried catfish and shrimp that I'm craving.  The sides are pretty good, but I don't really care for all of the salt and there are sometimes splintered bones in the collard greens.  The line is always crazy when I go (late night), but the old school soul music blaring from the speakers makes the wait go by faster.  I also like that people can pick out their own fish and produce, though I haven't taken advantage of that option yet.  Parking is crazy, lots of double parked cars, but it's worth it."
9/7/2019,1 star rating,"Small little shop with no wiggle room, constantly crowded and there's always a wait for food. An hour or more. Me and my friend got the same exact order on two separate plates, crab legs with veggies and shrimps .. we paid for it and the staff put it in the steamer SAME EXACT TIME but yet my food was taken out close to 30 minutes after my friend food was out. I told the staff member numerous times and after 3 times I got frustrated, the cashier could see the frustration on my face and told her co-worker to check my food cause it should be done now. Seemed like he ignored her and started cooking someone else's food and started bringing other items out to put I bathe oven and steamer. I had to raise my voice and demand that I get my food now because me and my friend had been there over an hour, his food was ready and getting cold. When I got my food it was bland and had a peanut butter taste to it, my only wonder is was the seafood expired .. I'm mad i spent $35 worth of food just for it to be disgusting and waited over an hour and 15 mins. Wouldn't go back ever and I mean ever."
11/27/2016,5 star rating,"My family of four came to visit NY for Thanksgiving, from Dallas, TX. We were made aware of Lighthouse through Instagram. We are originally from New Orleans, and very hard to please when it come to seafood, however LIGHTHOUSE WAS EVERYTHING WE IMAGINED FROM THE PICS, and SOME!!!We had Fish and fries, crab linguini, fish and shrimp with fries, lobster fries, shrimp with butter sauce linguini, blue lemonade, and fruit punch. We spent over a $100 and was very impressed with everything from the food to the drinks. I am still wishing I had tried the blue velvet cake. Michael, I must say THANK YOU KINDLY and I will spread the word from Dallas to New Orleans!! Thanks for everything man!! Good Looking Out!We will definitely be back to visit just for the food.Thank you,Kelly C"
8/28/2016,5 star rating,After my issue with the business we returned knowing the pricing problem n were prepared this time to look at menu not posted prices.. The food is amazing as well as the service.. The owner had seen my review n apologized to my husband and was extremely nice.. It's awesome customer service with awesome food that will make me recommend lighthouse n will be my new go to for seafood
8/18/2016,1 star rating,Prices posted are not what they charge at register. Will be filing complaint with the bbb
7/24/2015,3 star rating,The macaroni and cheese is to cheesy and it's not southern like to me the steamed shrimps are rubbery and they add to much season on the steamed food without request very hectic and very small but hopefully they get it together I love the collard greens and blue lemonade
3/1/2015,1 star rating,"I've waited for my food for over an hour and I don't know what it it is about the service in this area but I seem to always wait forever when I'm over here. The food here is definitely not worth the wait and I would recommend going to Doug E.'s chicken & waffle instead of this weak excuse of a fish market. I would even travel 10 blocks further to the the fish market on 145th for better fish and better service. The workers were extremely rude and inconsiderate making it seem like I was wrong for them taking a year to make my food. Don't ever come here if you're hungry you will be waiting for ever to get your meal and once you eat it you'll realize it's not worth it. The fish is improperly seasoned, the food was cold and they rather flirt with girls at the counter than serve customers. The food is way overpriced for the quality and service. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
5/28/2015,5 star rating,"This is my 3rd time coming to lighthouse. Amazing, perfectly seasoned fish, shrimp, sides and the staff is very down to earth. Was busy today but my order was ok. Definitely a must for seafood in Harlem. Open late nights on the weekend."
3/15/2016,5 star rating,"Food is amazing !!! Like seriously so delicious. Everything we ordered was so good . Steamed crab legs with old bay&garlic...those LOBSTER FRIES !! Even the fried items we ordered stayed delicious by the time we got home. Usually fried fish/shrimp etc isn't as good as when it's hot but theirs was so on point even after it took us a while to get home ; we didn't start eating right away.  The only big downside is that it was sooooo crowded and somewhat disorganized. It was really late at night which I do appreciate but If my friend didn't recommend it, I would have walked right out of this little hood spot but I'm glad we didn't ! Also it's fresh seafood and it can get very pricy !"
8/16/2015,5 star rating,Me and a couple of friends saw the Instagram peg and randomly at about 11:30pm (they closed at 12 that night) decided to go from the Bronx to Harlem to try them out....though they were almost closing they took our orders right away and had our food ready in no time. Not too many places would've done that. I had steamed shrimp and broccoli and man was it delicious. Very fresh food have to go back during the day to try the rest of the food.
1/20/2016,3 star rating,"The food was so good! However, it was way too greasy. I ordered the scallop linguini and it was sitting in a pile of grease. They need to be easy with the oil and more generous with the scallops."
4/29/2016,4 star rating,"Well I must say......coming to the city a few times a week for a few hours at a time,a person can get hungry...and I mean HUNGRY......while trying to find a fresh fish market I came across the Lighthouse......what a blessing....a place to get fresh food cooked to order.... Seems like heaven.... I was like a kid in a candy store selecting snow crab legs,salmon filet,broiled snapper,scallops and a wide array of vegetables.i had the salmon and scallops sautéed with a hint of cayenne pepper along with steamed potatoes,corn,Brussel sprouts and carrots. That was just the beginning......threw in some steamed crab legs with corn and potatoes and a whole snapper that was roasted(broiled)like I was in Jamaica..........as a person easily influenced by my stomach,I was amazed at the care they took in preparing the food and was drawn to ordering the ""crazy wings"" with fries......best decision ever...staff friendly,wait customary,food delicious....Couldn't be more pleased."

You can even go as far as picking the pieces you want cooked from the large freezer yourself. It does not smell like the fish market in there and the fish is fresh.The staff was pleasant and the chef was outgoing and passionate about his food.The spot was small, not for dining in, but perfect for take out!I ordered the Sauteed Salmon on yellow rice, fried jumbo shrimp, mac and cheese, collard greens, and macaroni salad. Oh yea and a fried lobster tail lol"
9/20/2015,3 star rating,Went Here Because I've Heard Some Good Things About This Place. & Sad To Say I Wasn't Satisfied At All. I Placed 3 Orders & On 2 Of My Orders They Forgot To Give Me My Shrimp.

But Maybe I'll Try Again & Get Steamed Food Instead Or Maybe This Was My First & Last Time Coming Here.
9/20/2015,3 star rating,"I actually didn't really care for the food, at least not the fried foods. I had order the fish & shrimp dinner with yams and mac and cheese. I also ordered the banana pudding because I heard it was delicious but it was mediocre. The wait is long from waiting to order to receiving your food. This is definitely a takeout restaurant not a sit in so don't expect to be able to sit and dine. The food was ok but I rather go to Famous Fish."

8/21/2015,2 star rating,"They only get 2 stars because the candied yams and mac n cheese was pretty decent.  I stood and waited for an hour for my food and it wasn't worth it , fish was not fried hard enough !the Tatar sauce had more seasoning than the fish and shrimp !

Now the actual spot is a cute little clean spot....but thats the issue...its little. They should have more seating room at least another counter or something but doesn't look like thats happening...The service...the service is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars. Everyone working there was nice and polite...however...it was so busy that they seemed almost flustered with the business. Orders were slowed down and forgotten and had to tell 3 or 4 people what I ordered before it finally came...and getting the food takes between 15-30 mins thats the only frustration... but great food , nice people....worth the wait and trip to Harlem"

I was told by the same delivery guy that they were ""waiting on my chicken wings"". It's now 8:15PM and know that my order has been forgotten. Fortunately they only accept cash so no card account has been charged. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. The service is the same when you visit too. I'M DONE, I WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN EITHER!

11/19/2014,5 star rating,"What an incredible culinary experience I had while there.  I ordered a dish that the chef created which took me back to the Caribbean.  I had a shrimp and rice dish that had my mouth watering.  It was  heaven !!!!  The Owner and the staff are very warm and welcoming.  Everything was on point. Please also check out the homemade Cakes - the absolute ""Bomb Diggity"" !!!!!  The Restaurant is clean and appealing.  A great place to satisfy any discerning pallet right in the ""Neighborhood"" ! .  Also like the fact that you could buy your own fresh fish in the market side of the restaurant. I just love going there and also tell all of my NYC friends about it"
10/7/2014,5 star rating,Just tried this restaurant today. Ordered from them twice. It was phenomenal.  Yummy. They gave me a free water. The fish was the best.
6/19/2016,1 star rating,"So i live in the neighborhood of this restaurant and keep trying to give them a chance but low and behold I was disappointed  AGAIN! FIRST THE SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE. Mixing up orders and to much fraternizing with the customers but u have to tell you about a specific event that have turned me off for good. So I ordered for deliver: the girl on the phone did not know what I was ordering or how much it was. She clearly made up a price; I order the same thing often so I know the price. So when the delivery man arrives with my food, he tells me there  is surcharge for delivering this far. Okay cool just would like to have to known that when she quoted me a price on the phone. After I opened my food (sautéed salmon and shrimp with broccoli) is COVERED IN SAUCE AND OIL.. Clearly not edible. I call the restaurant to discuss what they delivered to me and the girl on the phone  says to me "" you didn't tell us you didn't want to drain the sauce"" .. So when you order pasta at a restaurant do they include the water they boiled it in!!??? She then acts as if I am the problem so she finally agrees to send me a new meal and refund me the extra money they charged in the beginning. When the delivery guys arrived again he says there is no refund but when I show him the original meal.. Even he was disgusted saying is that butter. It's so sad I keep trying to give this local business a chance but they cannot get it together. This is it for me."
2/16/2017,3 star rating,"Heard about this restaurant for a minute now and with all the big talk, I decided to try them out. 1. The lighthouse fish market& Restaurant is small for the amount of people they allow inside at once to order. 2. This place is really intended for take out, so I don't know why they consider it a restaurant with only three barstools at a counter. 3. This establishment is pretty unorganized wth no crowd control. . 4. The food is more tasteful than other places I tried before, so I give them that, but don't try to save leftovers for the next day, because it won't taste the same. 5. I like how they prepare your steam food fresh and their prices are reasonable. 6. I won't rush to go back no time soon, due to the fact they stated that my order for two would be about 10 minutes and it took them more than a half hour to fix mines. It would not hurt to try them, however you've been warned.They even except EBT cards, so you may get a idea of the customers that patronize this place to order."

11/8/2014,4 star rating,"Customer service was unexpectedly pleasant and delightful. I can't tell you how many new restaurants I've stopped by to peek inside or ask for a menu then received no engagement. The guy behind the counter waved my husband and I inside so that certainly encouraged a return visit to order food on a future visit. We did just that. I really enjoyed the shrimp and chips--lightly seasoned in fresh oil made to order, delish. The fries were really tasty and cooked perfectly. This isn't the usual fish joint so be prepared to pay a few more bucks. I wished my order had at least 2 more shrimp and I look forward to trying other items on the menu. My husband on the other hand loves the fries and didn't enjoy his fish. Split vote here."

3/7/2019,1 star rating,"My first and last time going. I was extremely disappointed with everything about Lighthouse. I've been hearing about it for a while and I've seen their Instagram page and finally decided to try it. What's wrong !? For the hype and the booming business the place is a box. From The moving area to get your seafood, then to wait to pay and to pick up your food is a cram ! I waited maybe 10 mins to pay and over an 1 hour and a half for some steamed seafood!!! The time I waited For steamed seafood I should of cooked it myself! THEN the people over the counter are miserable. They're giving YOU attitude because your asking about the status of YOUR order ! People who ordered after me got they're food before me. My husband wanted a fish sandwich which came 40 mins after waiting and he was extremely disappointed with the lack of seasoning. The Mac and cheese tasted like black pepper why and how ? I'd love to know myself ! It looked better than it tasted . By the time I got the seafood I was even more pissed . It lacked seasoning tasted like sea. My husband had to put his fine touch on it to make it taste like what I should've received in the first place. Overall Waste of time, money and TIME lol !!"

1/21/2016,1 star rating,"Today we decided to go to the lighthouse for dinner. We had been there once before for fish and chips and it was tasty. This time we tried some different things on the menu. My husband ordered lobster tail stuffed with crabmeat.  The price on the menu said $25 but when she charged us the receipt price was $35.  The cashier stated the price went up. I told her you can't have one price listed while charging something totally different. At that point the cook explained that's the summer menu, the prices are different in the winter. Come again??????  It is January, why is the summer menu up?  We let that go...no problem. Here comes the real issue.  We order our food at 7:23 (I Stil have the receipt). We got our food at 8:22; it took 1 hr to get our food. After 30 mins of waiting, we were told the lobster had to be defrosted.  We sat there while they defrosted, steamed, sautéed and broiled this lobster. Needless to say 1 hr later that lobster was dead. That rubber lobster was not worth a 1hour wait. When we discussed the situation with the owner, all he had to say ""I apologize for the wait; please continue to support black owned businesses. I support all businesses but I only frequent professional establishments. The lighthouse just lost a customer."
8/11/2016,5 star rating,"I've been drooling over this places pictures on Instagram since 2014. I'm going to TRY to be brief as possible. I'm giving 5 stars for several reasons. My friend and I visited here after I had a minor surgery. After reading the reviews I had to say something. #1..A black establishment in Harlem trying to help the community eat healthy and FRESH FOOD!! Men busting their asses to get the food out as best and as fast as they could. I had no problem whatsoever with the staff and to see good looking men of color working hard was a damn turn on to be honest! They were friendly and honest that they didn't have what was on the menu..I totally understood. #2..They are COOKING TO ORDER it's not a pot of shrimp pasta ready made to plop in a styrofoam container so you can get to work on time from your lunch break! The wait is necessary, If you can't wait, come or order when you can wait! #3..THEY CATER TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS!! Do I need to say that again? Ain't no shame in my game I'm a proud holder of EBT with what little I get to help me with my financial obligations so TUH! Have your cash money or your EBT, simple.#3..The food was GOOD! My friend and I ordered a lot because we knew we wouldn't be back soon since we're from Queens. We spent over $150. They didn't have a few things but next time we'll call to make sure they do.  All in all let's not be petty!! Big up establishments such as this one instead of tearing them down. I in no way saw rudeness but I feel for people wanting better customer service. That comes with practice and teaching so..they'll get there. People waiting we're not pissed to me, maybe hungry but not HANGRY. We're friendly so we made conversation with whoever, I saw smiles on black faces and no attitude. It's a small place and giving what they're working with I'm commending them! I'm going back soon and I'll take that train ride and spend my Cash or EBT to have quality food made by my people  much love Lighthouse"

3/8/2017,3 star rating,Great food but the service is terrible I called and placed my order with a man named Michael who told me that I was order #33 it would take an hour or so when I got there in an hour he had already given my fish away and was very rude in conversing with me. I had to wait an additional 45mins for my food customer service sucks he left a bad taste in my mouth with his unprofessionalism
7/3/2015,1 star rating,"I love the food here, but the service is horrible. I called ahead to place my order, was told it would be ready by the time I got there only to arrive 10 minutes later and have to place my order again. Gentleman behind the counter told me 2 minutes, 10 minutes later I was still waiting. 30 minutes after I called I finally got my order; only to have it wrapped the wrong way. Stay away if you want decent service."
8/12/2015,2 star rating,Customer service was horrible. Guy was talking so much that he stalled the line and took long to take orders. He was very friendly but holding personal conversations with others off the line is very unprofessional. Looks like a new business in the hood with potential. Food wasnt that great at all. Very bland and seasoning was unevely distributed.
11/2/2014,1 star rating,"I wish I could write a review on how the food here but I've officially been waiting over 2 hours to receive my food. If delivery is not a priority for this place then they should really not deliver. I live maybe a 5 minute drive away from this establishment and have called twice about my order once at the 1 hour mark and the second time at the 2 hour mark. When I called the second time whomever answered the phone said ""2 HOURS!?!?!"" as if they were as confused as me. Then checked my order and said ""the order is in route."" Thats it? No sorry for the delay etc. etc. etc. just your order is in route. I can not recommend you ordering from this place EVER. There is no way my food will be hot by the time they get here. I am pretty sure I will have to call for a refund.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE"

10/7/2015,3 star rating,"First, I'll say the food was really great & the dessert (coconut cake & banana pudding) was truly amazing, best I've ever had. But, what prevents me from giving 4 or 5 stars to this establishment is the lack of organization. **If you place an order, do not go outside, wait inside and make sure your order is not forgotten and accurate**On the day I went, the place wasn't even completely packed, there were about 6 or 7 people there. And There were about 4 or 5 workers squeezed into that small area behind the register, unfortunately these employees weren't exactly in sync. Even though one worker at the register wrote down on the ticket how I wanted my seafood seasoned, the cook clearly did NOT read it because he says he didn't know of my request. I told him that my request for jerk seasoning was written on the ticket and he shrugged. Ultimately, I waited 30 mins to get one order of crabs (which was not jerk seasoned) bc other customers would ask to get their stuff out of the steamer before the timer ended and then my stuff was forgotten & pushed to back."
3/26/2016,1 star rating,"I would give this place a 0, but because I cannot I have to give it 1 star, but make NO mistake, this place doesn't deserve 1 star. I read the reviews before patronizing this place and wanted to check it out myself. Folks, believe the reviews! I cannot believe that this place is still open. Please take note that I am calling it a ""place"" and not a restaurant for a reason. Consumers need to ban together and shut this place down and make a statement on what happens when you open up a ""restaurant"" and have unacceptable slow service. The health department should shut down this place down because its frankly disgusting. You have the owner (tall, black dude) who does NOTHING, but walk around in the little, cramped ""restaurant."" I witnessed so many things in this restaurant while waiting on the line 30 minutes just to place an order. Then you wait another 30 minutes to get the food. The owner just walked around and it NEVER once occured to him to put on some gloves and get his ass to work. I am all about supporting black owned businesses, but c'mon the service sucks and the food is NOTHING to write home about. The oil looked dirty and stale. I saw an employee cleaning the windows with windex over the raw seafood. People walking around where you cook the food with no gloves, sweat pouring down their face. It was simply DISGUSTING. At one point, the owner opened the steamer to get something out of it and burned himself by first, not wearing the appropriate pot handles to retrieve very hot food from the steamer and two, being so akward with retrieving the item from the steamer that he spilled the gravy all over the floor. I never saw anyone (in the 30 minutes I was there waiting for my food) come with a mop or something to clean up the floor. Again, how is this business still open?? I live in the area and I remember seeing how disorganized it was to get it open and up and running and its as equally as disorganized now that it is open. Simply Horrible. I woud not recommend anyone patronizing this place. This is not a restaurant that can cater to a large volume of people. Simply ridiculous. My advice to the owner- do better or shut it down or you will be forced to shut down!!! My advice to potential customers and/or customers who patrionize this place currently-Stay away! Its not worth it. I almost forget to add that this place DOES NOT accept credit cards. You must pay in cash. Now, you tell me....does this place deserve to remain open in 2016 when they cannot invest in the ability to accept credit cards."
10/4/2015,3 star rating,"I went to this restaurant at the urging of my daughter who follows a fan of the restaurant on instagram. I was impressed with the fresh seafood selection and the variation of the sauteed ingredients.  I selected Bosa fish and Colossal Shrimp to be deep fried. My fish was prepared with some unknown spices and was good; however, it was the shelled and not deveined colossal shrimp that I was unsatisfied with the cooking method.  When I inquired about the shrimp being deep fried, I was told it was lightly battered, but it was not.  Who in their right mind doesn't de-shell shrimp for frying and clean it for that matter!"
7/25/2015,1 star rating,"They are the worst. Went in there to order the lobster tail stuffed with shrimp and the girl looked at me like I was crazy. She didn't even know what I was talking about! I told her to look at the menu where it clearly states that what they serve. She was like ""okay, let me see if they can do that."" She then turns around ask one of her co-workers if that can be done. He said ""Yeah, we can do that."" As if it's a special order. ITS ON YOUR MENU!!! so he then goes to the back brings out a huge lobster tail saying ""we can kill a man with this!"" And tries to sell it. Um no. The menu says it $25 for the tail stuffed with shrimp and you want to cut me a deal and sell it to me for $40 dollars!! REALLY?? They were totally unorganized and ill prepared to do what they say they can do. I rather fry up a chickens ass before I ever to eat there. Black businesses want support from one another but then turn around and act shady. FUCK THAT."
11/30/2014,4 star rating,I visited the establishment on my day off to get the licious fish and chips that are made out this supreme place. the fish was fresh  and the ambience was clean everybody was polite I'm going back 100 more times. But please know that your order may take a while they have a number where you can call the order in.
11/2/2014,1 star rating,"Worst customer service and delivery ever! I called to place an order and was asked to hold for quite a whole while the employee yelled and cussed at his staff before taking my order. I placed an order for delivery at 3:45pm. An hour later my food hadn't arrived so I called the restaurant to find out status of my order. I was told my food was on the way and informed they'd ran out of corn. An hour later my food still hadn't arrived. I called the restaurant and was told the delivery guy was on a bike and got hit by a car an was taken to the hospital.  He asked if I still wanted my order and told me they'd ^) have to remake it and send it with a driver. 10 minutes later my food arrived with a delivery guy on a bike.  I asked him if he was the one who got hit by a car and he said I didn't get hit I almost did. He told me my total was $18, however online the tilapia dish was only $8. He said you can just give me $8. I handed him a twenty and he told me he didn't have change.  He said he'd go to the store to get change but asked if I watch his bike.  It was 40 degrees outside and I wasn't going to watch his bike. He should have had change!  I should have got my food for free!  Really disappointed with this place. Don't waste your time. The owner has no integrity! Who would lie about someone getting hit by a car an being hospitalized to trying to overcharge me!"
