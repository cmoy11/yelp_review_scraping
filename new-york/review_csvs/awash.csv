3/25/2022,4 star rating,"Alright folks review 500!! This was one of my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in NY, but they have been off lately. Started out with the service when I last went. It was very subpar, and then when I went a few weeks ago they didn't have the gluten free injera and the guy didn't seem to care... So yes I went to Haile Bistro, and they accommodated my needs. I truly am saddened because this was my true go to, and they were definitely 5 star. I would order the veggie sampler that you can order by how many people you have in your party. You can get 5 courses per person and I believe the prices vary from $19 to $57. Don't forget the avacado salad as well! I would also get their honey wine which was delicious. Almost forgot they do also have desserts. I believe it was Rum cake and carrot cake. I have never tried them personally but I have been with folks that have and they enjoy it. Probably one of my shorter reviews but I am just hoping the service changes so I can update them to the 5 stars I know they are!"
4/26/2022,3 star rating,"Our first visit here was awesome - food and service was exceptional! It was our first time having an Ethiopian meal and our server was very helpful when she was taking our orders. We were very impressed and so we told ourselves we're coming back for more. We came back again a few weeks later - on a Tuesday night around 6:45pm. We didn't have a reservation but saw that they had a few open tables. The lady said she couldn't take us as they were fully booked for dinner, but offered us the bar seats instead. When we got to the bar, I went to check their website and saw that I could make a reservation for 7pm, 7:15pm, 7:30pm, etc. I make the reservation and waited for a few minutes and showed the lady that I now have a reservation. We were seated right away as there were still about 5 empty tables. I heard the lady refuse to sit another couple after that. I was so turned off by that but of course, I didn't let it ruin my night. The food was still great - very flavorful and looks extremely appetizing on a shareable plate. But customer service on the second visit might make me not want to come back anymore."
4/15/2022,1 star rating,"HORRIBLE ""special kitfo"". Never heard/tested such a horrible thing. This is not our cultural kitfo at all. It is packed with raw onions and jalapeño and something else & all you feel like is throwing up. The supposed butter is actually some oil that stayed long and stinks. I couldn't believe what I was tasting and smelling. In addition to all of these, they didn't pack injera for the kitfo. My order was take out and I was stunned when opened the box. I think they wanted to take advantage of the extra 1 injera I bought for $3.25, assuming I would use that when I'm out of options. They were right, I ate that. So in essence I paid extra for this ""kitfo"" thing lol. They should be able to warn their customers if they customize the authentic ethiopian food. Plus their greed and low quality ingredients were all big disappointments for me."
6/8/2022,5 star rating,"It doesn't seem like much from the outside but the food was amazing and the service top notch. I highly recommend this place for great Ethiopian food. Go for a platter, you will thank me later."
1/20/2022,4 star rating,"Excellent Ethiopian food with options for all types of food preferences. Their vegan sample was to die for. Even the meat eaters liked it better than theirs (the doro wat had no flavor comparatively)! So many incredible, full flavors and the injera just absorbed it all so well. Their cocktails were also very unique and had a nice twist to them. Servers were very kind and made great recs. 4/5 stars because the service is usually quite slow (although everyone is super kind and as long as you're not in a rush it's just more reason to enjoy!), and the bathrooms were not clean. All in all, this is some of the best Ethiopian food in the area."
4/6/2022,4 star rating,"Ordered the meat combo with extra injera for $40 takeout to share for 3 people, and it was enough food and a good value. Everything was pretty good. The meat was a bit salty, and the red lentils were a bit firm, but otherwise it was all tasty. Wish we could've enjoyed the food in person."
10/7/2021,5 star rating,"Awash is one of the best Ethiopian places in the city. It's one of the first I had been to around here. This is a little different than Indian. It's not as spicy, but the food has flavor. There's lots of choices for vegans. Be prepared for how you're going to eat. It's one of those Ethiopian places where traditionally you eat with your hands. This saves them money on washing dishes, right? It has lots of vegetarian options. The food all comes on a platter. It's covered with a spongy injeera bread. This comes with a few rolls of the injeera. We had the Tofu Tibbets. It's about $15 and comes with some greens. This looked like it was spinach or something like that. As for the tibbets, they were good. These had a pretty spicy tomato sauce and the injeera helped soak it up, making it much easier to eat it. It was really good food. It gets busy even later at night. This is one of the few Ethiopian restaurants around here so if that's what you want try getting something from this."
10/11/2021,4 star rating,"First time trying Ethiopian food. We rode our bikes and arrived hungry. It was delicious! Eat with your hands because that's the way it's done! We asked our wonderful server Joy to pick whatever for us and this is what she chose. Great selection except for the chicken. It was dry and just meh. The rest of it was delicious! The beef was amazing and full of flavor, soft meat and just overall I wish I had a tub of it. The injera was wonderful. Soft yet had an underlying sour taste which I enjoyed with the food. We also got wine and beer! Small selection but good none the less. If we ever come back which we will, we will definitely come back to this lovely restaurant! Thanks Joy!"
9/9/2021,5 star rating,"My friend and I have heard great things about Awash and finally got the chance to try it. The spot has a dimly lit dining room with a relaxing vibe. There's outdoor seating too if that's your preference. We both ordered the vegan combination platter, which comes with your choice of 5 different vegetarian options. The platter is served beautifully laid out on a piece of injera. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. You definitely have to try the Mesir Wot and the Shiro if you order a combo platter. I could eat them for the rest of my life and never be dissatisfied. Although it was a hike to get up to 106th street, I'll definitely be returning. Totally worth the travel."
8/28/2021,4 star rating,"I've been to Awash twice, and both times I got the Awash Special. If you eat beef, you NEED to get this dish simply because of the Special Kifto. It is this spicy beef tartare that is soooo addicting. I'll go around the platter and try every dish, but I always come back to the Special Kifto. It is seriously so good. Between my two meals at Awash (several months apart) I have noticed some slight discrepancies. The first time, I had a delicious cabbage dish on the platter and I was a little disappointed when it wasn't included on the platter on my second trip to Awash. Also, I was under the impression that injera refills were free, as they were the first time I went to Awash- however, the second time I went, when we asked for extra injera, the waitress (rather rudely) said we would have to pay extra. Usually, injera has been complimentary at every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to. One additional note - I think the staff could be a little more liberal with the napkins, as Ethiopian food can get a little messy on the hands. Overall, though, amazing food! I will definitely be back."
5/11/2022,5 star rating,Best Ethiopian food I've had in a long time. The different assortments of dishes on one plate made for a good selection.
5/29/2022,5 star rating,Went here years ago. My recollection is it was awesome and I'd like to go back when in the area.
5/20/2022,3 star rating,OK so everything was good everything was fine we eat our food it was super good and super spicy everything was excellent until we tried to order dessert and off the bat they said that they don't have dessert even though there was a menu and then when we were talking and they said that you can't sit here guys have to leave because there's a reservation like you're just straight kicking us out I don't know but this is gonna have to be to stars I'm very sorry
8/25/2021,5 star rating,"Some of my best college food memories were of eating Ethiopian meals in DC with friends of all political stripes one summer. Liberal or conservative -- we all loved coming together over family style meals served over a huge round of injera, and eating with our fingers while debating topics as hot as our food.  Ethiopian food is a bit harder to come by in NYC, but there are a few well-known bastions of the cuisine, including Awash, which seems to serve the real deal. They even offer gluten free, all-teff injera, which tastes far better than my homemade renditions made from the recipe on the side of my Bob's Red Mill bag of teff. It has a really unique flavor and texture that's unlike the softer, more springy wheat-based injera typically served in Ethiopian restaurants in the US. We recently tried the tibs wat and doro wat combo served with three vegetable dishes of your choosing. Between two of us, we were able to try all the vegetables dishes on offer. The tibs wat and doro wat packed some serious punch. Not everyone is going to like the dryish texture of the beef in the tibs wat, or the chicken in the doro wat, but in my experience, this seems to be how it's made everywhere. (It's very similar to Indonesian rendang.) Although we liked the stewed meat, to us the best part of the meal were the plant based dishes. Ater Kik Alicha (yellow split peas cooked in a mild stew and seasoned with onions and herbs) were a nice respite from the spicy heat of most other dishes. This dish was made with small chickpeas, clearly soaked and prepped in-house, and not from a can. They retained a substantial amount of texture.Misir Wat (split red lentil stew cooked in berbere) was excellent and the resemblance to certain Indian masoor dal dishes was uncanny. Again, lentils retained a good amount of texture. (These kinds of lentils are typically made a bit softer in Indian cuisine.)  Shiro Wat (ground spiced chickpea and split pea stew, cooked with chopped tomatoes and onions) had a pretty similar flavor profile to the ater kik alicha, but was cooked to a slightly creamier consistency and was spicier. Atkilt Alicha (potatoes, carrots, and cabbages seasoned with herbs and spices in a mild stew) were tinged turmeric yellow. Enjoyable, not particularly exciting, but another nice option for cooling off your mouth in between bites of spicier things.  Key Sir Alicha (beets and carrots cooked with onions and flavored with herbs and spices in a mild stew) were made with firm, sweet beets, probably prepped from fresh beets. (This is labor intensive, FYI.) Really a nice, light, low-key dish. Gomen (chopped collard greens sautéed with ginger, garlic, onions, and herbs) introduced some important green vegetable matter, but in all honestly, were a touch bland. I didn't get much of the ginger (or perhaps my mouth was too spiced out by this point to detect it). By itself, it needed more salt, but did act as a nice foil for the salty tibs and doro wats. We also tried the beef sambusas, which came three to an order. These are thick pastry rolls made out of phyllo (or phyllo-like pastry) and moderately filled with beef. Flavors and textures were reminiscent of Tunisian or Moroccan cigars / cigares, but far thicker, rolled chimichanga-sized. The food isn't particularly photogenic by delivery, so know that if you dine in at the restaurant, everything is presented beautifully, with neat little scoops of each dish placed on different parts of the injera. The soaked-through injera you get to eat at the end is fantastic. Someone on the delivery website we used called this food, ""Gucci."" I have to agree. All those labor-intensive preparations = very, very Gucci."
11/28/2021,5 star rating,"We went to Awash for an early dinner on a Sunday night. At first, there weren't many other people there, but the restaurant started to fill up around 6:30. The environment of the restaurant was very nice and warm, and the waiters were very friendly. Although there was some music in the background, the overall ambiance was pretty quiet and good for conversation.We ordered a sampler platter for three people which included two dishes and 6 out of the 7 vegetarian samplers and two meat dishes (we chose awash chicken and yebeg alicha). There were a lot of options to choose from, but I would personally recommend getting a sampler to be able to try as many things as possible. One thing to know is that there is a $9 fee if you get a sampler for a smaller group of people than you are with. We were really satisfied with the food that we got. There was a large amount of variety, and they were all great. The food also came out relatively fast. Overall, I would definitely recommend trying out restaurant. I think it is a great option for good, casual Ethopian food in the area. The prices were reasonable as well. For a dinner for three, you are able to have a good portion for less than $20 (excluding tip). The waiters were also very friendly and patiently answered all of the questions we had. I will definitely recommend trying this place out. It's a great place to go for with a group, especially those who love to share! That being said, they also do have options for those who don't like to share as well."
5/9/2022,2 star rating,"The restaurant was empty when we arrived. The waitress told us to sit anywhere and brought the menu before going back to the bar. We asked for suggestions and she pointed out one beef item that not raw or spicy. Service was slow in a near empty restaurant. For someone not familiar with Ethiopian food, it would have been more helpful of the waitress to try to explain more of their dishes. Got the gursha for an appetizer. Not recommended, it was basically lentil and injera, which we also got with our meal. We ordered tib and doro wat. The tib was extremely tough, almost like chewing rubber and had no taste. The doro wat was only 2 pieces of small drumstick with one egg. That was not worth the price that was charged ($21). With the meal came a dish of injera, the lentil on the side was very firm. The waitress was busy on her phone by the bar and came quickly when we paid, otherwise we had to flag her down.  This is a great place to go if you just want to sit and chat with someone and not be bothered to order food or drinks. Perhaps we went during an off day."
8/19/2021,5 star rating,"Let me just sing the praises of my favorite. FAVORITE restaurant in NYC. Awash is home. Awash is joy. Ate it twice last week. Now order again for this week. I think I will have to order every week. I was feeling depleted and immediately began to crave it's healing spices and ghee. This is like family cookout. Look at this deliciousness. They don't know me but I love them. Sambusa - delicious. I've had lentil and chicken. Both awesome though I like lentil more. Miser wat- perfectly flavorful and wonderful spiceAterkilt - delicious cabbage and carrot. I love that they don't cook the heck out of it so the veggies still have texture! This is the way to do it! Beg Alicha - I will marry this dish. So juicy. So well prepared that I smile while eating it. It's like the comfort of a warm embrace from a good friend. You can TASTE the care they put into their food here. I need to marry the cook, only way I can ensure happiness for life."
8/15/2021,5 star rating,"Let me tell you. I've now had delivery from 4 different Ethiopian places within the 30 minute radius of me. (Places start with M, L, B, A)THIS PLACE IS THE BEST! Lamb is succulent and with bone so it's even more tender and just melts off. I thought that I hate gomen (Ethiopian collards) and atakilt (Ethiopian cabbage/carrots) ... turns out I just haven't had it done well because I LOVE IT! The veg still has texture and is so flavorful. One night I surprised my apartment neighbors who had been feeling unwell with an order of their food and they had never tried it before. They wouldn't stop talking about it for the whole week, and now order frequently! I've ordered from this place back to back nights even. Get a combo, get the lamb, get whatever because everything I have had has made my body feel so good and full of life. Remember, the ghee and spices are so good for your body. It's anti inflammatory and healing, a healing I can truly feel. I'd run around town in an injera costume singing their praises if they'd feed me for free haha. Until then, delivery!"
4/29/2021,3 star rating,"Awash Ethiopian Restaurant offers free delivery & large portions. The packaging was fine except for a small leak. I tried the 19$ meat combination and 12$ Timatim Fit-fit. The fit-fit was overly spiced & oily. The rest of the food was ok - but it was better the last time I tried it. Since so many restaurants are struggling during the pandemic, I give extra credit to those able to remain open. Overall it was ok."
5/22/2021,5 star rating,"We visited Awash after seeing online that it was one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Manhattan and after getting a recommendation from someone we know and it was great!We ordered the meat combo which comes with meat and vegetables and injera for 2 people and the sambusa appetizer which is a pastry filled with your choice of filling (we chose beef), as well as the Walia beer and honey wine. Everything was amazing! The atmosphere was so nice- we sat inside where the lights were dimmed and Ethiopian music was playing softly. Inside the light fixtures and decorations around were all beautiful. The staff was kind.Back to the food- in the meat platter every item, whether meat or veggie was seasoned differently so you really get so much variety! And everything tasted good and worked well together! The sambusa was delicious and had a great crunch to it- and was filled with heaping amounts of filling. The Walia beer was really good too. We will definitely be coming back here!"
10/29/2020,4 star rating,"This is a great spot for some delicious Ethiopian food! The best part is they do substitutions in their platters. We ordered vegetarian platters, the red lentil is a must try! We also ordered the lentil sambusa but the server didn't inform us and got us the vegetable sambusa as they were out of lentils! I have heard their lentil ones are delicious! The Ethiopian coffee and tea were good and went perfectly with the platter!"
3/17/2022,5 star rating,We were a party of 7 today (St. Patrick's day) and the place was packed. They seemed to be understaffed for the amount of people that were dining yet the service was impeccable and the food came out at a reasonable place and was delicious. Hands down great service and good food. Shout out to our girls that tan the place like a charm!
4/19/2022,4 star rating,"In my opinion, Awash is not as good as the now-departed Injera, which was my favorite, Howevwr, I am confident that Awash is the best Ethiopian restaurant in Manhattan left standing."
11/11/2020,4 star rating,"I had a great experience ordering from Awash this past weekend. I always order the gluten-free bread with beef, lentils, carrots/potatoes, beets, and collard greens. This restaurant has options for many dietary needs including. Vegetarian options. Vegan options. Pescetarian options . Options for those who have intolerances and allergies that aren't too severe This restaurant serves only deliciously prepared food and even to-go its served with top flavors and an impressive presentation. Although sometimes they miss a few details in your order, overall I would give this restaurant a great review."
10/16/2017,3 star rating,"This place is amazing! I would normally give a restaurant like this five stars. I was however disappointed by a few recent events. About a month a go I came to this restaurant with a few of my girlfriends and I had informed them ahead of time about my gluten allergy. They had told me it was fine and that they would make the bread ahead of time. However, halfway into my meal I noticed something wasn't right. I had been served the bread with gluten in it instead of the gluten free kind! I had then told them about my allergy saying they gave me the wrong bread. I understood it was a mistake but if someone had come in with an allergy worse than mine, that would have been serious neglect on their part. I had also come in recently with a friend but they had run out of the gluten free bread entirely. If you want to be cautious I would say remind them a few times, or maybe try a different location."
4/12/2021,5 star rating,"I order Awash for delivery over the weekend, and IT. WAS. AMAZING. I ordered the sambusas with chicken: flavorful chicken filling inside a crispy fried flaky pastry wrapper. I also ordered the doro wat (chicken) with three vegetable sides (chickpeas, red lentis, and yellow split peas). All three veggies were very good. But the doro wat was UNBELIEVABLE. The platter came with one piece of chicken as well as a hard boiled egg. The sauce was truly lifechanging.The total order for both was about $30 (plus tax/tip), and it lasted me THREE full meals (with a little bit still leftover at the end). All together a fantastic deal--this order fed me for the entire weekend. Will definitely order again."
1/3/2020,5 star rating,"I came to New York to attend a birthday dinner for my friend on a Friday night. I was really excited after finding out we would be eating at a an Ethiopian restaurant since I have never gone to one before and it had great reviews. Most of the guest shared a large meat plate but I decided to get a separate vegan plate because I am a pescatarian. Since there was so many of us, it did take a long time to get our orders out( but this was mainly our fault for not ordering timely). Despite all of the orders and confusions, the servers were still able to get everything out accurately.The food was amazing and flavorful! I overall enjoyed my experience at Awash and will definitely be coming back next time i'm in New York."
12/16/2019,5 star rating,"I haven't had a meal that slapped this hard in a while. My best friend frequents this place and decided to come here for a birthday dinner. They were extremely welcoming about hosting a group of 15 of us. Although the ordering process was complex because of how many of us there were, they still pulled it off with no error. I, and a few of the other guests, arrived here HUNGRY. From the first bite, I could tell this would be a very filling meal. All the meat and vegetable options were exploding with flavor. My favorite option would have to be the special tibs and Awash tibs though. I wasn't as big a fan of the lamb and chicken. Upon request, the waiter was also able to bring out a slice of carrot cake with a candle for the birthday girl, which was a very nice touch to the perfect evening. Not to mention the cake was actually amazing. Probably one of the best carrot cakes I'd ever tasted in my life. Might come back here just to get a slice of my own.By the time we left, I could barely walk out because of how stuffed I was. And to top it all off the price was extremely reasonable. It ended up amounting to about $23 per person (excluding the birthday girl of course). Probably one of the most successful birthday dinners I've been to in a while. Thank you Awash!"
10/17/2021,1 star rating,The food was pretty decent big problem was the service it was almost non-existent.  some of there more popular dishes were not available.
2/16/2021,4 star rating,"Very delicious food and drinks. You should definitely get a platter with a variety of things to try, just so you can taste the different preparation of Ethiopian food. The cocktails were nice and sweet, how I like it. I went during a very cold day and yet still, the air conditioner was on blast. The food went cold quickly and it was harder to enjoy this experience when I was shivering. There was even a group of people who came in and quickly left because it was so cold inside, they said even colder than outside! That was the only crappy part of the experience. Everything else, even the service, was great."
7/10/2021,5 star rating,Perfect as always! The samplers here are generous with portions and give so many different flavors in one meal. Could live off the injera

2/27/2021,1 star rating,"I ordered the Veggie Combo, one word Nasty!! I paid $27 dollars for cold, bland vegetables, with non seasoned lentils, collard greens with not a bit of salt! Beets that were too sweet, and the "" bread "" that i guess you're supposed to use to dip , had a weird texture, and tasted ""lemony"" and bitter, ugh... I walked in, ordered, and while waiting, people were outside, inside, and coming in for pickup, I'm still scratching my head trying to understand, why???Anyhoo, I cook way better than AWASH! Wanted to try something different  in my neighborhood, I guess this was not it, walk on by the UWS location, and save your money!! SMDH!"
2/22/2021,5 star rating,"I really love the food here. So delicious, go try it out if you haven't already. You won't regret it. Only downside was the server our last visit seemed to have forgotten us at some points but the food honestly made me forget about that."

The fit-fit was excellent, and I really enjoyed both meats on the combo, as well as the shiro wat. I wasn't crazy about the lentils. Their injera bread is fantastic."
1/14/2021,5 star rating,Good people here. Outdoor sitting was nice but the heaters weren't enough for the cold. Not there fault of course just that covid sucks. They offer takeout.

8/18/2020,5 star rating,"All the food here is delicious, but the vegetarian options at this spot are just ridiculously wonderful. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the food is all super flavorful. Also recommend the delicious honey wine!"
8/16/2020,5 star rating,So good! Hands down one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've been to. I've shared the vegan platter here 2x with a friend.  Portions are great especially for the price. They give you all of the vegan sides except the tofu. I couldn't stop eating. Its byob but there's a corking fee so we've just ordered drinks here. I came here recently during covid times and they have 4 or 5 tables outside.  They thoroughly clean the seats and tables and bring you sanitizer when you sit. Can't wait to go back!
8/2/2020,4 star rating,Update*** since my first review I e been here several times.  Its now my favorite Ethiopian restaurant. The service is good and the food us eff green better
9/1/2017,1 star rating,This place is right in my hood but I've never gotten the opportunity to dine with them until tonight. My family of 3 walked in. Took them a total of about 25 mins to seat us and have the waitress come over to us. I will say that the food smells really good. But we didn't get to order because after making us wait the 25mins we were told the their card machine wasn't working and at the current time they were only accepting cash. Complete disappointment.  I just walked out. But the food smelled good enough that I may give them another try at another time.
6/9/2020,3 star rating,Such a difficult process getting delivery tonight. They said it would be here in 1:20 but it took almost three hours. And the menu online didn't match what they actually had available. And YET... the food was really good.
6/9/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious! Great food Great staffGreat locationGreat sceneryGreat everything!
6/7/2020,5 star rating,"This is my favorite restaurant in NYC!!! As a vegetarian, I get the vegetarian combo platter every single time and it NEVER disappoints. If you're vegetarian or vegan (all the veggie dishes are vegan), then I definitely recommend the platter so you can try all the veggies out. The food is so flavorful and filling and the portion size is really generous. I highly recommend. The staff is also super friendly. I can't go too long without eating at Awash because it's just my favorite food ever. Definitely go there!! They also do delivery and takeout, which is especially great during Covid. Support them!!"

5/10/2020,4 star rating,"Went to Awash for lunch with a friend who was visiting NYC to get his Visa straightened out before heading off to Russia to do his dissertation research. I ordered the Special Tibs (beef) with collards and beets, and he got Doro Wat (chicken). We shared the Misir Wat (lentils). Solid choices, everything was delicious. I'd never seen beets on an Ethiopian menu before so I was surprised, but since I love them this was a good thing. They went well with the collards."
2/27/2021,1 star rating,"I ordered the Veggie Combo, one word Nasty!! I paid $27 dollars for cold, bland vegetables, with non seasoned lentils, collard greens with not a bit of salt! Beets that were too sweet, and the "" bread "" that i guess you're supposed to use to dip , had a weird texture, and tasted ""lemony"" and bitter, ugh... I walked in, ordered, and while waiting, people were outside, inside, and coming in for pickup, I'm still scratching my head trying to understand, why???Anyhoo, I cook way better than AWASH! Wanted to try something different  in my neighborhood, I guess this was not it, walk on by the UWS location, and save your money!! SMDH!"
3/14/2019,5 star rating,"After checking in to our hotel in West Central Park, my partner & I scoured reviews of local Ethiopian restaurants and ultimately decided on Awash's based on proximity and positive reviews.Upon entering we were greeted by a friendly woman and were sat right away. After a glance at the menu, my partner & I decided on the awash tibs and the special kitfo. According to our waitress, the special kitfo is unique to their restaurant so we were intrigued. As we waited for our meal, music Ethiopian blared, but we didn't mind as heightened our anticipation. Once our meals came they were served traditionally on a large platter. Both items that we ordered were delicious! The awash was especially tasty and probably the best and most tender tibs we've had. The kitfo was good too, but it's important to note this dish is served tartare (raw). We will definitely be bookmarking this establishment and visiting again! Give it a try!"
4/7/2017,3 star rating,"So hubby and I are sitting across the street having a drink waiting for them to open. As  per the lady when we first went there, they open at 12:30 pm. Ok we wait. We ordered a drink. Having a bird's eye view of their place and their silver guarded she'd isn't up. It's not past 12:30 pm. I called and now they say they're opening at 1:00 pm. Ugh.As we decide at 12:50 pm to pick another spot, we suddenly see they opened their gates. My husband convinced me to give them a try. Turns out they had a water problem and they were trying to dry their carpet. Ok I understand things happened and yesterday was a horrible storm. The waitress that served us is very sweet."
1/7/2018,4 star rating,"You would love Ethiopian food especially if you are a vegan.Last December I missed my flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, so I stayed one night in Addis Ababa and had dinner and breakfast there. I loved the vegan breakfast buffet at my hotel and was craving Ethiopian ever since I got back to NYC. So I came here with a friend. I ordered Yatakilt Alicha (cabbage, carrots and potatoes) with split peas and beets as sides and my friend had a beef dish. Both of them were really good, and as we were really hungry, we finished our food in less than 20 minutes! Today was such a cold day, and we ran here, so our server brought us hot water while we were waiting for the food. I would love to come back and try the collard greens dish."

The spices are perfectly balanced with the ingredients' natural flavors, and the injera is just the right level of moist and spongey. Service was fantastic--really funny and nice staff."
6/9/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious! Great food Great staffGreat locationGreat sceneryGreat everything!
9/3/2016,5 star rating,I am a huge fan of Ethiopian cuisine and enjoyed Queen of Sheba.  I always wanted to try Awash and we went today to celebrate my buddies birthday.  The injera here is very nice as it melts in your mouth while you are absorbing all the food and flavored with it.We tried the Lamb Yebeg Alicha which is a lamb stew with the lamb on the bone.  This was amazing. A great taste and even better texture.Next was the Chicken Alicha. You may see a trend. For both meats we wanted it on the bone and not deboned. This was so tender and it fell off the bone.The red lentil vegetarian dish was also very tasty. I would order it every time.The ultimate dish was the special kifto.  A lovely slightly spicy steak tartare. Absolutely amazing and you have t try it.  I always order this and here it was great.Service was decent and friendly.  Hate to see it when they are busy.  The honey wine was a bit fresh but the Ethiopian lager was great.Check this place out.  You will love it.
9/29/2020,5 star rating,Great Ethiopian food! Try the veggie platter. They're open to you substituting our things you may want more of (less Misr Waat and more Gomen).
11/23/2019,5 star rating,"I LOVED this place- we got the sampler to share so that I could try everything, and I thought it all tasted fantastic. My favorite was the lamb, but everything else was a close second. I don't think there are many Ethiopian places in Manhattan, but this one is worth the trip uptown."
8/19/2018,3 star rating,"3.5*Not a bad place to try some new food styles. We tried combo 1. I can tell the food here is very stylish. Multiple ingredients(meat and vegetables) are put on a flat injera. To be honest, the injera is a little bit too sour for me. However, in combo one, I like the chicken and beef gravy sauce. They taste very good. Beets are also included in combo one. They are like the little sweet dessert for this dish.The service here is barely not very passionate. As I said before, it is always nice to try something new. This place is a good place to give it a try."
8/24/2019,4 star rating,"Ethiopian food is very close to Indian food. And that has ensured that I try more than a few ethiopian restaurants. Awash, by far, is my favorite place for Ethiopian food in NYC. Although the ambiance isn't fancy, the taste of the food here is immaculate. The service is very prompt. The restaurant is huge and can easily hold a lot of people. I've never encountered a wait time of more than 10 min here. For beginners - it's recommended you take the platter which allows you to taste all the entrees available. Also, make sure you also eat the injera that the entrees are served on. The spices of the entrees get soaked in the injera and the subtle flavor of these spices are amazing. For vegetarian lovers - do try the Shiro and Yemissir Kik Wat. The Ethiopian coffee is also fairly good."
3/16/2018,4 star rating,"First time trying Ethiopian food. Got the beef combo. The place was a good experience. Overall, will try a different place to compare experiencesPro- some of the food was flavorful and the veggies seemed fresh. Really loved their carrots and their chicken!- got sat down right away (6:30 pm Friday)- their blackberry honey wine went well with the spicy veggies we gotCon- we didn't even touch the spinach as it lacked flavor :( just felt mushy- this restaurant is awfully cold... we had to wear our jackets. Saw portable heaters here and there, but not sufficient to warm up the whole place- injeras had to be constantly asked for as they gave us 4"
1/1/2020,4 star rating,Food was great but took them a really long time to process our bill. A bit understaffed.
5/10/2018,4 star rating,"Second time ever having Ethiopian food and this place did not disappoint!  It did take a long time for the food to arrive to our table but it was so delicious. The injera melts in your mouth and is super spongy. My husband and I take a trip every year to NYC, so I cannot wait to visit again this year. Photos are from 2017."
3/19/2018,3 star rating,"I had never had Ethiopian food before coming here and I have to say it was pretty good. The sambusas were flaky and incredibly yummy, and would have loved to have more. Eating with nothing but your hands (and the help of injera bread) was weirdly enjoyable - it sorta released the inner kid inside me. My husband and I got the meat combo and chose three veggies as a side. My fav was definitely the lamb and the lentils, but everything was very flavorful and delicious. Be ready for spicy food (and a bit messy of course) and new spices, I can tell you that much - my stomach definitely needs time to get used to these new flavors. Nevertheless, I'd recommend anyone to try it! The main reason for giving three stars is the fact that the place could def use a little spruce up and def some music to set more of a vibe. Service was fine, a little slow but I wasn't in a hurry. I believe they have two more locations, one downtown and one in Brooklyn - i might try one of those next time, just to compare the vibe (and the food). All in all it was a good experience, and would def give it another go - once my stomach settles and gets used to the spices and flavors."
3/28/2018,4 star rating,"I tried reaching out to Injera and Ghenet but had bad experience w.both setting a reservation for 16 people (for my b'day) so I was so surprised when I reached out to Awash and they were so accommodating.  The owner is the sweetest lady u will ever meet and I was very happy to give her my business. I ordered a cpl of meat combos, the veggie combo, sambusas, a lamb and a chicken dish, and some honey wine.  Most of my friends had never had Ethiopian food before but now I converted them all, as everyone loved their meal!We had an amazing time and the staff did a good job w.my group so I would enthusiastically recommend this spot!!!  Enjoy!"

9/1/2017,1 star rating,This place is right in my hood but I've never gotten the opportunity to dine with them until tonight. My family of 3 walked in. Took them a total of about 25 mins to seat us and have the waitress come over to us. I will say that the food smells really good. But we didn't get to order because after making us wait the 25mins we were told the their card machine wasn't working and at the current time they were only accepting cash. Complete disappointment.  I just walked out. But the food smelled good enough that I may give them another try at another time.
11/6/2017,4 star rating,"Very solid Ethiopian restaurant in Upper Manhattan. Elegant yet cozy atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. Their tables are covered with white tablecloths and complemented with a vase of real red roses.Their prices can be on the pricey side (especially if you go for dinner), but ethiopian food is typically more expensive in general. If money is a concern, I would recommend going for lunch. They have great (and flexible) lunch specials and will still serve a wide variety of food.I have been here on several occasions now and I have fully enjoyed it each time."
1/20/2020,4 star rating,"Starts to get crowded and really busy after 6:30pm. Only two staffs outside that help sitting customers down, dealing with orders, serving and cleaning  up so they can  often miss you especially when it  gets really busy so just remind or wave (night need to try to get their attention for a bit at times) but it's okay. Very friendly and willing to answer any question you have about the menu. Two restrooms (one for men and other said women) but both have a toilet so technically you could use either, especially if you are in a hurry (no one would mind). Quality a few options to choose from for food and drinks. Good portion size and tasty food. Samplers are a good choice, love the raw beef. Lamb is delicious and they have rice that you can order if you aren't used to the flavour of sour dough. I love it though and I always enjoy eating Ethiopian cuisine. Did lights, quite a few tables and chairs, get crowded later on but still not completely squeezed with other people so  it's good, not hard to find, walkable to the 1 train (4-5 blocks) and nice atmosphere. It's a restaurant I'd come back to, and the price is still pretty reasonable"
8/30/2017,5 star rating,"I have been to Awash multiple times over the last few years and it always lives up to my expectations. This time I took some friends and they loved it too. The Awash special is flavorful and full of spices, just the way it should be. The only thing I would say is that I think the quantities are being reduced and that leaves too much injera and not enough of everything else."
11/6/2017,4 star rating,"Good food. Went with a group of seven. Good fun place to go with people you're comfortable with since you'll be eating with your hands, but they do give forks if you ask. We all got the combo. The chicken dish was the spiciest. All the veggie dishes were delicious. Beets were good. They can sometimes taste really earthy but it was cooked perfectly here. So was the cabbage and potato dish (i think that's what it was). They don't take reservations but we were seated within 20 min for a busy Saturday night around 8pm. Good service too."
11/18/2019,4 star rating,"YUMMMMM. I went here months ago and kept forgetting to review it, even though I think of it at least once a week. My bf is not as into Ethiopian food as I am, which is such a sad shame. I got the vegetarian platter and just had the time of my life eating with my fingers enjoying all the amazing flavors. Nicely priced and delicious."
10/13/2018,1 star rating,"Decent food but quite expensive and very inattentive service. We waited 20min and nothing came. I called someone to ask why, then it turned out they'd never put down our order at all. When our food did come, they didn't give us any utensils. I waved at a waitress and asked for utensils, she glanced at our table and walked to another table to take their order without taking any measure herself or telling anyone else to get utensils for us. Extremely RUDE and simply incomprehensible. During our entire time there, it was very hard to get any server's attention. Their service is not simply inattentive--the problem is their service is so bad that it doesn't even make sense. Having simply forgotten our order, and not giving us any utensils(they don't have any utensils on the table in the first place, which is already strange)--I don't know what other word to use besides ""incomprehensible"".The food is only decent but far from being able to justify even the price, let alone the service. As I am writing this, I wonder why I left a tip at all. Anyway, I will never be going there and neither should you. There are plenty of other Ethiopian restaurants around. This one is to be avoided."
1/12/2019,4 star rating,"Came at an extremely busy hour; my friend and I were asked to move to another table in order to accommodate a larger party who needed two tables to be merged.  It was quite hectic as we didn't receive our drinks until some time had elapsed.  The timatim fit-fit was an interesting appetizer, as it had a mix of vegetables along with pieces of injera bread; there was sharpness along with bite from the jalapeños.  The meat combination had a balance of meat and vegetable elements; I enjoyed the beg alicha, or stewed lamb portion as it wasn't too game-y.  The special tibs were milder and didn't have as overpowering of a flavor as the tibs war.  I preferred the atkilt alicha among the veggies, as the potatoes worked in concert with carrots and cabbage.  Ethiopian coffee was very fragrant."
4/9/2017,4 star rating,"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it was delivered (my fault, I think it would be better to experience it in-restaurant). I tried the Meat combo, served with 3 vegetables (I went with potatoes/carrots, lentils, and chickpeas). Everything tasted great! It was my first time experiencing injera (a sour flatbread used to scoop up the dishes): super interesting texture. The lamb and beef dishes were amazing! Chicken, chickpeas, and potatoes/carrots were solid. The lentils were a bit heavy on cardamom for my liking, but not bad."
1/14/2021,5 star rating,Good people here. Outdoor sitting was nice but the heaters weren't enough for the cold. Not there fault of course just that covid sucks. They offer takeout.
4/29/2017,5 star rating,"Ridiculously good.I have been to Awash multiple times over the last few years and every experience has been great. The food is always amazing and delicious and the servers are friendly.Whenever I go, I usually get the create your own combination (2 meats, 3 veggies). I think it is safe to say I've tried every veggie dish on their menu (except the string beans). They are all amazing. I especially like the shiro (chickpea) and gomen (collard greens). My favorite meat dishes are the Special Tibs, Doro Wat, and Doro Alicha. SERIOUSLY YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THE CHICKEN. It's amazingly tender and fall of the bone succulent. I like the Special Tibs because the spice gives it more of a kick (although not a very big kick).Honey wine is also delicious and goes great with the meal. Last time I went I also had the Azifa appetizer, which was delicious but not as spicy as I hoped it would be.In short, Awash is a fantastic restaurant with great food and drink and very reasonable prices. I will be back in the future I'm sure."

7/12/2019,1 star rating,"When I go to a restaurant mid week with 5 people I expect a discount.  Restaurants in Manhattan are a dime a dozen and midweek is the worst for them.When I got to Awash not only did I not get a discount, I got a menu that says mandatory 20% tip for parties over 5.  I am VERY ANTI-FORCED TIPPING.1.  There should be no tipping as the waitress is not my employee, the owner should be paying her-not me.2.  Putting that aside, since in our society, we do tip, it should never be mandatory as that just usually encourages shit service.3.  Even if you get good service forced tipping leaves a bad taste in my mouth and then I don't go back and you go out of business and your friends all say, ""Oh my god, I can't believe you couldn't stay open you're food was so good"". 4.  Well now you now why, once again restaurants are a dime a dozen and good ones are a quarter a dozen.  So the fact that this restaurant's food was good and the service was good too, they get 1 star and I'd never go back!  PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES AND DON'T EXPECT ME TO!  AND you have a nerve making it mandatory 20%.  I would have left but one of the other people picked out the restaurant.  Luckily, they won't be going back anymore either now that I explained why this policy is so anti consumer!"
1/3/2019,4 star rating,"Newly renovated restaurant in the city. If you didn't know about this place, you would definitely miss it but I'm glad we stopped in! The food was full of flavor and everything we got was delicious. We ordered a chicken dish, a chickpea dish and two appetizers and was more than enough food for two people plus left overs to split for lunch the next day. Highly recommend if you're looking for something different and new! Be prepared for to eat with your hands and enjoy the experience."
8/18/2016,3 star rating,"I came here with a group of four for dinner on a Monday night. The decor is simple, but welcoming. I especially liked their lamps. Our group enjoyed the food a lot, but the service left something to be desired. We wanted to have a nice, relaxing meal, but ended up spending a couple hours there, mostly waiting. The food took about 45 minutes to come out and even getting the bill took at least 10 to 15 minutes. There was only one waitress working the floor that night, so maybe they were just understaffed that night, but it really wasn't a busy night in the restaurant.As for the food, it was really enjoyable. We ordered the Vegetable Combination Platter for 4 and it was, of course, and enormous amount of food. The injera was incredibly thick, fluffy and delicious. We got a plate of it on the side and didn't even finish it, it was too much. I really wish I was able to tell the different dishes apart on the platter, but they were all very good so I guess that doesn't matter. The beet dish stuck out, as it was more recognizable and sweet, which contrasted greatly with the sourness of the injera. I also liked the little fresh kale and chopped tomatoes that they put in the center of the plate.I want to rate this place higher, but the dining experience was really not on par with the food. It was also incredibly hot and humid outside that night, but unfortunately Awash didn't seem to have air conditioner on in all parts of the restaurant. It was bearable inside, but more uncomfortable than I would have liked. Also, there were ceiling fans, but for some reason they weren't on."
1/7/2020,4 star rating,Food was great and old school atmosphere.  I'm not that familiar with Ethiopian food but this seemed legit.  Service was a little spotty.

Everything was very tasty (shiro and mesir wat were delish) but the fasiola was hands down the best I've ever had!! Their cocktail menu is also very unique, with many featuring Ethiopian honey wine. Service was quick and the staff kind. I'll be back for sure!"

2/29/2020,2 star rating,"They don't read or follow their own menu.  Waitress is pushy, trying to up-sell.. making up rules like I can't pick my two veggie sides during Lunch, the chef chooses, even though it clearly says in the menu that I can choose... Went in for the Doro Wat and it didn't come with the hard boiled egg as stated the menu and I've seen pictures of it with egg on Yelp.  They are very, very, very stingy with the Doro Wat, I got one tiny little piece of chicken and small scoop of the berbere sauce.. (see photo). It was good.. a little over spiced but I haven't had it in a long time..  but, How outrageous is it to not include what's a key part of the dish, the hard boiled egg?  Customers know what comes in Doro Wat, they shouldn't discriminate..  Get the beef or lamb tibs, I think you get more than one chunk of meat, as they seem to push that more on their menu..  and just get Dinner there, they really hate on you if you get lunch... And go somewhere else to get your Doro Wat."
8/25/2018,4 star rating,"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I found it a unique and enjoyable experience. The best part was that the meal was communal. A large spherical flatbread (called injera) is placed in the middle of the table, with multiple vegetables and meat placed on top. To eat, you pick up a rolled piece of injera, tear off a piece, and wrap it around whichever ingredients of your choice. While a little messy, it's pretty fun being able to eat with your hands and share the experience with friends.I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, and to be honest, a lot of the flavors were indistinguishable in my mouth, but there were a lot of different spices and flavors. Injera has the texture of spongecake and the taste of sourbread, allowing it to soak up the flavors of different ingredients. We ordered several spicy meats and the spice level was comfortable for me personally, but I would caution that it's above mild. I do wish they gave more pieces of meat though.The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice, dimly lit with candles in the middle of the tables for a more romantic atmosphere. When we arrived at 6:30 pm (on a Friday), the place was empty, but by 8 pm, the place was packed to the point where after we finished eating and lingered chatting, the server told us politely that another party was waiting for our table. The wait time for the food was a little long, about 20-30 minutes, but the server was very nice and attentive, and I would definitely bring friends back."
5/21/2018,4 star rating,"I really liked Awash. I didn't know what to expect with Ethiopian food, and I have to say I was really happily surprised. Navigating the menu is a little bit complicated. Thankfully they have the ""confused white guy combination platter"" which is a mix of a bunch of different stuff.The food, as you can see from the photos here, is served on this kind of crepe that is spongy and has a bit of an after taste. You use bites of it to pick up meat and veggies that are in sauces.It was all really delicious. The one thing I didn't like was the honey wine and coffee drink, but there was nothing particularly wrong with it...just not to my taste.Service was really friendly, prices were more than reasonable and the place was clean. I would absolutely return to Awash"
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"My fiancé and I enjoy coming to Awash. It's been a month since I've been here but I'm here now and the first thing i noticed was their change in menu format. It is MUCH EASIER to follow. Well played. The dish we usually get is what is called the Vegetable Sampler with a side order of Special Tibs. The vegetables we choose: Shiro, Gomen, Misir, Ater Kik Alicha, & Key Sir Alicha. The Shiro is my favorite!!"
6/24/2018,5 star rating,Super cute restaurant.The place is cozy and quiet; perfect for a date night or just a small group dinner. The prices are reasonable for the area. The food and service were excellent and fast. Will definitely be back!!
8/1/2019,2 star rating,"Worst service from an Ethiopian restaurant I've ever had. First, we waited A good 45 minutes before being waited on. They straight up ignored us, not even stopping to get our drink order. So after flagging down a waitress, who was visibly annoyed, they come and take our order.  The food didn't take that long to get to the table, and was quite good, but the servings are teeny tiny and they give you 4 rolls of injera- definitely not enough for three people. So we asked for a few more servings of injera and one of the waitresses (older lady with long braids) FLIPS OUT! She yells at us ""ok we will have to charge you because  you've already had two servings!!!"". I mean she yelled so loud patrons looked up from their meal and it got quiet for a sec. I'm not sure why they were so hostile. Anyway, despite all that I'd go again because the food is very good, one of the best in NYC. I've been here many times in the past and service was never that great, so I'm kinda used to it. But not so much the yelling (although it did make for a more authentic experience, having lived in Ethiopia in the past)."

Again, no. But they're friendly. And pleasant. And the FOOD! Love that injera (Spongy bread)! Went off my keto JUST FOR THAT! Had the special Kitfo- could she adequately explain what made it special? No , but I don't care- it was raw beef, spicy and delicious! The kale salad - any place that can make me enjoy kale? 5 stars right there. Coupled all this savory, Spongy goodness with a glass of cold mead Enat Tej (which seems like it's either an anagram for something naughty or a villain on Star Trek Deep Space 9) and paradise was attained, if only briefly. Will return as soon as I can find someone else to go with me who doesn't mind the exotic. (Read as: another 4 years) but I will be thinking about it nonstop until then!"
1/27/2019,1 star rating,"I don't like giving negative reviews but I'm so frustrated with the lack of good Ethiopian food in NYC that I think this might help Ethiopian eateries step up their game. I'm Ethiopian but, let me tell you, I don't have exceptionally high standards for Ethiopian food. I consider anything that I cook to be just fine, at the very least edible. The Ethiopian food I've had at Awash is NOT even edible and doesn't even remotely resemble good Ethiopian food. I've been here at least three times, hoping each time that the last time was just a one off-and it'll be better (I'm also sometimes just so overwhelmed with cravings for Ethiopian food that I just can't help but make bad decisions). What I've concluded after visiting a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in NY is that the meat just isn't properly sourced. In DC, all the meat comes from local butchers and tastes super fresh. And because there's a large Ethiopian population in the city, Ethiopian spices are readily available and easily flown/shipped in. In NY, the quality of the meat at Ethiopian restaurants is just terrible, it literally tastes like it comes from a low grade supermarket. And, I don't know if it's because there isn't as much access to real authentic Ethiopian spices, there's a ton of weird spice combinations that don't fit the traditional mold (like turmeric in tibs). In Ethiopia, the quality of any meat dish or curry/stew is often measured by the quality of the fermented clarified butter that goes into it and at NYC Ethiopian restaurants, especially Awash, the quality of the butter is just trash. I have a VERY hard time believing the restaurant owners and workers eat their own food. Kitfo is one of my favorite dishes of all time and I have vowed to never get it at a NY restaurant ever again. So, if you go, I advice you to avoid the kitfo at all costs and save your appetite for a restaurant like Dukem, Habesha Market, or Enat in D.C."
6/11/2019,5 star rating,"Since Massawa closed, I've been looking for another dope Ethiopian spot uptown and I've found it! My girlfriend and I ordered the shared meat platter and it was perfect and tasty. The texture of the injera was on point as well. Service is excellent. I'll be coming back. A lot."
11/18/2019,5 star rating,"Their special kitfo is fantastic especially when served with the ayib (cheese) side (they are often out of it). It is spicy, with the perfect amount of mitmita and salt."
3/30/2016,3 star rating,"I am a huge fan of Ethiopian food. I love the idea of eating with your hands and really connecting with what you are putting into your mouth. I was really excited to try this place but I was a little underwhelmed. I ordered the veggie plate for two. It comes with a choice of 5 veggies and a side of injera (Ethiopian bread). Gomen [collard greens] (B)The collard greens were cooked nicely. There was a bit of a crunch but they were slightly on the bland side and a little too watery for my liking. Yatakilt Alicha [cabbage, carrots, potatoes] (B)This was also on the bland side. The cabbage had a good consistency. The potatoes really didn't taste like much. It was a little creamy too which I found a bit odd. Yemissir Kik Wat [red lentils] (A)Super delicious. This was my favorite by far. It was a little spivey and savory. A little peppery and I could really taste the lentils. The consistency was really nice.Shiro [chickpeas] (A)This was delicious as well. I'm a huge fan of chickpeas. This had great flavor and great spices. It was more like a spread than anything but the texture did not bother me. Yater Kik Alicha [yellow split peas] (B)I really enjoyed the texture of this one. There were whole peas that were soft but had enough body to chew on. However, the flavor lacked spices and all I could taste were the yellow split peas  Injera [bread] (B)The bread was nothing special. I didn't eat much of it as I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't as tart and spongy and I would have liked (given that it is a sourdough)The staff is really friendly. Our waitress was great. The interior is funky and would be a great place to go on a date. They have really interesting lights with faces and paintings on the walls and above the bar. I think this would be a good place for some, but I am a lover of bold flavors and bold food. Most of the food I found here is on the bland side. I probably will not be coming back, but if you like Ethiopian food this place does it pretty well."
9/1/2019,5 star rating,"This is our go to neighborhood joint. We love the food, the service is great, we feel at home here. We usually come as an expanded family - grandparents, parents, and a very happy 2 year old - and get the vegetarian combo. We love it all: beets, cabbage, potato, lentils of various kinds, split peas, green beans, collard greens, fresh salad, and delicious injera, of course. Those who want meat, get it - it's usually pretty spicy - but most of us stick with the vegetarian (really, vegan) fair. There are couples having intimate meals and large groups celebrating and the place is good for all of us. Thank you, ladies of Awash, for taking such good care of us and feeding us so well."
11/12/2017,5 star rating,"We reached at closing time and requested for final order, but they didn't rush us at all. Hospitality: 5/5. I dropped and broke glass of honey wine and replaced wine immediately and didn't charge me for it. Ambience: very lively with Ethiopian dance music with red roses on table. Hygiene: very clean Food: 5/5 on spicy side and being Indian I love spicy. Staff: Very friendly and they customized order as per our need. They are extremely nice and non-pushy. We ate at peace even though we were last one. Definitely visiting again!"
9/12/2015,3 star rating,"Yay for lunch specials! The lunch special here includes even combination platters, so my friend and I got a combination platter each consisting of lamb, chicken, beef and four other veggie dishes I cannot remember (collard greens, red lentils, cabbage, yellow lentils). My friend and I were the only customers at the restaurant when we arrived on a Friday at around 12:30PM. Although it was her first time trying Ethiopian food, she liked it. I wished they had hand sanitizers at the table (as some other Ethiopian restaurants do), but I'm just being picky.The beef was the tastiest for me; I loved the spicy, sharp flavor. The lamb was the worst as it was not only boney (along with the chicken), but not at all tender; unless you like your meat very tough, do not get the lamb. The chicken wasn't all that good either as it was mostly bone that was incredibly difficult to pick at. And no boiled egg? (I've had boiled egg at all other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to?!)Though I have had better Ethiopian food elsewhere, I'm still thankful Awash is nearby enough that I can just walk over and get a quick fix. The food is very reasonably priced and service is friendly:)"

9/12/2016,3 star rating,"Went in friend to experience Ethiopian food for the first time! Concept of eating with hands isn't new to me.Food was ok...the veggies that we ordered were had somewhat of a sour taste. The chicken was also ok.If you just want to experience Ethiopian food once, go ahead check it out!"
3/2/2018,5 star rating,"We love this restaurant and we love this food. Yes, I can hear the jokes and questions come up every time I suggest this food to an Ethiopian-food newby.  Yes, they have had drought and famine but there is also rich agricultural land and a culinary tradition going back as far as any on the planet. The famine was more a result of a destructive war - now over as far as I know - and not the lack of arable land. Ethiopia is an ancient culture with art and music - which you will hear as you eat.If you're squeamish about communal eating this is NOT for you. The food arrives on a table-sized platter in mounds on an enormous pancake called Ingera. You eat the food with your fingers tearing off a part of rolled up Ingera and pinching the food into the bread. Part of the fun is seeing the beautiful pattern emerge as the food disappears. Each platter at Awash is a work of art. And the food is so good the platter appears quite rapidly. There are vegetables and grains such as lentils, collards, carrots and potatoes and chicken and meats in sauces that resemble South Asian and Middle Eastern spice palate but have unique notes such as Ber-ber, a spice from Ethiopia. We usually order a platter that includes a variety of dishes and includes at least one non-vegetarian. Doro Wat is a tender chicken dish the meat pulls easily off the bone into the ingera pocket. The lamb dishes are also wonderful. We love the Gomen Besiga which cooked with collard greens and a hint of cardomom. Try the Ethiopian beer."
10/19/2018,5 star rating,A little bit of a wait when we initially came in - but everyone was very courteous and attentive during the wait. Great venue for a quiet night.
2/21/2017,4 star rating,"Very good. Honestly, this was my first time having Ethiopian food, but my fiancé is always raving about it. So I decided to take her here for a surprise date night. It was great. We ordered the meat platter, which came with Injera, chicken, goat, beef, and it was delicious. The spices and sauces were really tasty and I was so full afterwards. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was very laid back."
8/24/2017,1 star rating,"I was  a fan of this place, honestly . To the point where I overlooked the attitude and poor service I'd get at times. But while the food is delicious, the prices keep increasing and don't match their online prices and the service is extremely poor. I've just decided I will no longer be going to this restaurant. Too much attitude , too long waiting time, general dismissive attitude towards customers.This is just to unprofessional for me."
9/2/2019,5 star rating,"My first try of Ethiopian food in the city. We ordered the meat platter for two. And it was delicious. Great service, staff were lovely. Also interesting and tasty drinks! Will definitely have to go back."
8/17/2015,4 star rating,"Food is awesome here. Definitely recommend a combo dish so you can sample as much stuff as possible (what I recommend everywhere). They also don't pander to neophyte taste buds, so be sure to request things mild if that's going to be an issue for you. I'm not a neophyte here but more of a wuss and can't take a lot of spice. Only problem is that the service can be really lackadaiscal (sp). You really have to make an effort to get water re-filled, an extra napkin, the check, etc. Again, to protest wage theft in waiter salaries, I always pay 20% tip, but here I was seriously tested."
6/9/2017,2 star rating,"Food is ok.  Some dishes are good, others are bland/lacking flavor.  Pretty standard Ethiopian food, nothing mind-blowing or exceptional. They are extremely stingy with the injera.  I like a lot of injera with my food and whenever I ask for it, I am just given one tiny rolled up sad looking piece, which appears to be torn in half. Indoor decor is tacky and outdated, as well.  It seems that they should invest in updating the place, especially since they've been in business for so long."
11/11/2017,5 star rating,Great habeshia food. Nice atmosphere. We had to keep asking for injera. They only brought 3 small rolls each time. We had to get more three times. But that let us see more of our incredible waitress.
12/30/2017,5 star rating,"So delicious -- my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the city at the moment.Don't come *too* hungry, as you'll wait a while between ordering and getting your food.And I recommend getting a plate for one: You seem to get more food per-person that way.I wish the doro wat were available as part of the meat combo, though there were plenty of other delicious options.They bring wet towels before *and* after dinner, a nice touch.Nice artwork on the walls, too."
8/17/2018,4 star rating,"We went as a party of 6 and we ordered the sampler for 4 and 2 appetizers. Food tastes amazing and the ambiance is cozy. 1 star off because of the service. The service is not bad per se, but it is very slow. For a busy restaurant like them, I cannot believe they only have two waitress."

10/9/2017,4 star rating,"I would give 4.5. Create your own combo-excellent. Special tibs-average. Small chunks of beef in a sweet and sour sauce. A little over cooked. Yebeg alicha-above average. Gamy lamb. The sauce is a little salty. Vegetarian-delicious. A lot of different kinds, all very savory. Injera-delicious. Soft and moist, soaked with different sauces."

8/6/2017,4 star rating,"The food is not bad. The service was super slow. And this being the first time we went there, the cuisine was brand new to us. I asked the waitress for recommendations, bt of no use. Besides, the service was not good. Super slow and hardly attentive."
10/28/2017,5 star rating,"This was my first time having Ethiopian food and they were really welcoming and even helped me pick out some items off the menu. I tried the honey wine. If you like sweet wine, it's very good. Definitely try the combination plates. Gives you a great breadth of things to try. Very much recommended for vegetarians or vegans. Lots of delicious dishes."
7/18/2019,2 star rating,"Astonishingly awful service. Food was good, although they got half our orders wrong and gave one person something he couldn't eat. It took 20 minutes to get an extra empty glass and it took 35 minutes to pay the check. I looked at my credit card charge today and the amount was wrong but only by $3 so I'm not pursuing it. Needless to say, I will not return."
3/29/2016,4 star rating,"Highly recommended! If you have a friend who has not been exposed Ethiopian foods, you should bring him/her to this place! Nice atmosphere and people, great foods. I love the sour bread and the meats&vegetables marinated with their unique sauces. Tips: you should eat with your hands, so don't go here for your first date!"
3/25/2017,5 star rating,"I absolutely love Awash. It is a small intimate restaurant. Awash is hands down the best Ethiopian restaurant in NYC. The food is authentic and delicious. The veggie combo is served with all my favorites and the portion size is very generous- well worth the price. Most important, the food is consistently good! I will say that service can be a little slow at times, but it is definitely a step up from a lot of Ethiopian restaurants. The waitresses are so sweet that it makes up for it. My only recommendation is that they sign up for UberEATS delivery service! I would order from here all the time if they delivered to my neighborhood!"
7/30/2018,4 star rating,I really enjoyed Awash. I started with a mimosa that had honey wine. It was delightful! Then salad. We shared a veggie and one with lamb. Great service too!
6/5/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious! I came here with a friend on a Saturday night around 9pm and the place was completely full. The staff are so sweet! We ordered the nonvegetarian and vegetarian combo, with the beef special tibs and lamb yebeg alicha. The combo comes with all of the vegetarian dishes, and unlimited injera. Every dish was delicious! I also had one of the honey wines, which was the best honey wine I've had. Definitely recommend getting some with your meal, the sweetness pairs well with the flavors in the dishes!"
6/25/2015,3 star rating,"It's not terrible, but I've had far better Ethiopian food. Got a combo which allowed limited choices. What I got was lamb, beef, red lentils, chick pea/lentils and beets/carrots/potatoes.  Everything came out looking pretty....The red lentils were by far the best of the grouping. They were delicious!The beef was very good however was mostly sauce.The beets/carrots/potatoes were underwhelming and virtually all beetsThe lamb was anything BUT tender. Dry, stringy, difficult to recognize as lamb. Reminded me of the first time I had goat. In a Nigerian restaurant with a Nigerian friend who was mortified at how horrible the goat was! (BTW...I have since had absolutely delectable goat...but I digress)The ground chick pea/lentils was over spiced ....NOT spicy though. It had the same spice as the beef dish, but with far too heavy a hand and as a result was inedible. Perhaps this is not usual for them.Overall, I was disappointed. As the lentils were do good, and there are so many other good reviews, maybe it was an off night? Hence 3 instead of 2 stars."
10/20/2019,1 star rating,"Worst dining experience I have ever had in Manhattan. We arrived at Awash for dinner on a Saturday night. I lived in east Africa for 3 years and have tried over 10 Ethiopian restaurants in the US. Awash being by far the worst. First, the waitress was rude and dismissive when I asked her about sides. I then placed my order, very clearly for Misir Wot as that is the dish I knew I would order before I even arrived. She then served us with Shiro, a dish I usually enjoy as a side but never as an entree. When I pointed out that this was Shiro and not Misir Wot, she argued that I had ordered the wrong thing. I believe she made a mistake and was banking on my not being Ethiopian to not know the difference. Unfortunately for her, I know my Ethiopian food. A more senior waitress asked her to update my order, which she did and the waitress proceeded to scold me when it arrived. The food was decent but overpriced, I would recommend Abyssinia in Harlem 1000x over this place. My boyfriend lives around the corner and Ethiopian is one of my favorite foods but I am NEVER going back and will tell anyone who will listen not to either."
5/5/2019,5 star rating,"Second time at Awash, and it still remains my favorite Ethiopian restaurant ever (even after LA, D.C., etc). Authentic menus, beautiful dishes, amazing cocktails - but stick to the honey wine. A traditional wine that compliments the complex flavors of all the food you'll be enjoying. Vegetarian dishes rock, but make sure to try the tibs and other meat dishes too. Lots of the sourdough flat bread (injerah) will be available to you, so don't be shy about asking for more! It becomes your utensils essentially, again adding to the fun of the cuisine and off-setting the complex spices with a tangy spongy flavorful experience. Wait times can be long on the weekends, but it's absolutely worth it. Wait staff is knowledgeable & if you're patient, they become warm and love to joke and help their customers have a truly authentic experience. 100% recommend!"
6/9/2020,3 star rating,Such a difficult process getting delivery tonight. They said it would be here in 1:20 but it took almost three hours. And the menu online didn't match what they actually had available. And YET... the food was really good.
9/30/2014,5 star rating,"Amazing food! I shared the veggie combo for three with two other people and it was more than enough - I even had some leftovers. I love that it comes on a big platter for sharing with what seems like a dozen different dishes to try. Friendly service, warm towels and a cozy ambience make this a place for the books!"
6/7/2020,5 star rating,"This is my favorite restaurant in NYC!!! As a vegetarian, I get the vegetarian combo platter every single time and it NEVER disappoints. If you're vegetarian or vegan (all the veggie dishes are vegan), then I definitely recommend the platter so you can try all the veggies out. The food is so flavorful and filling and the portion size is really generous. I highly recommend. The staff is also super friendly. I can't go too long without eating at Awash because it's just my favorite food ever. Definitely go there!! They also do delivery and takeout, which is especially great during Covid. Support them!!"
10/16/2017,4 star rating,"I came here with my bf at a friday night after a long search of restaurant because everywhere is crowded, here we finally find a position and I never tried Ethiopian food before. As asian, I have to say the food is very weird to me, in terms of the form of the food is made, the taste and the music. The material of the combination is quite ordinary, however, the way they are composed together creates very unique and special taste. The injera is a unexpectedly sore to me but after I got used to it, it was tasty. The lamb tastes also very good. We ordered a special ethiopian beer and some austria wine, which are all pretty impressive. The only dissatisfaction is that there are only two waitress serving about 40 people. It is not only slow but you also felt they are exploited, and why on earth don't hire more!"
9/11/2016,4 star rating,"We visited NYC for a day, at the end of which we had a hankering for some solid Ethiopian cuisine. Our Google and Yelp searches said ""Awash"" might be a good pick. So we got on the subway from the American Museum of Natural History, got off at Cathedral Pkway Station, and walked about half a mile to the restaurant.We were greeted really well, with smiles and warmth. Our waitress took our drink and food order with the prerequisite small-talk, and we waited while admiring the modest yet interesting decor. This restaurant family-friendly rapidly filled up with a young couple Indian on one of their first few dates (it sounds like), a big largely-Caucasian family with a kid, a pair of Cambodian siblings and a few uncles/aunties, and right next to us a pair of clearly West African girlfriends. What can I say, I love racial diversity and integration, and it's great that the staff at this restaurant is welcoming to EVERYONE!But back to the food. Our entree was the meat combo platter, which was MORE than enough for 2 non-gluttonous people. Most of it was well-seasoned, but it was lacking our favorite Ethiopian hot oils and spices (which was kind of the whole point of our cravings). I think they'd toned it down a bit for the General Diners. So we specifically asked for the hot sauce, which our gracious waitress brought, and all was well with the world. DELICIOUS!You know how the ""base"" layer of injira gets soaked with the sauces and flavors, and you can tear off the warm pre-soaked pieces and put them in your mouth, as they drip with saucy spicy goodness, in your mouth and right down your esophagus?Oh, man.Oh, man.It was a little DIFFICULT for me to listen to my body and STOP EATING, that's how tasty the food was.While they packed our ample leftovers for us, my wife wanted extra injira - a specific kind of injira - which the waitress was happy to sell to us for a reasonable few bucks,Our overall bill was a bit high... not ""Budakkan"" high, but ""New York City"" high, which was acceptable since the food was TASTY and the portions were big. We left a reasonable tip and walked back to the subway station to make our long trip back to Food-less Philly.We're not sure WHEN we'll go back to Awash, since we don't live in NYC, but at least we know for sure that Awash is a great little Ethiopian restaurant, and TOTALLY worth checking out!"

10/27/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing food. They were accommodating to my request for gluten free Injeera, and it was delicious. For others, I would suggest calling ahead if you want it GF. They pointed out which dishes were spicy for my aunt who is sensitive. It was a busy Friday night, but they let us wait at the bar. We had the meat combo for 2, but we could have fed 3.Wash your hands first, as Ethiopian food is eaten with the hands."
10/26/2018,3 star rating,"i had this kind of  food in the past however theirs was , kind of spicy plain and quite expensive and as mentioned in another  review very inattentive service. We waited a while the  waitresses busy talking to one another, not really paying attention to the dinning room, they were very sweet, but laid back   also they played their own numbing music, loud and when asked to kindly reduce the volume, they agreed but there was no much difference. we had combo 1 for two. The combo with beef was ok, i liked the lamb, food felt healthy but not really to die for."
6/24/2016,2 star rating,"Great food, poor service.I would give this place 5 stars if the servers were attentive and actually paid attention to the level of service they were providing to their customers.1. The food is delicious2. The venue is outdated and needs a major overhaul!! Carpet??? What restaurant still has carpet??!?! I'll be honest the tables are poorly placed, the decor is old and boring, and there is some weird glass mid-wall that is completely out of placeSpend some $$$ and make some minor updates, please!!3. The service is consistently slow!! Waited for water, waited for food (longer than normal), and waited for wine (and had to remind the server), oh and the servers congregate at the bar and talk.... We can see you!? Seriously makes it hard to want to travel here from across the park for mediocre service and great food- there is a lot of great food in the city. The service is what makes a place stand out and come back time and time again!"
5/16/2015,4 star rating,"Such a wonderful little place! It was my first time having Ethiopian, and I'm glad it was here! It's a dimly lit restaurant with a romantic feel. I loved that there was Ethiopian videos playing on the television, really adds to the ambiance. The service was awesome. I believe it was a mother and daughter serving us, both really friendly. Now on to the food!I got the doro alicha dish, which was delicious. There was the chicken plate, and two vegetable sides served over injera, a type of bread. The chicken was tender and for someone who doesn't normally like chickpeas, they were amazing! The great part about it is that in addition to the injera your dish is served on, they come out with plates of more bread! If you finish it, they bring out more injera. We also tried the honey blackberry wine, which was amazing. Sweet and goes so well with the food. Overall Awash gave me a great first experience with Ethiopian food. Definitely enjoyed myself and coming back here!"

5/18/2018,2 star rating,"Food was a little disappointing. For starters, they wrapped all the veggies and such in the injera so by the time it got to me, most of the flatbread was unbearably soggy. Injera is already very light and spongy so that was the real fatal oversight here. Would make more sense to pack the bread separately for delivery orders. The food was also pretty cold when it came which is only partly understandable because the place is only 8 blocks away. The temperature might have been tolerable if the food itself wasn't also a little bland. Disappointing, as this was my first experience with Ethiopian food and I was pretty excited to try it."

The order:Sambusa (beef filled) so delicious, great sauce on the side. Get this!!!Veggie combo: we tried all of the veggies, the very best were the shiro, the collards and both lentil dishes. The carrot string bean gets honorable mention. You honestly cannot go wrong with anything. Meat combo: the Doro Alichia and the Yebeg Alicha Fitfit. The Doro Alichia is the best chicken dish I've ever had. Ever. I also loved the paintings of the emperors and empresses' on the walls. This was a great experience for my mom and I, I'm glad we went. We have plans to go to the others :)"
2/27/2020,3 star rating,"The food is always good here; however there are 3 things this restaurant needs to address:  1) they are severely under-staffed, so service is quite slow on high traffic evenings like Friday or Saturday (the existing wait staff is great and working as hard as they can ... but insufficient) 2) they've recently started to ration the Injera (Ethiopian bread they serve with the food). No idea why they've starred to do this -- presumably to cut costs? Makes for a  stressful eating experience 3) they deliver their food in styrofoam(!), which is probably the worst material for the  environment. I fully support this restaurants, its staff and recognize the great food they make and ambience they  create. But they need to address these issues to keep me coming back."
8/6/2018,5 star rating,"It is the 3rd time I go there with my family and each time their service and food were excellent!!!

But now get used to it. Looking for something different... this is the right place!!"

7/27/2019,1 star rating,"This restaurant has been my favorite place for sometime last night I ordered vegetarian sampler for two in which we got a lot of food of course and all was fine. A third friend joined us and we were told by the server almost immediately that our third friend can not share with us and if he must then we must pay 9$ for the same amount of food. This is not even that crazy I guess resturant policy however when the friend wanted to order desert from the menu in which he did the server came back several times insisting that we can not share the desert either. With no explanation and in the most bizarre restaurant moment I have ever witnessed. The crazy thing is we didn't even try to share the desert, the server just thought to come back and remind us several times for no reason. I rather go to Benyam in w 148th St next time and enjoy the great service there."
5/10/2017,3 star rating,"I stopped in as soon as they opened that day so I was the only person there. Staff was friendly, and the ambiance is great. Love the painting of what seems to be a royal woman on the back, left wall. Absolutely beautiful. Now on to the food. I got the veggie platter - Gomen, Ater, Yatakilt Alicha, Fassolia and the Messir. Opted out of the Shiro and Keysir (I've never liked either). So coming from waitressing at another NYC Ethiopian restaurant and having an Ethiopian bestie who cooks for me this place was okay. Not the best Ethiopian food I've ever had. If you're new to Ethiopian food please give this place a chance, you'll like it. The presentation of the food was great and I enjoyed the Ater kik Alicha. You MUST try the veggie sambusa, it was yummy."

We came right at opening and were one of the few customers there.The combination platter was really excellent and had far too much food (not that I'm complaining).I will definitely come again the next time I have the chance."
2/11/2017,4 star rating,"4 stars because the service is bad.The food, however, is very good and I go back when I'm mentally prepared to wait 45-60 minutes for food at the dine-in. But again, I like the food. If the service were better I would give 5 stars. Multiple times, I have decided to not go because of the wait time. YOU WILL WAIT, and wait, and wait. Everyone looks busy but I'm not sure what they're doing."
4/22/2014,3 star rating,"Happily, the wait for food wasn't as long as other reviewers projected -- we were served our meat combo quite promptly. Just didn't love the food. Many of the dishes were spicy, which is fine, but the flavors were a little too overwhelming altogether and even the injera (which was quite good) couldn't balance the tastes. With that said, I'd recommend the collard greens, and any of the beef tibs."
11/16/2018,5 star rating,My favorite restaurant!!! Only downside is that they have some rules on ordering. It's small group friendly and kid friendly.
5/28/2018,5 star rating,"Fresh ingredients were being delivered  inside on dollies when I arrived at opening time. Got the 2 meat and 3 vegetable sampler. Went with the recommendations of the pleasant waitress. Injera was nicely done, not overly thick and spongy. Great taste, friendly service, and value price."
4/30/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome food, reasonably good ambience, and friendly staff! A must visit!"
9/5/2017,4 star rating,"My best friend discovered this place off a refinery 29 article for ""best places to eat in Harlem,"" and I am so glad she told me about it. The food is amazing - my favorite dish here is the doro alicha chicken. The marinade they use for this dish is divine. I took my parents to Awash and they were raving about the chicken too. I want this recipe so I can make it all the time . You can't go wrong with the meat and veggie combo platter - you get to sample all the vegetables (cabbage was my fave of these). The only thing I did not like was the special tibs, since it was too spicy."
4/30/2018,4 star rating,"The food is wonderful and tasty. The decor leaves a bit to be desired however. They have cleaned the rug and painted but in my book a restaurant should have tiled floors. I love the staff too, they're always pleasant."
7/12/2012,5 star rating,"I first was invited here on my birthday by Salome, an Ethiopian woman who apparently knew the owners well since they greeted her with hugs. Decor is nothing to rave about but the food is the best. I am vegetarian and they have lots for me to eat. I have been here a few times. My favorite foods include the chickpeas, the greens and the spicy lentils and I love the vegetable sambusa and the spicy sauce it comes with. Just remember to wash your hands because you use the injera with your hands to pick up the food, authentic syle. The ingera is a spongy type soft grain bread that you rip into strips to pick up your food. And the rum cake is soaked in rum and heavy. It is so heavy and large that if there are 2 of you eating they will only bring one slice because they know it is big enough for 2. The only issue is their lack of exactness in understanding everything in the English language. It is still a well-worth experience if you love spicy exotic food (I do!) and the price is very decent. I will certainly eat there again, many times, I hope - in the future."
3/21/2015,5 star rating,"This is my first time trying ethiopian food and I was blown away! My friend and I came to awash not knowing what to expect. But we will definitely be back. We ordered the all you can eat brunch for $19.95. You get to choose from 8+ delicious vegan friendly options- ethiopian eggs, pancakes,Couscous. We ate til we couldn't eat any more! The waiters were super friendly, smiling and attentive. This is my new favorite place!"
4/7/2018,5 star rating,Favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the city. Delicious food. Friendly staff and very consistent. A must visit in NYC. Enjoy! Get the honey wine!!

11/4/2018,5 star rating,"Restaurant was really spacious, the tables were not too close to each other. There was nice table decor, flowers, candles, etc.The food was delicious! Drinks were strong. Great costumer service. The waitress explained menu in understandable way. They accommodated my date's food restrictions.I would recommend this Ethiopian restaurant to everyone! Check out Awash!"
2/4/2016,5 star rating,"I knew I was going to be in for a treat when I heard the name of the restaurant. I love Ethiopian food and eating with my hands, but this place took it to the next level!The Ethiopian beer selection was excellent and delicious. The share platters were immense! Combining all the elements into a kind of Ethiopian taco was definitely the best course of action to tackle all that deliciousness. My friends and I left feeling good about ourselves which was surprising considering the ton of food we ate.I would recommend this for dates (when you know each other well enough), or events with friends. I have to go back soon!"
1/21/2018,5 star rating,"Great success ordering delivery for the first time from Awash. Got the vegetarian combo (which is also vegan) and a chicken, beef combo which comes with your choice of 4 veg sides. Each comes on large injera bread serving with an extra portion of injera. Delicious and beautifully presented, and still hot when it arrived. A great option if you have back to back sports events to watch on TV :)"
5/2/2016,3 star rating,"Tried Combo 1 and 2, the taste and smell of injera is special to me."
2/28/2016,4 star rating,"Really liked this place! I have not tried the other Ethiopian restaurants in the area in order to compare, but for now this is the best. Service: The staff was attentive, and always made sure that our water and wine were always filled. The food: It really was very good! The spicy dishes were spicy (and not mild), and those that were meant to not be spicy were perfectly seasoned. Nothing was too salty.I really liked it!"
4/3/2015,4 star rating,"Really, really good food! This was the second time I've had Ethiopian food so I'm no expert, but the food we had was delicious. We had a couple different lentil dishes along with some chicken, beef, and beets. All very flavorful and tasty. I also enjoyed my honey wine (which I've never had before--but wow!).The interior is dimly lit, so it can be romantic. Great place to go if you're feeling adventurous in your cuisine choices. I definitely recommend this place."
8/5/2019,2 star rating,Food was ok- just Ok. Nothing to rave about. Service was non existent. Wouldn't recommend or go back again.
2/16/2014,4 star rating,"My first experience at an Ethiopian restaurant and man was it good! My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try it for some time and after doing some research and coming with such high Yelp regard, Awash certainly delivered. Loved the create your own meat combo plate. We went as a group of 4 and by ordering 2 make your own meat plates for two, we were able to get through much of the menu. The veggies were great and the meats were all seasoned with such great flavor. Would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to not only try Ethiopian cuisine but just likes great and delicious food. And hey, who doesn't love eat with just their hands every now and then ;)The only downside why this isn't 5 stars is that the service is a bit slow. Nothing too too bad, but just not as efficient as I think one would expect and/or want. Deal Seeking Diva Tip: Not much to get a deal on, but great prices all around. Entree and drink all under $25!"
1/7/2017,5 star rating,"Best Ethiopian food in America!They are extremely stingy on the injeerah bread, but the flavorful sauces are unmatched in the US. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Ethiopian food."
7/22/2015,2 star rating,"Review for delivery onlyI love love love Ethiopian food, so whenever I have the chance to try out a new place I go for it.  While on the UWS I ordered the vegetarian combo to be delivered to a friends place about 15 blocks away.  Delivery was easy, but it was difficult to figure out what exactly was going to come in my combo so if you're very picky you'll have to call and ask.  Was quotes 45 minutes for delivery, and it took about 90.  Not immediately a deal breaker on a Friday night, but I would rather be told 90 and have it take 45 than the other way around.  When the delivery guy hands me the bag it's HEAVY, like it felt way too heavy to be what I ordered.  I check and it is what I ordered.  It's just that this place gives you triple the amount of injera any other place does.  I love injera so +1 star for that.Immediately I notice that all of the food is very oily.  I used an entire roll of injera just soaking up the excess oil.  Not exaggerating when I say there were pools of oil.  The injera that all the beans and veggies were on was disgusting because it had disintegrated in all of the oil.The flavor itself isn't bad, some of the things were over spiced (chickpeas I'm looking at you), and some were completely flavorless (split peas).  Definitely disappointing.The kicker was that there were tons of lemon seeds left in the food.  Not just one or two, but a handful.  I spent 20+ minutes picking out the seeds after I accidentally bit into one.Definitely won't order from here again."
8/12/2018,5 star rating,"The food is what makes us keep coming back to Awash: the vegetarian combo, a generous painter's palate of beans and veggies in yellows, reds, and greens; the sambusas, flaky and ambrosial, served with a garlicky dipping sauce that hums like a familiar melody; the meat dishes, especially a championship-caliber kitfo, virtuosically seasoned beef best ordered raw, and when they have it, with a dollop of collards-infused cheese. But while the food is sublime, it's the vibe that makes the place truly special. Time slows down in a good way at Awash. Gathering around an injera-covered collective plate, well attended by the familiar waitstaff, gazed down on by the canvases of Ethiopian notables on the wall, this well-loved spot is a serene retreat that feels like a magnificent family home."
12/31/2017,4 star rating,"I liked it okay. The ambiance was nice. The food was good, but not better than Lalibela in midtown, which is not closed. I really liked the avocado salad and the Ethiopian beer. Ambiance is low key and friendly, but service was kind of slow."
1/16/2015,1 star rating,"This is one of the worst places we have been to in the city .My family visited them on  the occasion of my birthday to be received by an absolutely discourteous waitress after standing and waiting for 10 minuted in a half filed restaurant. My 6 month old daughter required a inverted high chair that would fit her car seat , but there was one broken one which they have so we had to put her car seat on a shabby squeaking cheap chairs that these people have for their guests to sit on.We were again sitting there waiting for the server to show up to take our order...we were so annoyed already that we were ready to order the main-course but had the pleasure only after 15 minutes to b able to place order and get request anything to drink .30 min later when the food later arrived after 3 reminders ...Time seems to run very slow at this place and warmth and courtesy expected of the service industry are as distant as is Etiopia to the upper west side here ."
10/29/2018,1 star rating,"Whilst the food was enjoyable the service was slow as it took 45 minutes for my food to come. Furthermore, a 20% tip was added for a small party of 3 without us asking and when asking if we could pay separately the waiter appeared very confused. They took the liberty of adding a tip when their policy is only to add them to a party of 5 or moreMoreover after debating this issue I was given $30 less than I was meant to receive in my change and when I addressed this they remedied the issue but they already seemed to know they had made the mistake. I would reckon mend this restaurant for the food but not for the brash/ slow service."

8/2/2012,4 star rating,"I was so excited to return to the Awash tonight. Unfortunately it seems that they have switched from serving authentic Ethiopian food to a very toned down, bland ""farengee"" version to the point that I could not taste any berberi (a unique Ethiopian spice) in the food. We ordered a combination vegetable plate, a bottle of Tej (honey wine) and two beers. With a tip, the total for the three  of us was $100 plus. Service was friendly but very slow and not only was there no air conditioning, but the overhead fans were not running and we are in the middle of a heat wave!When we asked for some mitmit (a hot spice from Ethiopia) we were told they did not have any and instead brought us some not very hot peppers to break up. Maybe it was a Democratic Party political statement (get it, ""no mitmit????"")?Likewise the injera (bread) tasted bland. I asked if it was made from tef (which it should be) or wheat. I was told a combination but I would put money on it having been made 90% from wheat because it did not have that unique sour taste.The ingredients still tasted fresh but it is not the Awash that used to be filled with the local Ethiopian/Eritrean crowd. I understand catering to the changing neighborhood, but I miss the food with a huge kick they used to serve!6/24/15: I went with an old friend for lunch today and begged them to make our lunch Ethiopian spicy not ""farengee"" mild. They complied and earned back half a star! The injera is still bland indicating that they make it with a combination of wheat and tef rather than tef, so it was still missing that unique sour taste but as always the service was friendly and the food fresh. 3.5 stars is my updated rating."
3/21/2012,4 star rating,"Over the years I have eaten at the Awash with some of my observant Jewish and their Ethiopian friends.  In fact one friend spent several years teaching in Asmara, then part of Ethiopia, now the capital of Eritrea, so he is able to order in both Amharic and Tigrinya, while I can only say hi in each!  Anyhow having such an in made their good service even better and the food, while a bit expensive, has consistently been excellent. Because some of my friends keep Kosher, we order family style and stay with the vegetables. But because the food is so well spiced, I really never miss having meat (likewise for Indian food) though the chicken looks good!Jessie W was right on to mention the Tej honey wine being a great compliment to the food and be sure to ask if they have injera (the bread you eat with e food) made from tef rather than wheat. Injera made with tef is the real thing. A bit sour but delicious!I have been to a few Ethiopian restaurants over the years and this remains one of my favorites!"

1/16/2015,2 star rating,"The service was EXTREMELY SLOW!! The waitress was totally disinterested in serving us.We ordered the vegetarian combo which was pretty good. The appetizer( something that ended with a fit - fit) was extremely sour though.After the extremely poor service, the waitress came and demanded us to pay a 18% gratuity which we didn't feel she deserved at all!We still paid  since we didnt want a scene but definitely not going back again!"
2/25/2015,5 star rating,"So far I've been to 6 ethiopian restaurants in Manhattan and this one is far and beyond my favorite ethiopian in the city.  My friends and I usually get the Meat combo for 2 and either the veggie combo for one or two and then they combine them onto one amazingly awesome platter.  They offer extra bread if you run out as well. The bread is deliciously sour and so fluffy and wonderful.  Best I've had so far. I love the meats that they cook and the sauces, I have no idea what's in them but theyre perfect. If you like the taste of dessert wine then you should try their ethiopian honey wine,  it has almost a yeasty smell but the taste is sweet.  You definitely can't drink a lot of it but it goes great with the food.  Or you could get my favorite ethiopian beer (they have 2 or 3 options) and get a St. George.  SO GOOD. Can not recommend this restaurant highly enough. PLEASE GO HERE! bottom line excellent service, great food, good prices for such great food."
2/13/2011,4 star rating,"My fiance and I came here spontaneously to check out this highly-rated Ethiopian food, and it did not disappoint! We got the meat combo, which came with three meats and three veggies of choice. They were out of string beans, sadness, but the beets more than made up for it. The greens were a little bland, but they made us feel good about eating vegetables for the day.The food came out quickly, and we got extra injera for no charge.A good beer selection, too!The decor is minimal, but it doesn't need much. The food is quite excellent!"
9/25/2017,4 star rating,The best injira I have ever had. We ordered the combo plate -- chose a beef and lamb dish for meats. All the veggies were included. (Not just the three as the menu suggests.) Server was attentive and refreshed our injira regularly.
6/1/2011,2 star rating,"I had quite an unfortunate and disheartening experience here on Monday evening, Memorial Day. Previously, I'd never had an Ethiopian meal I didn't enjoy, it's always been at least decent no matter where I've been, but this place was just bad. Bad to the point I just don't even want to give them a second chance. Which I always do. Which is saying a lot.Before seeing the NY Philharmonic (playing Barber and Beethoven) at the nearby Cathedral of St. John the Divine, my friend (whose husband plays in the orchestra) and I wanted to try something new. Neither of us know this neighborhood very well, and neither of us have the opportunity to try this cuisine very often. It basically sold itself. And I want a refund.From the moment we stepped foot inside the establishment, the single waitress was loudly boasting about how this was her last day working here. Because I didn't want to offend my friend, and because there really wasn't enough time to search for another restaurant, I just pretended I didn't hear what she was saying. Big mistake. After waiting 10 minutes for water, it took another 10 minutes for her to take our order, then it took another 20 minutes for them to bring the food. I ordered Kitfo. It's raw!For crying out loud, I think the kitchen staff was about as equally disinterested in what they were doing as the waitress. The injera was overly thick and overly soggy and overly bitter. And there were mounds of it everywhere, with every dish. Talk about too much of a bad thing.The ""Azifa,"" a dish I've had many times elsewhere, was bland -- and the tiny bowl was surrounded by a heap of unattractive injera. The ""Yitimatim Fitfit,"" a dish I've had many times elsewhere, was laughable -- it had almost no discernible trace of tomato, it was all soggy injera and a couple pieces of onions, and this too was surrounded by mounds of undesirable injera on the side. The ""Special Kitfo,"" (their particular take on my absolute favorite Ethiopian dish, which I've had many times elsewhere) was absolutely horrible -- it tasted like bad Mexican salsa, and the meat hadn't been properly disassembled or ground so that it was very stringy and chewy -- and of course this came paired with copious amounts of regrettable injera."
9/16/2017,5 star rating,"Me and friend tried Awash for our first Ethiopian food experience. Very casual and home-feeling atmosphere, and the house honey beer is the best! Love all the dishes especially the bread. The fired dumpling appetizer was great too!"
1/11/2018,4 star rating,"I love Ethiopian food and in my little pocket of NYC I'm lucky to be around some of the best of it. Awash is my regular go-to: the vibe is really low-key (although it can fill up on weekends at peak dinner hours!), the food is fairly priced and portioned, and everything is delicious. Bring a few friends and order to share; the veggie platter is my personal recommendation (I roll deep with a ton of vegetarians), but it's all super crowd-pleasing. One extra note of praise: Awash makes a cocktail here (I don't remember the name, but look for it listed on the back wall) that's one of my favorites: iced coffee, blackberry honey wine, and muddled jalepeno. Super refreshing, and there's nothing quite like it anywhere else."
7/26/2015,4 star rating,"Awash is a very good Ethiopian restaurant. Additionally, it's a very, very vegetarian-friendly location, so if you have a bunch of people who can't eat meat in your group, definitely consider this place. It's great for groups. Their Shiro is delicious, though I also like the Gomen, and to be honest most of their dishes were just plain good when I had them. I typically get the veggie combo when I go here, and I'm never disappointed. I haven't tried any of their appetizers yet, which might entice me to go again soon. The food is a little pricey, but Awash has made me really like Ethiopian food, and I think that was worth the price."
6/25/2018,1 star rating,"Awful experience. i was really excited to try this place:(.  The staff was SO RUDE, i will never return.  I came on a night where there were 4 servers plus more help and the restaurant was moderately busy but entirely manageable.. so the wait time to first even be acknowledged with a ""hello"" was inexcusable.  Once seated, waited nearly 20 min before someone was willing to take our order only after flagging them down and almost begging.  we were given dirty looks by frustrated waitstaff but to be honest, the servers were all women btw ages of 30-50 that seemed tired and over the job.  But they should keep in mind that patrons just want to dine & eat without problems.  I wanted to leave before even ordering because the first 20 minutes alone was enough to make you leave.  We felt so unwelcomed, it was upsetting. But my friend knew i was craving ethiopian food and didnt want me to give up so easily lol.  We had just a couple simple questions about the menu but the server wanted to rush through our order and when i asked for chicken instead of beef, she barked ""NO"" without any apologies or even an attempt to ask the kitchen first.  So we left.  It was clear you didnt want us there.  i had heard once before that the servers here are only halfway decent to you if you're White or Ethiopian..but didnt want to believe that. I only came because it was conveniently located next to my friend's apt.  Dear Awash, please take some lessons on Customer Service. Its your job.There are plenty other Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurants in Harlem with outstanding food and warm, attentive service.  Please visit MASSAWA on Amsterdam Ave, ABYSSINIA on 135th street or BENYAM on Adam Clayton Ave.  Not only are their reputations known for incredibly delicious food but they truly appreciate their customers and it shows in their service. Please support the businesses that work hard to ensure their patrons are treated well where their money is spent."
3/27/2013,5 star rating,"I adore this restaurant!I discovered it in college more than 10 years ago, and am still coming back for more.  Although not particularly Ethiopian, their beets are delicious, and I have never had beets quite like this at any other restaurant.  In fact, it was the dish that redefined beets as a food that I ate.  All of the standard Ethiopian dishes are tasty here, with nice combo platters available to provide a variety of flavors to enjoy.  The injera is delightfully dark and sour, just as it should be!  This restaurant definitely has the right combination of good food and excellent service."
2/8/2007,4 star rating,"When I tried this place a few weeks ago with 5 of my friends we were hoping for yum and we got -- Yum.The food is generally a little spicy (unless you order one of say, 2 dishes that aren't) and they can surely turn up the spice if you want them to! Yum.A mixed platter can easily be split by 2 people. Good bang for your buck. Try one of the wines by the glass."
4/6/2019,4 star rating,Just went to this restaurant for the first time. Decided to go based on the reviews I saw on this site. Overall the food was very well prepared. The vegetable dishes were delicious and so was the chicken dish we ordered. The only complaint I have is that the lamb I had was over cooked. It was dry and a little tough to eat. The service was great. They were very busy but managed to get things to our table even if it took a few extra minutes. Great atmosphere too. I will be back!
4/10/2014,4 star rating,"I love Ethiopian food and have been to several places around the city. Ghenet was always my favorite, but Awash was a close second, which is convenient since I now live near it and Ghenet is long gone, at least in Manhattan.The injera is always really good, and I always eat entirely too much of it. My two regular choices are the yemisir kik wat (lentils and spicy berebere) and the shiro (mashed chickpeas, milder than the yemisir). I also go for the key sir alicha, which has potatoes, beets, and carrots, or the gomen, which is collard greens.I used to order kategna at Ghenet, which is injera coated in spicy berebere and a cheese-like butter, but that's not on the menu at Awash. When I asked about it, the server had the chef make some for me, which was very kind.The only downside is that the servers, despite being very friendly, are not always massively efficient. If you become frustrated easily at that sort of thing, you should be mentally prepared. The food is worth it, all in all a very nice place to eat."
6/9/2017,5 star rating,"I really have just one word for this place.......Delicious!!!Ambience isn't too bad, waitress wAs very sweet, and our food came pretty promptly. We got the veggie combo platter for 2 and Meat platter for 3 as we were 5 but it could have fed 8 hungry people!! It was a lot of food. Anyway! It really made great leftovers too!! My husband has eaten at other Ethiopian places but he said this one is really the best."
7/20/2017,5 star rating,"My experience with Ethiopian cuisine is limited to the restaurants of West Philadelphia, PA; San Francisco, CA; and Oakland, CA.

The injera is perfect. Our server noticed we were running low and brought more without our asking."

Every type of dish is so different from the other one. Great flavors!"

3/4/2015,4 star rating,"This was one of my favorite Ethiopian spots in the city. I went the other night and it was not as amazing as I had remembered but still really good. Good portion sizes for the price. I went later on, on a weeknight and it was pretty empty and quiet. I only get the veggie combo. They let me double up on one of the options instead of choosing 6 different veggie options. My friend has a gluten allergy so we called ahead and they had special injera ready for her. Not as delicious as the injera I get (which is so good) so poor her, but was so great that they provided it."

3/9/2018,1 star rating,"FOOD DELIVERED, FLAVOR LEFT IN THE STORE!!!Awash, what happened to you? Used to order and eat from you regularly, usually the Vegetarian Combo. It used to be delicious, spicy, flavorful and satisfying. Paired so well with beer. Well, took a break for about a year and ordered again tonight. So excited! First, ordered through Seamless at an overpriced  $30 minimum, but wanted the dish so bad, I splurged. But after starting to eat: YUCHHH!! Nothing had any taste! The lentils were soooo bland! The string beans and carrots were barely carmelized!! Where were the hot green peppers? Nowhere to be found!!! Our beers could barely pair with the food!!!! Even after filling up with a couple of injera breads, still felt hungry and unsatiated! This is truly a shame. One of the best restaurants in the neighborhood has lost its touch and jumped the shark. The worst part is the $30 we are down because of this. Awash, if you can prove to us that this was one time fluke, please do, otherwise I can't spend money on you again."

3/23/2014,5 star rating,"Favorite Ethiopian Place in New York (uptown location only) I've tried many Ethiopian places but this is the best. I stayed for a month in Ethiopia and this is the closest and most authentic I've tasted in the US. Servers are friendly, food is amazing. Try any of the Sambusas and the Tej and please don't ask for a fork! Google how to eat Ethiopian food with your hands, there is a technique. Give it a try! Great for vegetarians and meat lovers"
2/9/2018,2 star rating,"I'm really upset to be writing this updated review. I used to LOVE going to Awash but the past two experiences have just been terrible. On our last visit to Awash, we assumed our last experience was just a bad night and there was no way it would be a disappointment again. Unfortunately, we were WRONG. We made a reservation for 7:30PM on a Friday night and showed up right on time. My group of 3 waited for 25 MINUTES at the entrance before a waitress even came to seat us. I understand being busy but it takes almost no effort to tell your guest ""we'll be with you in a moment"" to at least ACKNOWLEDGE our presence. The worst part was that I made eye contact with the staff multiple times and they still chose to ignore us. I had to walk up to a waitress to get them to acknowledge us. We were finally sat at a table and the waitress took our drink order. I ordered a coke and my friend ordered a ginger ale. The coke came right away but the ginger ale came after re-asking the waitress 4 times through out the night. By the time the ginger ale got to the table, we were almost done eating the food. The WORST PART of the night is after we got our food, we were told the restaurant ""had no plates"" for us to use........WE HAD TO USE NAPKINS AS PLATES which is disgusting but really pissed us off when we saw the table next to us being given plates. Awash used to be my go to place for Ethiopian but this was just ridiculous. Thankfully the food was delicious but the horrible service ruined the night."
12/14/2017,5 star rating,"I love living so close to Awash! Typically, if you go on a weekday night or during the day, you won't need to make a reservation--but if you're going on a Friday/Saturday or Sunday, be sure to call in advance for dinner. If you're going out with vegetarians, Awash is a great option. That being said, they have many meat options as well. I love their vegetarian combo for two and the honey wine! The veggie combo comes with about 6-8 different veggie dishes w/ unlimited injera. Definitely check it out if you're on the Upper West Side/Morningside Heights neighborhood!"
1/29/2017,5 star rating,"Restaurant is spacious, Ethiopian music in the background, friendly service and delicious food. Good for groups and parties. Always love the vegetable combo!"
2/20/2014,3 star rating,"Good food, but mind numbingly slow. It might be fine if you are with a group, or a couple who wants to chitchat without any rush. But if you have any inclination to just get something to eat and get on with your evening, you will probably be frustrated; delivery or takeout might be better options, although I haven't tried them here.Things I've noticed:- if you ask for a fork they will wait on another table first before bringing the fork- if you pre-request a fork, they will forget. It has to be requested after the food is served - I would term this ""reciprocity of inconvenience""When you want to pay, the process is as follows:- prolonged wait to get the check (five minutes)- prolonged wait for staff to return to collect the check (five minutes)- prolonged wait to get change from the check (five minutes)Total time to pay: 15 minutesHaving said all of the above, you just have to get into the slow groove of the place if you eat there. I've realized that you will be sort of out of sync (bad mojo) if you try to rush things, and it's not advisable to be rude or upset about it or withhold a more generous tip."
8/18/2011,4 star rating,"Originally this place was a referral from an Ethiopian person I know and my visits here have all been good. Food for the most part is served on top of a style of soft flat bread called injera. In addition, a few rolls of the bread are provided and used in place of cutlery to eat the meal. The food is not very spicy, but not bland either. Some of the dishes remind a little bit of Indian food but it's not as oily or spicy. I can certainly recommend this place as a nice dining experience to try. Prices are reasonable and it's not an expensive place to visit. Service is friendly but can a little bit disjointed - but this isn't a high-end restaurant and so it's about inline with expectations."
10/7/2014,4 star rating,"My all-time favorite Ethiopian restaurant. I know DC is supposed to have some of the best Ethiopian food, and I've been in many other cities, but Awash uptown beats them all. Especially the green beans. Friendly service, but be prepared to wait for your food. I guess that's why it's so fresh. And if you go on a weekend at dinner time, there will be a wait for a table. But the injera is fresh and spongy and there is minimal grease on the food. We always get the veggie combo and it's always yummy. 1 combo can easily feed 3 people. A solid, cheap meal."
7/27/2014,5 star rating,"Been there twice, loved it both times.  I think the restaurant should be $ instead of $$. Granted, entrees are $13-$15 but that's probably enough for 3 people. I went there for lunch, ate the leftover for dinner and lunch the following day. The food was amazing and service excellent. It was quiet and chill - perfect for a slow eater who hates obnoxious crowds like me. I don't feel rushed out by overly-attentive staff like at many, many other more ""American"" restaurants. My advice is order anything - you just can't go wrong here."
12/30/2014,4 star rating,"Awash was an incredible dining experience. I am definitely coming again!My friends and I had the veggie combo for 4, so we were able to taste all 7 delicious vegan dishes, ranging from beets to lentils. We all had a sampler of each entree on a giant platter for us to share on. The waitress we had was also very sweet and kept bringing us more of the injera, free of charge. We also got a bottle of honey wine to split amongst the four of us, for $32. In the end, we each spent about $27, including tip. 4/5 stars because the seating is a bit awkward and cramped.Come to Awash! If you've never had Ethiopian, this is the place to try it first."
8/25/2014,5 star rating,"very good food kinda oily. fast delivery.wish they had rice. fast delivery. patient staff. vegetable sambusa were good, wish they were baked instead. combo 3 was good oily but very filling. my dog even enjoyed it :) $30  is expensive but it's worth it"
11/16/2013,4 star rating,"I've been a regular patron of Awash since I first came to NYC in 2002. I am sad to say that I took a 3 year hiatus. Thankfully, Awash lived up to all the good memories when I resumed our relationship. ;) I was here with 2 friends, (1 vegetarian), 2 weeks ago for dinner on a Saturday evening. We ordered 2 entrees to share for the 3 of us. The portions were so generous that we were all STUFFED when we left, and I even had enough leftovers for a full meal the next day.  We had the Awash Tibs and the Special Kitfo. Both were great. The tibs were flavorful, tender, and the sauce was a great complement to the injera. But for me, the reason I keep coming back to Awash is the Special Kitfo. No other Ethiopian restaurant does it better. (And I've been to many Ethiopian restaurants in DC that for some strange reason are more highly regarded). But be warned, it is SPICY.  If you can't handle heat, don't order it. We had the organic blackberry honey wine that was a great complement to the spicy food. Service was friendly. Overall great time. --Also, people, it's an Ethiopian restaurant, not fast food. Just relax with the slow service complaints. Order a drink, chat with your friends and enjoy the experience."
5/14/2017,5 star rating,"This place is amazing. Great service, generous portions, the decor is nice and they keep the premises spotless. I've ordered out from this place twice so far and both times have been extremely satisfying. Will return regularly!"
9/4/2016,5 star rating,"Never had Ethiopian before and was not disappointed. The order comes out on a huge platter lined with soft chewy flat bread. You are supposed to ripped the bread to pick up the food on the platter. No utensils necessary, although forks are distributed. The seasonings were unusual but delicious."
9/15/2009,4 star rating,"Yum! I had never been to an Ethiopian restaurant before this, so the whole experience was pretty great.  I came here with a friend for dinner and, unless you're graceful at eating with your hands, don't come here on a first date.  The decorations were really nice and the service was prompt. My glass of water was always at least half full (I'm a camel when it comes to restaurants).  The combo dishes let you try a little bit of everything and are quite filling.  All the food was delicious and the spongy teff injera was fun to eat.  The chicken in Berbere sauce was really delicious - just perfectly spicy - but a little oily. Maybe that's how it usually is, but this is my first so...My greatest complaint was that the women's bathroom door seems to get jammed easily...and I ended up stuck in the  bathroom for a panicked 8 minutes.  Beware."
2/15/2012,4 star rating,"DELICIOUSNESS.I came here for Valentine's Day with my Honey after a 20 minute search for a restaurant with a ""romantic setting."" I was excited to try the food-- my last experience with Ethiopian food was probably 6 or 7 years ago.My first impression of the place was ""cozy"" but ""a little cramped."" It seems like this restaurant has been in business for a while and is need of some remodeling.The service was a bit slow but it was a packed house with only three waitresses on shift. The owners also decorated for the holiday with red balloons and fresh roses in a clear vase of water on each table. I hated the balloons; they just looked distasteful...the red roses would have been enough to symbolize Valentine's day.Anyway, we ordered a ""create your own combo"" meal for two: Yegbeg alicha and special tibs - comes with three vegetables. Oh my deliciousness. The food was simply amazing. Fresh, flagrant, and filling - my three favorite words in the world of dining. I loved the yegbeg alichia which is like a lamb stew. The special tibs (ground beef) was also very tasty. The vegetables, all except the red beets, were so yummy.My Honey and I were so full and satisfied. It was a wonderful experience and we both truly enjoyed the food. I would def. recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Ethiopian cuisine on a budget!"
8/26/2013,2 star rating,"This WAS my favorite Ethiopian food in the city until we experienced really bad service last time we came. The food here is mouth watering, don't get me wrong. But the last time we came here the service was terrible. It took 2 hours to get our food, we were served the wrong thing, waitress was annoyed when we pointed in out, they didn't believe that our ID's were legit, took forever to get the check we had to walk up to the bar to pay (which a lot of other parties had to resort to as well).It's really unfortunate since the food it great and I like the overall vibe of the place. From now on I will be frequenting Zoma instead."
7/22/2014,4 star rating,"I'm so grateful that my friends introduced me to Awash... Here, you have options.  Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, paleo, carnivore or omnivore, there is something delicious for every palette.  Best bang for your buck are the combination platters and they are genereous portions for 1, 2 or more so feel free to share.  Enjoy a bottle of the honey wine and grab yourself a little pancake and dig into the yummy.  Beets and carrots and lentils and collards and chicken, lamb, beef, potatoes, it's all here and all delicious.  Not overwhelmingly spicey and, if you don't do pancakes as a vehicle for your food, ask for a fork and dig in.  Lately, the fans and AC are not running, so go on a cool evening, early when it is not too crowded or you'll feel the heat and that's no fun."
1/5/2016,2 star rating,I've had Ethiopian food before so I had some notion of the food. This food was cold and the bread they serve with it was not great and on top of that the price was out of range for the quality of food.
3/19/2017,3 star rating,"The Doro Tibs and Doro Wat were fine, but a couple of the other meat dishes lacked flavor. The vegetable dishes seemed underwhelming, although I would say they did the best job with the chickpeas. I've had really intense-flavored Ethiopian food elsewhere. This was not it. Perhaps a regional thing? Really long wait times for everything except the order taking. Not sure I would recommend."
10/1/2016,4 star rating,"This was so good. We had the vegetarian combo and it was delicious. The flavours were deep and shifted nicely from being spicy and mild. We drank the honey blackberry with our food and that was absolutely wonderful, not too sweet but still you were drinking honey wine. The service was very nice, the waitresses are kind and helpful. Highly recommended!"
2/3/2011,4 star rating,"Eating here was my first time ever having Ethiopian cuisine, but I'd read/heard a lot about it so I had a good idea of what to expect -- no utensils and most everything is eaten with injera, the sticky spongy sourdough-like bread (which by itself is sour enough to take you a little by surprise, but you get used to it and it is accompanied well by the flavorful entrees served with it).Being our first time, our server was very helpful to us and made some general recommendations. There were plenty of vegetarian options, and my friend and I got the Vegetable Sambusa appetizer, and the Shiro and Yater Kik Alicha. They were all delicious and there was definitely more than enough food for the two of us. We love strongly flavored foods, and there were plenty of spices that went so well together.Definitely want to come back and try more of the dishes."
1/12/2012,4 star rating,"I never been to another Ethiopian restaurant therefore don't have much to compare it to. I been here 2x and have really enjoyed the food. I don't like spicy food so this is what I had; the chicken sambusa's which were so yummy and crispy then the Awash chicken, the beef tips with beets, greens and carrots. I really enjoyed eating with my hands instead of using a fork since this is not the norm for me. I do have to add the food its heavy and very filling its best to come hungry."
2/19/2012,5 star rating,"I've been eating and enjoying Ethiopian food for over 15 years now.  Awash is truly as good as it gets -- or at least as good as I've ever had it. I think the other reviews here accurately describe a night out at Awash, so I won't waste anyone's time by attempting to write a long review of my own. I will just say that this is the restaurant where my girlfriend and I went on our first date so it holds a special place in both of our hearts.  We almost always order the vegetarian combo --- and it has never disappointed.   If you have never experienced Ethiopian food, I highly recommend you give it a chance.  The closest cuisine I can compare it to is Indian ..... but I actually enjoy Ethiopian more.  There is something special about injera bread that no other cuisine can offer.Also, for those Ethiopian newbies, you have to be prepared to eat with your hands.  If you are one of those people who can't handle eating without a knife and fork, then this probably isn't the right type of food for you.  I think the photographs which accompany this review give you a good idea how this works....  you tear the injera and scoop up your food with it!   Just thinking about this is making me hungry!Enjoy!"
9/3/2016,5 star rating,Wonderful food and friendly service! Very authentic. We split the meat and veggie combo and everything was perfect. Special Tibs and the Cabbage dish were my favorites. Red lentils and red beet dishes were also spectacular!
2/11/2016,4 star rating,"Fantastic Ethiopian restaurant! There aren't many Ethiopian spots in the city but this one was spot on. There were four of us and we tried the sampler platter with various vegetarian and meat options. We sat in the corner and ate from one of the traditional baskets. They should definitely add more baskets because there's only two sets in the whole restaurant! The food was extremely delicious and was plentiful for 4 people. The prices weren't too bad either. I would have liked the food to be a little bit more spicy so perhaps include some spicy options? Otherwise, no complains at all. They also have a great beer list including traditional Ethiopian beers (which I didn't even know was a thing) and some local classics."

12/2/2013,2 star rating,"I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a fan of Ethiopian food. I don't like the sour spongy bread. However, Awash does it right with the lamb, chicken and veggies on top of the spongy bread. The flavors blended well. Although, not the best lamb or chicken I've had, it was better than descent. The service is very  S   L   O   W.  That's an understatement. It took over an hour for our food to come out. And this is not an exaggeration. I watched the time on my phone when we were seated and when we got the food. By time we go our food, it was 9:45pm. The restaurant was near empty when we go the food. We were the only 2 tables left. I won't be back."
9/20/2013,4 star rating,"I'm newly re-obsessed with Ethiopian food. I tried it in DC a few years ago, and fell in love. Thought I had the obsession under control for a while...and then, I recently ate at one of Awash's competitors, Zoma. So, of course, I had to try Awash too! And now... I'm obsessed. Again.Because of aforementioned obsession, I decided to order take-out last week from Awash. The restaurant is actually bigger than I thought it would be, and has a homey, Ethiopian vibe. I like it! The one star deduction is because of their service at takeout. For one, they initially charged me extra for the dish I ordered to go, the Missir Wat. I asked them (nicely) about the price because I noticed it was cheaper on their website, and they made me feel like I was a little crazy for even asking. Ladies, I don't mind paying...but please update your website. Maybe they were having a bad day, idk, but that was the only negative I experienced, so I'm not going to hold it against them.The food I ordered was delicious. My order came with the Missir Wat, but also included Gomen and Yatakilt Wat. IMHO, the Gomen and Yatakilt were definitely better at Awash. In fact, the Yatakilt I've tried at other places is bland for me, but as a Brownie, I LOVED the different spices they put in it - it's probably the best version I've tasted! The Missir was also tasty, although I still can't stop thinking about the creamy, smooth, perfectly spiced version I had at Zoma. I think the one at Awash has stronger spices in it, but overall, everything was really good. The injera I got was fresh, spongy and WOAH sour. But that's ok, I like Woah Sour. Overall, a delicious experience. I was SO happy about the leftovers I had in my fridge the next afternoon :) I will be back for dine-in! Definitely stop by if you're in the 'hood!"
7/23/2016,5 star rating,"I don't know why but for some reason my girlfriend and I have lived in and around NYC for our whole lives and didn't try eithiopean food until about a year ago. Either way, after our first experience trying it at awash, we were simply hooked. After getting over the mental struggle of deciding whether or not you want to jettison your childhood manners and eat with your hands (which you 100% should), you'll find that every dish on the menu is tasty and the spice combinations of ethiopean are awesome. The injera here is also very good....we usually order extra along with either the meat or vegetarian combo. The interior of the restaurant is simple and understated but the service is attentive and takeout is usually prompt and just as good."
11/4/2017,2 star rating,Just a few other tables occupied in the slow time between lunch and dinner. Yet it took 30 minutes for the one entree we ordered to come out. Later we asked for a check so we could pay (twice) and waited 15 minutes for that. The food was ok but extremely overpriced. Very disappointing.
3/24/2018,3 star rating,"my boyfriend and i love ethiopian food! we hadn't been to an ethiopian restaurant in some time and i found one close to our final destination on a recent visit to the upper west side of nyc. it was Awash. to our pleasure, there hasn't been too much deviation in menu items amongst the ethiopian restaurants we've experienced in the past, so we had a clue as to what to expect regardless of the fact that Awash doesn't publicize their menu on their website. as a couple we ordered the vegan platter for two. as predicted, the menu items were expectantly on point. based on the description of the double platter, we thought that we would choose 5 of the 7 vegetarian menu items, but the waitress told us that we could have all 7, so with pleasure, we did! the bottles of beer we ordered were kinda warm. the platter of food was perfectly sufficient for two people and we were served the perfect amount of injera, but the intense flavors i've experienced at other ethiopian restaurants were not there. the staff was pleasant and the place was comfortable. all in all it was a good, just not great experience at Awash."
6/10/2014,3 star rating,It's actually 3.5. The food was above average the price isn't bad - the veggie combo is 15$ a head. The service is below average but definitely sufficient. The atmosphere is nice. At the same time it's probably one of the best Ethiopian in the area.
2/8/2014,3 star rating,"The three times I've been to Awash, the food has consistently been spectacular, and the service has consistently been disappointing. Awash is definitely under-staffed, and it's so popular that it's always packed, meaning it takes forever (over an hour) to get your food. Last time I was here, it also took 45 minutes for the server to bring the check, even after asking a few times. As for the food, portions are HUGE, and they have great vegetarian options.Bottom line: Absolutely delicious, but really really slow."
10/20/2013,3 star rating,"I came here with a large group of friends on a Thursday night without reservation. The place was about half-full, so we didn't have trouble getting a table. We ordered the Yetimatim Fitfit salad and Doro Wat+Tibs Wat platter to share. The food was very mediocre. They are more or less on par with Massawa, which is another Ethiopian place located on 120th street. For the price we paid, we got a good amount of food and the quality was not too bad.But one complaint I had was that the service was EXTREMELY slow. I understand that Ethiopian food generally takes a long time to prepare (based on my experience in multiple Ethiopian places), but I think it's still unacceptable that we had to wait over an hour for our food even when the place wasn't busy at all."

We very much enjoyed our experience and will absolutely be back."

1/22/2013,5 star rating,"At first we felt like we were cheating on Meskerem. After all. we'd been going there for years.But slowly over time, Mesekem became distant. It was ignoring our needs. And it became obvious we were growing apart. The little changes started building up, and after awhile we noticed we weren't going as often. Meskerem became distant, and it felt like they didn't know us anymore.So we thought ""let's just try seeing other Ethiopian places. It'll be causal, just to see how it felt."" Awash was the first one we'd try. And trust me - we didn't plan to fall in love. It just happened.It wasn't love at first sight. Not at all. We had to wait nearly 30 minutes for our table, and it was crowded (although in Fairness it was a Saturday night).  But Awash turned up the charm instantly with their friendly staff. We were laughing with them. Even starting to enjoy ourselves.And then the food came out. That's when it happened. It was love. we cleaned our plates. We didn't want the night to end we enjoyed ourselves so much.We even considered going back the next night. We didn't want to seem needy by going back too soon. So we thought we'd play it cool. We even started to tell our friends about how great it had been. And decided then and there that we were through with Meskerem. We were ready to commit to Awash -- because when you know, you just know."

The restaurant is in a cute area (there's like a hip, rolled ice cream place not too far), it's a cute restaurant with Ethiopian art on the walls, the whole 9 yards.

I hate to give a bad review, it's unfortunate I have to write like this."
8/6/2013,4 star rating,"Walking in, you suddenly feel transported back to an old college favorite. Not that I went to Columbia right up the road, but that nostalgic familiar feeling of an old worn down interior where the food is more important than the ambiance -- that reliable family restaurant that puts up with the large, loud parties and also caters to intimate, cozy dates. There's just something comfortable about this place, even when it's packed and despite its minimal decor and dated furnishings. And the service -- friendly enough but really secondary to the food. The food is pretty fantastic and comes in good sized portions. Well distributed on the injera platter for everyone to get enough of everything on their side of the table. Honeywine is good, but sweet."
9/20/2012,1 star rating,"I love Ethiopian food, but I was disappointed with the lunch special at Awash.  I called ahead and ordered the veggie combo to-go.  Picked it up 20 minutes later, and the service was awful.  The waitress didn't smile, wasn't personable, didn't carry herself as if she was in customer service at all!  I mean, did I do something???Anyway, the food was only average anyway.  Not really seasoned well.  I think from now on I'll stick to my regular Ethiopian spot!"
8/24/2013,4 star rating,"Very good food -- definitely can stand their ground with the best Ethiopian restaurants. We had the vegetarian sampler for 2 and it was reasonably priced, quite filling, and we enjoyed the variety.The only spoiler was one of the 5 dishes we asked for in the sampler was wrong, and it took a long time to get our waitress back so we could explain the error. It was quickly fixed however as she brought out the dish we expected in short order.The spiced tea was a cup of hot water with spices mixed in, and a Lipton tea bag on the side -- is that really what spiced tea is in Ethiopia? Somehow I thought the tea would be of slightly higher quality.Overall, very good food and definitely worth a return visit."
10/31/2015,3 star rating,I love the food here...I have been off and on a customer for many years and the food never disappoints me I get my Tibbs and Atakilt or Sambusa and Gomen....the portions are Generous this place is down home and old school in the best way. Dont go to the other awash or mesk or Queen of Sheba go here it's worth the trip. p.s.... ask your waiter to warm your injera and then enjoy! PS service could be stepped up a bit
9/14/2013,4 star rating,"Awash owns one key trait that makes a good restaurant, and that is that when you walk inside the door, the outsideworld gets closed off and you are ensconced in the totaldining experience.Sparse but intriguing decor fills the place, but you get a real vibe of being in a place that could be in a ward ofAddis Ababa. The tej? THE TEJ. Listen, that honey winemade every thing flat out groovy. Their injera was a goodmix of fluffy but filling. And it made for a wonderful complementfor the meal to come. The shiro simmered, and I suspectit wasn't TOO spicy due to complaints but it had a slightkick. The yebeg wat will make your eyes roll back in yourhead with delight.And did I mention the tej already? Now, be mindful of two things: 1)service can be up anddown depending on the crowd and time of day you eathere, and 2)this place can get a crowd fairly easily. Goesto show its popularity in an area with so many options."
10/18/2015,4 star rating,One of the best Ethopian food in the city. It difficult to find gluten free bread and the cook was very kind to make me one. I would love to go back and have more of that delicious bread.
3/15/2011,4 star rating,"Before I came to New York, I had been talking about what I've nom'd, what I haven't nom'd and what I would like to nom--Ethiopian food was definitely on the list of haven'ts and would like to's. Luckily for me, our first night in the concrete jungle entailed dinner here at Awash, as so enthusiastically recommended by my good friend and gracious host.Mind you, the only thing I knew about Ethiopian food at this point was that you ate with your hands and possibly sat on pillows [I only got the hands thing right, I think the pillows might be more of a Moroccan setting].My friend apparently comes here religiously and suggested we get one of the combination plates, which from what I can remember, consisted of lentils, collard greens and potatoes cooked in Ethiopian fashion with a serving of doro wat--a scrumdiddlyumptious blend of chicken in red pepper paste! Sounds simple enough, but abso-freakin-lutely finger lickin' goodness. Utensils could be requested, I'm sure, but what could possbly be more fun than eating with your hands? It's like you're 5 all over again! Besides, when in Rome? Everything is eaten with this spongy-sourdough-semi-bitter like bread [Google said this is called 'injera'] which is a little overwhelming on the palettes when consumed on its own but perfect when combined with the contents of your plate. We ate everything--not a chicken left undevoured or a lentil left untouched.Unfortunately, I can't give Awash a 5-Star rating just yet, no matter how delicious it was, mainly because this was my first experience with Ethiopian food and have absolutely nothing to compare it to. But now, the bar has been set. I'm definitely looking forward to my next doro wat experience."
5/19/2009,4 star rating,"First off, I LOVE Ethiopian food.  So it's no surprise that I would make it a point to try some in NYC.  Awash was very yummy, but I think I'm still partial to the places in LA.  We ordered a meat combo, appetizers and a bottle of wine.  The meat combo was a little bland and the injera was more sour than I was used to.  The chicken sambusas though were AMAZING.  Deliciously seasoned ground chicken in a triangular crispy phyllo dough.  It came with an addictively spicy sauce that I covered my sambusa in.  I've had sambusas at other places before but this was definitely the best one I've had.For an absolute wino/lush, the wine was my favorite part of the meal.  The red honey wine is to die for!  The wine is called Honey Run Blackberry Honey Wine and is amazingly rich in flavor.  It's very sweet and thick so the flavors linger in your mouth long after you've swallowed.  It's seriously orgasmic!  So much so that I tried to bribe the waitress in selling me a bottle to go.  Alas, no such luck.  Instead, she pointed me to a liquor store nearby that carried it. (FYI: Whole Foods carries the wine too!)Service was slow but pleasant.  It's definitely worth trying if you're not in rush."
3/14/2009,4 star rating,"Whenever I think of Ethiopia, I think of Sally Struthers.  Maybe it has something to do with the country's starving children.  Sally always said she wanted to save them.  She looked more like she had eaten all their food herself.  It's no wonder.  Despite what one would assume from a country associated with famine that swept Ethiopia in the 80s, Ethiopian cuisine is addictive.Unfortunately, if you've got a hunger for Ethiopian, and you find yourself in NYC, you're likely to starve.  There aren't many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in this city. And by excellent, I don't mean fine service and linens.  Ethiopian restaurants shouldn't make a fuss. They should be a hole in the wall run by family and packed with life. The decor should feature bad portraits of Haile Selassie.  The service should be sloppy, the food simple, the check reasonably priced.  Ethiopian restaurants should be like Awash.I've been to this family-run restaurant many times thanks to my brother, the ""regular."" I've never left wanting. The meat sambusas are properly flaky, and plump with smoky, spicy ground beef.  The injera is thick enough to support the saucy stews, but thin enough to not hide their flavor.  The kitfo is raw, spicy goodness, the wat well-seasoned and  slightly, delightfully greasy and the tibs, chunks of chewy richness. The service, like you might expect, is a bit slow, but the family-vibe and neighborliness makes up for the African pace--especially the stylish Rai, who somehow transforms this tragically un-hip ethnic restaurant into a hipster's haunt each and every time she visits your table.So stop saving the children from their food, Sally.  Get on the Awash tip.  You'll find everything you want in an Ethiopian meal, without the bad karma.  What are you waiting for? Call the number below now!"
9/29/2015,4 star rating,My first time to try Ethiopian food. This restaurant may be a good choice. But I am not used to eat this kind of food. But I had a good dinner that day because I knew what the Ethiopian food looks like.
2/24/2015,5 star rating,"I LOVE Awash. As a Somali American living in NYC, this is the closest I'm going to get to East African food. I have been to all of the locations but I frequently get take out from the Court Street and Amsterdam location. The food and serving size is pretty consistent at all the locations. Price for entrees are at least $17.00 and up but you get a lot of food. Don't be fooled by the spread out circles of stew! The Amsterdam location has an excellent veggie combo that includes ALL the veggies on the menu. Great chain restaurant for Ethiopian food. Go support and give it a try!"
4/3/2011,4 star rating,"This is the third Ethiopian restaurant I've been to in the city and I was pleasantly surprised. Having lived in Ethiopia for 4yrs and having eaten the cuisine in other countries, I have high standards. I always think it's best to order a combo meal in an Ethiopian restaurant so that's what my friend and I did.My friend and I shared the Awash Special combo with Special Tibs (beef cubes in marinated sauce in a spicy sauce) with the Gomen (collard greens), Patakilt Alicha (cabbage, carrots & potatoes) and Yemissir Kik Wat (split red lentils).The good:Well portioned - we were so fullSpicy & tasty - although I did feel it was more heaty-spicy than fragrant-spicy. But at least it wasn't bland!Price - for the combo with just tap water, the bill came to $20.70 in total!The bad:Injera - itself, it was good but it came very cold. That might be my own issue as I grew up with it freshly made for me by my servants in Ethiopia so I prefer it warm. Oh well."
8/19/2014,1 star rating,"Called at 9pm for delivery. At 9:35 I called to follow up, was told that driver left already. 10pm still no food so I called again. Was told driver left a long time ago and it was the only delivery so it shd be any minute now. Mind u I live 8 blocks from this restaurant. 10:35 now I tried calling again. Nobody was picking up anymore so I asked my bf to call from his phone coz I had a feeling they're screening my call now. My bf calls sure enough they picked up. He was not very happy to say the least. He was then told that they were having problems with their kitchen and the driver has JUST left but if we're not interested anymore to send him back. I mean really?  Now on to the food. None d what we ordered was edible. If I can take a picture of what we got I would but we threw it out because we were so disgusted!  We ordered vegetable sambusa, the Yater kik fifit and the shiro."
7/7/2013,4 star rating,I love Ethiopian food. Up until I tried Awash I hadn't found an Ethiopian restaurant I really liked in the city. Awash was recommended by two women working an Ethiopian stand at Smorgasburg. I came with three dining partners - one of which was vegan. We ordered a 3 person meat & veggie combination and one all veggie combination. The meal was delicious and rivaled some of the best Ethiopian meals I have had in the past. The service was also exquisite; they were very polite and patient when we wanted explanations of what each item in the combo was. I will definitely be returning to Awash and I highly recommend it.
4/15/2010,5 star rating,"There are places where nothing else matters once you start eating. The ambience and the noise and everything just fade away, and become irrelevant. Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those places.The veggie combo here is great. Every dish is spot on. The lentils are just spicy enough, the carrots and beets just naturally sweet enough, the greens just crisp enough. Everything is just right. And the waitress was kind enough to give us a bunch of extra dishes on the house as part of the combo, so we had something like 9 types of veggie entrees instead of the usual 4 or 5 that are on the menu. Who even does that anymore? And on a sidenote, what's up with all the people disgusted by eating with your hands, and complaining about the lack of utensils? That's how people eat in different cultures, deal with it. Don't be whiner snobs. That's like walking into a japanese place and complaining that they give you chopsticks and not forks. It's called expanding your mind to different cultures, and if you live in New York, you should try it sometime. Losers."
11/5/2015,3 star rating,"I was a little disappointed with this restaurant. I love Ethiopian so I was looking forward to trying it. However, between inattentive service and the fact that we received the wrong order, it just wasn't a great experience. The food was ok. Not the best Ethiopian I've tasted but definitely not the worst. I would not go out of my way to return here."
7/27/2014,5 star rating,"Been there twice, loved it both times.  I think the restaurant should be $ instead of $$. Granted, entrees are $13-$15 but that's probably enough for 3 people. I went there for lunch, ate the leftover for dinner and lunch the following day. The food was amazing and service excellent. It was quiet and chill - perfect for a slow eater who hates obnoxious crowds like me. I don't feel rushed out by overly-attentive staff like at many, many other more ""American"" restaurants. My advice is order anything - you just can't go wrong here."
7/26/2014,2 star rating,"i didnt give this place a ok rating cause honestly something are good but most or just alright. the spices the seasons its not what i expected it was bland somethings like the chicken, the beef was on point seasons spicy delic, the collard greens yes yes  more more. the honey wine  i would buy at was wine store 365 days a year its great i had the blueberry one yummmmm.  the injera  i can say i enjoyed its not as sour as other places i had it from. i would say this when in rome do as the romans please use ur hads its fun."
7/22/2014,4 star rating,"I'm so grateful that my friends introduced me to Awash... Here, you have options.  Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, paleo, carnivore or omnivore, there is something delicious for every palette.  Best bang for your buck are the combination platters and they are genereous portions for 1, 2 or more so feel free to share.  Enjoy a bottle of the honey wine and grab yourself a little pancake and dig into the yummy.  Beets and carrots and lentils and collards and chicken, lamb, beef, potatoes, it's all here and all delicious.  Not overwhelmingly spicey and, if you don't do pancakes as a vehicle for your food, ask for a fork and dig in.  Lately, the fans and AC are not running, so go on a cool evening, early when it is not too crowded or you'll feel the heat and that's no fun."
7/19/2014,5 star rating,"Lunch special for $9.95 is great. Definitely will be full, and you can get a good variety of meat and vegetables per order. Would go often if I lived closer."
7/13/2014,4 star rating,Great food. Excellent restaurant. I went with a couple of friends who had never tried Ethiopian. They were very impressed. The food is a bit spicy so ask about milder options if you're not into that. Service was fast. We ended up getting a combo for two (even though we were three).  They say they charge if you add an extra person but they comp the charge if you get an appetizer.
6/10/2014,3 star rating,It's actually 3.5. The food was above average the price isn't bad - the veggie combo is 15$ a head. The service is below average but definitely sufficient. The atmosphere is nice. At the same time it's probably one of the best Ethiopian in the area.
5/22/2014,1 star rating,"I love the taste of their food but:---if you get the wrong server it isn't worth it. I just sat in silence eating my meal with no music but listening to the server carry on a loud phone call in sharp tones, even carrying the phone to the table and continuing to talk on it. Not a relaxing experience. I felt like I was trapped in a strangers house and trying to eat my way out. --- Also, the portions felt like leftover scraps and were very small on the meat helping."
5/7/2014,5 star rating,Always great every time I've been with groups or just one more person. Friendly staff as always. A bit of a hike from the b/c trains but shorter walk from the 1.
4/22/2014,3 star rating,"Happily, the wait for food wasn't as long as other reviewers projected -- we were served our meat combo quite promptly. Just didn't love the food. Many of the dishes were spicy, which is fine, but the flavors were a little too overwhelming altogether and even the injera (which was quite good) couldn't balance the tastes. With that said, I'd recommend the collard greens, and any of the beef tibs."
4/10/2014,4 star rating,"I love Ethiopian food and have been to several places around the city. Ghenet was always my favorite, but Awash was a close second, which is convenient since I now live near it and Ghenet is long gone, at least in Manhattan.The injera is always really good, and I always eat entirely too much of it. My two regular choices are the yemisir kik wat (lentils and spicy berebere) and the shiro (mashed chickpeas, milder than the yemisir). I also go for the key sir alicha, which has potatoes, beets, and carrots, or the gomen, which is collard greens.I used to order kategna at Ghenet, which is injera coated in spicy berebere and a cheese-like butter, but that's not on the menu at Awash. When I asked about it, the server had the chef make some for me, which was very kind.The only downside is that the servers, despite being very friendly, are not always massively efficient. If you become frustrated easily at that sort of thing, you should be mentally prepared. The food is worth it, all in all a very nice place to eat."
9/2/2010,5 star rating,"Noodles is an idiot. His ""review"" haha starts out by saying he is open minded, but then he immediately starts complaining about the culturally authentic practice of eating with your hands. I would love to see his review of a sushi restaurant:  ""...I'm open minded, but the 'fish' is not even cooked!?! WTF...""Noodles is a twit!"
12/9/2009,4 star rating,"I will admit it.I am biased.I love Ethiopian food.Though, fear not, ye faithful Yelpers: That auto-star did not have to come into play here. Awash earned it all on it's own.Courteous service from the moment we stepped in the door. The host and water boy made no less than 8 trips to refill my glass (I am a lush) and had a smile on his face every time. No traditional handwashing, but clean, hot towels did the trick and warmed our mitts from the cold outside.The food was delicious: warm wat and cool salad, bountiful injera, unique Ethiopian beers. Especially pleasing was the variation in flavour from one wat to the next (unlike some places were an indistinguishable profil pervades each dish). I cannot reccommend one in particular; just get the vegetarian combo and go exploring.The one negative was how tightly cramped the tables were -which lead to us being 'Awash' in sambussas at one point when our waiter ate it trying to reach our ""cozy"" corner table. Coming and going meant traffic patterns, and logistic work is not normally what one looks for on a friday night.If, however, what you are looking for is huge portions of comforting, filling, and unique food served with pride and an effort to please, Awash is the place."
2/18/2013,3 star rating,"We came here on an impromptu Friday night - it was busy, but as we were only 2 people, we managed to get a table right away. This being only our second time trying Ethiopian food, we opted for the meat combo and a glass of the honey wine. The food was overall quite good - very aromatic, spiced and so much to eat! The honey wine was quite good too, reminded me more of asian plum wines, but my husband wasn't too keen on it. It's definitely a good option for some affordable, delicious and unique food."
7/22/2015,3 star rating,"The food here is so delicious, but I gave them three stars because the service has always been slow (pretty bad about keeping up with the waters, which is important because some food is HOT) and because they can't keep their hours.  Have been here for lunch several times, and about half of the time we show up when Yelp says they open, only to find them closed.  Once we had to wait 15 minutes (fine, we just walked around until it opened) and then once we were told (after calling in) that they would open at 1! This is ridiculous and I haven't been back since.  When I'm hungry, I'm not waiting an hour+.  There are other Ethiopian restaurants that have better service and can actually manage to stick to an opening time.If you can't handle waking up to open until 1, don't list your hours as earlier!"
7/17/2015,5 star rating,"Delicious. Needs more than 5 stars. I ""mmm"" ed after every single bite. Spicy, but not too spicy. Garlicky, but not too Garlicky. So fun to eat with my hands. Left my belly full and warm. Cute interior, clean. I'm never in the UWS, but I will definitely come back for this. $10 for a lunch special!! What?! Got the beef and lamb combo with tons of veggies. Very nice staff. What else? I freaking loved this place! :)"
3/27/2015,4 star rating,Went yesterday evening and had a veggie combo with Ethiopian beer. It was truly delicious. I had tried Ethiopian only once before in Dubai and didnt like it much. Awash refreshed my admiration for Ethiopian cuisine and culture. Our waitress was perhaps among the nicest I've ever experienced. Very cool and relaxed and gave us a detailed overview of what we'd be getting the combo. They also have a TV with an Ethiopian channel running in the background. The decor is authentic with pictures all over the walls. I highly recommend it.
1/25/2015,5 star rating,I love this place! A really good friend introduced me and i have craved their food ever since.  This is a remarkable experience! I make it a monthly must as i live on long Island!
9/27/2008,4 star rating,"The first time someone suggested Ethiopian food to me I have to admit I thought it was an oxymoron.  I can still remember as a child being scolded at the dinner table, ""Don't waste your food there are starving children in Ethiopia.""  Contrary to that line of thought, you definitely will not leave Awash feeling hungry, but perhaps a little guiltier.Ethiopian food is great for a group of friends and people you don't mind getting a little messy around (i.e. not great for first dates where you want to impress someone with the prissy ability to eat food without physically touching it).  At Awash, and any other truly worthwhile Ethiopian dining experience, you eat with your hands, tearing off small pieces of the pancake-like bread ""injera"" and then scooping up mouthfuls of stewed meats and pureed veggies.  The soft, spongy surface of the injera soaks up the thick, flavorful sauces.  And for New York City, the price is definitely perfect for debt-ridden grad students (just a hop and a skip away from Columbia).  For just $10.95 I had a massive plate all to myself with a choice of two meats and three vegetables.  I had the chicken in berbere sauce ""doro wat"" which was the messiest to eat because the chicken, tender as it was, was served on the bone and required a certain degree of fingernail digging and fingertip scalding.   I also went with the beef sauteed in green peppers and onions ""tibs""--but next time around I think I will try the special tibs which sounds like it might have been spicier.  For vegetables, the beets, carrots, and potatoes ""key sir alicha"" were a gorgeous splash of red and when combined with the golden orange of the pureed chickpeas ""shiro"" I had a sunset on my platter. If you're feeling like celebrating, give the rich honey wines a try.  Both the white, Sheba, and the blackberry come highly recommended."
10/20/2008,5 star rating,"OH~ AWASH~ I could not love you more~Tonight I have a combo 5 (Doro Wat, Doro Alicha, Key Sir Alicha, Gomen,  Yemisir Kik Wat ) Doro Wat and Key Sir Alicha are especially amazing. They just reminded my favorite Uyghur /Uighur (Xinjiang in north of China) food ""Dapanji"" - A Big Plate of chili Chicken, Potato & the most unique Flat Noodle-  which I never find in any restaurant in New York.And the service is fabulous, too!"
1/10/2009,5 star rating,"$35 BUCKS FOR TWO PEOPLE & BEER...Why say more?! Love this place...The service is definitely slow but worth the wait. It's affordable, great food and fun to eat. My friends and i enjoy digging in with our hands ...lol and washing it down with honey wine or beer! I recommend any combo without the pork or lamb... It did not taste too good but everything else is great.Definitely give it a try!"
6/29/2015,4 star rating,5 of us enjoyed dinner tonight. We had a meat and vegetarian platter and lots of delicious injera. My husband tried Meta Ethiopian beer for the first time and says it was good.I wish they would give us the nice warm hand towels at the end of the meal as well as beginning. Lovely relaxed atmosphere. Not rushed service - so be patient.
8/20/2008,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I decided on a whim to try this place.  It was somewhat close to us and recommended in a magazine.  The quote from the article  was, ""Great spot for a hot date.""  Yes, please!We jumped on the 1 and arrived to find an empty place.  We were somewhat concerned, since we had just passed a few hopping restaurants.  We ordered the meat combo and it was AWESOME.  We got 4 meat dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  All healthy servings, too, for $23.95!  New Yorkers know how to EAT!  I love it here, already..."
1/23/2008,4 star rating,"Fairly nice decor. i usually judge an Ethiopian restaurant on it's art displayed (amongst a few other things of course), and there is certainly some nice stuff here. The food is fairly good. I am going to give it 4 stars overall because the food is not horrid (I would give the food a 3.5 really), the service is always nice, and they've always had Harar when I've been there, which is a damn good beer. I do wish that I could give it 3.5 though. I'd lay down a 3 here, but I just feel like it deserves a wee bit more, so I am going to be gracious. Oh yes. If someone ever sees a place where you can buy Harar in a store, let me know! My friend in New Mexico would love to have some mailed to her, and I would love to have my refrigerator fully stocked with it."
8/2/2006,4 star rating,"Yummy Ethiopian food as good or better than any other place I've been.  Like many other Ethiopian restuarants, you can get some kind of veggie combo that has all of their vegetarian dishes for quite a reasonable price, and in good sized portions.  Not actually being a vegetarian, I also had some doro wat, which was very tender and tasty.  The Ethiopian coffee, which I've never had before, was pretty good and interesting ... some strong coffee with a wee carafe of warm milk and some spices (?).  Worth a try if you haven't had it.They feel like they're a bit out of the way, as the neighborhood changes somewhat as you move east of Broadway, but they've got a nice big sign calling out to you, so it's easy to find.  Quiet enough inside for a conversation, swith a bit of background music at a reasonable level.  Nice place for a casual dinner."
4/19/2011,5 star rating,"Consistently amazing, though I have only gone to the one on the UWS since my first go. My only complaint is that they served me raw meat once without asking, which is apparently their policy to only cook certain meats when asked. So, now I know and knowing is half the battle. Go jo. I did eat a bit of the raw meat just to see and I have to say: not a fan. Next time I'll ask them to cook it. After the meal when they saw I didn't eat the raw meat, they offered to cook it for me, and said that they gladly would have done so earlier as well if I'd wanted next time. Very nice about it. The Beef TIBS are amazing, and are served cooked. Again: amazing. I also recommend the beets, even if you don't like beets normally. My girlfriend always thinks they are carrots and I have to remind her they are beets.Update: The next time I DID ask them to cook it and the waiter was hilarious (different waiter). Hi: ""are you sure?"" ""It's supposed to be raw"" ""I can't promise it will be good"" ""I don't think you will like it."" He was nice enough, but I was pretty confident in my decision. And it was a great decision. It was delicious. About beef tibs: So, there are several different tib options at awash. I swear to you, I've ordered the same tibs each time, and each time they come out different. Sometimes with onions, sometimes with onions and peppers. The first few times, it was JUST steak. I loved it that way. The onions and peppers are great too, but even when I order the one without onions and peppers, they put it in. Sometimes even if I ask for no onions and peppers. If I were allergic, this would be a problem. Thankfully, it's always delicious enough that I don't care."
2/2/2011,4 star rating,"I really enjoyed the ambiance, the waiter's were attentive without being annoying, and were helpful with my selection. Since I'm not a fan of food on the bone, I stuck with the beef. It was delicious. The Honey Run wine was amazing, easily the highlight of the meal, because it was just that good. I'll have to go back and get more before I give it 5 stars, but I will definitely be going back!"
8/20/2009,4 star rating,"i looooove Ethiopian food and all my friends who've never had it before enjoyed it when I took them here. This place was my go-to final exams food. Don't ask me why I craved Ethiopian food when I was stressed and cramming all night . . . but somehow, Awash always hit the spot :-)Also: the portions are HUGE! You can get 2 meal's worth of food in one of their $10-15 entrees."
11/21/2010,4 star rating,"FIVE STARS FOR FOOD AND SERVICE, I only give this four stars only because when it is over-crowded, the ambience loses its charm.GREAT FOR GROUPS!Food is SO good, SO authentic and SO affordable. The first time we got the check, we literally asked the server if they made a mistake (in our favor.) We couldnt believe how cheap it was. Love the ingera bread (spelling?)- it is so healthy, also!Get the platter for 2 if you go..and start with those afiza lentils..I have never tried a dessert there.Wines by the glass are a bit weak, go for a beer.This place is great for delivery as well when you have a great bottle of wine at home."
7/3/2011,2 star rating,I am not sure if I went on a day when the cook decided not to add some umph to the food. It lacked the flavour that I expected to raise the sense of my tastebuds.I had a combo platter the portions were great and were filling minus the flavour.I loved the atmosphere it was cozy and soothing.The serivce by the waitress on staff was awesome.I love to go to resturants and just relax and not be rushed.If I wanted that type service thats what fast food is for.I would go back again but next time I will have to tell the to spice it up or somehing.
10/5/2012,5 star rating,"What a fun experience!  It is a lot of fun.  I want to go back right now.  I went to Awash about a week and half ago and got caught in a downpour.  It was lovely to rush in and have a seat with my party.  I saw the metal dish containing all the lovely random meats and veggies, and my eyes dilated.  There was a random mix of different flavors.  Tasty juicy cabbage, hearty collard greens, delicious lentils, wonderfully flavored grilled chicken, scrumptious beef went well with the rest of spongy bread underneath.  I really enjoyed this ambience.  Dark, dim lit, and romantic.  Great for a date and romantic evening, I still had a blast with my friends."
1/25/2013,5 star rating,"I fell in love with Ethiopian food while living in DC, and was hoping to find some place equally delicious in NYC. It took a few tries at a few different restaurants, but I really love Awash. When I lived on the West side, I used to get takeout here every other week. Now, I make a point of grabbing takeout whenever I happen to be back on the west, and I never regret it. The bread is just as tangy and delicious as you hope it'll be, the takeout portions are generous (my standard order of beef tibs with two sides is $12.50 and is two full meals - sometimes I can even stretch the bread to three!) I regret that they won't deliver to me anymore, and that they don't offer okra as a side dish as many other Ethiopian restaurants do. But I'm willing to let go of one of my favorite vegetables for all their amazing flavors!!!"
9/29/2010,3 star rating,"The food was a 4. The service was a 2. This averages to a 3. I made reservations for 14 for a birthday-bachelor party. They accommodated us well, and even said I could bring in cupcakes and other stuff for the party. When we were all seated, they took our orders with a lot of patience with our questions, although they couldn't handle orders above plates for 3 (although their menu says they can). So, we ordered in 2s ($22 and up) and 3s ($33 and up), and then had a loooong wait for the food to arrive, as other reviewers have noted. Not only that, but they weren't very helpful in wrapping leftovers to go; they seemed to take people's dishes and then not come back. Last, they took FOREVER to give us our damn check. We waited, then asked, then waited more, then asked again, then waited more. We were subsequently late for our next engagement because of them, and this also made for a lot of bad check splitting based on some people estimating their costs without a bill in hand. Drama drama drama for my birthday and friend's bachelor party. As for the food itself, it was good. The cuts of meat were not fantastic, but the flavors of the food were great, easily 4 star. Unlike LA, they were more on the sweet/savory side then just spicy in a wholesome/salty way. And, each dish tasted somewhat unique, rather than blurring together. I'd return for the food but put lots of pressure on them for the service. Go only if you have time and no other plans and lots of patience."
10/26/2015,3 star rating,They look almost an hour to bring the food even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. There were only one waiter serving. The food was delicious though. The ambience isn't great at all.
11/24/2014,4 star rating,"Awesome food! My biggest gripe is the price!!! it can get very expensive, very fast. The quantity of food you get with one order makes it worth it though. The food took a while to come out but was obviously very freshly made. The waiters were great about water/ enjira refills. They also carry Tej (honey wine) which is delicious... although very intense. Also, now that its winter, the restaurant can get so cold! My party ate with jackets on! other than that this place was great!"
10/16/2015,4 star rating,"Service can be a bit slow, but the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. I recommend the Tibs with some honey wine."
7/14/2010,3 star rating,"Injera was delicious, but I found the vegetarian platter a little wanting - some options were overspiced, others bland, none really in between. Overall, I did like it and would go back. It is only my 2nd Ethiopian experience, and so far the first restaurant I tried suited my tastes better. I also enjoyed the vegetarian spring rolls that I had as an appetiser. The majority of deep fried food tends to come drenched in the sensation of win, and this did not disappoint.I'll keep taste testing and if I am back in NY, would definitely try it again. After all, any restaurant that gives you hand towels to wash your hands in preparation for your meal, then allows you to pretty much play with your food (a.k.a eat with your hands) is a done deal for me."
5/22/2014,1 star rating,"I love the taste of their food but:---if you get the wrong server it isn't worth it. I just sat in silence eating my meal with no music but listening to the server carry on a loud phone call in sharp tones, even carrying the phone to the table and continuing to talk on it. Not a relaxing experience. I felt like I was trapped in a strangers house and trying to eat my way out. --- Also, the portions felt like leftover scraps and were very small on the meat helping."
4/6/2011,4 star rating,"A solid spot for a weeknight dinner.  They have great deal for a dinner for two, 2 different meats, and 3 veggies and two glasses of wine for like $34.  We ordered the chicken and the lamb along with the collard greens, lentils and beets (sorry I don't know the Ethiopian names).   Awash has good service and it is a nice little find on the UWS.  Check it out!"
8/4/2011,4 star rating,"I have a huge crush on Ethiopian food. My first restaurant job was at an Ethiopian place: what a breeze, service-wise! No flatware to mark or clear, and each table's order comes out of the kitchen all together on the same big plate!At Awash, they bring you the big plate lined with injera (that signature spongey Ethiopian bread made from tef, the smallest grain in the world -- it also doubles as your fork!) and two dollops of vegetable sides (in our case, collard greens and a mixture of carrots, potatoes and beets) and then they spoon your order onto the plate table-side. We got gored-gored (chunks of tender, raw beef tossed in a spicy sauce; $15) and shiro (pureed chick peas, hot sauce; perhaps my favorite thing in the world; $10.50). That and another vegetable dish (carrots and string beans, $13; maybe we wouldn't have ordered it if we knew we'd get those other little dollops on the plate) was more than enough food, especially considering that the bread is filling, and you really can't eat this kind of food without eating bread, since you are using your hands and most of the cuisine is quite saucy.To that end, you get extra rolled up injera on the side and refills if you need; before your meal arrives you get a hot white washcloth (like the Japanese oshi-buri); with your check you get individually wrapped towelettes."
8/22/2012,5 star rating,"We ended up at Awash after our favorite Ethiopian restaurant closed down but now we don't bother going anywhere else because the food is delicious and authentic.We always order the vegetarian combo platter for two with a side order of special tibs (spicy stewed meat with tomatoes). The vegetarian combo comes with an assortment of legumes, such as shiro lentils and pureed chickpeas, accompanied by a dressed salad or cooked dark greens, and served with a side of injera bread. It's never too crowded so you won't wait long to be served. Columbia students, neighborhood folk, and tourists can be found dining here. I highly recommend this place, Zagat rated."
4/24/2010,5 star rating,"Absolutely wonderful restaurant definitely worth a visit!!!!!Service was very prompt and my water was filled as soon as it was almost empty and on every table there was a beautiful rose, a nice touch. The restaurant had some interesting decor (paintings of monarchs, it seems) and the set-up was very cozy with mirrors, white cloth tables and a mini bar in back that smacked of festivity.But oh the food.....I had Ethiopian food once before and was not impressed, but decided to give it another go, and boy am I glad I chose Awash. The injera was not as sour as the one I had the first time and the sponginess and tanginess was right on.I ordered the Awash chicken which was marinated with garlic ginger, and other spices and came with three vegetable sides of which I picked GOMEN (collard green coked with onions, garlic and green peppers), YATAKILT ALICHA (cabbage, carrot, potatoes, delicately sauteed with peppers onions and garlic) and SHIRO (crowned chick peas, mildly spiced, cooked with chopped onions and tomatoes). The vegetables are so thoroughly cooked and rich with all kinds of exotic flavors. It is apparent they use herbs and spices liberally and the result is splendid. The chicken was cooked dry (and one of the few dishes on the menu cooked without butter) and was slightly harder to chew than I would've liked but nevertheless tasted awesome with the injera and the vegetable sides. My favorite vegetable side is the SHIRO so be sure to try that one!They gave you extra injera (I had three ""rolls"") and really filled you up. I think I devoured the whole thing in less than 3 minutes. At first it felt kind of strange to eat with your hands while scooping with the injera bread but after the first few bites it felt so primal and just FUN to eat with your hands in a restaurant setting. It felt so free and liberating! Between big lip-smacking bites, I was vowing to return here and bring all of my friends. I think I will be craving Ethiopian food  reallll soon! (Never though I would ever say this). p.s. I tried the dishes cooked in Berbere sauce and not too crazy about the sauce. It's a little spicy but also had a bitter after-taste that I think I might get used to after a while but initially was a bit jarring. Avoid until you get used to the other things/bored with other things on the menu."
6/5/2018,4 star rating,"I have to say I am writing this review because I was inspired after just having a bad Ethiopian meal tonight. I am a fan of Ethiopian food and will eat it any where i can. I've reviewed other Ethiopian restaurants and trust me Awash is still one of the best. This location has better cuisine than the others. I was going to Brooklyn and East Village locations, and happen to be in Harlem. Decided to come here and I was happy. I said this is what Ethiopian food is about. Note you, I am about to write a negative review about ANOTHER Ethiopian restaurant that inspired me to write this review. Their Doro wat is still good and NOT OILY! Also, the bread is light and not dense. Lamb and beef are good. Beets are A plus and gomen (collard greens) are solid too. Recently on another trip, I had a cocktail here and I liked it a lot. Waitresses are also very nice. Wait time is reasonable. Make the trip and come here."
12/10/2014,5 star rating,"Wow is this restaurant delicious. I was so pleased to see many Ethiopians dining when I walked in, the mark of a truly authentic ethnic restaurant. The food was extremely delicious, so unique, flavorful, different and interesting. My boyfriends and I shared the vegetarian platter of about 8 salads that came on a huge tray covered in injera, the delicious, spongy Ethiopian bread and a sweet South African wine. The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was lovely, with ambient lighting and quiet Ethiopian music, and the space was extremely clean. I will absolutely be back!"
7/27/2009,4 star rating,"In 20-30 years, African restaurants may fill out the hip downtown streets. For now, you can enjoy Awash's Ethiopian standards. I chose one of the meat combinations, which feeds 2 and is served on the large, spongy pancake (no fork/knife allowed). All meat and vegetables were tasty, though not necessarily memorable (after all, this is peasant food--cheap, appetizing, and satisfying)."
1/28/2013,4 star rating,"An Ethiopian place on Indian Row? Why not! This place is great. We had the Meat Sambusa's, Awash Chicken, Gomen, Shiro and Yatitikit Alicho. Sambusa's are a must have, Might skip the Yatikit next time. While sometimes the flavors melded into eachother into a nebulous flavor, overall it was very good. I tried a friend's honey wine and it was delicious but incredibly sweet. As a desert wine it would be nice. Also tried some delicious Ethipian Beer; having a Harar or two wouldn't be the worst move you could make.. Ambiance is relatively upscale but we had a rowdy crew of 8 and they didn't seem to mind. The best part might have been the bill. 45 dollars each for a lot of food, a lot of wine and a lot of beer."
7/10/2015,4 star rating,"I don't usually write reviews, but I had to give credit where credit is due. I ordered a HUGE amount of food from Awash for a company luncheon recently. Seeing as I'm not too familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, I coordinated with the manager Bogi (spelling?), who was incredibly helpful on what I should order. Being that it would be in large quantity, I was worried that the quality would lack a bit, but everything was delicious. The split lentils (Yemissir Kik Wat) were amazing, just the right amount of spice and very filling, as well as the Veggie Sambusa. Even though they don't serve rice, she bought some from a local store and included it in the order.She was incredibly accommodating, as they delivered all the way down to our office in Midtown East. The delivery guys were EARLY and get this, she even called to make that everything was delivered. Usually I'm stalking the restaurant to get their whereabouts, but she was AMAZING! She called me when they left, when they arrived and after. Well done!"
3/21/2012,4 star rating,"Slightly smaller portions than other Ethiopian restaurants that I have been to, but that was actually a good thing.  We were still full after sharing their 'make your own combination for two'.  The special Tibs were delicious and the chicken was so tender!  The Tej (Ethiopian honey wine) was nice a crisp - one of my favorites!"
3/2/2017,3 star rating,"The food was extremely good. They provide nearly unlimited injera, and they packed what is typically a very messy ordeal when one of my friends couldn't finish her portion of the entrees. The Yebeg Alicia was great. The lamb wasnt as tender as advertised or expected. The wait was long despite having made a confirmed reservation - seemed like a miscommunication between the servers."
12/23/2014,4 star rating,"The restaurant is tucked away, clean, and quiet. The food was very flavorful and very generous in portions! (we ordered the veggie platter, and the selection was varied and ALL delicious) Really, my only criticism was that it seemed like they were rationing the injera.Otherwise, I absolutely have plans to go back. Some of the best Ethiopian I have had in New York."
5/16/2008,4 star rating,"I lived right next to Massawa years ago, and was a loyal customer, so I'll admit to being a little based.  That being said, I was in the neighborhood of Awash last night and decided to give it a try.  We started with a bottle of the blackberry honey wine.  It was sweet and delicious, a nice complement to the food that followed.  We had a mix of meat and vegetables.  I didn't find anything to be overly spicy, but the berbere sauce did have a kick.  Highlights were key sir alicha (red beets, carrots and potatoes) and doro wat (chicken in berbere).  I'm also a huge fan of injera!Service was slow, but that was actually nice, as we didn't feel at all rushed and took the time to enjoy out food and wine.  The food actually came out pretty quickly. The slow part was getting our check.  Oh!  And not to be left unmentioned, the Ethiopian coffee was excellent! Loved it!"
12/14/2014,4 star rating,Great food the best Ethiopian in the city in my opinion. service is hit or miss but worth it for the great food.  I eat here often.
11/13/2016,4 star rating,"This place has been here for a long time with good reason.  The food is always yummy, and contrary to what another reviewer mentioned you can get all veggie combos.  The staff is also always nice.  The atmosphere is unassuming, which is part of why we like it.  Sometimes the injera is not as warm as we'd like, but that is a minor issue.  We've also ordered take out: the quality is just as good.  It does come a little messy: it would be better if they packaged the injera and the meat/veggies separately, but its still worth it."
1/18/2017,5 star rating,I absolutely love this place. It's comfortable and always delicious. I eat at one of the 3 Awash restaurants at least twice a month. My very favorite!
10/18/2016,3 star rating,"We got the meat combo platter. Some decent veggie dishes but lacking robust flavor. Our lamb dish was terrible, tough and stringy. Other meat dishes were fine but nothing compared to the more flavorful dishes I've had in other Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurants in DC."
2/23/2015,3 star rating,Service was poor food was okay the only thing that was delicious was the sambusas both beef and veggie thats the only reason for the third star.
10/11/2016,3 star rating,"Food was uneven.  A few dishes were very good, others kind of bland.  The chicken Doro Wat was a highlight.  Injera was light and not overly-filling, which I liked.  The staff was very friendly, but there were only two women working the whole place, so service was slow & somewhat inattentive. The environment is pleasant -- nice lighting, art & quiet music -- and overall quiet, but it's definitely worn.  There was tear in the carpet your table, the bathroom was really in need of repair, and I killed a roach in the hall by the bathroom and kitchen, which was an unappetizing way to start my evening, to say the least!  St George's Amber beer was quite tasty, but the honey wine I had for an after-dinner drink wasn't that great and almost put me in a sugar coma.  One other odd note -- they used weird disposable hand towels microwaved in plastic packets, instead of the lovely cloths most places use."
10/6/2013,2 star rating,"My husband I ordered the meat combo, which also comes with three veggie items. I really wish we stuck with the vegetables. The meat didn't seam fresh and had a good amount of gristle. Overall, the food seemed under-seasoned. But the worst part? My husband and I both had upset stomachs later that night. While the service was great and I really enjoyed the honey wine, I won't be returning."
11/24/2009,4 star rating,"A good feeling came over me as soon as we breached the doorway and the delicious smell of spices hit me right in the face.The place was almost full on a Sunday night at around 7 so that was a good sign in my book as well.I ordered a combination plate consisting of tibs(spicy cubed beef), doro wat (chicken on the bone) and three vegetable sides. The red lentils here were a little more al dente than most Ethiopian restaurants I've been to but just as tasty. The meat was tender and the spice level was a nice slow steady burn. They also have many vegetarian options like most Ethiopians joints.Prices are very reasonable. Service is a little slow but who's rushing?"
11/21/2016,5 star rating,"Every year I place a big order of many dishes for a special ""evening in Ethiopia"" I offer friends on Long Island. I order the food and then come and get it in the afternoon and that night everyone explores new tastes and has a great time. Everything is well prepared. The staff is very helpful. The dishes are all tasty and the whole experience is a delight, with lots of injera. Thanks to all for a wonderful job of bringing delicious Ethiopian food to New York City."
9/13/2016,5 star rating,I've been so fortunate to live within walking and delivery distance of Awash and find that this is hands down one of the best Ethiopian spots uptown. The portions here are more generous than nearby spots (I've tried Massawa and Soma) and everything is rich and flavorful. Delivery service is reliable and the restaurant itself has great service and ambiance. I'm an Awash fan for life!
9/10/2016,3 star rating,"Portion size is pretty small so if you're hungry you'll need to order more items than you usually would. I've been to other Ethiopian restaurants before and they seem to give you a little less compared to others. In terms of food quality, it was about average compared to other Ethiopian restaurants. Flavorful food."
9/2/2016,4 star rating,I came in for the lunch special and had the vegetarian combo.  It was very good and the staff was great. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because there is a minimum purchase of $13 if you use a credit card. Overall great experience there.
6/28/2012,4 star rating,"Amazing! I love good Ethiopian food. The place was quiet, but it was quite late when I arrived and really empty the night I visited it. Despite the wait service getting off to a slow start by the end of the night we were all laughing. He even gave my son some pointers on how to eat the food without spilling it. I ate the pre-fix menu which was reasonably priced for the neighborhood. I left happy, full, and smiling."
10/27/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Ethiopian restaurant in New York. The portions are excellent and they're incredibly consistent with how good they are.  The biggest problem with Ethiopian restaurants in New York is their horrible service and consistency with quality and awash is by far the best. I just wish string beans were included as part of the side dish when ordering entrees.  Overall, i highly recommend this place, I order at least half a dozen times a month."
5/7/2014,5 star rating,Always great every time I've been with groups or just one more person. Friendly staff as always. A bit of a hike from the b/c trains but shorter walk from the 1.
7/8/2010,5 star rating,"I must preface this review by mentioning that I previously lived in Berkeley, CA right off Telegraph and was very close to an amazing Ethiopian restaurant that I immediately fell in love with. I knew that a city like New York was bound to have great Ethiopian restaurants as well, so I made it a point to check some of them out as soon as I could.A friend and I decided we wanted a post-happy hour dinner and thought ""why not try an Ethiopian place?"" So, we did. We chose this particular place because of its location. We live near Columbia University, which is in walking distance of Awash. (Also helped that I always check Yelp before doing anything and saw the good reviews!)The service was good. We ordered honey wine and they gave us a sample of the blackberry version of it, so we could decide since neither of us had had that kind before. There was a small fruit fly in my first glass of wine but it was immediately taken care of, and I didn't think much of it! The restaurant has a nice ambiance. Dimly lit with candles at each table. The place was pretty full, but not loud even though the tables can be quite close to one another. My friend and I each got a combo plate with two meats and three veggies. I got special tibs and some other kind of tibs (which I can't remember right now). They were incredibly flavorful and delicious. I liked that they were both a little spicy. I ordered the collard greens, potatoes and carrots, and beets and carrots (?) for my vegetables. All were very good. My friend got lamb and chicken with chick peas, lentils, and the beets/carrots and really enjoyed everything.I will definitely be visiting the restaurant again very soon! I cannot wait actually!"
4/25/2011,5 star rating,This was seriously the best Ethiopian food I've had! I highly suggest that you get one of the combos. That way you get to try a little bit of everything.
6/24/2011,4 star rating,"Oh my Awash, you have delicious food! I have been to a handful of Ethiopian restaurants in DC and this makes the cut. The vegetable platter is very yummy with EVERY dish in the platter was excellent. The ambiance is no frills with tables packed in the restaurant. We sat near the window--which was much nicer. The service was slow, but we weren't in a rush. Overall, a very pleasant experience. I will be back."
7/22/2012,5 star rating,"I've had Ethiopian food before, but this was my first time at Awash.  I thought their dishes were fabulous, and quite a good deal for dinner for two in NYC.  My husband and I shared one of the combo platters and had several meats and veggies to choose from, and they were all tasty!  The lentils were probably the simplest dish and not quite as flavorful, but it was a nice break for my palate considering everything else is either spicier or has a stronger flavor.  We had MORE than enough food for the two of us, and were definitely too full for dessert :)Service was good, the waitress was friendly, and my only slight complaint is that the place seems a bit crowded and overstuffed with tables."
11/29/2016,5 star rating,"Visited this restaurant because it was within walking distance and the menu looked like a solid selection of quality authentic Ethiopian food. Ordered the veggie combo for two - portions were perfect and variety was a great mix allowing us to try out different Ethiopian dishes. I highly recommend getting a combo meal - it is very reasonably priced and allows you to try a bit of everything! Perfect for a date night, would definitely return."
7/13/2014,4 star rating,Great food. Excellent restaurant. I went with a couple of friends who had never tried Ethiopian. They were very impressed. The food is a bit spicy so ask about milder options if you're not into that. Service was fast. We ended up getting a combo for two (even though we were three).  They say they charge if you add an extra person but they comp the charge if you get an appetizer.
9/10/2016,3 star rating,"This restaurant was the location of my one and only foray into Ethiopian cuisine; I hope this isn't typical because I was extremely disappointed not only by the food but also by the service which I found to be very indifferent! Perhaps Sunday afternoon isn't the best time to eat at this restaurant but I'm not sure I will ever set foot in here again to find out otherwise! Disclaimer; I am a non-vegan who stuck to the vegetarian options in order to placate my vegan friend, perhaps that is the origin of my dislike for the food"
10/23/2008,4 star rating,"Excellent food, attentive service, excellent food.  And really reasonably priced to boot!  My veg entree was $10, and a meat entree runs about $15.  The atmosphere is casual and laid-back, and while there's the requisite ethnic-restaurant ethnic artwork (here, portraits of former leaders), it's not over-the-top or tacky.The injera was a little too thick for my taste, but my entree was super tasty.  I had the collard greens, which came with a side of carrot and potato-like things, and it came with a dollop of some sauce, all of which was devoured really, really quickly.  It was tasty without being really heavy; I didn't feel gross after eating the entire mound of greens.  Yum!  It's a shame I really rarely come up here, otherwise I'm sure I'd patronize it more.  They have maybe half a dozen veg dishes, all of which looked really good."
9/21/2009,5 star rating,"This restaurant is one of my favorites in the neighborhood. I have never had a bad meal here, but be warned: it IS Ethiopian food, so it will be different from anything you have ever tried before which is what I consider to be part of the fun. I usually get the meat combination for two (definitely with the special tibs as one of the meats) and a beer. Food is fresh and delicious. Sometimes, it is true, the service can be a little slow, but the food is so good I never mind much."
10/29/2011,5 star rating,I am new to New York and this was one of the first places I was recommended to try. The atmosphere is very inviting and calming. The staff was very nice to us. THE FOOD: AMAZING. We had the group deal and shared different food options. To be honest I don't remember specifically what I had but the good thing it was all delicious. The chicken was especially yummy! I am always craving their food. A meal if shared will be around 10 dollars. It's well worth it! Looking forward to going back.
6/5/2013,2 star rating,Below average Ethiopian food. Very little taste...which for Ethiopian food is weird since its usually the most flavorful
1/8/2014,4 star rating,I came back for a second try and the new flavors have definitely grown on me! I ordered the Awash chicken that I liked last time around and was very happy. Looking forward to introducing some other friends to the cuisine!
1/22/2013,3 star rating,"My first Ethopian food! No utensils required/allowed - be prepared to get messy.I got the Combo for 1 with meat with the Awash Chicken,  Beef Special Tibs,  collard greens, lentils, and carrots and potatoes. The Ethopian bread was a bit bitter due to all the yeast. I liked the Awash chicken a lot and the sauce on the beef but the beef itself was a bit tough."
11/15/2013,3 star rating,I love the food here but I suggest you go on an off night --- do not go on a weekend night... if you're hungry.  The service is really bad/slow here and their ability to even fill up water glasses becomes impaired :(
4/28/2013,2 star rating,"First time at an Ethiopian restaurant.  Underwhelmed.  Expected more from the reviews.  Got a combo platter of two meats, and three veggies  Food was really boring, nothing terribly wrong, seemed well prepared, just nothing hit me as a good flavor combination.   The bread was interesting, spongy, and tangy.  The honey wine was nice.  I was not prepared for this, but there are no utensils, so you have to manage your bread provided to picked stuff up with.  Would rather not deal with that hassle, and mess."
11/25/2010,3 star rating,wall art is interesting.... Decent selection They don't rush youI liked the special beef
7/25/2011,3 star rating,"Went here with some friends - a fun place for Ethiopian food and pretty quick, decent service although lacking in Ethiopian smiles and sunshine.None of the food was bursting with freshness or originality, a common theme  with Ethiopian food outside of DC, making this place fade away into the realm of average. The injera (bread) was quite good - a pleasant supriseDoro Wat (chicken) - solid offering; right amount of spicinessGored Gored (raw meat) - also pretty good, a little too buttery but that's how the ethiopians like it. nice spice again.Tibs (grilled lamb) - fine but not memorableGomen (collared greens) - a little soggy and flavorless, but an important counterweight to all the meatShiro (split peas) - not very fresh, not very tasty, looked like mudMessir (lentils) - a bit better than the shiro but not by much. too spicy.Vegetable beyayenetu (veggie combo) - excluding the above three, it wasn't bad, but they constituted 3/5Overall I would come back if I happened to be in the area and was with friends who were in the mood. Recommend the meat dishes over the veggie ones, which is sad because usually it would be the opposite.Ambiance was a bit blah despite what other reviewers have said. Nice selection of Ethiopian beers and the sparkling water - Ambo."
12/8/2011,4 star rating,"I was not super hungry so, I split a meat sambusa app and the string bean and carrot dish with my Mom. The sauce that came with the sambusas was so good. If I lived near, I would buy it and keep at home to put on everything. I loved it. The sambusa's were good to, but to me they were just a vehicle to get more of that sauce in my mouth. The green beans and carrots were really good- cooked until almost roasted. They kindly included the beet dish and the red lentils so that the plate wouldn't look so empty. I really liked the beets. I wasn't crazy about the red lentils. The paprika or whatever pepper powder they used in it tasted uncooked or there was too much for my liking. I'm not saying it was wrong, but it was just a little too much to make my mouth happy.The ladies that waited on us were so nice. I would love to go back."
3/11/2016,4 star rating,Great food! I've been here multiple times. It takes a while to get the check in case you have to eat and leave.
1/12/2014,5 star rating,"If you've never tried Ethiopian,  like me, this is a great place to start!  Great service. We were two abd ordered the meal for two with the chicken mains on the Ethiopian Flat bread called injetta. Quite like Indian food, you eat with your hands abd quite rightly because that's when you get the full flavor from the chicken that's falling off the bone or the lentils or the Chick peas.. give this place a try. .good brunch spot because the food is so good you won't need wine for that after food siesta.. the food will take you there. . And all for under $25.."
1/2/2013,4 star rating,"Out of all the NYC Ethiopian places we like this one the best. Their injera is awesome and their veggie combo is tasty.  We spent about 3 years trying every Ethiopian place in Manhattan and settled on this for the food, drink (get the Meta Beer) and location. The staff is pretty cool too!"
4/15/2016,5 star rating,"Great experience -- the restaurant is nice, the staff was kind, and the food was superb. Got one of the vegetation dishes, and there was a lot of food (plenty for two people), all fantastic."
10/27/2013,5 star rating,"Delicious. Unique. Special. I love this restaurant. The flavors of Ethiopian food, the kind servers and the traditional ambiance gave me a truly special experience, no matter how dissimilar the flavors are compared with traditional new-American cuisine and its pan-Asian counterparts. Awash, is of course, anything but."
2/16/2013,3 star rating,"As far as Ethiopian restaurants in the city go, this one is #3 to Zoma and Queen of Sheba. Being vegetarian, I can only compare my two favorite dishes: shiro and miser. The shiro was very good, but is better with bigger portions at Zoma across the street. My friends loved the chicken and lamb dishes, and the place is obviously doing something right since it's pretty hard to get a seat on a weekend night. It's sort of crammed and twice while I was there, people tipped over glasses while walking by tables. The service was TERRIBLE, almost to the point that it became a joke for us - that he hated us for some reason we didn't know about. They're all about turning tables and getting another party in, but ironically move at a snail's place and you have to ask 10 times before you get your drink/food/bill. As others said, the honey wine is a must-do at any Ethiopian place that offers it."
7/29/2013,4 star rating,"The place to be for Ethiopian. It's a very mellow little spot and I found all the servers to be super friendly and accomodating. I had the lamb with chickpeas, which was delicious! Also, I recommend the meta beer, nice and sweet. Be sure to wash your hands because you will be eating with them!"
10/31/2014,2 star rating,"My first time having  Ethiopian cuisine, don't know if there will be a second. All I tasted was smoke and chipotle. Not good at all. Awash was a wash for me. So much so, that we went for pizza afterwards."
6/27/2013,3 star rating,"Awash offers an Ethiopian menu that is alien to many people but gives the opportunity to abandon expectation. The first thing to go is the silverware. The second is the slightest idea of what you just ordered. I went for the kitfo because raw meat and hot spice sounded like a no brainer to me. I was really blown away by how delicious and flavorful it was, but it became overbearing pretty quickly. I usually do not like to sweat my dinner the entire evening or taste my entree at 10 o'clock the next morning but... lucky me. Even the Injera used to eat it with became less neutral and more spongey and yeasty throughout the meal. I would try Awash again as they have a lot of interesting menu items and the kifko was genuinely an interesting dish."
1/21/2015,2 star rating,"Super slow delivery! More than a 90 minute wait!! The food is good, but such slow service, so we probably won't get it again."
2/27/2010,4 star rating,"Awash is one of the best places to eat by Columbia university. The food is ridiculous and makes me, a veracious meat eater, consider being a vegetarian after sampling the lovely vegetable combo. Words to the wise. Get the veggie combo. It's cheap, feeds two , and the lentils are likely to make it  on the list of things that make you go ""ooooh""."
9/8/2015,4 star rating,"We had a hankering for Ethiopian food and Awash on the upper west side hit the spot. The place is unassuming, very plain decor, a few pictures, nothing that really speaks to its origins. Kind of like a diner that has ramped it up only slightly (e.g. for a restaurant where people eat with their hands, a single paper napkin is the utter height of parsimony... get rid of them, bring in cloth, I'll pay the extra couple of bucks you'll need to charge to pay for a laundry service). We had the vegetable sambusa followed by the meat platter (with three veggies). We needed a few extra rounds of injera, but that was no problem. Apparently you can have as much as you like. We shared a bottle of Tej. This is a must-do part of the meal. Tej or Ethiopian beer, though seriously, Tej. It's a honey wine and it goes so well with the food. All in all a great night and it will be added to our stable of good places to eat."

8/6/2010,2 star rating,"Ambiance - 5 stars. White table cloths, good spacing between tables. Music not blaring. Lighting just right. Clean.Service - 3 stars. Too slow to come to take the initial order. Too slow to give us the check. The sad thing is the restaurant was not that busy. But even if they were, some kind of acknowledgement that we were waiting would have sufficed. No such gesture was made.Food - 3 stars.  Had the veggie combo which I normally get at Ethiopian restaurants. If I wanted to introduce someone to Ethiopian food, it would not be here. Take them to Meskerem in the W 40s - 100 times better. Some of the food here was pretty bland. I was wondering where were the spices.Drinks - 1 star. My friend ordered a Long Island ice tea to help wind down his hectic work day. Unfortunately this drink did not do the trick. Let's just say the look on his face after the first sip had the words ""let down"" written all over it. I felt bad for him because he was really looking forward to it too.Prices - No happy hour drink specials (at least none advertised). Drink was $7. Food is reasonably priced. Veggie combo was $11 which is about the norm for NY.Overall - I won't be back. Only 2 out of the 5 dishes on the veggie combo were worth eating. From now on I'll stick to Meskerem in the W 40s (or on W4 if I'm taking it to go). That is until I find a better Ethiopian restaurant in NYC."
7/31/2006,5 star rating,"I had my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine at this place.  The spongey bread (have no idea what its called....does it matter?) is the only utensil you need. Great place for a first date....its casual, inexpensive but still cozy and quiet. Yummy!"

4/11/2009,2 star rating,"Well let me first being by saying that I was not excited about going to this restaurant. The food doesn't look appetizing. But, after trying it, it was better than I thought it would be. The bread ( I apologize now for not having the technical names to refer to) is very spongy and slightly sour. The foods you choose are placed in a large pan with your choices on top. I chose the single person combo platter at $10.95 that includes two meats and three veggie choices. I had the special tibs (beef cubes), chicken, beets, collard greens and lentil (saucy). The lentil was a bit spicy but tasted very good. THe chicken was a bit bitter and was my least favorite. The best dish of the night however, was the appetizer- beef sambusa. I loved the sauce that came with it. It had a heavy lemony garlic flavor to it. We also had veggie sambusa which was good. The sambusas had a great crunchy, flavorful crust. Although the appetizer was good, I probably wouldn't make a trip from Queens all the way out there for a meal..The food does take a while to be served (but at least it's the same for everyone across the board so you expect it and it's not intentional discrimnation or something...).The food is very filling. You can share a combo but must add $5 for every additional person the combo is not designated for. The ambiance is nice with candles, portraits of important people and my favorite- the  Ethiopian styled lanterns. I liked that the waitresses wore traditional garb. They looked very elegant."
8/31/2013,5 star rating,"The combo is the perfect amount of food for two with plenty of variety of meat and vegetable dishes. The Doro Wat is super succulent and delicious, and the lentils are an excellent choice for veggies."
10/23/2015,4 star rating,Some of the best Ethiopian food I have had in NYC (full discretion I have only been to 3 other places).  The decor needs some work but if you focus on the food and friendly service it is a great option on the UWS.
6/19/2010,5 star rating,"I've always really liked Ethiopian food, and this has so far been my favorite Ethiopian in the city.  The ambiance was very nice-homey, ethnic-and there was a really upbeat vibe.We were there around 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  The place was about half full.  Unlike some other reviewers, our service wasn't slow, and as is typical at Ethiopian restaurants the waitstaff were extremely polite and respecful.We had the meat combo for 2, and we each had a glass of honey wine (1 red, 1 white).  Both were flavorful.  The injera was absolutely perfect.We pretty much devoured the ample plate of food when it came to us, and left completely, utterly full.I would definitely like to go back."
6/7/2009,4 star rating,"Second time at an Ethiopian restaurant. It tastes very similar to the first on i went to. My fave parts are the sour flat bread and eating with your hand. I think this place gives you unlimited bread, but I am not sure, so don't hold me to that. I also tried Ethiopian coffee for the first time since they're known for their coffee ceremonies. The coffee is tasted like it has a lot of spices in it. My friend really enjoyed it but it's not my cup of 'tea' (it made my stomach felt like it was on fire). But all in all, I like Ethiopian food :)"
3/19/2013,5 star rating,"Such an amazing menu!  I came to NYC to visit my sister and try new things.  Ethiopian food please!  Defiantly take your taste buds and yourself on a food adventure.  Easy to share dishes and great drinks.  Very nice, friendly, and helpful service."
8/19/2014,1 star rating,"This was an awful dinning experience. We came at 8, We ordered appetizers. It took an hour for us to get our appetizers, and the entire time we never got waters filled, main orders taken-anything without hunting down the waitress. When we finally did get our entree it was 9:40. The couple next to us came after us and ate, paid and left before we even got our order.   The wait staff had intense attitudes, walking away when we politely questioned about our order. The worst part is they tried to tack on a mandatory 20% tip to a party of 5 polite, quiet people.  The food wasnt spectacular. Dont even bother."
3/24/2007,4 star rating,"Ethiopian food and I are quite fond of one another, and this place is no exception.  It's a little out of the way for me, but was well worth the hike."
3/30/2009,4 star rating,"I have to admit I was pretty apprehensive about eating here because so many of my friends that have tried Ethiopian haven't been fans of the bread. I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here. The ambience was relaxed, the waitress was extremely helpful with suggestions and explaining the different dishes, and the food was really good! The whole experience of scooping up the meat and vegetables with the bread and eating with your hands was really unique and a lot of fun."
4/10/2009,4 star rating,"This was my first attempt at Ethopian food and dare I say that I love it. The experience was simply amazing. The food was great and the price wasn't bad either. We ordered a bottle of red honey wine... OMG!!! We tried to buy a bottle from them that we can take home but they wouldn't let us. It was so good. We ordered the Meat Combination to share and because there was three of us, and the combination is shared between two people, there was a $5 charge. However, you can get away with not having to pay if you order another appetizer. The one we chose was the Chicken Sambusa. It was amazingly good. Especially if you dump a lot of the spicy yellow sauce on it. The pastry is lightly fried so it's crunchy and the chicken inside was not dry at all. The Meat Combo consisted of Tibs Wat, Doro Wat, Yebeg Alicha, and any 3 vegetables of your choice. It's basically pork, chicken, and lamb cooked in 3 different ways. The pork and chicken were great. I'm not a big fan of lamb to begin with so that was okay. We chose YATAKILT ALICHA which is cabbage, carrot, potatoes, delicately sauteed with peppers onions and garlic, YEMESIR KIK WAT: split red lentils cooked in berbere sauce, and SHIRO: crowned chick peas, mildly spiced, cooked with chopped onions and tomatoes as our 3 vegetables. YUMMMM is all I got to say. The only problem I had with this restaurant is that the bread you grab everything with was way too sour for me. Not a big fan of that.The overall experience there was great. The service was good, although they should hire at least another waitress because when it got busy, we couldn't get her to come over fir at least 10 minutes. The price was great too. The three of us spent a little over $70 including tips and a bottle of honey wine that was $27."
2/5/2011,2 star rating,"I'd like to give this place 2.5 stars. interesting (in a good way) sauce with the samosas, but everything else was surprisingly bland. We got the combo with special tibs, lamb with onions, potatoes & carrots, red lentils, and greens. The lamb was actually pretty good but everything else needed something, anything. The lentils had a kick (hot) without actually having much flavor. This is the only Ethiopian I've tried in nyc, but I guess the west coast has spoiled me in that it is probably one of the more disappointing Ethiopia meals I've had."
12/18/2012,5 star rating,"I've been to Awash a few times and I am never disappointed- the food is delicious. Friends of mine from DC (where the Ethiopian food is known to be awesome) said this was their favorite place in NYC and that it was just as good as in DC. I always get a combo platter with 2 meats/3 veg and enjoy it The lamb dishes and ""special tibs"" are my favorites. The lentil dishes are good too. I usually like to get an Ethopian beer to accompany the meal, they usually have a selection of 4 or 5. Dinner on a casual date night for 2 (combo platter) with 2 beers was less than $50, which is great in NYC!"
4/19/2011,5 star rating,"I can't believe I havent written a review for this place yet.  I love it here, I bring all of my guests to eat here!Some of my favorites include: the awash chicken, the shiro (vegetarian)  and i love the Sambusa's both the beef and veggie ones. This place has great service and I love the ambience!  Definitely one of my favorite places in the UWS :)"
4/19/2011,3 star rating,"Solid Ethiopian place that's in walking distance from columbia. great for groups, fun place to take folks who haven't tried ethiopian before. Filling, relatively flavorful, well spiced food. My only qualm is the service which is really erratic - sometimes there on point, at others you'll be doing a good deal of waiting. On balance I'de recommend Awash for decent ethiopian food."
4/19/2011,5 star rating,"Consistently amazing, though I have only gone to the one on the UWS since my first go. My only complaint is that they served me raw meat once without asking, which is apparently their policy to only cook certain meats when asked. So, now I know and knowing is half the battle. Go jo. I did eat a bit of the raw meat just to see and I have to say: not a fan. Next time I'll ask them to cook it. After the meal when they saw I didn't eat the raw meat, they offered to cook it for me, and said that they gladly would have done so earlier as well if I'd wanted next time. Very nice about it. The Beef TIBS are amazing, and are served cooked. Again: amazing. I also recommend the beets, even if you don't like beets normally. My girlfriend always thinks they are carrots and I have to remind her they are beets.Update: The next time I DID ask them to cook it and the waiter was hilarious (different waiter). Hi: ""are you sure?"" ""It's supposed to be raw"" ""I can't promise it will be good"" ""I don't think you will like it."" He was nice enough, but I was pretty confident in my decision. And it was a great decision. It was delicious. About beef tibs: So, there are several different tib options at awash. I swear to you, I've ordered the same tibs each time, and each time they come out different. Sometimes with onions, sometimes with onions and peppers. The first few times, it was JUST steak. I loved it that way. The onions and peppers are great too, but even when I order the one without onions and peppers, they put it in. Sometimes even if I ask for no onions and peppers. If I were allergic, this would be a problem. Thankfully, it's always delicious enough that I don't care."
2/2/2011,4 star rating,"I really enjoyed the ambiance, the waiter's were attentive without being annoying, and were helpful with my selection. Since I'm not a fan of food on the bone, I stuck with the beef. It was delicious. The Honey Run wine was amazing, easily the highlight of the meal, because it was just that good. I'll have to go back and get more before I give it 5 stars, but I will definitely be going back!"
4/17/2011,2 star rating,"The real downfall of Awash was the service and ambience.  The place itself is sort of odd because its carpeted, the tables are close together, and the chairs are similar to something you'd find in an office.  I wouldn't have really noticed the strangeness of the place if I hadn't had to wait for my food so long. We got seated between two couples, and since the seating was so close together, we could basically hear all of their conversation.  This is typical for NYC restaurants, though - but it was pretty difficult to watch them eat their food while we waited over an hour for ours.The service was very slow.  We got there on Saturday at 8 pm, since we had a reservation.  We got seated right away and probably placed our order around 8:10 pm.  We probably got our drinks around 8:20, our appetizer at 8:45, and our food at 9:20.  By the time we got the entree, we were absolutely starving and ate it in 5 minutes.  We were probably even hungrier because we watched the two couples next to us eat their huge plates of food while we waited for over an hour after we ordered.The food itself was fair, but not great.  I had Ethiopian once before in Washington, D.C. and I was blown away by the food.  I was pretty excited to try Awash, but it did not meet expectations.  The meat samosa was heavy on the crust and light on the meat - I did like the sauce accompanying it though.  For the main course, we got the meat combo to split between the two of us.  The best was the chicken - it fell off the bone.  The other meat, which the waiter recommended, was pretty simply spicy - not the complex, fragrant spicy that I had expected from my prior experience.  The vegetables were all decent.  The injera was good.  It really was just fair - it was all okay, but not great.  As for the alcohol - the beers were interesting - I had the Hakim Stout and liked it.  I didn't care for the honey wine because it got too sweet to drink after a few sips - but the waiter did let me try the two kinds before ordering, so it was my fault.It seems like if you go here on a weeknight, you might get better service and thus might be able to better enjoy the experience.  Also, you may not want to come at a peak time.  We waited for over an hour for our food, but the couple next to us came in at 9 and were served their entree just a few minutes after we were (much to our chagrin). I really think that if the service/ambience had been better, we wouldn't have been so harsh on the restaurant and the food."
4/10/2011,5 star rating,"Awash sits midblock on Amsterdam Avenue between 106th and 107th Streets, in a stretch of nondescript low-rise buildings beneath a red awning.  This is in what some call the ""Manhattan Valley"" section of the UWS, centered around Straus Park one block to the west on Broadway.  Although the neighborhood will probably never be a true culinary destination, it's becoming home to more and more solid restaurant options. Awash, for those who have a true appreciation of Ethiopian food, is the neighborhood's crown jewel.Anyone who wants to appreciate Ethiopian cuisine must first come to terms with injera, the region's staple flatbread, which is not truly flat but rather leavened just enough to form a spongy texture.  It's undoubtedly unusual in flavor to the western palate with a slightly sour taste.  Fortunately, Awash prepares injera perfectly, and it forms the ideal base to accompany the rich array of sauces and succulent meats that emerge from the kitchen.  The menu at Awash is versatile, and diners can sample multiple flavors from the appetizers and mains, which are grouped by type of meat (beef, lamb, poultry), as well as combinations.  My favorite appetizer was the Gomen Beziga consisting of beef strips, collard greens, and onions; but the secret of this dish was cardoman - which made the dish peppery and slightly sweet.  For the mains, the combinations are the way to go for those who want a taste of everything.  Most include doro wat, a rich stew with local spice mixtures like bebere and niter kibbeh (a clarified butter), and a boiled egg.  Diners cannot go wrong with any of the combinations.If there's a knock on Awash it's that the dessert options are pretty limited.  However, the meal itself is so rich that little more is needed aside from an obligatory steaming cup of the bold and satisfying Ethio Coffee.Summary- I love African food, and Awash is great.  I wish I had found it sooner.  But no matter - it's one of my favorites, and I'll definitely be back."
4/6/2011,4 star rating,"A solid spot for a weeknight dinner.  They have great deal for a dinner for two, 2 different meats, and 3 veggies and two glasses of wine for like $34.  We ordered the chicken and the lamb along with the collard greens, lentils and beets (sorry I don't know the Ethiopian names).   Awash has good service and it is a nice little find on the UWS.  Check it out!"

4/3/2011,4 star rating,"This is the third Ethiopian restaurant I've been to in the city and I was pleasantly surprised. Having lived in Ethiopia for 4yrs and having eaten the cuisine in other countries, I have high standards. I always think it's best to order a combo meal in an Ethiopian restaurant so that's what my friend and I did.My friend and I shared the Awash Special combo with Special Tibs (beef cubes in marinated sauce in a spicy sauce) with the Gomen (collard greens), Patakilt Alicha (cabbage, carrots & potatoes) and Yemissir Kik Wat (split red lentils).The good:Well portioned - we were so fullSpicy & tasty - although I did feel it was more heaty-spicy than fragrant-spicy. But at least it wasn't bland!Price - for the combo with just tap water, the bill came to $20.70 in total!The bad:Injera - itself, it was good but it came very cold. That might be my own issue as I grew up with it freshly made for me by my servants in Ethiopia so I prefer it warm. Oh well."

3/23/2011,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here to have our first Ethiopian food experience, and we were not disappointed. We started with the vegetable sambusa, which was incredibly good. The flaky, buttery crust practically melted in our mouths, and we could actually taste the vegetables (rather than it being some kind of pureed filling). For an entree we had the meat combo with the chickpea, collard greens, and split yellow pea vegetables. We loved each of the meats, which were accompanied nicely by the vegetables (however the vegetables were not memorable on their own). Perhaps it would have been better if we had let the kitchen choose the vegetables, as that seems to be an option. The atmosphere was candle-lit and romantic but also accommodated larger groups nicely."
9/8/2012,3 star rating,"I'm glad I got to experience my first attempt at Ethiopian food in New York. I was told that Awash served one of the best Ethiopian food in town. But unfortunately, it didn't settle so well with me.I ordered a combination plate that included 2 meats and 3 veggies. It's more food than I could have handled. All of the items you order are served on top of injera, a type of flatbread. I did not particularly like the injera because of the acidity. I understand that it is supposed to be mildly sour, but it took away from a lot of the flavors of the meats. It left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. Half the portion of my combination platter was way too spicy to eat. And I usually enjoy a nice spice to my food, but this was just giving me heartburn. I did enjoy the lentils because they were milder and had enough flavor for me to enjoy. I definitely preferred the vegetable dishes over the meats. The only downfall I had about my dining experience was that as a noob, I don't know much about Ethiopian food. So throughout my meal I was only guessing what portion of my combination dish was what. Overall, I had a pleasant meal. I just wasn't blown away with anything, except a lot of gas released afterwards."

It's spicy but nothing too much. I recommend!"
6/16/2009,4 star rating,"Really like this place. Ethiopian food is great and the fact that this place is always crowded is proof of it's deliciousness.

3/29/2010,5 star rating,"Casual, decorative atmosphere; cool space. Dead on a Monday afternoon, I was a little unnerved by no lunch menu/portion/specials. The $11.50 for a dish was certainly a bargain, though, as it was absolutely a copious amount of food.

No utensils in the takeout bag being the worst part of the experience, a solid 4.75."

12/14/2011,3 star rating,This place is an good neighborhood spot! My roommate and I checked this place our on a Sunday night and it was actually more bustling than I expected. We shared the vegetarian platter for two and I definitely liked about 80% of what was on the plate. The best part about it was that they continually bring you more of the spongey bread that you use to eat the food with. I would come back here. The only downside is the service is a bit slow.

I went with a friend who did Peace Corps in Ethiopia, and she said it was amazing and authentic. She also raved about the fact that they had real Ethiopian beer, but I can't remember what it's called. I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan of the cuisine, but I loved the experience and would highly recommend Awash. It's a fun adventure!"

We had a combination plate with 2 types of meat, potato, carrots, and other very tasty items...perfect for a cold rainy day in the city. I think they do a wonderful job and will be back!!!

12/6/2010,5 star rating,"giving Awash 5-stars because the other 2 Ethiopian restaurants in my neighborhood are nothing compared to this!about 4 years ago my boyfriend and his family introduced me to Ethiopian food. i was a bit skeptic because i had no idea what it was, but trusted them to give it a try. plus i didn't want to be rude=Pthe dish we ALWAYS get is the combo #2 with beets. it consists of lentils, chicken, tibs wat (beef), carrots, potatoes and 2 large pieces of injera (bread). we order it about once a month and it's always consistently tasty! the portion is large and usually feeds 4 people.go during the day when it's really quiet since the place isn't really spacious, the dinner crowd can make it feels kinda cramped. or eat it at home, which is what i usually do."
4/6/2011,5 star rating,"Great food, attentive, friendly service, and a sweet deal on dinner for two: very filling combination platter and two glasses of wine for about $30. Winner."
5/22/2011,4 star rating,Very fresh with huge portions! The nice thing is there are many choices for the different combinations. We had a veggie combo and a veggie/meat combo. The best Ethiopian I've had in NYC.
4/22/2012,4 star rating,I bought the veggie combo and it took me 2 days to eat.  I wasn't trying to spend that much on food but it was worth it.  Thumbs up!
5/14/2012,3 star rating,"I have been to Awash several times, and I feel that the service has been deteriorating over time.  They fixed up the walls of the place, but the nice partition decoration is gone, and now a plastic wall separates two dining groups and it can take away from the experience.  Yesterday I went for Mother's Day. There was no wait, and that was a plus.  We were told to sit wherever we liked... Another plus.  There was no A/C and I'm okay with that since the weather was nice outside and a breeze was coming in through the open window.  T here was NO music.  When we used to go a while back, we would listen to their folkloric music, and it was nice.  We used to love watching their paintings, but there aren't that many now.  Service was a little slow, and I was surprised about that since the place was not full.  Then we were given menus, and soon after we were ready to order.  We weren't given anything to wipe our hands (moist, heated hand towels).  Since I knew that I would be eating with my hands, I went to their bathroom to wash my hands.  Then food came, and it was delicious!  (Five stars on the food!) It really hit the spot, and they were good about providing us with extra vinegar bread when we were running out.  We got our dessert, and then it was time to tip.  We tipped the minimum, as without any music, there were uncomfortable silences and I didn't want to hear the couple behind us talk.  Then I got annoyed that other tables would get those moist towels, and I felt like chopped liver. Perhaps my look and style didn't scream Chi Ching loud enough... who knows! I might give them another chance, because I like the food, but I would be happy to find another restaurant which will give me the full experience.  The food is great, but service ruined it for me."
8/8/2012,4 star rating,"Cozy atmosphere, reasonable prices, the honey wine and the combination plate options are great, especially if you haven't tried Ethiopian cuisine before. Staff is friendly and efficient. I haven't eaten Ethiopian food anywhere else so not sure how this place compares to other Ethiopian restaurants. I enjoyed my meal and would recommend this place as a fun, low-key dining option for people in the neighborhood."
9/22/2008,4 star rating,"Staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.  Ethiopian honey wine is the perfect drink to go with dinner- I prefer the organic version.  Don't be alarmed- it's Ethiopian so there is no silverware, but a nice hot towel to wash hands before you begin eating.  Vegetable Sambusa with dipping sauce, Awash Chicken and Key Sir Alicha were my favorites.  Be prepared to share, and NOT spend a lot of moola."
1/25/2009,4 star rating,"This is a pretty good ethiopian place.  I've eaten there at least 10 times and for the most part have been very satisfied.  I've only ordered vegetarian there, but its good.  The price is fair, usually dinner for 2 people came out to about $35.  Service can be slow at times, but not too bad, although I suggest not ordering appetizers because they can take a long time to arrive."
9/10/2011,4 star rating,OK went here again. It was better than last time.Maybe I was overreacting with the last review. It was perfectly spiced and delicious.This time the injera was PERFECT! AND they are the only Ethiopian restaurant uptown that offers a lunch menu. Folks get your lunch fix here and not at the price of a full dinner meal.YAY! But I don't know if it's served Saturday and Sunday. BUT YUM-O!! I'm totally going to go for lunch on the regular. They will know my face!
8/28/2011,4 star rating,"Not bad at all. I've always loved Ethiopian food. This is a new one for me to try out. And I can say it's good. To me not quite as good as Massawaa. But then again , I did go during lunch. Maybe it's because Massawaa has a special place in my heart. Their injera it not quite as sour as the others I have tried. But what I tried is as yummy as I've expected it to be.The wait staff is attentive. The portions sizable. And there may even be some to take home too. Well depending on how much you can consume. And AMEN they have liquor! Next time I will try a meat dish. That will be the meal and the deal breaker. But for you Vegetarians/Vegans please do give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed."
1/20/2015,5 star rating,Great food here. Casual atmosphere. Be prepared to eat with your fingers!
7/6/2009,4 star rating,"I took two friends here about a month ago and was a bit nervous because they'd never had Ethiopian before, so I was hoping they would like it! We had a great time. We got the special, a combo platter for 2 with a bottle of wine for $40 (to split among the 3 of us) with an appetizer of chicken sambusa, which was heavenly! I would definitely recommend the sambusa. The wine, some kind of blackberry honey wine (other readers have commented) was DELICIOUS although quite sweet, but it was absolutely fantastic and complimented the dinner quite well.I hadn't visited Awash (or other Ethiopian) in awhile and wasn't sure what to order, so I asked what a good combination platter would be for people unfamiliar with the cuisine and our server recommended some dishes, which were great. One annoying thing-- they have a charge for sharing plates, yet the 3 of us (who were hungry!) could not even come close to finishing the combo for 2 that we ordered. We didn't get the plate charge (because one of us ordered the appetizer, perhaps?) but it bothered me that they would have that charge when it's really impossible to finish what they design for 2 people.I would go again in a heartbeat though and recommend it to anyone who likes to try different food. The atmosphere is nice and service was slow at first but our waitress was very helpful."
11/25/2009,5 star rating,Best Ethiopian in NYC hands down. Great takeout and dine in.
6/11/2011,5 star rating,"Ethiopian food is really good, and Awash is one of the best in the City.  The vegetarian platter is great because you get all of their vegetarian choices and it is not too expensive if two people share.  I cannot believe there are so many different ways to eat lentils. Have with a glass of mead (honeywine).  I agree with Ryan R. that appetizers are unnecessary, but they are good."
8/5/2011,5 star rating,A friend took me here for my first taste of Ethiopian food and now I can't get enough!  It is reasonably priced and a little taste of heaven!Now I am living in LA and one of the things I really miss is my dinner dates at Awash.  I have been to Little Ethiopia in West LA to get my Ethiopian fix - but it is never quite as good as my first experiences at this little gem in NYC.  I know where my first meal will be when I go back to visit!
12/17/2011,4 star rating,I go to Columbia U. and order Awash to my dorm weekly. The combos are delicious and very affordable. The food always arrives within 20-30 min. The doro wat combos are soooo great! The perfectly-cooked chicken literally falls off the bones. The vegetables that come on the side are the perfect complement for the dish and are very flavorful. It's funny because the friendly staff there pretty much recognizes my voice whenever I call to place an order. I always crave Awash!
1/2/2012,5 star rating,"This is the best Ethiopian food in NYC. Ethiopian in general is heaven for anyone who is vegetarian or vegan. I usually share the veggie combo which as several very tasty options such as lentils, ground chickpeas, potato and carrots, spinach, beets, etc.  I've been here with meat eaters and they have often remarked that the veggie dishes are tastier than the meat dishes.The honey wine is a delicious treat, although its tough to drink too much of it since it is very syrupy and sweet. I can't even get through one glass of the stuff by myself.The sambusas are a must. The lentil ones are really good and others have told me that the beef ones are amazing too.The prices here are reasonable and the food is delicious, not too oily like at some other Ethiopian places. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cozy and casual."
8/15/2014,3 star rating,"Decent food, interesting flavors. A little too much of the sour dough bread and very little meat."
8/13/2009,5 star rating,"We've regularly eaten Ethiopian/Eritrean cuisine across the country - DC, LA, SF, Detroit, Chicago, etc. Awash is at the top (followed by The Blue Nile in Ann Arbor [which is VERY GOOD], &  Mudai in San Jose). The food is consistently excellent. The wait staff efficient and gorgeous. It's one of our favorite restaurants in the country. You'll enjoy each bite and quaff."
7/29/2009,4 star rating,"I'm used to no-fuss Ethiopian, and so I found Awash to be refreshing in that it is more spacious, cleaner and more attentive than previous experiences. It's the little things like putting new paper over the tablecloth and providing warm towels as well as re-filling water (esp. if the Special Tibs are too spicy) that keeps me coming back. With that said, the Special Tibs has a kick without being too spicy, and the lamb and chicken entrees are tasty with a slight kick without being spicy. The Shiro was my favorite, as well as the red and yellow lentils, and I even got my friend to finally try out the tasty marrow and stick her finger in the bone. The injera is good -- spongy and moist without having the fermenting smell I've encountered at other places, and the Ethiopian red and white honey wines are quite good. A combo platter for one is around $11, and my friend and I elected to each have our own combo (two meats, three vegetables) for greater variety since it's only a buck over a joint combo."
7/27/2009,4 star rating,"In 20-30 years, African restaurants may fill out the hip downtown streets. For now, you can enjoy Awash's Ethiopian standards. I chose one of the meat combinations, which feeds 2 and is served on the large, spongy pancake (no fork/knife allowed). All meat and vegetables were tasty, though not necessarily memorable (after all, this is peasant food--cheap, appetizing, and satisfying)."

6/16/2009,4 star rating,"Really like this place. Ethiopian food is great and the fact that this place is always crowded is proof of it's deliciousness. The combo plates let you try a bit of everything and the portions are huge so you may want to look around before ordering a whole one for yourself. It's a good place to share if you know who you're sharing with. Oh, and they have a great vegetarian option as well!"
6/7/2009,4 star rating,"Second time at an Ethiopian restaurant. It tastes very similar to the first on i went to. My fave parts are the sour flat bread and eating with your hand. I think this place gives you unlimited bread, but I am not sure, so don't hold me to that. I also tried Ethiopian coffee for the first time since they're known for their coffee ceremonies. The coffee is tasted like it has a lot of spices in it. My friend really enjoyed it but it's not my cup of 'tea' (it made my stomach felt like it was on fire). But all in all, I like Ethiopian food :)"
5/19/2009,4 star rating,"First off, I LOVE Ethiopian food.  So it's no surprise that I would make it a point to try some in NYC.  Awash was very yummy, but I think I'm still partial to the places in LA.  We ordered a meat combo, appetizers and a bottle of wine.  The meat combo was a little bland and the injera was more sour than I was used to.  The chicken sambusas though were AMAZING.  Deliciously seasoned ground chicken in a triangular crispy phyllo dough.  It came with an addictively spicy sauce that I covered my sambusa in.  I've had sambusas at other places before but this was definitely the best one I've had.For an absolute wino/lush, the wine was my favorite part of the meal.  The red honey wine is to die for!  The wine is called Honey Run Blackberry Honey Wine and is amazingly rich in flavor.  It's very sweet and thick so the flavors linger in your mouth long after you've swallowed.  It's seriously orgasmic!  So much so that I tried to bribe the waitress in selling me a bottle to go.  Alas, no such luck.  Instead, she pointed me to a liquor store nearby that carried it. (FYI: Whole Foods carries the wine too!)Service was slow but pleasant.  It's definitely worth trying if you're not in rush."
5/2/2009,2 star rating,"I'm torn on what to rate this! I started out with the honey wine and the beef sambusa. The waitress brought out samples of the red and white honey wine, and they were both fantastic. I actually liked the red better, which is a first since I'm not that big on red wine, but we went with the white. The beef sambusa was fantastic! It came with a spicy sauce to dip it in, not sure what the sauce was made of.The main meal though, I thought it was bland and I didn't particularly like the spongy bread you use to eat the food. Which is a first, because I'm a carb fiend. It wasn't horrible, it's just not something I'd come back for. I'd definitely come back for drinks and appetizers, though! Four stars for those!I'd agree with people who say the service is friendly but slow. One waitress for a fairly small place."
1/10/2011,5 star rating,"Awash, you are my favorite restaurant in New York City.  I love you.  Tibs wat, I would marry you if I were not already married or if it were legal to marry a meat product.  Also, I cannot get enough of the vegetarian platter.  The collard greens and beets are so good- I want to built little forts around them to prevent my fellow diners from eating my beloveds.  This place also has amazingly attractive staff.  Even if my friends are not in the mood for Awash, they can sometimes be swayed by the promise of hot waitstaff."
3/17/2013,4 star rating,"The food was great. We ordered the veggie combo for 2 people and almost the entire injera was covered with food. I particularly liked the collard green. The injera here also has a nice texture. The waitress was nice. Overall, a good and fun experience to eat and share food."
1/5/2011,5 star rating,"My first and favorite exposure to Ethiopian food. The injera was great. The chicken entree I got was incredible. Even the vegetarian dish, which I normally don't go wild for was absolutely delicious. I couldn't recommend this place more. Some might not be into eating with their hands (deal with it you cranks) or the seating, but I loved it from beginning to end. The only bummer was no honey wine, but I'm assuming that was an anomaly. Eat up!"
8/27/2012,3 star rating,"I always walk by Awash and have wanted to try it for a while and it did not disappoint!  I had never had Ethiopian before but it was actually very tasty!  I am surprised that not too many of the reviews mention the lack of silverware because it doesnt seem like a common knowledge type of thing to me.  Instead of silver wear you get several rolls of spongy dough in addition to a large portion of it under all of your food that you use to scoop up the food with your hands!!  No biggy but definitely not the norm, I had no idea what to expect personally.  It has a little bit of a faint bitterness or vinegary like taste to it which I was a fan of but the fiancee... not so much!  Pretty good service, kind of hot in here though (would have been pretty bad except I was kind of strategically placed under the AC unit!)    I had seen a lot of good reviews for the vegetarian platter... I am a carnivore so I would never order a vege platter but I did get a combo plate with some vege selections which were delicious!   We had the meat platter with special tibs, yebeg, doro wat and tibs wat.  Everything was very flavorful and overall pretty scrumptious!  I would go back yes, but don't see myself in here every day!"
7/3/2013,4 star rating,"I went to Awash for my first experience with Ethiopian and it was really great. The combination platters are the perfect size and variety, I really enjoyed the lamb and the spongey pancakes for grabbing the food were delicious. The beers were surprisingly good, I would recommend Harrar. The honey wine was sweeter and less citric than a regular white, but it was not really worth the price. The service was okay, the atmosphere was nice with crowds ranging from people on dates to families."
7/6/2008,5 star rating,"I went here for the first time with someone from Ethiopia and they agreed that this is as good as it gets when it comes to Ethiopian food outside of Ethiopia. The restaurant is run by a very friendly family and the service is great. Tell them what type of food you like (spicy/not spicy, veggie, etc.) and they will recommend the best dish for your tastes."
5/24/2013,4 star rating,"Nice neighborhood restaurant. The food is very tasty. We got the meat combo & it had some good heat to it. The chicken with ginger is very flavorful, we asked for no heat & it was perfect. The portions are big enough to share. Went on Thursday night & by 7:30 all the tables were full. The service is a bit slow but there were only 2 waiters that do everything from the bar to checks to seating so we understood. They are very friendly."
11/1/2012,4 star rating,"This is my go to Ethiopian place after Meskerem in Hells Kitchen got some weird make over. The food is delicious and the food quality is pretty much the same each time you go. There are a lot of Columbia students that go here, and the place can get pretty full, although I've never seen a line, or anyone waiting more than a few minutes. Atmosphere is pretty standard, nothing fancy. Probably not the best 1st date spot, unless your date really just cares about the food. Service will range from SLOW and unfriendly (rarely) to 10-15 minutes for food and friendly (usually). It really just depends when you go. The combos are a great value."
4/13/2012,4 star rating,"This is my first Ethiopian food experience and my wife's second so take this review with a grain of salt.  We ordered the Meat combination which came with 2 beef items, a chicken and goat item with 3 veggies which included leeks, chickpeas, potato/carrot mix all served on top of their ethiopian bread as you can see from the photos other people have posted.  The combination platter was around $25 which isnt too bad at all.  The rolled up dough you see in some of the pictures rolls out and you tear it to dip in the various items on the plate.  The flavor of the dough is kind of vinegar-y with some acid to it which i think goes very well with the food on the plate.  The platter for 2 is filling as we both were left with our bellys hanging out.  Also Ethiopians are apparently known for their honey wine so give it a shot.  I would say it was definitely a pleasant experience and am now open to other Ethiopian places in the city.  I saw a grubhub sticker on the front window, so maybe they deliver too, which i think can be interesting."
5/30/2013,3 star rating,"The food is excellent but service was severely lacking. After eating at the sister restaurant in East Village where the service was excellent on a previous trip it was disappointing to be so neglected. No water refills, no extra plate of injera, a long wait to get someone's attention, then longer wait for the check.  We probably won't go back to this restaurant. There are too many good places in the neighborhood to suffer the poor service and too many choices for good Ethiopian food in other neighborhoods to bother going here."
12/28/2008,5 star rating,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  I have been going here on and off for many years.  I love the food, although I must admit I have very little experience with other ethiopian food.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to a new comer to ethiopine cuisine.  They offer many differerent dishes and have a few beers from ethiopia as well.  Try the carrot cake, it is incredible."
12/31/2011,5 star rating,"I am a food snob - and I don't give a 5 star rating lightly.  I'll admit it (because even if I tried to deny it, my family reminds me of this fact all the time).  I like good food.  Awash is my favorite restaurant in NYC.  I've been coming to their Morningside Heights location since 1998 and have never had a disappointing meal.  I always, always get the same meal - the veggie combo - and it is always amazing.  If you go with 2 people you'll probably have leftovers from one veggie combo. I have had Ethiopian at other places in NYC and in almost every city I have traveled to (yes, I love ethiopian food) - and Awash is far and away the best you'll have.  It is a friendly, low-key place owned by the same Ethiopian woman (who gives me a big hug every time I come and asks how my family is doing)."
4/29/2010,4 star rating,"This is a favorite for tasty, quick, affordable Ethiopian food. The service is very prompt. I recommend the Veggie Combo -- there is more variety than comparable dishes at other restaurants."
6/18/2011,4 star rating,"After frequenting QUEEN OF SHEBA for years and always missing that spot on Amsterdam and 122nd (Zula Cafe), we tried AWASH.  Service was satisfactory but the food was excellent.  Delicious veggie combo.  We asked for BUTECHA which they said normally wasn't in the veggie combo but they added it.  Small and somewhat dark but the food is less oily and tastes healthier."
7/20/2009,3 star rating,"try the blackberry honey wine-- tastes like an ice wine.went here and tried Ethiopian for the first time last night.had the combo for 2-- great food, the flavors reminded me of indian and malaysian... didn't love the spongy bread flavor, it was good to start but the sourness and saltiness started to wear on me after a while. the staff is great, attentive, and very friendly! cute restaurant."
3/23/2011,4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here to have our first Ethiopian food experience, and we were not disappointed. We started with the vegetable sambusa, which was incredibly good. The flaky, buttery crust practically melted in our mouths, and we could actually taste the vegetables (rather than it being some kind of pureed filling). For an entree we had the meat combo with the chickpea, collard greens, and split yellow pea vegetables. We loved each of the meats, which were accompanied nicely by the vegetables (however the vegetables were not memorable on their own). Perhaps it would have been better if we had let the kitchen choose the vegetables, as that seems to be an option. The atmosphere was candle-lit and romantic but also accommodated larger groups nicely."
7/11/2012,4 star rating,"A lovely place for Ethiopian, particularly if you're in the Columbia neighborhood.  The food is always delicious, even if it takes a while to get used to eating without utensils.  The decor gives the place a funky vibe, but the restaurant is versatile enough for intimate dates or dinners with a large group of friends.  Portion size is generous, but dishes can be pretty spicy.  For those who don't like spice the Tibs and the Awash Chicken are always winners."
7/9/2012,4 star rating,Such a lovely place! The staff are warm and friendly. The food was quite nice and satiating. Very nice spot for Sunday brunch or dinner or meetup with close friends. Highly recommended!
6/1/2010,5 star rating,"I absolutely love this place. We've been here many times since we moved to NYC almost 2 years ago, and it's the first place we bring any out of town visitors. Highly recommended!"
2/26/2011,3 star rating,"As a self proclaimed ethiopian food afficianado, this place is not bad. I havent gotten the chance to explore too much on their menu but they have a great lunch deal for around $8, 2 meats and 2 veggie items with injera. I usually get a double order of the butter chicken with shiro and miser waat which are all habesha approved, yummy. Good service, nice and clean atmosphere, moderately priced alcohol. Bring cash if you are not spending more than $13...."
6/13/2011,4 star rating,My favorite Ethiopian. Decor is not great but the vegetarian platter and low price make it worth the price every time.
7/3/2011,5 star rating,"The staff was very friendly and the food was awesome! Overall, it was a pleasant experience for my first time having Ethiopian food. Yum...and the Veggie options are Vegan! Huge plus since I am vegan!"
1/17/2012,4 star rating,"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food, and I LOVED it!!! It reminded me of a mix of Indian and Moroccan food. I wasn't a fan of the honey wine (too sweet for my taste), but I'm glad I tried it. My friend and I shared a meat and veggie platter for two people. We loved all the veggie dishes and the chicken dish, but we weren't huge fans of the lamb dish because the lamb was a bit dry. The restaurant was super crowded and loud the whole time, but it was a great atmosphere and a delicious meal!"
3/26/2012,4 star rating,"Delicious Ethiopian food that is consistent and hands down some of the best in NYC.  The service is quick and friendly, decor is professional with white linen.  The combo dish is a great deal and it is what I consistently order.  Everything is delicious but the beets are unbelievable-do give them a try.  They are my new addiction!"
2/26/2012,5 star rating,"Delicious!  The vegetarian platter is particularly good, and the honey wine is surprisingly tasty -- sort of like a cold mulled wine.  I don't know if they take reservations, but are frequently packed, especially on Saturday nights.  Highly recommended!"
10/19/2013,5 star rating,"Great food, very authentic; great atmosphere; wonderful staff.  Very kid-friendly.  My family has been coming here every few weeks for years.  What kid doesn't love eating with his hands?  Plus now my husband and I tend to eat more vegan foods.  The food is super flavorful and the quality is highly consistent (we should know, we come here a lot!).  The staff is very sweet and they like kids and families.  We always get non-spicy dishes for the kids (as combos):  Yater Kik Alicha (yellow split peas), String Beans And Carrots, Yatakilt Alicha (cabbage, carrots, potatoes), Gomen (collard greens), and Doro Alicha (chicken).  The chicken literally falls off the bone, it's so incredibly tender and delicious.  It's hot (temperature-wise), so take it apart for the kids and let it cool off first.  My kids are 5 and 7 and they'll eat even the collard greens, that's how good this place is.  My husband and I love all of these (except the chicken), plus we enjoy the Yemisir Kik Wat (red lentils) and Shiro (chickpeas).  For both, the flavors are similar but distinct, the textures are different, and we can never choose between them.  They won't rush you out, so ask for your check when you are ready and let them know if you're in a hurry.  For vegans like my husband, this place has a LOT of great options... so easy for us to eat here and so delicious!"

12/13/2009,5 star rating,"Awash was a pleasant surprise as my father puts it. He was in town and wanted to check out something unique and different. I happened to live a block across the street from there about a year ago. I visited Awash once before and really liked it. This place is exceptionally great. For starters, the ambiance was terrific because it was very homey and had Ethiopian paintings/decorations. For $8 lunch special, which is a steal, we ordered two meat and two vegetarian dishes each. We ordered the special tibs which comes with a hot sauce and special sauces, the YEBEG ALICHA FITFIT, which tasted buttery and succulent  and the DORO ALICHA chicken dish. I was really impressed with the lamb and beef dishes but the vegetarian entrees were just as amazing. I especially liked the flavorful collard greens and the cabbage, carrot and potatoes dish. I loved this place and would come back in a heartbeat. The bread is also great but don't go crazy eating it, as you will fill up pretty fast. My dad thought this place was great and I highly recommend it especially to those who never have had Ethiopian food."

I've never had bad Ethiopian food, but there are slight differences in the quality of meat, richness of flavor, and texture of  Ingera. all the meats that came in the meat  combo were tender, lean, and flavored to perfection. i'm an Indian man from Jamaica, so eating boldly flavored, and spicy foods is what comes natural to me. I have a good sense of when it's done right or wrong, and my meats and vegetables were all done right. the only exception being the lamb, i forget which type of lamb dish it was but it came with the meat combo and was slightly bland. it wasn't bad at all, i just happen to like things spicy. also the ingera was decent, could have been fluffier, but i wasn't complaining at all, the stews more than made up for it. while there you must try the honey wine, i had never come across blackberry honey wine before and was nervous that it would be way too sweet. but much to all our surprise it was not extremely sweet at all. my brother does not like wine, and yet he enjoyed it very much. the prices were average for Ethiopian food. you share every thing so it really comes out to be very cheap. i would go again, for sure, and i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Ethiopian spot. the food is awesome!"
