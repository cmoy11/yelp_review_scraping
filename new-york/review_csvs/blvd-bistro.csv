This is definitely my most favorite brunch spot ."

5/30/2022,5 star rating,"Hidden gem! This is a must try place!!We came on a Saturday for brunch and didn't make a reservation. The staffs were super friendly and accommodated us. We got lucky but I would highly recommend using Yelp waitlist. We ordered:- blueberry pancake with fried chicken- shrimp & grits with biscuits I've had chicken & waffles, but never thought to pair savory chicken with sweet fruit pancakes. I'm obsessed now, it was life changing! The rich crumbs from the chicken adds texture to the fluffy sweet pancake. You also can't skip the blueberry... it adds a wonderful ""freshness"" to the fried chicken. The ingredients complimented each other so well. Their chicken is tender and fried to perfection. (Doesn't feel too greasy either) The jumbo shrimp and grits was also very delicious. This is very rich and flavorful... and it comes with a biscuit. They also give you hot sauce and honey butter to eat with the biscuit. The waiter gave us an extra biscuit since we were sharing the dish, very thoughtful gesture.I love this place, definitely need to come back again and spread the word. If you're ever craving soul food - look no further, this is the place!"
5/30/2022,3 star rating,"Located in Harlem, this place has a casual-cool vibe, and serves modernized soul food classics. I was thinking of getting the Fried Catfish Dinner with turkey collards and southern potato salad, but then I saw the Fried Catfish Poboy which was a fraction of the price, so I ordered that. The Catfish Poboy also came with french fries. The piece of catfish was a decent size, and there was coleslaw on top, nestled in between a brioche bun. The catfish was fried to perfection and was delightfully crispy, as well as tender. The catfish was also well seasoned and full of great flavor. The coleslaw was a fresh crunchy addition, while the bread was buttery and soft. The fries were thick cut and satisfyingly crunchy with nice potato taste. My friend had the Fried Chicken brunch, which was served with biscuits. All the food and sauces came at the same time, except the biscuits, so when we mentioned it to the waiter, he very graciously brought over 4 biscuits instead of only 2. This was definitely a nice gesture. The fried chicken was okay, but didn't blow me away. The biscuits were too try and a bit on the bland side for me (even with maple butter and jelly).Service started off pretty good, but part way through our meal, the waiter gave us our check and let us know he was on his way out, but to let us know if we needed anything. This confused us, and it was difficult to get the attention of any of the servers after that. I was not impressed by the meal and have no plans to return."
5/30/2022,5 star rating,Everything is so delicious! Vibe was just what the doctor ordered. If you are ever in Harlem...pay them a visit!!

5/17/2022,1 star rating,"My fiancé and I ate here several times back at the old location and was in the neighborhood for the new location. The dinner was good and we enjoyed the food. Now a month later, I get a text alert that my credit card got charged $12 during an hour where the restaurant was not open. Now I have to call my cc and have them send me a replacement card. I told my fiancé we are not eating here again"

5/7/2022,5 star rating,I came here back in February for brunch when we had a snowstorm. BLVD Bistro was one of the few places open. I ordered the Fried chicken with pancakes and added blueberries to the pancakes. The chicken was delicious! Crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. The flavor was perfect. The pancakes were unbelievably fluffy. Adding the blueberries is a must! I will definitely be back!
5/7/2022,5 star rating,Incredible food and service. One of our favorite restaurants in the city. Sunday brunch is the best
5/6/2022,4 star rating,The food is delicious but the music gets really loud. It's a fun place to eat but not the best for conversations.
5/2/2022,5 star rating,One of my all time favorite spots. Always on spot with food and drinks. Location is a bit small but that's how it goes with a NYC hot spot. I wish they had later hours on the weekend. Maybe it's just me but I think they close early on the weekend for a NYC restaurant.
4/29/2022,4 star rating,"Sunday brunch done RIGHT! I had an amazing experience at BLVD Bistro and I seriously can't wait to go back! We got there as soon as they opened on a Sunday and there was only one other party ahead of us. As soon as we walked in, the hostess showed us to the table and it went all the way up from there! The waiter we had was wondrous! We ordered a few things from the menu and they were all a hit! The chicken was seasoned well, fried perfectly & finger licking good! The buttermilk pancakes were definitely 4 stars in my book! Although they didn't have those good old southern crispy edges, I still thoroughly enjoyed them. I tasted my friends collard greens and seriously contemplated ordering some for myself! The vibe here is definitely on 10! I mean what's better than listening to soulful gospel music while eating a delicious soul food brunch?! I was singing and eating and eating and singing!! I noticed a few of the workers dancing and singing as they worked which was fun to see! The restaurant is small, and the food is scrumptious! So you know what that means? You're probably going to wait a long time for a table. We got lucky that Sunday morning but I'm already prepared to have to wait when we go back again. Stick it out cause it's definitely worth it!!*we had no problem finding street parking!*"

4/25/2022,1 star rating,"I went in at 2:46pm for a table, they told me a hour wait. So I waited, then returned at 3:46 and asked about my table. They told me someone was getting up to pay their bill and they would seat me and my friend. At 4:40pm, we were still waiting and just left. We ended up having our brunch across the street because we were STARVING. Poor experience, poor customer service."
4/24/2022,4 star rating,"The food was really good especially the grits and the catfish. The drinks took a while and I felt that should have made a little sooner. The music was great, had us doing a little dance in our seats.The server sold us a pitcher of moonshine and said it would get us six drinks. After waiting a while for the pitcher, it came out and only made 3Drinks and it was 3 of us. He apologized forMisinforming us and that was cool of him to do! My cousin had the ribs and she loves it. The vibes are great if you are looking for a Harlem brunch spot. Side note which I didn't like can't sub sides on the weekend.. crazy right!"
4/23/2022,5 star rating,"We had such a fantastic night at BLVD. not only was the food A1, but then service... oh my gosh. The service was wonderful. From the minute we got in we were met with very sweet hostess's and the floor manager KevEon.. chefs kiss! He is really wonderful. Our server, Emilio was one of the sweetest most efficient servers that I've had in awhile. We always felt tended to. Even a wonderful woman who was not our server, Lynn, kept checking in on us to make sure we were doing well. We honestly never wanted for anything here. There was always someone making sure we were good always. At the end Ernesto cleared our table to make sure we could finish our drinks comfortably. We will 1000% be back. Thank you so much for making a dining experience feel like a home cooked dinner with family"
4/17/2022,1 star rating,"Incompetent and unprofessional. I went to be seated, just myself, and was told I could sit at the bar. I have no problems with them accommodating larger parties first but I waited an hour and they didn't ask anyone at the bar to leave so other guests could sit. People were sitting at the bar not eating or drinking with to-go bags for an hour and I watched the host seat people and overlook me."
4/17/2022,4 star rating,"Solid soul food and drinks. Place was bumping on a Saturday night and set the tone for the rest of our night out. Food was delicious and although the place was busy, service was on point and attentive. Would recommend this place to kick off a night out in the city on Saturday night."
4/14/2022,4 star rating,Blvd Bistro was a great time! I was visiting New York from Los Angeles and came here for dinner with friends. It was a Friday night and busy so the food and drinks too a long time to come out but still a great vibe and good food. There was a live DJ playing R&B/Hip Hop. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the Fried Chicken Dinner and it was a good size. I feel like they gave me the whole chicken! Overall 8/10!
4/10/2022,4 star rating,"CONRAD SAVED THE DAY! I'm guessing you get a better experience with a reservation, at least I'm hoping because the service we received was  as well as the table next to us while seated in the patio. After being seated it took about 20 minutes before we realized no one was going to even bring us water. Once we caught the attention of a passing by server (Conrad) he was extremely apologetic even though we weren't his original table and worked to rectify things. We finally were able to place our order which at least was one small win. There seemed to be an extended wait for the food, we arrived at 11:00AM and did not receive our food until after 12PM which seems like a bit much. I will say the food was amazing (I probably would've flipped the table if it wasn't after the wait and less than great service initially) which is why they received the rating I gave. The environment seems fun and enjoyable with groups both large and small with a fun live DJ on Sunday. I'm hoping this was just a ""bad"" day for the establishment because I would like to come back again in the future for another try."

6/25/2021,5 star rating,Brunch Date with the girls ! It was a wait. But the food and music was absolutely worth it . BLVD is right on the corner of 116th in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Harlem. Parking was hard to fine so I suggest a Uber . The inside was would have looked better but with all the PPE protocol that we have to follow. I completely respect safety over style. The DJ had us jamming . The music was it ! We ordered two crates of mimosas. And the ended our meals with a moonshine punch. ( definitely worth the try) . And the service was super quick I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes for our food to drop. My friends had the breakfast sandwich and the shrimp and grits . Both looked good. I had the pancakes and fried chicken. Pancakes were delicious. But the chicken was topNotch . Perfectly seasoned and fried. Crunchy on the outside and super moist on the inside. I was definitely happy with my food. Considering that most brunch spot are hit or miss when it comes to the food. Would I go back ? Most definitely Should you ? Yes! Get the punch n the chicken
3/29/2022,3 star rating,"Very busy place. Was lucky enough to grab a couple of seats at the bar before before crowds descended upon the restaurant. Took a while to get things started with service but bartender waitress was pleasant enough. My catfish breakfast was deeelicious. Catfish fried n seasoned perfectly, flawless cheese grits. Ordered a side of gravy for the biscuit that was supposed to come with the meal (i had to ask for the biscuit cuz it didnt come with my food). Hard pass on the gravy and the biscuit was nothin to write home about.. too crumbly. My bf's country fried steak was literally a whole steak that was deep fried.. the laziest, worst rendition of a CFS ive ever seen, but bf didnt complain. I would have sent it back. Not a bad spot.. curious as to the other offerings to see why ppl crowd it out tho."
3/25/2022,4 star rating,"Good flavors but still needed salt, hot sauce, and honey. Great spot for a more upscale brunch. No drip coffee and greasy home fries. This spot is for brunchers. It is tight and if you sit at a booth you better be skinny"

4/9/2021,4 star rating,"The thing that BLVD gets is that anyone can get soul food in Harlem at a million places. And what sets BLVD apart is that it manages to hire friendly staff and seems to always have the owner on site to ensure all is well. That's something that many other places lack. The food is solid and made upon request, so do know that the food takes some time to make it out. However, their drinks are solid, the music is always good and the decor makes you forget all of the previous businesses that tried to hold this corner of 116th street.  Speaking of which, the location couldn't be better nor easier to find.During the pandemic, BLVD has set up outdoor seating, a weekend brunch with a live DJ and it's classic Brunch all day menu.  There's always something going on in this neck of the woods. This is what makes BLVD hold it's own against it's very popular neighbors. Definitely check this place out and explore this pocket of Harlem and beyond. They follow COVID-19 restrictions with dividers and the like for indoor dining. If you're planning on a weekend brunch experience, make a reservation!!!"

5/25/2021,5 star rating,This place has amazing vibes I must say.  I was walking down Fredrerick Douglas St and I noticed this restaurant being very busy.  So of course I fomo and decided to give it a shot.  We had to fill up a form before being seated to ensure that we don't have covidWe weren't too hungry so we only ordered 2pcs of chicken one dark and one white.  I must say their chicken was flavorful.  Crispy from the outside and moist from the inside.  I also ordered their Nina Simone and it was great also.  Our waiter was very nice and he added some biscuit to our order free of charge
4/3/2021,4 star rating,"Hmm should I give away the best little gem in Harlem or naw. Starving on a Sunday and found this hidden black owned gem on Yelp. O M G. O M G.Called ahead in attempt to get a wait time (to see how much longer I had to starve lol) but the hostess wouldn't even give an estimate over the phone. Weird but anyway....Parking is a doozy but it's the city to be expected.Pulling up to the restaurant I already knew this place was lit. Walked in to see a DJ blasting all the good hits. Such a good vibe! Luckily, for a party of 6 a table was available right away, yesss! Staff: Didnt really care for the waiter as he did not check on the table often. Never came back to ask if I wanted a refill on my drink but yet a 20% gratuity is charger for parties greater than 3. No wonder he never came back, he doesn't have to work for his tip :( The good ...:.Food: 100/10 deliciousAppetizer: Had the biscuits basket. Had to ask the waiter to bring butter and jam smh. The biscuits were so good! Tasted like a less dense Popeyes biscuit. Definitely crumbly though so hover over ya plate if you want to eat it and leave no crumbs aka so you don't waste ya coins and lose this biscuit to the floor. Got a side of bacon too. Only 3 pieces for $8 ehhh not with that price, however, the bacon was delish! Not too hard. Thick. Smokey-ish flavor. Entree: ok so I really wanted pancakes and chicken but it would have been silly for the whole table to get the same thing. So we all ordered different things. EVERYTHING was amazing. Everything was Chicken and pancakes $22:First let me say thank you for the combo of chicken and PANCAKES! Haha everywhere else I have to beg to have this combo instead of waffles. The chicken was piping hot. THREE nice  sized pieces. Perfect light coating. Not too thick. Not greasy. Juicy. Seasoned well but not overpowering like some black owned places that take seasoning to the extreme. The pancakes. Yessss! I love some good buttermilk pancakes! Perfection! Reminds me of the pancakes from Sweet Chick. Huge. Moist. No lemony flavor (thank god). Melt in your mouth and the blueberries or blueberry compote on top was a great addition.Shrimp and grits:Speechless. O so yummy! Definitely not your nasty Quaker microwave grits lol. Almost so ""smooth"" and buttery it was like eating mashed potatoes. Huge shrimp on top with that delish thick cut bacon and cheddar cheese. I was stuffed at the end trying to finish the 1/4 I had left. Too embarrassed to get a to go box for that little. Well done entree.Catfish meal:Perfect coating. Not thick. Good seasoning and again not overwhelming but I felt the seasoning didnt get into the fish if that makes sense. You took a bite and it started off yummy and then bland because it didn't penetrate all the way through. Would like to see other fish options too like flounder.The potato salad and greens were good too. My madre said after awhile the greens tasted too sweet.Drinks:Sneaky sneaky. Ordered the spiked lemonade. The blueberries definitely shined through and made for an awesome drink. Not overly strong but it definitely sneaks up on you. Thought about ordering a second one but the waiter was a no show until the end but I suppose in that respect to was a good thing because I'm not sure if I would have came out of that place standing. Can't wait to come back and really experience a good outdoor summer vibe."
5/30/2021,4 star rating,"This time for brunch I stopped at BLVD Bistro (black -owned). I had the Catfish breakfast, Bistro wings and Baldwin cocktails. Everything except for the eggs were great! The catfish and grits were well seasoned. Catfish was fried perfectly. The Bistro wings were dressed with garlic, soy and ginger sauce. The Baldwin cocktails were on point because I had 3 of them . They are made with blood orange juice, lime juice, simple syrup and Ketel One Botanical Peach & Orange Blossom.The vibe was really nice. There is a live DJ all day. It was just really laid back! I will definitely come back.."
11/21/2021,4 star rating,This was my first time coming to BLVD for brunch.  It was super crowded but good vibes only.  There was a DJ setting up around 1:30PM which was a highlight for me nothing like good music and good food! I made reservations via YELP which was the best thing I could have done because there would have been a wait.  The bar was full and definitely an overflow but drinks were coming and the bartenders were handling the crowd.  The food came hot off the press and I enjoyed everything.  I have to say I had delivery but it definitely made a difference sitting in and enjoying the meal there.  Big bathroom very clean a little wait because there was only one stall but that's life.  If your in Harlem check it out!

9/20/2021,2 star rating,"Disappointed. Never EVER again. We were seated promptly upon arrival. The woman who sat us at our table had a friendly demeanor and was courteous. However, our cloth napkins were stained and the cups were dirty. Two of our cups smelled like rotten egg.  So gross. That should've been a red flag for us to leave. It also took a bit for our waitress to come around to our table to serve us water. She was nice but seemed overwhelmed. She forgot to bring us straws, napkins, condiments, etc... we got up to grab things ourselves. I felt bad because the place was super busyIn addition to the ridiculous wait, the music was nightclub loud we had to yell to communicate to the waitress and or the person sitting next to us. Not pleasant at all especially for families with children. The lyrics to the song selection were raunchy. Songs like Pop that p$**y with kids waiting for food. Because the food took sooooo long we felt we should go elsewhere. My daughter was developing a headache and was really hungry. The waitress brought us complimentary biscuits after 45 minutes while we waited another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. When the food finally arrived, the worker legit threw the plate at my daughter with an attitude. As if we were at fault for their delays. She was so friggin nasty. My French toast was NOT delicious however the rest of the food my party ordered was. Management seriously needs to do a better job at communicating delays in the kitchen prior to seating instead of having the waiters make a million excuses while trying to serve. Get your back end and front staff more support during peak times. Teach your staff to update your customers. And check your attitudes at the door when you come to work. It's not the customers fault who come in hungry to wait hours to be served drinks and food. This experience makes me sad because I was so excited to support a black owned business. ."
10/4/2021,1 star rating,"A BLVD BISTRO NIGHTMARE!!!Arrived for our anniversary, super excited for soul food only to be sat on unstable outdoor dining furniture. In addition, we literally were not served any appetizers or food for 1 hour and 45 minutes. My husband and I couldn't understand why as it really wasn't too crowded. My husband went to check with our waiter and he said the kitchen ran out of food. Someone zoom in the camera right now! WTF!!!! How is this even possible? The worst part is we were not offered any additional water or drinks. The new supervisor on board came over and disregarded our table only to offer another table who came after us by the way free drinks and appetizers. Keep in mind I'm taking mental notes. At this point we informed the waiter that we were leaving. Only to have the staff rush out with our food. We decided to stay, but then I noticed my collared greens were 50% full, and my husbands burger was rare. 1 hour and 45 minutes for this nonsense? I mentioned to the waiter about the 50% collared greens and he gave me a hard time to add 50% more. I just can't understand how this was even ethical at this point.Last, on behalf of that new supervisor on board the waiter stated they were not coming to apologize but will give us 10% Off.  By this point I'm over it and it's 8:30pm so we decided to leave and pay the bill only to find out the 10% was never even taken off! You have got to be kidding me!!!!!!!!! So we approached the waiter who should of realized that this was the case and had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get 10% off. Our bill was $90 for 2 mojitos, 1 cheese burger deluxe, and a fried chicken dinner with a side of Mac and cheese. This took a total of 3 hours (6-9pm) of our evening which was supposed to be a special experience for our anniversary. Terrible Sunday staff Blvd Bistro, and way to go with hiring the new supervisor, she's definitely NOT a keeper!A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE AND WE WILL NOT BE BACK! #DISAPPOINTED"

Hot, fulfilling very well balanced. I ordered the Lobster Crab Cake Benedict; It came with a biscuit and a salad. The sauce was perfect the eggs were great and of course the lobster crab cake was on POINT! No corners were cut on this meal. Also the hospitality here was great. Everyone was friendly and I felt like I was visiting my aunts house. The vibe was great. There was a DJ there... you may catch yourself singing in the middle of a conversation . Bathrooms are also nice and clean . My only complaint... not really a complaint but I wish that there was another location in Queens. But it may take the authenticity away ‍."

By the time I got to the restaurant, I felt that I could eat a whole pig. The shrimp dish looks small but the large shrimps are succulent and filling. We added the chicken wings as an afterthought, is average (perhaps we're too full to taste...).Their bathroom is cool"
2/14/2022,5 star rating,"Went to BLVD Bistro for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon around 2-3PM. It was still on the busy side. We were a group of 2, the only availability they had was seating at the bar which we were okay with, and turned out to be comfortable as well. The food was perfect! And the drinks were strong. Thoroughly enjoyed the whole meal. Just note: the restaurant was playing music sort on the louder side; we did have to speak up a bit more to converse, but we made it work. I am not certain if the music is played at a lower volume on other days. I would recommend for smaller groups and for a meal out with the girls"
2/11/2022,3 star rating,"This place has a cool look,and it has a feel of wanting to stay for a while .  The location is great right in the middle of Harlem.  One thing I notice is the level of hospitality needs working on. The staff or most of the staff is at a beginning of their career.  Owner teach them will it will pay off in the long run, Amen lights"
2/5/2022,3 star rating,"Let me first start this review by saying Shannon the manager of the restaurant went above and beyond to accommodate us and our concerns. Thank you Shannon!!Now...for the nitty gritty. My fiancé and I are visiting New York for the weekend (he's a native, BX stand up) and we were looking for a date night spot for dinner and drinks. He has been to BLVD before for brunch and raved about the food and atmosphere so naturally I'm excited to try this place he spoke so highly of. When looking for reservations (which were plentiful) we initially chose the 9:15 reservation but pushed it back to 9:30 to account for traffic, etc since the weather wasn't the greatest.  Please note that although the restaurant website says they close at 10, reservations could be placed as late as 10:30 on the Yelp app. We arrive to the restaurant at 9:35 to check in for our reservation. We noticed another couple in front of us seeming to be turned away at the host stand. Awkward. So when it's our turn, I give my name for the reservation to which the host replies ""oh yeah I tried calling you... we're having a food shortage in the kitchen"". Huh?? So I check my phone and indeed have two missed calls from 5 minutes ago. At the start of my reservation time. Sooo 1) you tried calling me? The moment my reservation is set to begin. Weird. 2) food shortage? That's not something you just notice..so of course at this point I'm searching for a restaurant nearby to have dinner bc this one is having an off day. My fiancé being the optimist he is encourages me to be open minded and see what food they do have available before just canceling the idea of eating here altogether. The host chimes in also that we can be seated and see what the kitchen can offer. I get it. He's trying to save this encounter and bring in some business but I personally was not feeling it lol but, obliged my man. The manager came over to see what was going on and to make sure we were being taken care of. The host assured her ""he got it"" but allowed her to step in to take care of seating us and getting us situated. We sat down but I still was fully dressed, coat on, because if we need to make a dash across the street, she was going to be ready ok? Anywho, after about 10 minutes of being seated our waiter comes and asks what we were thinking of ordering so he could check to see if the kitchen could accommodate. I requested the burger (bc it's hard to mess up a burger, right? Wrong. Keep reading) and my fiancé ordered the catfish breakfast. The waiter informed us that those orders could be fulfilled (yay!) and he would put those in and get us some waters. I'm like ok, cool. Still not completely out of the woods yet. He comes back with the waters and informs us that the bar is closed (huh?? It's around 945 at this point. And again, you can make a 10:30 resy so I'm not understanding) but they will make us one drink since our little fiasco at the door. Ok, fine. One drink is better than none I guess. So we continue trying to enjoy the evening. Then the food comes. My fiancé's food was great with no complaints. My burger however was extremely underdone in the center (I requested medium and yes I know what that means). I sent it back and informed the manager that I did not want a replacement (I mean the place obviously is going through a lot right now, so I was fine with not eating anymore). As the good manager she is, Shannon went above and beyond to listen to our concerns and tried her best to remedy the many missteps we experienced. She really wanted to make it up to us. So I agreed to have another burger made.....only for it to come to me completely well done. Felt like a bit of a smack from the kitchen like ""oh you don't like a little pink, OK!"" But whatevs. Shannon of course apologized again and offered us dessert on the house and a chance to come back for brunch. Sigh. We will try again, but honestly I wish we just got chopped cheeses from the bodega. Maybe brunch will be better or we can go earlier because closing time ain't it."
2/1/2022,5 star rating,"I would always see BLVD while driving through Harlem but I never went inside until a couple of weeks ago. My best friend had told me that I needed to try BLVD. She was raving about the biscuits, the chicken, the sweet tea. EVERYTHING. And she's like me so she's picky. I went with my cousin on a Saturday night. Service was good and there was no wait, but we also made reservations.  We ordered the biscuit basket to split. I ordered the Brioche French Toast with a side of bacon. My cousin had the steak and eggs. LET ME TELL YOU...the biscuits were so moist and warm. You can tell they are fresh made. I enjoyed the accompaniment of the cane syrup butter and jelly. I'm still thinking about those biscuits today. I'm a sucker for good French toast and that French toast was so damn good. I loved the caramelized banana sauce they topped it with. It was just as sweet as syrup so none was needed. It was about 5 big pieces of French toast (imagine the brioche loaf from Trader Joe's). I tried my cousins steak. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The parking in the area is actually not that bad. We got a spot right across the street. I think my only small issue was that the music was very loud, but I'm also sensitive to loud noises. All in all, 100000/10 recommend. I can't wait to go back."
1/24/2022,1 star rating,I love this place. The food is OUT of this world!! However I ordered takeout and they served me uncooked pancakes. When I called to tell them they didn't even offer me an apology. Very disappointed
1/21/2022,4 star rating,"So In Dec 2019 was back in nyc  first time since leaving and my friends and family all wanted to hang out and when we go to go deep. So I checked this spot out and we called and made reservations for 20 people. When we got there it was a lil crazy they had a party who booked for earlier than our party and they ended up bringing more people then there reservations and staying much longer then expected.  So they were trying to split my party up and the West Indian island man in me was like hell no. This doesn't make any sense, we will  just wait and we had some drinks.  Finally the previous party left and they seated us in back, it is in like a heard of cattle. We had a great time great food and great drinks the customer service might have been a little bumping initially but in the end both my party and the staff were laughing and smiling together. It was a memorable evening. Thank you blvd bistro  for making this happen.   I would definitely recommend them"
1/19/2022,5 star rating,"This place was live with smiles and great music when I came in with my wife to be. The owner took care of us and so did a few other servers, what remained consistent was the smiles and warmth of the staff ... and good gosh the food?! The food was NOTHING less than AMAZING! I'd give the restaurant 6 stars if I could. A true HARLEM gem."

7/20/2021,5 star rating,"It's been 5 years since I've been back! I love the new location!  I was so excited to learn he occupied this wonderful corner! So we had a big group and there was always someone watching over us, including Carlos the owner!  His wife is a delight!  She brought us our cinnamon rolls and their delicious homemade cream cheese!  I ordered the lobster and crab Benedict which is available only on weekends!  It's was divine!  Their was barely any filled and the texture was soft!  The taste was seasoned and delightful!  I loved even the dressing on the side salad!  The biscuit was off to the side and it was just as good and fresh as the cinnamon rolls! Their Turkey collards are still so freaking delicious!  The left overs from the table were eaten by me, as we got up to leave!  Lol!"
11/13/2015,5 star rating,"Just the best simple twist on comfort food ever!  There's no way to not walk out happy, having stopped in!  A space that's small and homelike, with a homecooking approach that makes you grateful you came to Harlem!"
10/11/2014,5 star rating,"This is thee neighborhood gem!  Always accommodating, even huge parties!  It's like your father or mother cooked and made you a plate!  Carlos is the reason! The only reason!  Tell him Julie sent you!"
6/19/2021,5 star rating,I came for brunch and I got plans to come back! That catfish and cheesy grits was slapping. The biscuits were homemade and my friends maple chicken sausage was from scratch as well. That food was hitting and the leftovers hit even harder. Harlem is a bop but I'm definitely making that trek for this spot.
4/23/2022,5 star rating,"We had such a fantastic night at BLVD. not only was the food A1, but then service... oh my gosh. The service was wonderful. From the minute we got in we were met with very sweet hostess's and the floor manager KevEon.. chefs kiss! He is really wonderful. Our server, Emilio was one of the sweetest most efficient servers that I've had in awhile. We always felt tended to. Even a wonderful woman who was not our server, Lynn, kept checking in on us to make sure we were doing well. We honestly never wanted for anything here. There was always someone making sure we were good always. At the end Ernesto cleared our table to make sure we could finish our drinks comfortably. We will 1000% be back. Thank you so much for making a dining experience feel like a home cooked dinner with family"
4/14/2022,4 star rating,Blvd Bistro was a great time! I was visiting New York from Los Angeles and came here for dinner with friends. It was a Friday night and busy so the food and drinks too a long time to come out but still a great vibe and good food. There was a live DJ playing R&B/Hip Hop. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the Fried Chicken Dinner and it was a good size. I feel like they gave me the whole chicken! Overall 8/10!
12/8/2020,4 star rating,"It's the grits and biscuits for me!!!I've heard so many GREAT things about this restaurant and finally got a chance to try it and I'm glad I did. During a stay in NYC I dined here for brunch, and it was everything! After perusing the menu, I opted for the jumbo shrimp and grits (my mouth is watering as I write this). The grits were heavenly, some of the best I've ever had.  And the shrimp were huuuuge and delicious. The dish also came with a biscuit that was out of this world. The service was great. And the staff went above and beyond in this COVID era to make sure everyone was safe. I can't wait to go back!"
2/20/2022,1 star rating,"Everything about this place was disappointing.1. It's very loud with the DJ on a Saturday. We elected to sit outside as a result.2. We barely saw our waitress. Water glasses left unfilled for an extended period of time despite the table next to us being well looked after and refilled.3. Never asked if we wanted cocktail refills which, was probably a blessing considering our initial drinks took an extended period of time to come. Again, the table next to us was visited by either the manager or owner and had their drinks comped. We were never approached or offered anything.4. The two side plates and one set of silverware we were brought with our starter had dried food/grits on them. It took so long to flag someone down and get new ones that we eventually shared our starter with one set of utensils and no plates, just eating it off the cast iron pan it was served in.5. The food was awful. we were expecting to be wowed and everything arrived cold without a lot of gravy, etc. the chicken fried steak we were told is cooked to medium. The chicken fried steak was more like chicken fried shoe leather and the scrambled eggs that arrived with it were cold. Awful. The best part of the chicken and biscuits was the biscuit. The fried chicken was dried out and not juicy. Also was cold. The fried chicken batter was tasteless.We left $100 lighter and sorely disappointed. Have to wonder about all of the rave reviews on here and who writes them and whether they are authentic."
2/19/2022,5 star rating,"Great Great vibe! Loved the DJ!!! Food was decent. Mac n cheese was too salty, the catfish lacked flavor but them greens was hitting! The biscuits were good too. I'd def return"
12/11/2021,2 star rating,"Not good, not bad.My girlfriend and I were super excited about visiting BLVD as their vibe seems super cool from the outside. They have DJs there and the crowd is super cool.Unfortunately the service and food were lackluster. We ordered the burgers and it took a solid 45 minutes to receive them. The server also never came to check in on us to see if we wanted refills for our drinks. Once we got the food, it was ok but pretty oversalted. I asked for mayo on the side (don't judge) and the waiter never brought it.The worst part is that we both got the runs after eating here. I would definitely avoid this place if possible."
2/18/2022,5 star rating,"Made a reservation... seated immediately! Side note- I love the pothos plants adding greenery... bringing outdoors in. My meal was delicious!!! Hot, fulfilling very well balanced. I ordered the Lobster Crab Cake Benedict; It came with a biscuit and a salad. The sauce was perfect the eggs were great and of course the lobster crab cake was on POINT! No corners were cut on this meal. Also the hospitality here was great. Everyone was friendly and I felt like I was visiting my aunts house. The vibe was great. There was a DJ there... you may catch yourself singing in the middle of a conversation . Bathrooms are also nice and clean . My only complaint... not really a complaint but I wish that there was another location in Queens. But it may take the authenticity away ‍."
11/8/2020,5 star rating,"BLVD Bistro was so good. My party of three easily made a reservation for an outdoor table on a Friday evening (they've been shutting down the street, so the restaurant can have tables all over).We shared the seven cheese macaroni topped with applewood smoked bacon, which was incredible, as well as an order of chicken and biscuits (the chicken was perfect) and a barbecue pulled pork sandwich. Only thing I wouldn't get again were the rice and beans, which were good but not really special. Stick to the chicken!!!!Service was amazing!"
5/3/2021,5 star rating,"So I came here over the weekend and I was impressed. The moonshine punch is nicely spiked and although they dont have bottomless brunch, our carafe was poured to the very top .The biscuits didn't taste fresh out of the oven when we got them, but they were still good and that butter/cream cheese concoction they put with it was AMAZING. My egg breakfast was simple yet satisfying but my favorite part was the cheese grits that I ordered on the side. Those grits were so creamy, it was unbelievable. I can't wait to go back and try the eggs Benedict!"
4/29/2021,4 star rating,"This place is so cool. I went here for brunch with my family after visiting Melbas for a school lottery seminar being held there. They gave us the option to eat outside which we declined due to the chilly temperatures outside that morning. The food was really good. I had a burger there that was vso decadent that I felt guilty for eating afterwards lol. The blood orange mimosas were deliciously strong. However, what stood out the most was the music. They played a lot of good 90s hip hop that really added a cool flair to the place. Make sure if you want to go you make a reservation if possible. That place was packed as we left."
5/22/2022,5 star rating,It was our first time at this restaurant. The atmosphere was outstanding m. There was a live DJ playing the great tunes. The drinks were good and strong. The food was phenomenal. You can taste the flavor. Will definitely revisit on my next New York Trip.
8/9/2021,4 star rating,"Great vibes & food. Sunday brunch had a live DJ. We were able to do outdoor seating on the street which was closed off (except for bikers and sneaky cars). Inside, just a bit too packed in the middle of a pandemic. Their burger & fries meal was tasty. The sodas were a bit watery and weak in flavor. Perhaps it needed to be refilled, but great service and overall experience."
5/24/2021,5 star rating,"We were exploring Harlem and saw this place was packed, and had great music so decided to check it out. The chicken blew us away. I wish I had been hungrier more to get a full entree, but just stuck with a la carte. Literally finger licking good. The service was quick, and our waiter was really nice. A few missteps happened with our order, I wanted dark meat and got chicken breast, I wanted a strawberry lemonade and got regular lemonade, and the restaurant was incredibly hot with no AC on and no fans by the bar, but honestly I had a great time and didn't care because I thought the chicken really was just that good. Will def be back when we come to the area"
11/3/2021,5 star rating,Absolutely love this place the food is tasty and fresh and the libations amazing. Great music and vibes all around
7/11/2021,5 star rating,Ok so Ive been watching this place IG post for months finally decided to make reservations. Took the train from Brooklyn to Harlem ok blah blah lol. The vibe was cool and the music was on point! We were seated right away and our waiter forgot his name but he has dreads was very nice and explained everything on the menu and made suggestions. We started with the Frozé   so good not to strong cute and nice going down. For food I went with  the Jumbo shrimp with cheese grits topped with bacon  with a buttermilk biscuit on the side like WHAT!! So damn good flavorful grits cheesy and creamy omgggg  . Then the lets talk about the huge shrimp not overcooked seasoned to perfection so damn good. My friend got the catfish dinner came with collard greens  and potato salad. Her fish was well seasoned and not greasy the greens were amazing as well. Now the potato salad needed more relish to smack ya momma lol but not bad.. Definitely will return with my guy soon he would love it  .. Don't hesitate to go BLVD BISTRO.

5/27/2021,4 star rating,"I came to visit a while ago & as for my first time experience I must say that the  pancakes were tasty and My mom enjoyed her shrimp and grits. The atmosphere was calm and the food was great. The only thing that bothered me was, when I was about to change my order - the waiter or manager caught a little attitude ,but I'm glad I stood with the pancakes. It was deliciousIg: Briannascravings"
4/2/2022,4 star rating,"So I really love the DJ factor. He always shows up. The music is always a vibe even if it's too much old school. I appreciate 90% of the waiters and waitresses they are very attentive. The owners are always respectful and always try they're best to make sure everyone is ok. And although today my waiter may be High or drunk or whatever, I'm choosing to stay. All of the food is a good choice. But I am a creature of habit, I love grits and catfish it is always a good matchup. (Today it's just a bit too salty but it like that everywhere with catfish) I think I'm over trying to get a good Mimosa from here too. (I am a connoisseur of alcohol Lmao) It may sound like I have problems with my visit today. Yes, it's always a packed house so. Despite what went wrong today things are good here at this Black owned establishment. I appreciate the patron love again from the owner Markisha and Chef Carlos. Thanks Again!"
12/3/2021,5 star rating,Great customer service. The food is always hot and the drinks on point. I haven't had a chance to try the deserts but there is always next visit. I had the catfish and grits what a delight.
9/25/2021,1 star rating,Posted a review of terrible service and misrepresentation of menu items. The owner responded to my post claiming she came over to our able several times and offered complimentary drinks. Not true. We only dealt with our server and runners . Obviously this is a pattern and they can't keep up with who complains about what. Again - stop taking patrons for granted.
8/16/2021,1 star rating,"An over-hyped disappointment. Friends raved about the old location, so decided to give this place a shot as I had friends visiting from out of town (all foodies and well traveled).Appears this restaurant is popular and they seemingly take their customers for granted.Food: F (worse fried chicken and worse ribs for the price (ribs had no flavor and chicken drenched in oil; super soggy. Horrible rice and greens).Service: C: Runners had the worse attitude, as though patrons were an inconvenience. Server was sweet, but slow and not on top of her game.Menu: very limited.Worse part:  got the biscuits and biscuit and gravy. When they arrived, we discovered that they were not the items listed on the menu, but sweet cinnamon rolls disguised as biscuits. When we asked the server, she said they ran out of the regular ones. She also claimed that the gravy covered biscuits were savory. We showed  her the cinnamon laden biscuits and she didn't know what to say.   It's ok if restaurants run out of items, that happens, but be transparent with customers. What if some had a cinnamon allergy?I usually give places a second shot, but certainly not this one!  The owners need to wake up. New Yorkers have standards and long memories. Also, you need to be customer centric and have quality food if you want to have staying power!"
10/24/2021,5 star rating,"I'll start by saying my boyfriend swears by this place. They have a mouthwatering menu and pretty good music. I would suggest having a reservation for prime times like dinner and brunch, but BLVD is well worth the wait. No matter what meal you're going for, you are sure to need a nap after"
9/11/2021,4 star rating,Met a friend here on a Thursday night. Made reservations and was seated right away. Ordered drinks shortly after being sat and put in an app order upon receiving. We ordered the wings and they took quite some time but they were fresh and super hot! Very tasty and then split the Shrimp and Grits. The grits were nice and cheesy and great seasoning for the shrimp. I will definitely go back to try other items. Best part is they have breakfast all day!
3/28/2022,4 star rating,I'm giving it 4 stars because the food was delicious!But the service could be better! Would highly recommend the Shrimp & Grits!
3/26/2022,5 star rating,"This place is ON POINT! From the atmosphere to the food to our server! Such a friendly staff, it felt like we were one big happy family. Oh and the DJ was rockin'! Went to celebrate 35 years of sisterhood with my line sisters! We will definitely go there again soon. Thanks BLVD Bistro!"
2/21/2021,4 star rating,"I heard good things about this place at work so we had to show up and give it a try. We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and the place was buzzing! The staff was friendly, there was a live DJ playing all the hits and the drinks were flowing. We opted for french toast and their blvd cheese burger for our food. We also got the spiked lemonade carafe as our drink. The french toast was a little bit too cakey for me, and it seemed a bit basic. The cheese burger was good, but i would've like to see more options to customize the burger. As for the spiked lemonade?! Definitely a banger, drivers beware though, it tastes so good you might forget its spiked lol. Overall we loved the vibes of this place, food was decent, drinks were better, and the atmosphere was the best!"
9/8/2021,5 star rating,"I enjoyed a delicious brunch here. I had the buttermilk pancakes topped with peaches and macadamia nuts, the maple chicken sausage, and scrambled eggs. The pancakes were melt in your mouth light, the sausage was well seasoned with fennel and other spices, and the eggs were fluffy."
5/1/2021,5 star rating,"Cute little spot on 8th avenue and 116th Street. I made reservations for 2 with a friend and we were seated right away. It was a bit of a struggle for me to scan the QR code to check In to confirm the reservation upon arrival (safety precautions I guess), but after that, everything was smooth sailing. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes along with turkey bacon. My friend ordered the egg breakfast which was eggs any style, biscuit, smoked bacon and home fries. We both enjoyed our meals along with a carafe of Bellini. We also had the moonshine punch after we saw other people ordering the carafes of that.I enjoyed this place very much and hope to return again really soon."
3/22/2022,4 star rating,"So I've been here twice! First time was a great experience except one of my shrimp from my shrimp and grits was under cooked! Other than that my grits were cooked to perfection! Second time I visited I was blown away by the catfish and grits and cheesy fluffy eggs... also with a Nat Turner (Frozen Hennessy Drink) everything was on point! Also, their biscuits are the biscuits you think of when ""Martin"" would talk about his Mama's biscuits!!! They are nice a fluffy as well! I shall be back!"
5/27/2021,5 star rating,"This place is spot on! My first time there and I recommend everything! See the pictures. Our server, Brandon was serving other guests so a colleague got us started. The teamwork was great.  My mom and I shared the wings which were perfect. I had the ribs entree and they were very accommodating so that I could enjoy sides that weren't offered with them. Everything was delicious and my mom loved her food too. We also thought Brandon gave excellent service. Efficient, attentive and pleasant.  The only complaint my mom had was she didn't think her Southern Belle cocktail was strong enough. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to dine here on my next visit back home to Harlem. Hopefully, Brandon is there or someone just as good."
8/29/2021,5 star rating,"A great time was had by all!!!! My friend and I met at the Bistro at 12pm 8/2821 for brunch. When I tell you we stayed until 9:30pm. We laughed we danced we drank we saw friends leave and new friends return to our table. Malik was taking care of us the whole day, poor man. The foods is to die for and we have ordered everything . Malik you were right the potato salad is on point. Malik interacted with us, he was patient ( my friend are a bit much) I'm sure we drove him up the wall. Malik definitely is the best of the Best and we love him. Shoutout to the lovel Brandon and the Birthday chef who were also gracious and personable.  Shoutout to the female DJ who did the damn thing.

We had a reservation and were seated asap. Interior and exterior decor is modern and tastefully done. The bar accentuates and people are seated there's comfortably. It is a Harlem restaurant with a Black clientele as well as other residents of Harlem. I loved that it's a Harlem establishment, a Black owned eatery. The food is fresh and tasty. Service is very good. Drinking Prosecco with OJ is a good idea but the too basic Sangria can be skipped. All and all a wonderful Great restaurant"

I loved everything and would definitely return. It is a little loud in there so keep that in mind. I went on a Sunday and they had a DJ, I'm not sure it this is every Sunday though. I definitely recommend trying this place out!"
2/5/2022,3 star rating,"Let me first start this review by saying Shannon the manager of the restaurant went above and beyond to accommodate us and our concerns. Thank you Shannon!!Now...for the nitty gritty. My fiancé and I are visiting New York for the weekend (he's a native, BX stand up) and we were looking for a date night spot for dinner and drinks. He has been to BLVD before for brunch and raved about the food and atmosphere so naturally I'm excited to try this place he spoke so highly of. When looking for reservations (which were plentiful) we initially chose the 9:15 reservation but pushed it back to 9:30 to account for traffic, etc since the weather wasn't the greatest.  Please note that although the restaurant website says they close at 10, reservations could be placed as late as 10:30 on the Yelp app. We arrive to the restaurant at 9:35 to check in for our reservation. We noticed another couple in front of us seeming to be turned away at the host stand. Awkward. So when it's our turn, I give my name for the reservation to which the host replies ""oh yeah I tried calling you... we're having a food shortage in the kitchen"". Huh?? So I check my phone and indeed have two missed calls from 5 minutes ago. At the start of my reservation time. Sooo 1) you tried calling me? The moment my reservation is set to begin. Weird. 2) food shortage? That's not something you just notice..so of course at this point I'm searching for a restaurant nearby to have dinner bc this one is having an off day. My fiancé being the optimist he is encourages me to be open minded and see what food they do have available before just canceling the idea of eating here altogether. The host chimes in also that we can be seated and see what the kitchen can offer. I get it. He's trying to save this encounter and bring in some business but I personally was not feeling it lol but, obliged my man. The manager came over to see what was going on and to make sure we were being taken care of. The host assured her ""he got it"" but allowed her to step in to take care of seating us and getting us situated. We sat down but I still was fully dressed, coat on, because if we need to make a dash across the street, she was going to be ready ok? Anywho, after about 10 minutes of being seated our waiter comes and asks what we were thinking of ordering so he could check to see if the kitchen could accommodate. I requested the burger (bc it's hard to mess up a burger, right? Wrong. Keep reading) and my fiancé ordered the catfish breakfast. The waiter informed us that those orders could be fulfilled (yay!) and he would put those in and get us some waters. I'm like ok, cool. Still not completely out of the woods yet. He comes back with the waters and informs us that the bar is closed (huh?? It's around 945 at this point. And again, you can make a 10:30 resy so I'm not understanding) but they will make us one drink since our little fiasco at the door. Ok, fine. One drink is better than none I guess. So we continue trying to enjoy the evening. Then the food comes. My fiancé's food was great with no complaints. My burger however was extremely underdone in the center (I requested medium and yes I know what that means). I sent it back and informed the manager that I did not want a replacement (I mean the place obviously is going through a lot right now, so I was fine with not eating anymore). As the good manager she is, Shannon went above and beyond to listen to our concerns and tried her best to remedy the many missteps we experienced. She really wanted to make it up to us. So I agreed to have another burger made.....only for it to come to me completely well done. Felt like a bit of a smack from the kitchen like ""oh you don't like a little pink, OK!"" But whatevs. Shannon of course apologized again and offered us dessert on the house and a chance to come back for brunch. Sigh. We will try again, but honestly I wish we just got chopped cheeses from the bodega. Maybe brunch will be better or we can go earlier because closing time ain't it."
3/7/2022,4 star rating,Food wasss amazing service was a lil slow but the restaurant was very busy. I was there with a party of four.
2/1/2022,5 star rating,"I would always see BLVD while driving through Harlem but I never went inside until a couple of weeks ago. My best friend had told me that I needed to try BLVD. She was raving about the biscuits, the chicken, the sweet tea. EVERYTHING. And she's like me so she's picky. I went with my cousin on a Saturday night. Service was good and there was no wait, but we also made reservations.  We ordered the biscuit basket to split. I ordered the Brioche French Toast with a side of bacon. My cousin had the steak and eggs. LET ME TELL YOU...the biscuits were so moist and warm. You can tell they are fresh made. I enjoyed the accompaniment of the cane syrup butter and jelly. I'm still thinking about those biscuits today. I'm a sucker for good French toast and that French toast was so damn good. I loved the caramelized banana sauce they topped it with. It was just as sweet as syrup so none was needed. It was about 5 big pieces of French toast (imagine the brioche loaf from Trader Joe's). I tried my cousins steak. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The parking in the area is actually not that bad. We got a spot right across the street. I think my only small issue was that the music was very loud, but I'm also sensitive to loud noises. All in all, 100000/10 recommend. I can't wait to go back."
11/20/2021,3 star rating,I enjoyed the DJ she was rocking I would definitely hire her for any party I'm having. Didn't play that crazy hip hop of today. She kept it classy old school.  Took about 25 minutes to be seated since my reservation didn't go through.Our waitress Sharlisa (hope it's spelled correctly) was very informative about the menu and drinks. She was very attentive even with it being busy. She made sure to check on us periodically. Which was excellent. I had the Nina Simone drink (small but tasty). As an appetizer I had the ginger soy garlic wings which were very tasty. I could eat those everyday. For dinner I had the Lobster and lump crab cake with Poached eggs minus the yolk and lettuce with a nice dressing which was surprisingly good since I don't do any kind of dressing except for fresh lemon. Both of my friends had the fried chicken with delicious collard greens and potato salad.They enjoyed their food however mine not so much. They forgot to add the Lobster & lump crab meat. It was very wet and salty and for the price it should have had what it stated it was. Next visit I will try the Grits & Shrimp. For me I would not order the Lobster and Crab cake again since there was no lobster or crab meat in it and like I said before super wet & soggy.Overall the place is nice atmosphere is nice. But one thing to remember is make sure you have a reservation. Although I didn't like the Lobster & Crab cake I enjoyed the music & drinks. The collard greens are EVERYTHING but the potato salad needs work. Waaaaaaay tooooo much MUSTARD not enough RELISH or ONIONS for my liking.
12/12/2020,5 star rating,"**Post Covid Review**I've been wanting to come here for a few months now since I saw the good rating & reviews. I'm happy I finally was able to today & I wasn't disappointed at all. The restaurant has outdoor seating where you have your own personal tent, which I thought was good. They also have plastic dividers up for the long half booth seating inside. Upon entering theres a big bottle of hand sanitizer & all the staff had on mask. My cousin & I came here for brunch & had reservations. I thought we might would have to wait, but once we came in & stated we had a reservation, we were seated immediately. For starters we had the biscuits with sausage gravy & it was good. The biscuit melted in your mouth & the gravy was flavorful. My cousin & I both would've liked if there were more gravy, but it was still very good & I'm not someone who really cares for biscuits, but I ate the all of mine. For an entree I had the crab cake Benedict which came with a poached egg on top & a mix green salad. The crab cake was cooked perfectly as well as the poached egg. The mixed green salad had a light dressing on it too. My cousin had the blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage & eggs. She had no complaint about her meal either. For a beverage we had the pitcher of moonshine punch, which definitely had a kick to it & tasted good. It wasn't too fruity, it was well balanced. I also brought home a order for my mother which she asked for bbq ribs & she said the ribs fell off the bone, was tender & very flavorful. I'm happy to have been able to support this restaurant especially now since starting Monday, indoor dining will be closed again & it's too cold for outdoor seating. The service was good & the waiter was attentive. I'm also happy my cousin & I didn't feel rushed to leave after we ate. We were able to talk & not feel like the staff was ready for us to leave. I would return again & hope all restaurants can continue business during this uncertain time."
1/17/2022,2 star rating,Went there for a bday dinner was the worse orders got mixed up some of cold drinks were disgusting and service horrible don't know what was going on and it was cold in the back they kept opening the door smh no one was satisfied that day
2/11/2022,3 star rating,"This place has a cool look,and it has a feel of wanting to stay for a while .  The location is great right in the middle of Harlem.  One thing I notice is the level of hospitality needs working on. The staff or most of the staff is at a beginning of their career.  Owner teach them will it will pay off in the long run, Amen lights"
6/27/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices, and really delicious food. The drinks are great and strong which is definitely a plus. I recommend getting the moonshine punch, it's so refreshing and worth the price! I also ordered the Jumbo Shrimp with Grits and wow, so flavorful! The owner is also such a sweetheart, she was so welcoming and really cares for her customers. Overall, my friends, boyfriend and I had a great experience at Blvd Bistro! We'll be back for sure!"
12/1/2020,2 star rating,I love nothing more than a black owned restaurant but this place just isn't it. Came here for brunch on a Saturday with Yelp reservations and was seated promptly. Our waiter was nice and attentive. The food was... yeah simply just not good. For starters my eggs Benedict came out with boiled instead of a poached egg. They remade it quickly but the remake didn't taste any better. The Mac and cheese was decent but not something I would come back for. Highly disappointing
10/26/2021,1 star rating,WARNING!!!!!! WARNING!!!!!! Was at this business twice this past Saturday on 10/23/21. First for brunch and second for dinner. I ordered the catfish breakfast which had scrambled eggs and grits and cheese following it with a biscuit. The grits tasted like mash potatoes didn't have any grain of grits in it. The party I was with complained that the food was horrible they expected it to have more flavor since it's in the Harlem area and black owned. For dinner my glass water smelled like raw chicken. I ordered wings and sent them back due to the wing still literally bleeding. The party I also was with had the meatloaf dinner which they also complained about not tasting fresh along with their order of wings bleeding too. Later on that night I believe I ended up getting a slight mild case of salmonella. I do not recommend this food establishment at ALL. Please be carful.I went to this establishment twice this day once was last minute brunch. For dinner was reserved for a birthday for about a week since I came back bashing the grits. Secondly the wing that was eaten was from someone that I offered it to. From a business owner who is in the food industry you should retrain your cooks bigger pieces have to be fried more to the temperature degree to avoid any future violations. As you can see I ordered wings since I was highly disappointed with brunch thinking that wings are safe and who can mess up on that. Obviously I was wrong. Don't embarrass yourself in public and take accountability for your business and make it better. Constructive criticism.
6/11/2020,4 star rating,"Writing this after two visits. The first was shortly after I ran the NYC Marathon and although may memory was that it was delicious, I'm pretty sure I was still delirious with fatigue so my judgment was likely obscured.That said, I brought a good friend from out of town back for round two and happy to say BLVD did not disappoint. We both had the breakfast sandwich with potatoes, and the bottom less brunch, which were both incredibly satisfying and a great value for my dollar. They also had a DJ spinning great tunes as we all dined.I remember on the first post-marathon trip, my family from out of town was with me. A drink on the menu mentioned Mississippi, where I hail from, so we mentioned it to the waiter and he brought over the owners, a husband and wife. They were incredibly warm, hospitable, and we found out we new a few of the same people. Support businesses like these y'all, they're treasures.Go here fam."
5/31/2021,5 star rating,Visiting from Texas I spent a birthday brunch with family and friends. Chef Carlos Swepson had great hospitality. The food is phenomenal and the ambiance is amazing! Job well done!
7/7/2020,5 star rating,I love the food here. Went here for brunch. Had some amazing drinks and a great conversation with the chef and owner. He is a great man and an amazing cook.I had the shrimp and grits plate with eggs and a biscuit. Everything was delicious! The grits were creamy and rich. The eggs were a perfect sunny side up and the shrimp was seasoned and cooked well. And dont get me started on the biscuit; I loved that biscuit! The portion was good. It was a brunch menu and included a pitcher. The drinks were made soooooo well. Worth every penny and j do appreciate a quality drink. Go give BLVD a try you wont regret it!
7/3/2021,5 star rating,This place is amazing! All day brunch. My favorite is shrimp and grits. The grits are cheesy and the shrimp is seasoned perfectly. The lemon pound cake us very close to homemade; yum! This place is a staple for delicious brunch with great R&B and hip hop: you have to love all day brunch.
6/30/2021,3 star rating,"The food here is pretty tasty like many of the other reviewers said, but I have to deduct a star because the service was slightly lackluster. In addition, the  appetizer plates were dirty, and one of the potato salad sides looked like someone had taken a giant spoonful before it arrived at our table. We also ordered one of their Uptown Teas after the food arrived, and we had to ask the server for our drink after it never showed up. In fact, the server disappeared for like 15 mins, and we saw her re-enter the restaurant from outside. The fried catfish was bomb diggity (that means good)."" It was nicely seasoned. The fried chicken was good too. Though, my fried chicken was a little too done. The fried chicken pieces were dry, but the breading was definitely on pointe. Other than the missing spoonful of potato salad, the sides were pretty good though. The drinks were also good, especially the froze. The ambiance was the best part! Great music, and fun vibes."
3/7/2020,4 star rating,"The atmosphere is vibrational. The staff, servers and waiters are fun and friendly. Music was decent. They favor their biscuits and they were pretty good. Nice, fluffy and buttery. The Mississippi mango drink is one I'd go back for. The drink was very good. The fried chicken sliders were decent not phenomenal, nothing much to it. The atmosphere is trendy-grungy-jazzy-cool. A bit dark but not oddly. A large enough space without too much crowding. It was a great vibe. I'd visit again for another drink and to try other things on their menu. Their fish looked so good but I was not very hungry on this visit. Next time, I'll bring my appetite."
4/25/2022,1 star rating,"I went in at 2:46pm for a table, they told me a hour wait. So I waited, then returned at 3:46 and asked about my table. They told me someone was getting up to pay their bill and they would seat me and my friend. At 4:40pm, we were still waiting and just left. We ended up having our brunch across the street because we were STARVING. Poor experience, poor customer service."
10/20/2020,3 star rating,"This was a difficult review to write. Every time I come here; I have a different experience. Sometimes amazing, sometimes mediocre. I feel that overall, the food is really good. I've enjoyed their pancakes, and shrimp and grits. They have a decent smothered pork chop and candied yams...but the last time I ordered it, the rice was hard and undercooked. Their biscuits are hit and miss. The service tends to vary as well. Overall, I do like to support black-owned businesses, and they have great potential. But BLVD Bistro needs to work on its inconsistency."
12/12/2020,5 star rating,"Another awesome visit to Blvd Bistro. The service is excellent, kind, polite, and attentive. The food is absolutely delicious. The vibe is chill. FYI: make a reservation because it gets crowded quickly. Enjoy!"
12/11/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite brunch spot. I never know what to order because I want to eat everything on the menu. I love the breakfast sandwiches with grape jelly and the shrimp and grits the best. The service is also great; the hostess and waiters are awesome, pleasant and attentive. Make a reservation because it gets really crowded."
2/29/2020,3 star rating,"This review should be 3.5 stars.Decent enough bistro that has moved to Fredrick Douglas Blvd from Malcolm X. If you plan to dine on Friday or Saturday, it's best to make a reservation. Fortunately, we had a reservation for our dinner, but the line was quite long for a Friday night around 8 pm. The restaurant has a pretty cool layout; however, it can be quite loud (like most restaurants nowadays) . . . I'm not sure if it's the acoustics. If you want to have an average, kind of quiet dinner, you probably should try another restaurant and maybe get pre- or post-dinner drinks here. I felt like I had to scream/talk to the person who was sitting across from me at the table. Our server, while a bit hyper, was pretty good. Since I ordered the double-cut pork chop, I would have appreciated if he told me that the dish takes longer to prepare than the other items on the menu. It was a tad annoying seeing other folks who were seated after us get their food before we did. Actually, maybe this information should be mentioned on the menu. The wait time was not a game killer; it just would have been nice to know. Since BLVD is a Southern-style restaurant, I was a bit surprised that the pork chop was on the bland side. However, the caramelized apples and onions were a nice addition to the traditional dish. You must try the BLVD Bistro Wings.I more than likely will revisit the restaurant, but I'll visit during off-peak hours."
1/31/2020,4 star rating,Nice neighborhood bistro on Frederick Douglas Blvd.  Right next to 116 th St subway stop. Recommend the happy hour specials in the bar area.  Asked to be seated theere for specials..The sliders came as three large burgers.  Had the wings which were tasty and filling.  The two appetizers were enough to fill  two people.Recommend the apple baked pie with ice cream as well as the bread pudding.Service was good.
11/8/2020,3 star rating,"Went here for brunch and it lost points because of the wait for food. I came on a Sunday had a reservation for 2:30. I got sat close to 3p and the food didn't get to us until 4:30. An hour and a half waiting for food is unacceptable. The place was packed during covid. They seemed to do a horrible job managing the number of people on the waitlist and those that had reservations. Despite my reservation I had to wait on a line that moved at a snails pace to just check in. Once I got sat the server was fairly good. Came by and immediately gave us water came back some minutes later to take our order. The food was amazing. Almost worth the wait. We got the catfish dinner, the catfish breakfast and pancakes. Everything was seasoned so well. Seriously no complaints w the good. Would probably get the food to go or try dinner to see if it was less packed. FYI no bottomless or unlimited but carafes are about 35."
8/3/2021,5 star rating,"I was visiting NYC for my sister's bachelorette weekend. We decided to come here for brunch. I really liked the vibe and atmosphere of this restaurant. I loved the fact they had a DJ who played great music! Our server was great! She gave recommendations and offered to take pictures of the group. I ordered the Biscuit Cinnamon Roll Basket, which is only available on the weekend. They came out hot and fresh and tasted great! I ordered the Fine Herb & Cheese Omelette and a side of Cheese Grits. I was very pleased with the food and service. I would definitely come back!"
1/15/2020,5 star rating,We really enjoyed brunch here. The French toast with sugar cane butter was incredible. Among the very best pain perdu I've every tasted. The bread is modestly saturated in the butter which gives this dish a perfectly integrated sweet/buttery taste.The bacon was well smoked and porky. Had the Harlem Wit beer to go along with it.
3/21/2021,5 star rating,"This was a first time visit and I must say I really enjoyed it. Reservations where made... (Advice) Make reservations. This place get fully booked. Dj played awesome music giving great vibes. Looking for an upbeat atmosphere, this is the place. Food was amazing. I'm going back. Drinks buy them by the carafe you won't be disappointed. Definitely recommend. BTW our waiter Q which he said was his 1st day, did an awesome job 2 thumbs up.. I'd give more but that's all my hands allow ... LOL"
5/11/2021,4 star rating,"One thing about great soul food places is they flourish in the food department but service is usually their shortcoming. I met one of my friends that live in Harem to catch up and he recommended this spot. He said the food was great so I said this sounds like a no brainer. When I got there he said it be a 30 minute wait. I said that's not an issue. Only issue is we didn't get seated until an hour later. In my mind I was thinking this food has to be good because no one has left since I've gotten here and the workers was apologizing for the wait and saying you won't be disappointed. During brunch they have the dj playing music and it's a good vibe. After letting the management know our issues with waiting that long they apologized and offered us some drinks to compensate for the wait while we ordered. I ordered the fish and grits. At one point I thought they went and caught the fish, fillet and cooked it because it took some time for it to come out. Since we both had to leave by a certain point I told them to box mine to go. But when I tell u once it came out I forgot about all the issues I had, that was a understatement. The fish was fresh, the cheese grits were perfect, the eggs were flavorful and the biscuit with the honey butter was amazing. The pitcher was also good. Aside from the long wait everything was great but since I had that expectation I was ok. So if your on a time crunch I'd order to go ahead of time, but if you have some time go sit down and enjoy a plate."
5/3/2021,4 star rating,"One of the reasons that I came to this spot is because they do brunch all day on the weekend. We went on a Saturday night, I had a reservation, and I was seated promptly. Definitely recommend a reservation. However, apparently there was another group before us that had reservation and had been waiting over an hour and was very upset.The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service was pretty good, and the vibes were great. I started with the cinnamon roll biscuits. I was sightly disappointed because the biscuits were very hard, but when I asked for another order, the second batch was much better. For my entree, I had the catfish breakfast and it did not disappoint. I would definitely be back, but go earlier in the day. When we got there, the DJ was leaving. Music was playing, but it seemed to be playing off of someone phone."
11/17/2019,5 star rating,"I was visiting a friend in Harlem that lives down the street from this place so we figured we check it out.Decor/Ambiance: When we walked in the first thing I noticed was the church music playing and the beautiful sunlight coming in from the windows. It was the perfect Sunday morning. The decor was very simple which made the place very open for a NY restaurant. I noticed one of the windows look like an old car garage so maybe that's what the building use to be. If so, management did a fantastic job turning it into a beautiful restaurant.Service: The staff was very friendly and attentive. My friend thought the homemade biscuits were complimentary and asked the waiter if we can have some. He politely explained they're usually only for dinner and at brunch you have to order them. He then offered to bring us two on the house which we were VERY grateful for. They seemed to have a great system in place to seat people quickly and keep the food coming. We had a reservation which definitely helped.Food: AMAZING!!!! Like I'm already planning my next trip back. I LOVED the cheese grits! They were so creamy and fulfilling. I got the catfish and grits with a side of chicken maple sausage! So yummy. I definitely want to come back and try dinner. The fried chicken looked to die for.Recommends: make a reservation for sure! This place has a pretty good crowd on weekends. Also try the cheese grits, best I ever had!"
8/30/2020,4 star rating,"I came here with my fiancé for a nice night out, he picked here to eat. The interior of the restaurant looks nice with ranch style and a rustic look to it. Since we are in a pandemic, we were situated outside behind a bus stop. I'm not rating this however. To drink I ordered shrimp and grits and Chardonnay to drink. The meal was ok. I liked the jalapeño with the cheese and bacon bits. I just wish there was more shrimp. The biscuit that came with the meal was tasty with the maple butter they served with it. The staff were great as well, I can't wait until this pandemic is over, I would have loved to sit down inside. The decor really had me. The food and drink were served in take away pans. I understand why, but it doesn't make for a good photo lol."
9/20/2021,4 star rating,"I love this place... in the past month I've traveled to harlem twice to have brunch here. The food is good, the vibe and music is great... the staff is friendly and efficient.  Now the moonshine punch is Amazing!!!!!!!!  If u don't do anything... have the moonshine punch."
8/29/2020,3 star rating,This was a really cool getaway for the night. There was ample seating along the sidewalk of the restaurant even though seating was off-limits inside you still got a really good experience being there. I got the fried chicken with biscuits and a side of mac & cheese. The fried chicken was very moist and hot so you can tell it was freshly made the biscuits were delicious along with their maple butter and the mac & cheese is very girly and cheesy just the way I like it I had a really good experience our waiter was super friendly and super cool. I definitely enjoyed being there and I will definitely go back when things clear out and we are back to normal once again
11/5/2019,4 star rating,"I struggled with how to rate this place. I've dined here several times and the food is beyond yummy.  So why the quandary you ask ~ the last experience was off. We had a reservation. Seating at like 7:30 or 8 pm  on a Sunday.  Someone called to confirm AND sent a text. So we replied to both. Yes we were coming. We arrived a few minutes late and waited to be seated. They said they weren't sure we were coming After being finally seated we were told they were out of a number of things. Including ~ grits. Check their menu. So much is centered around ...grits. Anyway, the owners came over. We chatted. They made grits. Were charming. Hence our dinner shoulda been pleasant. But there was some hubbub between the owner and some folk. It was loud and unnerving. Yikes. Shouldn't that be handled when guests aren't in the restaurant?  The food was ~ exceptional. Excellent. Divine. Scrumptious.  Now if they can tighten up the management."
2/21/2021,5 star rating,"This is by far one of the best restaurants I have been to throughout nyc. I'm not located in Harlem, but I make a whole day trip out of getting food from here. My best friend and I went a few months ago (still during the pandemic) and not only was the service phenomenal, the food was amazing also. My server who was also one of the bartenders, Abe took great care of us with decent priced, strong drinks. I didn't know what I wanted but I knew I needed caffeine and he got me squared away with what I believe was an espresso martini. I will never buy another drink again. So thank you for that!We ordered...Blvd's Southern Dinner - fried chicken, collard greens & potato salad Banana pudding I believe there was a fruit pancake option at some point, which is what my friend got. ALL OF THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Anytime I am in the area, you all ALWAYS see my face."

10/19/2020,5 star rating,"I got the jerk chicken and waffles for brunch meal. The jerk had good flavor and the waffles were decent. I like mine a bit crunchier texture...I also got the fried cod fish fritters which were tasty especially with the sauce. The fries were awesome,very crunchy and hot. Couldn't finish everything so I had it for later...this place has good food"
7/22/2021,5 star rating,"So I have been curious about this place for some time. I finally decided to see for myself what was so awesome about it. They did not disappoint! We were greeted immediately as we walked through the door. The shrimp and grits was amazing! Decadent, juicy, balanced consistency and cheesy! My husband has the BBQ pork ribs and I wasn't able to take a picture because he devoured it. While the soda machine wasn't working (bummer) the bartender (ahem... mixologist) found a way to make me the most decadent aromatic drink. It was heaven.  We were stuffed for hours and I absolutely recommend this place."

3/30/2021,4 star rating,This spot was super cute and had a popping DJ. The wait was super long on a Sunday during the afternoon luckily we had a car but it was worth it. The food was AMAZING! I was obsessed with how buttery the pancakes were the chicken was so tasty and the macaroni was cheesy. I had to take some home. My only complaint was they didn't do bottomless just a pitcher that I didn't really think was that worth it. It wasn't boozy enough and had a lot of pulp. The waiter accidentally charged my date's card twice but it was busy and they were quick to resolve it. The staff is super friendly I would definitely come back.
3/19/2021,4 star rating,"Food was so delicious. Drinks were strong but so tasty. Ambiance was great. The one thing I would say could be better is they were pretty clearly over booked, we waited maybe 20-30 mins after our reservation to sit."
9/16/2021,3 star rating,"The food here was absolutely amazing!! Super fresh, hot and came within a reasonable aunt of time! The service on the other hand was a bit slower than I would expect. It took over an hour for us to get drinks and the server did not check in on us frequently so it was hard to get things like extra napkins and sauces. Highly recommend the catfish breakfast!!"
10/26/2021,3 star rating,Drinks and biscuits were good.  Easy to make reservations. The breakfast eggs with bacon that I ordered were just too greasy and unappetizing.
3/20/2022,5 star rating,"What can I say? Great atmosphere and just as great was the food. We had the catfish and grits, as well as the shrimp and grits. Everything was seasoned great and cooked to perfection. Came for Sunday brunch and couldn't be more happy for our selection. Prices were fair and portions were optimal. Waitress was Shea and the GM Shannon were amazing. Hope you all get to meet her and the rest of this amazing staff during your visit."
9/23/2020,4 star rating,"Those biscuits are AMAZING. Mac and cheese was on point! Vibe is nice, and I can't say enough about the great service. The one suggestion I would make to the chef/owner is the wings that are used HUGE. And while this sounds great, larger wings are generally from those that are low quality over fed mass produced chickens - which produce a ""rubbery"" texture to the meat. It may be ok for most (which is why I assume they still use them), but for those from a culinary background, will get sent back. I would happily pay $2 more if they used organic chicken."
10/6/2021,5 star rating,"Service was great. Collard Greens with Turkey, and the Mac and Cheese (I excluded the bacon) was great. Topped it off with Uncle Nearest on the rocks!"
10/17/2021,3 star rating,Really enjoyed the catfish and the sangria was good but everything took a really long time to come out. The place wasn't jammed packed so i'm not sure why. My boyfriend doesn't want to go back because the music was a bit loud making it hard to have a conversation once the DJ started at noon but I liked the music she was playing so I was ok with it

10/17/2021,4 star rating,"Overall great for brunch, but the service took very long. I guess the first delay was that we were seated without menus and they didn't bring menus for 10 minutes. We were a group of 6 people and most of us ordered the biscuit sandwiches based on the waiter's recommendation. Those were great, but the food took about 1 hr 30 min to be served. We also drank carafes of their Prosecco punches. The blood orange flavor is better than the mango one"

10/26/2021,5 star rating,"Best biscuits I've had in a long time! We went for Sunday brunch. Got there about 11:00am and didn't have to wait more than a couple of minutes. I had the catfish, scrambled eggs, and cheese grits with a side of collard greens. I am very picky when it comes to collard greens and I was shocked at how tasty the greens are here so I ordered seconds. The portions are a good size but the collards are so good that I was just being super greedy and needed more. The biscuits are fluffy and melt in your mouth. My uncle ordered the steak and eggs and said the steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection! The next time I am in NYC I will definitely be returning to this place. The music was great...not too loud but loud enough to enjoy. Everything was delicious and the Peach Bellini mimosas were fantastic! No complaints at all....wonderful customer service! I can't wait to return!"
8/3/2021,2 star rating,"The food was okay. I first ordered the lobster Benedict which was not served on top if anything, like a English muffin or biscuit. It was horrible. I had to return it. You could taste the vinegar in the eggs. As I asked for a 50% refund since I was trying to eat some until I just was fed up with the meal. I also ordered the wings it was very salty. I would not come here again."
7/30/2021,5 star rating,"This review is for brunch only! My hubby and I randomly decided to go to BLVD on a Sunday morning for an impromptu brunch experience. We have heard great things about this establishment and wanted to try it for ourselves. Upon arrival we were placed on the waiting list but invited to sit at the bar to eat. The two servers behind the bar were attentive and very friendly. Hubby ordered the Catfish Breakfast and I ordered the Egg Breakfast. Both dishes were made well, tasted fresh, and full of flavor. The drinks here were top notch and I am not one to say that lightly. I ordered the Frose All Day and it was DELICIOUS. It gave me just the buzz that I was looking for and I literally had to hold myself back from ordering a second one. Hubby had the Momma's Honey Pot which was strong and perfectly made as well. We will definitely be returning to try dinner items to see if it will keep it's 5 star level of perfection!"
11/15/2021,2 star rating,"Do not go here on the weekend unless you're there within the first 2 hours of opening. Do not go there and sit outdoors if it's scheduled to rain. I got there around 1pm & was seated around 1:30pm, my food didn't come until 2:30pm. We asked for lemon w our water and was told there wasn't any more, here's lime. I only had a burger and fries so I took no pictures since nothing was fancy & my cheese was burnt. There's no heater outside though it's enclosed it's still cold. I was sitting near torn plastic so when it rained water came through the hole. We moved over a seat and then water started dripping down from the top onto the table. There's no social distance or dividers, so that was a very bad experience for me."

7/25/2021,1 star rating,"Great food, terrible service. Never get a delivery from here. I usually go here in person and have a great experience. Today, I placed an order on Seamless. After it was already 15 min past the est. delivery time, I tried calling the restaurant to see what was going on, but no one answered the phone. I then called the delivery driver to see what was going on and he said he was unable to talk to the staff.After waiting almost an hour with no update, I decided to walk to the restaurant myself. The staff at the front desk was talking amongst themselves and I had to ask if they worked there before getting any service. Next thing, my order was cancelled altogether after an hour of waiting and walking there myself. While seamless helped with a refund, the staff didn't seem to care and acted like it was normal course of business because they're understaffed and had an attitude."
7/27/2021,2 star rating,Food was cold .I was given hard biscuits twice and the waitress brought the wrong meal to my table.I felt this restaurant would be of caliber because it was referred advertised by my favorite basketball player.(Dwyane wade)I'm highly upset at the service received.
2/26/2022,5 star rating,"I'm from the south and I must say, this is some of the best soul food I've ever had. You have to try the cheese grits! This is an amazing restaurant. I highly recommend!!"
8/21/2021,5 star rating,"Saw this spot on Yelp, black owned. 4 stars. Say Less... made reservations so it wasn't a wait. We ordered, the chicken & blueberry pancakes  & the catfish and grits breakfast. It was A1, definitely tasted like somebody grandma made the food. Also got the 116th & Frederick Douglass...definitely put the foot in it. Great ambiance, great vibe, great everything. Chicken could've used some mambo sauce, but what are you going to do. No pictures, too busy crushing. Take my word for it."
2/25/2022,5 star rating,Great place and great vibes. Love the music and the owners were super nice. He wait with a reservation was longer than expected but all good.
2/20/2022,5 star rating,AMAZING service!!! From the host at the front to our server to the manager... They were friendly and accommodating and made our experience so pleasant. This was my first time here and I will definitely be back.
4/25/2021,5 star rating,"Me and my two kids had such a great experience at BLVD Bistro. I know of this place because a few months ago my husband had an interview here, he didn't get the position but he said this place smelled amazing while he was there. So once we got some good weather I took my kids here for brunch. And they did not disappoint!! First of all my cocktail actually had liquor in it  I feel like u can never get a good cocktail now a days. Second the shrimp and grits is a must try. And my kids shared the chicken and biscuits and they really loved that butter/honey sauce for the biscuits. Yummm we will be back"
11/14/2021,5 star rating,Great food and service. Brunch on Sunday is a good vibe with great mimosas and a DJ! Don't miss the chicken and biscuits.
3/6/2021,5 star rating,I love this restaurant! The biscuits and gravy are really gooooood!! I ate their food twice. Always order a side of gravy-- you want to put everything on it!! Super good food and great vibes. Give it a try!
8/16/2021,5 star rating,"The biscuits were fire, good fried chicken, and the shrimp and grits were delicious. You can't just eat anyone's potato salad, and this potato salad was good as well. Small place but great ambiance and excellent customer service"
8/31/2021,5 star rating,Love this place. Staff is always pleasant! Shrimp and grits are my favorite along with biscuits. I advise you make reservations because this place is a local favorite! Issa a vibe for the culture!
4/14/2021,4 star rating,Friendly staff and all masked up! The French toast shown was deliciously made with a hint of coconut and topped with caramelized bananas (ask about allergies since it wasn't on the menu)The cocktails were good just mix them.
12/1/2020,5 star rating,"Yes yes yes!!! You know what makes any meal 100 better!? Amazing service. My friend and I went for their Sunday brunch and I'm so happy we came by. Customer service was on point from the beginning to the end, I think our waiters name was Trent but it's a little hazy because our drinks were soooo strong(moonshine punch). You ever just order drinks because it's brunch with no intention to get drunk, then have to wait it out to do other errands because you got drunk. Let's just say I never made it to the gym that day. The food was delicious as well. We are def making this a monthly spot. Try to get there early they do tend to have a waiting list."
8/4/2019,5 star rating,"We came here for brunch on a Sunday.  Its located right at subway train stop. We had reservations for 1245 and was seated in less tha  10 mins. The wait staff was friendly and helpful.We ordered catfish & grits, blueberry pancakes,  fried chicken basket w/ side eggs & grits.  Topped it off w/ sangria. It was wsy too much food. The portions are large. But, now we have tomorrow's meal. The food was excellent!"
6/9/2021,5 star rating,It's definitely one of the best soul food restaurants in the city. Love everything I've had there. The biscuits are a must. And try the moonshine cocktail pitchers! If you are looking for a little more upscale soul food place check out BLVD.
3/31/2020,4 star rating,"Arrived at BLVD Bistro around 1pm on a Sunday and let me tell you... this is clearly one of Harlem's go-to brunch spots on a Sunday afternoon (& tbh, now I understand why!)The vibe is clearly curated to appeal to their targeted audience and they do a great job doing just that. The DJ was on fire! & helped relieve the tension of our 1hr+ wait. (I do wish they had a better system with seating because it was getting pretty hectic.)We were seated and attended to by a young women whose name I cannot remember. (Now, I understand ya'll are busy and may have a lot going on... but there is no reason why she did such a bad job. She literally came back to our table twice asking for our order after we had already told her. Then she forgot what we told her, not to mention one order never came out!)Yes, the service from the waiter was bad. However, I the food and the quality of the food outshined that experience by far. The shrimp & grits are to die for! I ordered the crab cake Benedict and it was pretty good. The fried chicken and cheddar biscuits basket was also a hit. My friends both ordered Bellinis and said they were the best they've had. Not shocked as the food was really good. Definitely recommended, just wish the service was better!"

11/29/2020,4 star rating,"The place was good pretty pricey but hay we live in a covid world now eggs with cheese was 10 dollars because I wanted it on the side. Eggs 8 dollars 2 dollars for cheese, what do you think about that or is it me?The service was great food was good, I heard  so many things about the place I wanted to try it for myself. I live in queens don't know if it was worth going back  but no complaints here."
8/3/2021,5 star rating,Such a delicious experience me and partner when here for a date night and it was just fantastic the atmosphere was bumping! The service is laid back in a good way the make you feel like you're a regular. We had the biscuits to start which were hot and fluffy! Then we had the shrimp and grits which was one of best of I've had in my life and my partner had the fried chicken which was really delicious but could of been seasoned a little more. But pour that hot sauce on it and she was in heaven! Would definitely recommend!
2/9/2020,4 star rating,"Where do I begin with my review...first off, when you walk in the restaurant, the ambiance is vibrant and warm. The hostess and staff are extremely helpful and attentive. Lastly, the food was so amazing. Our table was served with the chicken and waffles, jerk chicken,  and a salad as a vegan option. You can taste every ingredient in each dish and the spiciness was just right.Excellent soul food. Great atmosphere,  friendly and accommodating servers. The portions were plentiful. Enjoyed the food, the space was really clean and professional. The staff was terrific. Great experience from start to finish. Our hostess was great. Our waitress  was attentive, friendly and had excellent suggestions. The food was beyond good. Thankfully we had a large group so I got to sample a lot of the starters, each one better than the other.Service was exceptional! I had the chicken and waffles. The mixture of sweet and spicy was to die for! Highly recommend the mac & cheese & collard greens...reminds me of down home mac & cheese. For drinks my group shared jamaican rum punch, which was a great hit. Dessert consisted of gluten free chocolate cake and the sweet potato donuts with vanilla ice cream.  Music added to the laid back atmosphere. Definitely worth the trip into Harlem.Highly recommend this spot."
2/3/2020,5 star rating,"Iight so boom. I've been to BLVD Bistro at it's old location on 122nd & Malcolm X Boulevard, so I was excited to attend brunch at their new location on 116th & Frederick Douglass (RIP Streetbird, you had a good run). The service was divine, shoutout to Toya, the food was bomb, DJ was fire, and that sweet tea & Prosecco drink....LAWD. Let's get into it.We arrived at 2:45 for our 2:45 reservation. Our table was set and ready, but the last member of our party of 4 was late, so we had to wait for her to be seated. That ain't no problem *Shannon Sharpe voice*, typical protocol. We waited for our guest to arrive while jamming out to the tunes the DJ was spinning. I loved to see an Asian woman playing the latest soca, reggar, hip hop & rnb, sis was lit and definitely had the vibes right. Once we were seated, our waitress Toya was on it. She was SUCH a delightful spirit oh my goodness. She had us freestyle rap our order, gave us recommendations based on our appetite and food preference and made sure our glasses never stayed empty**All in all, our table ordered the fried chicken and biscuit basket (side of collard greens for each of us), the grilled cheese with potatoes and the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. We had the bottomless drinks, and chose the sweet tea & Prosecco drink. Hunty. Listen. LISTEN. That drink is DANGEROUS! I never thought to mix the two, but omg I need it in my life EVERYDAY it was SO good. The sweet tea was fresh, homemade and the Prosecco just set it offff. Lawd. The food was equally as bomb. Fried chicken fried to a crisp, crunchy, tender meat juicy on the inside. The biscuits. Just like my mamas biscuits. Flakey, golden brown, fluffy on the inside, buttery goodness. YUM. Accompanied with butter and jelly (I took some home and had it with some vanilla bean syrup from Trader Joes later that evening. BABY! Too. Good.) We all enjoyed our meals, scarfing it all down. When the pancakes came out I told my homegirl I knew they were going to be good because they just LOOKED like it. You know what I mean. Perfectly golden brown with the crispy edges. She took one bite and solidified what I already knew. My other homegirl legit ate her ENTIRE plate of grilled cheese and potatoes. The grilled cheese had breakfast meats and eggs on it as well so the meal was very hearty and filling.My ONLY qualm, is that bottomless was an hour. An hour?! Challenge accepted. At first we asked ourselves if it made sense to do bottomless for only an hour. But, a cocktail itself was $14, we knew we wanted to have more than one cocktail, so as long as you have 2 drinks you're saving money in the long run. And trust, you'll have more than 2 because again it was just DELICIOUS.5 starts man, 5 stars. Andre Leon Talley was in the building having a great time buttering up his biscuits and jamming to the music. The owner walked around and made sure everything was to our liking. We were able to ask other staff members for extra condiments & refills without the ""I'll alert your server"" attitude. Just all in all, a GREAT time. I will definitely be back if not for lunch then dinner (I saw some items on the dinner menu with my name on it). But I promise you....you'll love BLVD Bistro as much as I did."
3/9/2020,5 star rating,"I stopped by this restaurant after having brunch earlier that day. As soon as I entered, I got hungry again because the food smelled so good. I sat at the bar and ordered the Homemade Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich with a Spiked Tea (see photo), and it was DELICIOUS. I also tried the fried catfish meal with grits and scrambled egg. I highly recommend coming here if you're in the mood for excellent soul food!  I will be returning to try the rest of the menu :)"
4/17/2021,2 star rating,"Do not waste your time... not sure if this is just because of the pandemic but the service is TERRIBLE! Green houses do not have heat, I was given a glass of orange juice that wasn't clean! There was a whole lip gloss stain, my friend had a leaf in his water. They don't cover the food or drinks when they bring it from the indoor restaurant to the greenhouse so there's particles flying from everywhere into the food. If everywhere else wasn't booked, I would've left. Food was a 7/10, that's the only good thing that came out of here otherwise, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"

The owner took care of us and so did a few other servers, what remained consistent was the smiles and warmth of the staff ... and good gosh the food?! The food was NOTHING less than AMAZING! I'd give the restaurant 6 stars if I could. A true HARLEM gem."
5/4/2021,5 star rating,The first time I went I fell in love with the breakfast and mimosas I told myself I have to go back for dinner. I went back for dinner and the restaurant is literally a 10/10 the food is great the staff are so nice the drinks are perfect and the prices aren't bad I love this place. Best Brunch in all of nyc.
8/19/2020,5 star rating,"Had brunch here on Saturday in the rain, still had a wonderful meal and enjoyable time.I had the watermelon goat cheese salad - the mix of sweetness, tart of the lemon vinagreet, earthyness of spinach and smooth sweeet goat cheese was perfect. My friend and I also split some biscuits and gravy - biscuits were rich and buttery, the gravy was perfect and had really nice sausage in it.The music playlist was also on point. Lots of stuff both my friend and I listened to as a teenager and it took us back and kept our conversation going :)"
12/1/2018,5 star rating,"This place is like a scene out of one of the classic 70's movies Claudine. I had such a great dining experience here for lunch and can't wait to share it with others. The only time I travel to Harlem is when I'm in the mood for down home southern cuisine at Amy Ruth's . I had my doubts coming due to the reviews here but the service exceeded my expectations. My friend suggested we dine for lunch with her 1 year old. Our server was Malik and he was great. The staff here was so friendly and the food was very good. I ordered the Catfish Po Boy served with a nice pickled Cole Slaw and a skillet of potato salad. My friend had the pan fried chicken and biscuits. Our food arrived in perfect time. There were other locals dining and conversing but it wasn't crowded around 2:00. The catfish was perfectly breaded, light and crispy. I've had a Po Boy previously and this was the best. Everything was fresh and the presentation of the food was perfection. The potato salad was nice and light not covered in mayonnaise. My friend's 1 year old loved it.Above all, I loved the ambiance here. The selection of classic 70's rhythm and blues oldies like the OJAYs and Gladys Knight and The Pips being played while we dined was so dear to my heart and gave me the feel of the old Harlem. I loved the art work here ! The James Baldwin piece is so dope. Check out the bathroom walls here. So cool! Covered with the spirit of Harlem. The essence of black history. I can't wait to return for dinner and dessert."

12/3/2019,2 star rating,"They get two stars because of the music - other than that..........My bookclub met here on a whim on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was a little crowded but not overly so.  We had about a 10-15 minute wait but like I said above the music was good so we didn't mind.....We were seated and given our menus - it's a typical brunch menu (except steak and eggs were $42 which was outrageous).  If you wanted the two-hour unlimited drinks you have to add an additional $25 to your meal which none of us was willing to do so we all just had water.  Our waiter comes over to take our orders.  Now mind you....two of us had the Eggs any style which was bacon, eggs and potatoes with a biscuit.  Two of us had the catfish with grits and eggs.  Now about the food......my plate had two measly pieces of bacon and I do mean measly, my potatoes were hard and the eggs with cheese were ok.  A plate was placed in the middle of the table with a small container of jelly, some kind of cane butter and ketchup.  I asked for regular butter but the waiter said they don't have that (have you ever heard of that in a restaurant??)  I was told the catfish and grits were eh.  The fish was good but the eggs and grits didn't hit the spot.  To top it off we paid $28 each which is overpriced, especially since none of us really enjoyed our food.At least the music was good......"
9/18/2018,2 star rating,"I wasn't that impressed.My sisters, niece and I went to Blvd Bistro one Sunday for brunch.  First of all the restaurant is small, VERY small and there isn't any place to wait.  They do have a small outside patio area but it was raining on the day we went so we couldn't sit out there.We placed our orders when seated - as I've stated the restaurant was very crowded and it seemed like they only had two maybe three waiters so needless to say they were very busy.  I ordered the catfish and grits my sisters ordered the catfish dinner and my niece had the french toast.  Our food was ok - nothing exceptional.  I was able to switch the grits for potatoes (I hate grits), the biscuit was really good but by the time the waitress brought the butter and jelly to go along with it I was almost done eating.  Same thing for the ketchup I asked for to accompany my potatoes, it took a long time to come.  My sisters said their food was ok - their sides (collards and potato salad) were REALLY small.  I tasted the potato salad, it was good but a little too much vinegar for my liking but all of our fish were luke warm - not as hot as it should have been.  My niece had a plate of french toast - about six large pieces, she said it was ok.  We each had a glass of mimosa with our meal.  Overall, the meal was a little pricey (almost $50 per person) for an entree and a drink and definitely not worth the price.  I'm glad I went but don't think I will be returning."
3/22/2021,5 star rating,My favorite spot for Brunch with my girls! The food is always top notch and the atmosphere and vibes are always impeccable! I love their shrimp and grits along with a good ol' Sangria! The owners are extremely friendly and approachable! I can not wait to return.
6/20/2021,5 star rating,This place was amazing nice vibe on a summer say it's kinda hot inside ... unfortunately the host with the lobster tattoo on her arm and green nails very unprofessional and not attentive at all  just poor entry service I should be greeted without a attitude she made it seem like she didn't want us there... get a better host
8/2/2021,4 star rating,"Let me tell you if your looking for a soulfood atmosphere, with amazingly crafted drinks look no farther. Excellent service the waitress made sure are time and money spent was worth it. One of the greatest places in Harlem. We ordered the steak which was made to the wellness. After the pie was scrumptious. No need for a doggy bag."
11/10/2019,3 star rating,Honestly? I think it's gotten a bit too hyped. It's good... but not that good. The biscuits are dense and everything on the menu is a few dollars more expensive than it should be. The drinks also verge on the sweet side without much room for variety.
10/13/2020,5 star rating,"I had the time of my life at BLVD in the early Fall - the Blvd was blocked off and there was socially distanced brunch dining on the street, complete with a DJ. People looked happy dining and doing the electric slide on the street, having a blackity-black time. What a vibe. Food was okay, drinks were AMAZING. I had the Crab Cake Benedict and enjoyed it very much. One of my friends had eggs she didn't enjoy at all, but agreed that the rest of our meal was good. Most importantly: my friends and I lived our best lives with the drinks infused with moonshine-soaked fruits. Don't underestimate those! I can't wait to stop by again!"
2/3/2020,4 star rating,I came here after having dinner across the street just to grab a drink. This restaurant is cute and had a nice chill ambiance. My bartender Malik (very friendly and funny) made us some delicious sangrias. The drink had a nice kick and was flavorful filled with delicious fruits. This place is spacious and their is a back area that will be perfect for private events. I'll come back to try other drinks and food.
2/21/2020,4 star rating,"I came here on a Wednesday night and wasn't too busy but I could tell that this place has the potential to be a very busy spot. We got the southern fried chicken dinner, shrimp and grits as well as the Mac and cheese to share. Did we need all that food between two people? Nope. But we are greedy and not afraid of it. The fried chicken was amazing. It was perfectly seasoned with a crunchy outside and juicy deliciousness outside. The shrimp and grits was the top winner. These are the best grits I've had in my life. I will definitely be back for these grits. The only disappointment was the Mac and cheese. It was lukewarm and not that memorable. I also felt like it was overpriced for the value. I washed this all down with sangria and I have to say one of the best I've had since I went to Barcelona last summer."
10/18/2020,5 star rating,"Had so much fun at this spot last night. The food is sooo good!! We had ribs, meatloaf, chicken, biscuits, Mac, literally everything lol but no one had complaints about any of it. The drinks were also tasty and strong.

5/3/2021,5 star rating,"Great old school hip hop and and R& B music  and food is amazing. Had the fried chicken , biscuit and mac and cheese. Everything was very tasteful and it came with a delicious red sauce  for the chicken (mild) , a  sweet butter for the biscuits and the best strawberry jam I ever had. The mimosa is delicious, made with fresh orange juice."
8/25/2020,4 star rating,Due to Covid they had outside seating available. My friend and I were unaware of needing reservations but luckily they were able to seat us. Original we were seating again the wall but an air conditioner from the apartments above condensation leaked on us. We got moved over but our table was on a slant.. It was a little annoying but we made the most of it. There is a scan so the menu can upload directly on your mobile device. Our waiter was very nice. We ordered a mimosa carafe and chicken and biscuits. The mimosas were strong and good. Originally we didn't think the chicken and biscuits would be enough but it was very filling. Very tasty. The food was placed in Togo containers and the drinks in plastic cups. They also had a DJ so the music was good as well. I def would return.
3/19/2021,4 star rating,"BLVD Bistro you are most certainly remarkable, I had a wonderful experience here yesterday. What a cute place. They really know how to prepare Double Cut Pork Chop. It was perfectly made. Absolutely incredible. Their workers were all so nice and attentive. Overall, I think that this is an awesome spot."
6/13/2021,4 star rating,I've been a fan of BLVD bistro for 8-9 years. Hearty portions- rightly priced. Lately the music has been loud - like can't hear yourself talk LOUD. I guess the changing the scene for a new demographic. BLVD Bistro used to attract a more relaxed nature crowd. But I'm THERE for the shrimp and cheese grits!! Still a fan.

9/22/2018,4 star rating,"So I had this place book marked for quite some time and since I was in the area, I decided to check it out. Although I heard this was a great spot for brunch, I came here during there lunch (almost close to dinner) time. As I walked up, the hostess was standing outside and immediately showed me to where I could be seated. The place is small but quaint. The staff was very friendly and attentive. There were nice pictures on the wall of the restaurant and beautiful photos in the bathroom projecting Black Renaissance which I LOVED!While you wait for your food, the server provided you with biscuits that were really good! I only ordered a drink here and the ""Lobster Bisque"" which was quite filling. I planned on going to another restaurant and happened to come across this one which is the reason why I did not order an entree. This is also the reason why I gave it 4 stars because I did not get a chance to try there brunch or dinner, however I would come back. Ps- this restaurant is literally walking distance from the 125th downtown area which makes it very convenient for eating."
9/14/2019,4 star rating,"First time at the new location. BLVD is consistent -- food is always good, service always friendly and professional. We didn't have a reservation and were told by the very friendly host that a table would be ready in 15-20 minutes; we were also offered seats at the bar if we didn't want to wait. We decided to wait for a table, and one became available in only 10 minutes or less. My daughter and I both got the southern dinner with fried chicken, plus a side of biscuits. Our meals came out so quickly that we hadn't even got our drinks yet! They give you a 3-piece mixed serving of chicken, which is quite ample. It comes with collard greens and potato salad, both very tasty. I can't remember the names of our specialty cocktails and I don't see them on the online menu, but they were yummy and not stingy on the alcohol! One of them was mango puree and tequila and the other was raspberry puree, vodka, prosecco. I can't remember our server's name now, but he was a sweetheart, as were the hostess who took our names, the man who seated us, and the host who was floating the dining room. Thanks for being here for Harlem, BLVD Bistro."

8/31/2019,5 star rating,"I came here for brunch and we made a reservation for 10:30am because my daughter informed me that the place gets really crowded. Our waiter was Solomon - can't write a review without mentioning him. He was an excellent waiter.For brunch I ordered the homemade buttermilk sandwich (bacon, eggs & cheese). It came out nicely plated with a little jar of fruit preserves. It was 2 sandwiches on the plate. The biscuits were nice and soft with flavor. The bacon had a nice sweetness to it that went well with the eggs and cheddar cheese.I also ordered a side of cheddar cheesy grits - can't come to Harlem without ordering the grits. The grits was really good, nice and thick with a lot of flavor. I didn't add a thing to the grits and it was delicious. For my drink I ordered the bottomless Bellini. I think they just started the bottomless drinks because it wasn't programed in the cash register. I had one carafe of the Bellini since it was early. The Bellini taste really good, it was a great mixture. It was worth the price.My suggestion is to make a reservation and to come early to avoid a long wait."
2/13/2021,5 star rating,"BLVD Bistro, in my opinion, now holds the crown for best soul food in the city. The environment was modern and vibrant with great music. Our waiter Conrad was a great help in navigating the menu as well. The drinks were unique and tasty. But the thing that sealed the deal was the food!!!! The suasage gravy, chicken, eggs, everything was outstanding! I will be back on my next weekend venture to NY for sure."
6/13/2021,3 star rating,"I visited BLVD Bistro today for the first time, a friend recommend it. I had a 4pm reservation. It's apparently an 'It Spot' as it was packed with patrons. The music was on point but was so loud that you had to shout to be heard. We were seated in one of the pods outside but before being seated our temperatures were not taken and contact information was not taken. (Maybe they're not doing that anymore). The waiter was not the most pleasant and initially had a bit of an attitude. My friend and I ordered a drink each that came in a small plastic cup instead of a glass and we were still charged $16 dollars. We orderef the fried chicken dinner with potato salad and collard greens. The potato salad was really good but the greens were salty and the yams were hard as if they were not boiled/cooked long enough. Overall the experience was okay but I was not too satisfied with my food."
6/11/2021,5 star rating,"Stopped into BLVD Bistro and all I can say is I'm a huge fan. The service was incredible, the food delicious, and the atmosphere was really energetic. I'll definitely be adding to my favorites in Harlem. If in the neighborhood, stop in for a delicious meal."

10/27/2019,3 star rating,"Unsalted fried catfish. Was there for brunch. But the grits and cheddar cheese with poached egg was good- but how can you go wrong with that. My husband said the French toast was one of the best he ever had- really sweet, if you're into that.The biscuit was amazing. I'd like to go back and try the fried chicken but if they don't salt the catfish I'm scared about the chicken."
3/7/2021,5 star rating,Great Fried  Chicken and the collard Greens are a must. The apple goat salad was a great size ans can be shared.  Then let's talk about those warm biscuits with the honey butter Baby. I will need a 45 min session on my peloton tonight.  Great space music and service brunch menu has a great selection as well.  .
11/23/2021,5 star rating,"I haven't been back here for almost two years due to California living, and I miss the food and vibe. Sunday brunch includes gospel tunes and great food. Blueberry pancakes that almost float off your plate, good coffee and great service from a hard working team. You're my NYC tradition, hope to see you soon."

11/18/2021,5 star rating,"I had the best experience at this restaurant today. From the host who remembered to politely ask for proof of vaccination to the most delightful server, Brendon. But, the sign says it all, ""BISCUITS ALL DAY""!  Delicious. I was equally impressed with the individual cups that our condiments were served in.  No need to worry whose hands had touched it-unlike most ketchup/hot sauce bottles!  I will most certainly be returning! Oh and the ""Catfish Po'Boy was really good, too!"

4/5/2021,5 star rating,"Oh my goodness. I had brunch on Easter Sunday. I ordered the shrimp with cheese grits. Absolutely delicious. Kudos to their hostesses, servers, floor walkers ( don't know their real title)  to make certain that all is going well, chefs and overall staff. My only drawback was the music was rather loud so it was hard to converse with others at your table. You were forced to speak loudly. Drinks were outstanding, nice and strong. My overall experience was excellent. I will definitely be dining there again. This time I'll try the fried catfish. Thanks Blvd Bistro. Keep doing what you're doing."
11/4/2019,3 star rating,"The food is delicious well seasoned. Its good soul food! The shrimp and grits were delicious! However the biscuits were served cold and a tad hard. I reiterated to the waitress I wanted warm batch and again, I was served cold biscuits Try and make a reservation it's sometimes full.Over all it's a good restaurant to if you're really hungry."
9/11/2021,5 star rating,Food was awesome but I recommend just making an early reservation because the Later in the day the longer it takes to be seated and your reservation might be sabotaged as sometimes people sit for longer than the 1.5hr time limit.
9/9/2021,5 star rating,"I really liked this place. Great music, live atmosphere, great people. The food is pretty good too. The only thing I wasn't pleased with was the cinnamon biscuits--they were dry. The wait was somewhat long, but that's okay because there's enough to do in the area to pass the time. Also the Ronald Draper art installation outside of the restaurant makes for a great photo op!"

1/24/2021,5 star rating,"C'mon Shrimp & grits...with a buttermilk biscuit!! Omg sooooooo good! The best shrimp & grits in NYC in my opinion. The DJ is always on point during brunch. I love it here. The owner & his wife are sweethearts. The manager Trent is a joy, love him! We have a favorite server, I feel bad because I don't remember his name...but he's Hispanic, petite yet powerful:) His service is the BEST. This is one of my go to restaurants in Harlem...where are we going? To BLVD bistro period! No regrets ever. Bellinis are delicious and STRONG."
2/28/2021,5 star rating,Went to brunch here and had so much fun! They had a live dj playing bomb music. Their food is so good and you can get a carafe of alcohol too with your meal. I got the omelet and my bf got the shrimp and grits. Both were amazing! We tried one of their moonshine mixed drinks and it was delicious. Highly recommend this spot. Both the atmosphere and the food/beverages are very good! :))
10/17/2021,1 star rating,I usually go to this restaurant all of the time. I love the food and USUALLY I receive amazing service. I actually was so hyped to be there. However this time my friend found a rubber band in their food and at first we were assuming the best because we speak with the owner often and always have a great time. However our food was not compensated and the new manager SHANNON was so unbelievably rude. Her Whole approach gave the energy like she felt like we were trying to get free food I am like ma'am every time I'm in Harlem I support BLVD bistro. It was the saddest experience because we deeply respect the owner and his business. They need to get rid of SHANNON ASAP she's not a good look for their business. A RUBBERBAND? There should be no discussion the food should be free. The waitress was great everyone was great but how that manager dealt with it. WOW disappointed
10/16/2021,1 star rating,"Disappointed.  The fried chicken was tasteless.  Service was very slow but waiter was very nice and had too many tables to wait.  I came to this place because I saw it featured on Dr. Oz and they raved about the biscuits, which were very good, but you had to pay for them.  Usually you get a basket of bread before your meal. Here you had to pay for it.  For the chicken,, you pay  for white meat like a fast food joint..  My meal cost $45 with no alcoholic drink, fried chicken, which came with potato salad and greens, which were okay, lemonade and biscuits.  Finally, there are two prices on your bill, one for cash and one for credit which is higher.  I don't know if all restaurants are doing this since COVID, but I was shocked and luckily we had cash.  Bottom line, for me, Boulevard Bistro gets a thumbs down."
3/13/2021,2 star rating,"The service was great! My waiter was funny and fairly attentive. The vibe is cool and music choices are pretty dope.But the food was lacking. I had the shrimp with grits, which was cold--first bad sign.Then the biscuit it came with was not only cold but hard and pretty flavorless.The Bellini was decent just needed to be stirred as the flavor was at the bottom. But unfortunately this was room temperature at best and not cold."
10/31/2021,5 star rating,"Such a welcoming, cool place. The food was delicious. I had the fried chicken dinner - so good and the collard greens were AMAZING! Yes, Red Rooster and Sylvia's are in the area, and I love them too, but this is a must brunch spot in Harlem!"

3/12/2018,3 star rating,"So, this place is cute. It's very small and they got as many seats as they could in there.  It was Sunday, so they were playing Gospel music - cool, but turn it down a bit - the volume made conversing a challenge. I had catfish and grits that came with a biscuit and eggs. It was DELISH!  The fish was perfectly fried with a light coating of corn meal and the grits were CREAMY with the right amount of cheese. The scrambled egg was perfectly cooked as well. The spiked sweet tea with prosecco was amazingly yummy.  The only negative re:the food was my biscuit. It was CLEARLY overdone (see pics). About 3/4 of the way through, a waiter asked us ifnhencouldnhave the extra chair at our table. It was holding our coats which he took to hang up. It meant that I hen had to get up, put my chair in the aisle so he could have it and then slide the other chair. Just an inconvenience in a crowded space."
11/19/2020,5 star rating,Delicious food in a safe environment.  Brought out water for my dog without asking.  Group of 6 felt comfortable and food is awesome.  Varied menu for brunch made everyone happy. Thanks for you efforts
10/23/2017,5 star rating,"The. Best. Grits. I've. Ever. Had. I'm still dreaming about the grilled prawns nestled in a bed of bacon and buttery grits. The texture was creamy but not mushy and everything came together in a wonderful symphony in my mouth.The greens here were also amazing. Yes, they came in a very small cast iron pan that looked cute but made me nervous because of how small it was. Did this dish belong in a miniatures cooking video? However, once I took a bite of it, the flavor was much bigger than than a hundred miniature cooking shows put together.The fish on corn plus honey was also a terrific blend of crispy, tender, juicy, dry, sweet and salty. The chef here does a beautiful job of highlighting contrasting notes without letting them fight with each other. Instead the flavors compliment each other wonderfully.Definitely more like $$$ for dinner, but well worth the experience. Will come back for the Mac and Cheese dish, because if it's anything like the grits, I'm sure it will be unbelievable."
11/5/2017,5 star rating,"Just had brunch here. Dang!!  That was good!!! It's a tiny little joint with a line out the door and for good reason. We went at 11am on a Sunday which was just about the right timing. When we left there was a huge crowd waiting. We ordered the pan fried chicken, banana pecan pancakes and macaroni and cheese. Holy crack a moly it's tasty!  The chicken was PHENOMENAL!  It's hard to make chicken that is thick and yet it's super moist and very flavorful. This chicken is all that and a bag o chips people. Sides were potato salad and greens. Both solid. My husband, a pancake connoisseur says that these pancakes might just be the BEST HE'S EVER HAD!  I tried them and concur. Super moist and packed with flavor. The Mac and cheese with bacon on top was also excellent. Service was awesome and the vibe was super cool. Overall you should hurry up and go get some brunch here!"
9/18/2021,1 star rating,"On Saturday evening 9/18/21, I waited over 10 minutes to be recognized after being seated. I'm assuming one of the owners or managers (male late 50s) waited on a table next to me even though I was seated first(it appeared he knew them). He had his back to me (he was sagging) to the point I read the brand of his underwear. He completely ignored me. I wanted to see how long I'd wait. I was given water by a young man who stated he wasn't my server after asking him. He said he'd get them. I waited approximately 7 minutes. Meanwhile the older manager came to check on the table next to me, further ignoring me. A couple sat on my other side and that manager tended to them, again ignoring me. I started to think I was either invisible or he had some unknown personal grip towards me. Finally, a waiter asked if I had been served and I said no. This waiter was pleasant in taking my order made a suggestion on beverages. I waited another 15 minutes for my food. I didn't receive any condiments for the food that was supposed to come with that particular meal. I waited another 7 minutes before getting my waiter's attention. When I finally received those required condiments, they were in a metal cup about the size of a silver dollar, (butter, syrup and jelly). I had to ask for more. The manager/possible co-owner checked on both table on my right and front ( me in the middle) never once acknowledging me. When It was time to get my check, I waited about 10 minutes ( napkin in my plate, manager/co-owner still tending to both tables. I finally got up went to hostess and said, I would like to pay. She located another manager as I was sitting down and that manager asked me if I needed my check and I said yes. I observed her talk to the other male manager/co-owner and I observed him saying and pointing to my waiter who was immersed in other things. Finally, the waiter came with the check and I pointed out that he did not delete the unsweetened lemonade. That little transaction took another 10 minutes. The waiter obviously forgot, walked past me and was serving customers outside. By this time, I made up my mind, no tip will be given, I will not spend another dollar at this restaurant and I will write a yelp review. It took another 5 minutes before I got the adjusted check. To say the least the service and lack of common/basic customer service was unacceptable and unprofessional by the waiter and the older manager/possible co-owner (sagger). The food on a scale of 1-10.... I rate it a 6. (Fried chicken and pancakes). The syrup and butter weren't at all tasty. Stick with regular butter and syrup. Hopefully, those two individuals will be better. Some how, I think It was kinda personal‍"
9/23/2020,4 star rating,"Those biscuits are AMAZING. Mac and cheese was on point! Vibe is nice, and I can't say enough about the great service. The one suggestion I would make to the chef/owner is the wings that are used HUGE. And while this sounds great, larger wings are generally from those that are low quality over fed mass produced chickens - which produce a ""rubbery"" texture to the meat. It may be ok for most (which is why I assume they still use them), but for those from a culinary background, will get sent back. I would happily pay $2 more if they used organic chicken."

9/6/2020,4 star rating,"So it dealt with social distancing. My waiter was very pleasant , however who saved the day was Malik (forgive me if I'm spelling his name wrong). Although my waiter was very pleasant he was very busy. Malik acted as a filler brought over our drinks (very well made , quality of brand is in question. I got an Amsterdam vibe) . The food: grits were the best I ever had in a restaurant setting. The pancakes while the effort was there it was an obvious fat content (butter or oil in batter) that took away from the potential fluff. It was also very pleasant to see the head waiter interact with patrons / bussing tables"
9/5/2020,5 star rating,"Staff was so sweet and everything was delicious! They have a great outdoor set-up. I had the watermelon goat cheese salad to start and shrimp and grits.

8/30/2020,4 star rating,"I came here with my fiancé for a nice night out, he picked here to eat. The interior of the restaurant looks nice with ranch style and a rustic look to it. Since we are in a pandemic, we were situated outside behind a bus stop. I'm not rating this however. To drink I ordered shrimp and grits and Chardonnay to drink. The meal was ok. I liked the jalapeño with the cheese and bacon bits. I just wish there was more shrimp. The biscuit that came with the meal was tasty with the maple butter they served with it. The staff were great as well, I can't wait until this pandemic is over, I would have loved to sit down inside. The decor really had me. The food and drink were served in take away pans. I understand why, but it doesn't make for a good photo lol."
8/29/2020,3 star rating,This was a really cool getaway for the night. There was ample seating along the sidewalk of the restaurant even though seating was off-limits inside you still got a really good experience being there. I got the fried chicken with biscuits and a side of mac & cheese. The fried chicken was very moist and hot so you can tell it was freshly made the biscuits were delicious along with their maple butter and the mac & cheese is very girly and cheesy just the way I like it I had a really good experience our waiter was super friendly and super cool. I definitely enjoyed being there and I will definitely go back when things clear out and we are back to normal once again
7/21/2019,5 star rating,"Okay so this restaurant is also worthy of its five stars. Great Service and well designed soul food!The portions are not gigantic designs to Stuff you face. The prices are on point with the quality of their food. The items that take time to make such as collard greens black-eyed peas, baked beans are presented with properly prepared Fried Chicken, shrimp and grits, and Sliders. What that means is that the chef knows exactly what he's doing in his kitchen and nothing's over cooked or sitting. This is a very important point when you're trying to get soul food especially from anywhere in Harlem.The importance of soul food is making sure to get things right with good timing. If a restaurant is struggling they may serve you food that's been sitting for awhile. Thank God that the Boulevard Bistro does not do that. Which means you get great food every time. Be sure to come here avoid all the other ones that have been around for 20 years serving you bad food.  Just because a restaurant has been here for 20 or 30 years doesn't mean it's good.Be sure to try the Blvd Bistro! Btw: Great service from David:)"
1/25/2020,5 star rating,What more can I say great to fantastic location and great ambience. The owners of this venue has scored a homerun in the restaurant game. Just the Couple of steps from the B C 116th St. station. You will just be overwhelmed by the fantastic comfort created here. Complimented by comfort foods that will rekindle memories of good food prepared by the families best cook. The owner is usually  present making sure they your experience is nothing less than  exceptional. I suggest  you come stop by when in Harlem to have you taste buds massaged with good food.
9/16/2018,3 star rating,I'm from the Area and that buzz is that this place has good food. I get there with reservations and still had to wait for 30 min.  The food takes at least an hour to get to you after you order so be prepared to have a long wait for food that will wow you less than the wait it took to get it. This place is truly over rated and should either change management and chef or close.

I visited a friend and we grabbed a quick bite here and I really enjoyed the atmosphere from beginning to end.

There was such a sense of community that is genuinely and truly Harlem."
8/12/2021,1 star rating,"The anticipation to visit this restaurant was completed with dissatisfaction, waited a few minutes for staff to take my order and the breakfast was a total disappointment. The platter came in a cast iron skillet , bacon was not cooked all the way it was limp and greasy , the eggs seem to have come from a pasteurized box and not a fresh cracked eggs, the home fries were more like mashed potatoes... I asked for steamed milk to accompanied my tea, the server look at me lost and bewildered of my request.. this place is more focused on playing loud music , than food !!!"

Creamy, full of flavor and the jalapeño & bacon were perfection as the shrimp. My stepson devoured the apple wood bacon and the Fried chicken which was delicious. The staff were excellent. Our server was knowledgeable about the food, and made us feel right at home. Another server was super nice to my stepson which made him feel better about eating the chicken with his hands :)All in all, fantastic!  Quality food, great atmosphere."
12/31/2019,4 star rating,"My husband and I are here in New York for our anniversary... So I was excited to see what Harlem had to offer. I am happy that we came across this cool little brunch spot! It was Sunday morning and as we entered the restaurant we immediately felt the Sunday morning vibes as Marvin Sapp gospel music was playing throughout the restaurant. The crowd was chill and later throughout the day the place was PACKED!! I even heard the hostess say that they were no longer accepting walk-ins....Reservations Only!!! The wait was 30 minutes but there was an option to be seated at the bar right away and I decided the latter was the best decision!! After being seated at the bar we were greeted with a super friendly bartender who encouraged us to do the Bottomless Peach Bellinis or Mimosas.  Bottomless Mimosas are $25 each and a single glass is $13.  My husband initially had a mimosa but asked to switch over to the Bellini bc the mimosa was bitter. The Peach Bellini was good..... not GREAT..... but good. Although the bartender encouraged us to go the bottomless route we had to hunt her down to get a refill!! But the bar was busy so I get it!! The bartender raved about the Chicken Fried Steak and the shrimp and grits. We are from down South so I know what good grits take like.... Surprisingly, the grits and eggs were the best part of my meal. The shrimp were pretty good too and were seasoned well. The Chicken Fried Steak was good but nothing to write home about. Overall our experience was very pleasant and this was a great start to our first day in New York!"

7/7/2020,5 star rating,I love the food here. Went here for brunch. Had some amazing drinks and a great conversation with the chef and owner. He is a great man and an amazing cook.I had the shrimp and grits plate with eggs and a biscuit. Everything was delicious! The grits were creamy and rich. The eggs were a perfect sunny side up and the shrimp was seasoned and cooked well. And dont get me started on the biscuit; I loved that biscuit! The portion was good. It was a brunch menu and included a pitcher. The drinks were made soooooo well. Worth every penny and j do appreciate a quality drink. Go give BLVD a try you wont regret it!
7/4/2020,5 star rating,"Had a 1 pm Saturday brunch at BLVD, and would definitely return for more! I had the catfish and grits while my husband had the pulled pork bbq sandwich, and we shared a Bellini carafe. The catfish and grits were the star of the show, SO delicious, it's no wonder they're so popular. The biscuit was also great with the sugar cane butter. Props to BLVD for the most sanitary outdoor dining situation I've experienced so far in the time of Covid-19, where you place an order at the front of the house so the servers minimize exposure to unmasked guests.Would absolutely come back, thanks for a delightful brunch BLVD!"

The first was shortly after I ran the NYC Marathon and although may memory was that it was delicious, I'm pretty sure I was still delirious with fatigue so my judgment was likely obscured.That said, I brought a good friend from out of town back for round two and happy to say BLVD did not disappoint. We both had the breakfast sandwich with potatoes, and the bottom less brunch, which were both incredibly satisfying and a great value for my dollar. They also had a DJ spinning great tunes as we all dined.I remember on the first post-marathon trip, my family from out of town was with me. A drink on the menu mentioned Mississippi, where I hail from, so we mentioned it to the waiter and he brought over the owners, a husband and wife. They were incredibly warm, hospitable, and we found out we new a few of the same people. Support businesses like these y'all, they're treasures.Go here fam."
5/24/2020,5 star rating,Just got some shrimp and grits with sangria. If this is heaven or my last meal...I am satisfied. Perfectly cooked shrimp with grits made with bacon and cheese and scallions. Thank you for this blessing. Please come and support this amazing restaurant.
5/5/2020,5 star rating,I took my wife to Blvd Bistro in Harlem a few years ago for Mother's Day and it was the best food I ever had in Harlem. The place was clean the decor and art work was beautiful and the smell of the food when I walk in the door was mouth watering. We ate we drank we talk can't wait to go get my takeout this coming Sunday damn u covid19 it won't stop us from getting our shrimp and grits. The staff is superb very attentive and professional love that place I highly recommend it

3/31/2020,4 star rating,"Arrived at BLVD Bistro around 1pm on a Sunday and let me tell you... this is clearly one of Harlem's go-to brunch spots on a Sunday afternoon (& tbh, now I understand why!)The vibe is clearly curated to appeal to their targeted audience and they do a great job doing just that. The DJ was on fire! & helped relieve the tension of our 1hr+ wait. (I do wish they had a better system with seating because it was getting pretty hectic.)We were seated and attended to by a young women whose name I cannot remember. (Now, I understand ya'll are busy and may have a lot going on... but there is no reason why she did such a bad job. She literally came back to our table twice asking for our order after we had already told her. Then she forgot what we told her, not to mention one order never came out!)Yes, the service from the waiter was bad. However, I the food and the quality of the food outshined that experience by far. The shrimp & grits are to die for! I ordered the crab cake Benedict and it was pretty good. The fried chicken and cheddar biscuits basket was also a hit. My friends both ordered Bellinis and said they were the best they've had. Not shocked as the food was really good. Definitely recommended, just wish the service was better!"
3/30/2020,2 star rating,"Listen ... I am writing this review because I've been triggered after watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. That's not to say that the kitchen here is a nightmare but the service was so horrible that I can't not say anything. It's been a month and a half since my visit, and I am still thinking about how bad this service was. Let me explain, I went on Valentine's Day, in which they were offering a seafood only prefixed menu (bad sign #1). We were sat down, and then proceeded to wait 45 minutes before the server came to take our order (bad sign #2). After waiting an additional, 25 minutes the server returned with only one drink (My date and I both ordered our own drink). We proceeded to wait another 10 minutes before asking about the missing drink and then had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get the missing drink (bad sign #3). Now let's get to the food, we waited approximately an hour and a half before the food came out, and when it did unfortunately one of the fish entrees was burnt and was missing the sauce on it (bad sign #4). After sending the dish back, we waited an additional 20-25 minutes for the new one to come out.All in all, I was there for a minimum of three and a half hours, the service wasn't great, the food was subpar, the only saving grace was the biscuits."
3/19/2020,5 star rating,Amazing food!!!... this is the first time in my adult life i order grits and it was so GOOOOOD! That was 5 O's because it deserves 5 stars. The Fish  and mac and cheese are good too the only thing i would say needs improvement is the drinks those are a bit on the soft side. I have tried 4 on the menu all the same. Overall the food and service are amazing. And make a reservation!!!
3/17/2020,2 star rating,"Arrogant, aloof and inattentive waiter made this experience a challenge. The shrimp and grits which have been great in the past was horrible. Stringy shrimp isn't pleasant.  My girlfriend's sangria was actually excellent.  Not recommended. Too many other excellent options nearby."
10/21/2018,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch on a Friday for one. Got seated right away after the hostess cleaned the table for me. I was indecisive about what I wanted being that everything was appealing. I settled for the Southern Dinner with chicken. It took around 20 minutes to be made (menu states this) since it's made to order which was fine to me. The food was very good, as other reviewers stated.I took away one star for the price of the food and service. The meal I ordered definitely wasn't worth $28 because of the portions. For $28, the sides should be a little bigger. The soft drinks are over priced as well, a glass bottle of sprite was $4. The other reason is that the hostess and waiter are the same person. Maybe they were short staffed the day I went but that's also very time consuming when one person is doing everything.The place is very small, so for days they are popular, be mindful of the wait time or RSVP!"
11/17/2018,1 star rating,Absolutely horrible service.  Entire party was served dinner and I waited 20 minutes for my order which I did not get. I asked for my order to go at this point and would like my dinner comped since everyone was finished and waiting for me.  The manager would only remove the appetizers from the bill which was much less than what my dinner was.  $36 for ribs and this sad excuse for a side dish.Absolutely do not recommend.
5/16/2021,5 star rating,"Literally my first Yelp review, but this place is worth all the praise. I'm originally from the south, Georgia/South Carolina/Tennessee, and their Shrimp and Grits has got to be one of the best interpretations I've ever had. No joke, don't walk but run to this place for food! Enjoy!"
7/3/2021,2 star rating,I went to Blvd a few weeks ago and was not pleased at all.  This was my 1st time visiting their new location since they moved a few years ago.  The food was mediocre compared my previous visits at their former location.  The Frose was not frozen at all and the atmosphere left much to be desired.  I would like to try one more time to make sure it was not an off day bc I have very fond memories of the dining at their old location.
12/1/2019,5 star rating,We went there to celebrate my sister's and my cousin's birthdays. We made a reservation for 25 and a few extra folks joined the celebration. The staff were wonderfully friendly and understanding. The food was delicious and a good time was has by all. Thank you Blvd Bistro for making this day a memorable one.
1/3/2019,4 star rating,"I always try to make it a point to stop by Harlem when in NYC. This was my choice this time around and it did not disappointed me. The place is located in the corner,  underneath a brownstone home. It  has few tables so I recommend you make reservations first. The service was a bit slow at the beginning but once the waiter came to take the order,  it was all good.  The fried chicken sliders are to die for.... do not miss it.  We were a bit disappointed with the 7 cheeses mac as we were expecting a creamier mac and cheese but nevertheless, it was good.  The place doesn't have liquor license so only beer, wines, champagne, sangria, etc.  We were told they will be moving to a bigger location soon so confirm location if you plan to visit in the future."
10/3/2020,5 star rating,"Went today for brunch with my sisters, we had a great time. From the food to the service everything was on point. We got lucky because we got there around 12 so there was no wait, we were greeted by Chef and his wife and they walked us over to our table within a few minutes. Our server Evan was attentive and friendly. We all got the catfish with different sides....there were no crumbs left. We also got the Apple and goat cheese salad to start and it too was delicious. Cannot wait to go back."
11/28/2016,4 star rating,"This was my favorite restaurant of this past week. Disclaimer- I was born and raised in the South so I know good Southern cooking... and I'm a fan!Look, is it as tasty as the real thing? No, of course not. This isn't my mom's or my family's cooking which has been honed over generations. BUT, the food is real good and it's very close to the real thing. In fact if you were in Memphis and you went out to a Southern-style restaurant, you could do a lot (a lot) worse than this spot.So, we actually went uptown to Harlem just to sample the fare here. The ambiance and service at this restaurant were pretty much perfect. I certainly felt that warm Southern hospitality, albeit NYC style.The warm biscuits with sausage gravy, sweet butter, and grape jam was perfect. I mean perfect. Maybe even the highlight of the meal.But the fried chicken dinner would certainly give the biscuits a run for their money. Perfectly fried and very tasty, with a side of excellent, eggy potato salad (with just enough mustard), and a decent collard green (which would've been perfect if it was prepared using pork instead of turkey, but hey everyone is health conscious nowadays).My brunch companion had the fried catfish which was actually also really good, but the fish was only lukewarm. Fried foods always need to be served hot. Something for them to work on... Add cheesy grits, restaurant quality scrambled eggs, and more biscuits and you got yourself a great meal.Certainly the best fried chicken and southern-style food we've had in NYC. Everyone should try it..."
10/20/2019,2 star rating,"I came here for a nice brunch with Association of Black Journalists fam from school and I was not impressed with the service. We had a reservation for noon, but I got here about thirty minutes early. After the rest of the fam got here, we had to wait for what felt like about an hour to be seated. After we got seated we had to ask for utensils which were not already on the table, (I don't know why you would sit anyone at a table without utensils.) Also the food, was not as great as I thought it would be. The food just didn't seem cooked enough, which made the wait before way worse. I ordered bacon (which looked uncooked) home fries (which were pretty good, not gonna lie) and over easy eggs that just didn't taste as good as I thought it would. The biscuit was delicious though. Also the portions were way too small and the prices were not great either.  We ended up having a good time regardless, but the experience would have been a lot better if whoever we made a reservation with was more prepared to have us. I definitely support my black businesses out here, but we have to do better than this!"
10/20/2019,5 star rating,"AH-MAZE-ING!!! 100's all around. This is my second time visiting the new location. I so happy they've upgraded to a larger space because it was so needed. The decor is so warm and welcoming. The cushion in the booths are firm but soft. The food, is the best!!! As a harlemite this is some of the best soul food in Harlem! Today I had the catfish with eggs and grits. OH EM GEE the gritssssss! Usually I hate grits but the grits here, just get them, trust meeeeeee! Creamy, flavorful and soooooo yummy! These are the grits I imagine they serve in heaven! They just got to be. Lastly, shout out to the manager Trent! He remembered me and my friend from our first time there. He greeted us like old friends and made sure we were satisfied (which we were beyond!) The staff here is so attentive, my glass was filled without asking. I highly recommend dining at BLVD bistro, your belly will thank you!"
6/20/2021,5 star rating,"I tried the Blvd In Harlem for the first time this Father's Day. I am a very picky eater so you know when you order your meal and it needs no salt, pepper etc you visited a winning establishment. I also give 5 stars to the Chef Carlos the food was amazing. The server Lashay was very pleasant and attentive."
6/19/2021,5 star rating,Black owned establishment food has always good service was on point music and drinks the best. Catfish Dinner is the best and there Biscuits the best I ever had. I always get extras to take home. Had an excellent time celebrating family members birthday. Thank you to Malik and his staff for making everything perfect the elders had a great time. You have to come here for brunch or dinner
9/14/2018,4 star rating,"This place is very nice. It's very small and cozy. Since I went on a Thursday night it wasn't so crowded. The service was really good and food is amazing. They give complimentary biscuits with honey butter before the meal. The servings may look small-average but it's not. I had to take some leftovers home. Their daily happy hour is perfect. My only complaint is they have no lights outside the restaurant and they have this awkward stair like pavement right outside. Since it was very dark and slippery from the rain, I almost fell. Besides that, I recommend this Harlem gem."
10/24/2020,5 star rating,"Extraordinary service, the waiters were all attentive to all the tables. The food was DELICILUS & strong drinks. I didn't expect to eat in foil pans but the food was well organized."
8/3/2019,4 star rating,"A nice brunch spot, casual but hip. For brunch on the weekends you will need to make a reservation as it was pretty packed when we came for brunch on a Sunday and here was an hour wait. I had the catfish and grits with scrambled eggs, it was perfection. Food was excellent but portions could have been bigger. Also, they only have one restroom for patrons to use in the entire restaurant, which was a bit inconvenient when you're ready to leave but need to make that stop and have to wait 20 minutes in a line. Still, food was good, loved the relaxed ambiance, service was attentive. Definitely worth returning to."
11/2/2020,5 star rating,"EXCELLENT!! My new favorite brunch spot! Everyone is masked and gloved. Dividers separated tables. Food served in disposable cartons for safety. Staff was amazing. I Went with my family to celebrate my daughter's birthday and everything was absolutely delicious!! We started with the wings which were finger licking good, literally. My mom had the steak and eggs. I tasted and we both agreed it was perfect. My daughter had the cheeseburger. She wasn't able to finish because it's a big portion. She took the rest home! She NEVER takes doggy bags and hates leftovers. I had the catfish and grits and it was pretty mind blowing. Grits were creamy and cheesy and flavorful. I don't usually do catfish but I was incredibly pleased. The chef and owner made rounds greeting customers which was a dope touch. To top it off they sing Happy Birthday to my daughter and gave her banana pudding. They made brunch memorable and super special for my family. Thank You so much BLVD!! I will be back very soon!"
5/28/2021,5 star rating,Took all the mothers and grandmothers in my family and they absolutely loved the food and atmosphere. BLVD is one of my favorite restaurants and it being black owned in Harlem makes it even more special.
6/30/2018,5 star rating,"This place was recommended to me for some good soul food in NY. I made the trip to Harlem after deciding it was worth a try. They have the menu outside in a glass case so you can get a feel for their options. There is a lunch and dinner menu with some differences. I walked in after finding the place and luckily it was not crazy since it was a weekday. But there were a find amount of guests dining in.  The seating area is very tight and cozy. At first I was waiting to be seated and thought no one saw me. Servers were busy going back and forth to tables bringing food. A gentleman saw me and got me a menu and a seat. Later on I realized he was the head chef... I sat next to a visitor from another state who apparently was sightseeing and Blvd was on her list of places to try. So to me that was definitely a good sign.My server was a polite and courteous person named Clarence. He made some recommendations and asked if I had eaten here before. According to him the place has the best soul food in NY. As a starter I was given a freshly baked biscuit to whet my appetite. I started with some organic chicken sliders served with homemade biscuits. Two nice pieces of chicken with cheese was a very good start to the evening. For the entree I decided on the catfish chicken dinner that was accompanied by smoked turkey collard greens and southern potato salad.  This dish takes a bit of time for prepare but it was worth the wait. I do not usually order catfish at all but wanted to try the southern dish. The sauces that came with were a standard tartar sauce and something called African fire sauce. Yeah the name said it all. The sides were very tasty, especially the potato salad. The catfish was very savory and fried just right. Since I was only one person I was limited on the amount of dishes I could try. The macaroni n cheese and pulled pork sandwich that another table has ordered looked very good as well. But I had to make sure to save room for dessert. Clarence recommended a very thick and rich chocolate cake which was a good finish to a great meal. Awaiting Clarence was another helpful gentleman. The ambience is dark and I had to use a mini light to make sure the food photos were good. I just recently found out that a scene from Luke Cage S2 was filmed at the location on Lenox/Malcom X Blvd. what better way to represent Harlem. This is definitely a place I would go back to because I need try the other delicious menu options and I appreciated the customer centric service that I experienced and witnessed while observing the other tables. Before I left I shook the hand of Chef Carlos and thanked him for the great food."
9/1/2019,2 star rating,"My first time in this restaurant. Ambience was very nice. Service was good. Wait time was short. Food and drinks were good. We had the catfish with greens and potato salad. Greens were very good.The potato salad was bland and was certainly not soul food potato salad. I was born and raised in an African American household. I am well aware of ""soul potato salad"" and what was served to us was not it. I was very surprised and disappointed since everything else was so nice.Best of luck to the restaurant. I enjoy seeing a business run by people of color in my neighborhood. Please continue to refine the potato salad.Olivia"
10/1/2019,2 star rating,"I had high hopes for this late Saturday night dinner but unfortunately it was pretty lackluster. When we first were seated, our waiter told us the bar was closed and we wouldn't be able to order any special cocktails. My experience has been usually that the kitchen closes before the bar so I was pretty confused. I can't imagine what Harlem restaurant opened for dinner on a Saturday evening would discourage patrons from ordering overpriced cocktails, but touché. The manager must have sensed our confusion, because the same waiter came back shortly and corrected himself stating we could order cocktails. Not wanting to risk the bartender purposely messing up the drinks, we settled for glasses of wine instead.  The complimentary biscuits and butter were somewhat stale and given to us with no utensils. It took several minutes to get the waiter's attention as he purposely ignored our attempts to get him to come to our table despite there being only one other couple dining at the restaurant. More disgusting was the butter it was served with which clearly had been left out un-refrigerated and congealing. We ordered the shrimp and grits and turkey meatloaf as our entrees. The shrimp and grits came with cheese and jalapeño bits. The shrimp were a bit over cooked, and the dish could have been enhanced with leftover liquid/gravy from the shrimp. The seasoning was okay, not too salty. The cheese was not that appetizing. I can forgive lackluster food, maybe it was an off night. But the lack of hospitality shown by the waitstaff is worrisome. If you don't want to serve customers, then just say the kitchen is closing. But welcoming us in and then giving such piss-poor service is stupid and made way more of a lasting negative impression."

1/18/2021,4 star rating,"This restaurant is outdoor dining friendly! They have heated igloos (I call them) or a makeshift tent with heaters! The food was great , I had the catfish, grits(really creamy) eggs and biscuit. I also had the moonshine punch which was exceptionally good as well!

My boyfriend and I are visiting from Los Ángeles and are staying near this restaurant.OUR ORDER-shrimp and grits $28-mac and cheese $20-Harlem beer- $8The servings were pretty small and the food was ok, but not $20+ dollars worth. I've had soul food before but never had food this greasy, it was really off putting. Sadly, I really didn't find anything exceptional with the food."
7/19/2019,5 star rating,"This was hands down the best brunch in NYC. Wow! If you're planning to visit on a Sunday, I recommend making a reservation. I made a reservation on Saturday for Sunday brunch and was able to get a late morning reservation. However, without a reservation the wait didn't seem longer than about 40 minutes.I ordered the Catfish and Grits, which the waiter said was most popular. My Mom ordered the Blueberry pancakes with additional sides of cheese grits and bacon. We were BLOWN AWAY by how amazing our food was! My Catfish and Grits came with two (2) crispy pieces of catfish, eggs, cheese grits and a biscuit. I'm still shook. My catfish was not fishy tasting or greasy at all and was cooked to perfection. I am not a fan of eggs at all but my scrambled eggs with cheese were the fluffiest and best tasting eggs I've ever had. The cheese grits tasted like they were made in Heaven with cream instead of water and a fine, high quality cheese. And the biscuit was good! The Catfish and Grits may possibly be the best brunch meal I've ever had. I think I'll need to go back and have it again to confirm.. lol! My Mom loved how light and fluffy her pancakes were with fresh blueberries. The syrup tasted homemade. The bacon could have been crispier. She ordered the cheese grits after one bite of mine and just had to have her own. Absolutely delicious!We met the Owner/Chef Carlos. He was very friendly, humble, and left us wanting to support his establishment even more. He recently relocated the restaurant to Frederick Douglass Blvd/116th which is a very short walk from 125th and very conveniently located right off of the 1 train. I cannot wait to come back to this restaurant esp. since Travel Noire credited this restaurant with having the best Shrimp & Grits in NYC. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great brunch in NYC!"
10/9/2019,4 star rating,"So I've came here a few times, the first time I came the wait was crazy but the service was amazing. They moved quickly to make things happen, so me and my husband was seated quicker than we expected. The food was amazing, my husband said the shrimp and grits were the best he had so far. The 2nd time I came here I made reservations, my 2 best friends wanted to treat me to a nice meal. This was theirs 1st time here and they were crazy over the biscuits and honey butter. The drinks were pretty good ( I wish they had better drink specials for brunch ). Now they have a new location with more space. Came here with my hubby for after work date, this was out 1st coming on a weekday. I ordered the 7 Mac and cheese and he came for those shrimp and grits. I was a little disappointed with the Mac n cheese, it was oily and chard too much so it gave it a burnt taste. So I won't be ordering that again. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious ( I wish it came in a bigger wine glass based on the $14 price). The service was amazing and I was so happy they finally got a larger space to accommodate how busy they get. Even though I wasn't happy with my Mac and cheese, I still will come and try other things on their menu."
12/9/2018,5 star rating,"This is my second time here and I wanted to come back bc the food was so good. Came here to celebrate my bday with my 2 friends. I made reservations for 2:15, we got there a little early and it was packed. The young lady explained the wait can be from 15-30 mins. She was so nice I couldn't even be mad. We got seated around 2:20 which isn't bad at all. Our waitress was amazing and helpful. The food here is so good, I ordered the catfish and grits. My 2 friends order the crab cake and eggs. We also ordered the spiked lemonade. We all enjoyed our food and cleared our plates lol. We even ordered biscuits to go. The only thing this place is missing is a bottomless brunch options. If you're in Harlem this is a must."
4/15/2021,4 star rating,Their shrimp and grits are amazing! I like the coleslaw and biscuits as well. This was a go-to evening spot during the craziness of the pandemic last year. I enjoyed outdoor dining in the street when they closed off the road to pedestrians although it was cold out. The other two times I enjoyed indoor dining. All three times I enjoyed the food. Their drinks are decent and the service is always great. I'll be back again this year I'm sure!
10/5/2019,4 star rating,I had the Blvd with catfish (you can also order fried chicken with collard green (w/turkey) and potato salad (I substituted baked beans (no pork). Catfish was good and 3 pieces! We had an extended wait for a large party of 15 people.however they made good on it.
11/5/2016,5 star rating,"I had gone there this afternoon with the strong anticipation of having another one of their scrumptious hamburgers (I went there twice before  and had them and the place was packed). I saw that the woman at the next table had the fish, grits, eggs and biscuits and it looked and smelled so good that I changed my mind and order several times in my head. The smell coming from the next table was so wonderful that my taste buds took over my soul and ordered my brain to change its mind. ""Me, want that fish plate instead of the hamburger."" it kept telling me over and over. My tongue won out and so the fish plate it was.When that food plate arrived I could barely wait to add some of that sweet butter on the cheese flavored grits. Everything was more than spot on. I'm glad that my brain (for the lovely hamburger) lost out to my tastes buds that afternoon. Next time I go there for the food I might have inner-self, duke it out between the Crab Cake dish against the Burger. I'll be the winner just for going to Blvd. Bistro whether my mind, nose or tongue wins out.By the way without the reservations, my friend and I hadda wait on the sidewalk for 14 minutes to get in. A tell tale sigh that the joint is popular.Wondervah!"
8/28/2020,4 star rating,The only reason I'm giving 4 stars because the server reached into my lap to take a look at my mask.    It made me so i'm comfortable I love this place and I was on a date with my husband and it was so disrespectful and I felt so low apologize to my husband even though I shouldn't have... and address the server he then apologize. I let him kno that wasn't acceptable . I will be returning.  The food is great.   Happy hour is fantasy
5/1/2021,5 star rating,The food is GREAT!  The fried chicken and the potato salad took away all of guilt of breaking my diet.  The lemon pound cake is something to talk about.  I have already told several family members around NYC that they have to make their way to this jewel of true southern cooking.

It's also on the corner of a busy intersection, so outdoor dining is crowded by others walking by.

All of our meals were to die for.  The Crabcake Eggs Benedict = yummy!!  The Bacon, Eggs and Biscuit = yummy!!  The Shrimp and Grits = yumilicious!!  The chef was very visible, making sure those dining were enjoying their meals.  The Bottomless Sangria definitely snuck up on me, next visit, I am sticking to one (1) Sangria.  Lol!!  Can't wait to go back."

The location is perfect, food is perfect.  We had a sampling of the food and omg..I needed a bigger plate and pot.  The BEST Catfish I've ever had! Seasoned just right. The Collard Greens...I needed a pot WITH the pot liquor! Fried chicken, not overly seasoned, crispy! Potato salad reminded of my grandmothers..yummy and the biscuits....I almost thought it was a light cornbread but when I bit into it..I've never had a biscuit so light and airy. Too bad I live in VA, I surely would hit this spot at least a couple of times a week!  We also had an opportunity to meet the owner!"
4/26/2021,5 star rating,"We came here on a Friday night and got the private little greenhouse/booth outside. Everything was so delicious, we were in a food coma afterwards. We ordered the biscuit with sausage gravy which was huge, then I had the ribs with candied yams and my girlfriend got the fried chicken, both of which were amazing, as were the cocktails. The side of fries was a little small for $8 but our waiter Malik B offered to give us a few more, he was fantastic all night. We will definitely be coming here again!"

Unfortunately, an hour before our reservation, we received a text from a personal phone number noting they were closed for the day. I've enjoyed the food here in the past but the lack of professionalism on this occasion means I won't return."
6/9/2019,4 star rating,BLVD bistro is the perfect example of a Harlem gem. If you're looking for a new local brunch spot or happen to be in the neighborhood for a good eat this place will do the job. The service didn't seem to be the most attentive but don't let that deter you from the amazing food. My friend and I shared the chicken and biscuits and blueberry pancakes and I would highly recommend. You can tell this food is made with care and attention to detail I.e. even though they were busy and their machines were down - the food was still 10/10. Added bonus: sangria is amazingly made If you're thinking of stopping by- do it you won't be disappointed
2/13/2016,5 star rating,"I am currently trying to figure out what took me sooooo long to finally have a meal at the fine establishment.  My hubby and I woke up early on Saturday craving just a good brunch.  We wanted to keep it local and stay in Harlem and I have been dying to try BLVD Bistro.  We arrived around 10:30 on a cold Saturday morning and they had just opened up at 10am for brunch.  Walked in to the establishment and we were greeted by the staff immediately and seated.  It is not a large space inside and I wouldn't recommend bring a large party...unless you have reservations.  I did notice there had seating outside for warmer months (which I look forward to).Anywho...Immediately walking into the place they had a very easy going and inviting atmosphere.   There were about 3 other tables seated having brunch and such a diverse group of people there partaking in brunch.  Our server, Tracey (I believe :), came over to our table to introduce himself and ask if we wanted a beverage to start.  My husband and I both decided on mimosas and my husband inquired if it was any unlimited mimosas specials.  There is no unlimited mimosa specials and in which I was sad at first but then after having our food I understood why.  My husband ordered bacon and french toast and I ordered the home fries with the biscuit breakfast bacon sandwich.Our food arrived in a timely manner and definitely faster than I anticipated.  I was so excited to dig in I almost forgot to take some decent pics for you Yelpers.   So lets talk about this biscuit breakfast sandwich real quick.  Its scrambled eggs, aged cheddar, and your choice of turkey or pork bacon.  It WAS HEAVENLY and I am almost positive Jesus came down to 122nd and Lenox and made it himself.  YES, it is that good and I will probably ending up craving it OFTEN.  The blending of the eggs, cheese, and bacon was just so smooth.  And the biscuit is out of this world.  The home fries were delicious and seasoned well. Now real quick back to the unlimited mimosas issue. After eating and indulging in the food I can understand why they would not have it,YOU COME HERE FOR THE AMAZING FOOD and not the drinks.Lastly, one thing about me when you claim to have southern roots and have a restaurant in NYC I will google to inquire about your roots. During my google search I found out the Executive Chef and co-owner is from Mississippi.  So I had set my expectations high for this establishment AND HONEY THEY KNOCKED IT OUT THE PARK. It is rare the first time you go to a restaurant you enjoy the food, the service, and the atmosphere.   The entire time I was there they were playing all of your FAV 90 R&B SONGS. ALL OF THEM!  What is better than enjoying good food while hearing music that keeps you moving in your seat???YOU GOT YOURSELF A NEW REGULAR BLVD BISTRO!!!!!!!"
7/29/2019,5 star rating,"BLVD Bistro deserves all 5 stars! The food was great, the music was perfect, servers and hosts were friendly and attentive. I had such a great time. My family and I came in two weekends ago for brunch and we enjoyed every bit of it. I ordered the southern dinner (yes, for brunch) and it was so good and filling! Everyone else had either shrimp and grits, the blueberry pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon, or the steak and eggs. Everyone cleaned their plates and if they didn't then someone else cleaned it for them! We also ordered a pitcher of mimosa which was great and made with freshly squeezed oj. I'm def going to be coming back"
6/2/2018,2 star rating,"I visited BLVD bistro today for my first time after living in Harlem for a couple of years. The place has a lot of unfulfilled potential. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. But that's it. Complete absence of kitchen ventilation makes place smoky and my tearing eyes were refusing to stay open. The only advantage I found in this fog is the mandatory laundry of everything I was wearing, include my sunglasses, once I'm getting home. I ordered Fine Herb Omelet and Cheese organic eggs, white aged cheddar cheese, served with home fries (pic is attached) for $16.Unfortunately, the only herbs"" I found in it was 1 little leaf of parsley, which you can barely find on the picture. Home fries were definitely dry and burned and a crispy taste of coal made a great combination with omelette's imaginary herbs. All this for $16 ... After paying a bill I paid a visit to the restroom, which welcomed me with a dozen flies in the air. The End."
8/25/2018,4 star rating,"I enjoyed dining at BLVD Bistro! I came at a really relaxed time (6pm) and the server was not very attentive given there were not many people inside. We had to keep flagging him down to take our order, get water, and our bill. But he was friendly when he did come over! Only reason this place is not 5 stars.Overall, the food was amazing! I love love love the biscuits they have here and are probably the best I have ever had in NYC. The butter marmalade that accompany the biscuits is to die for. I had the fried okra for a starter, it wasn't cut into small pieces like it typically is, but regardless it was still pretty good. They were very crisp and seasoned well. I also had a watermelon and feta salad which was great even though it wasnt like the southern food they offered. Definitely would reccommend for some great food."
9/6/2019,3 star rating,"Went for happy hour .. I tried all the specialty drinks & would definitely come back to drink. I ordered the wings and it was something about the special chef sauce I did not like ‍ The wings put me off so I didn't try anything else to extend the disappointment. I should have tried the fried chicken sliders instead, next time!"
3/3/2018,2 star rating,"Food portion was a bit small (especially considering the price.) But the quality was pretty good. I had an egg dish and there were bits of shells in the sandwich which was a bit unpleasant.The service was hot and cold. It started with me entering the (relatively empty) restaurant... I was seen, but ignored for a while. After my presence was finally acknowledged and I was seated, my server - Star - was a bit short with me. I was very thirsty and another worker never minded to come and hit me with a refill (I made him make a few trips, but he came with a smile.)I liked the music selection. Not sure if I will return, especially with a lot of other options near the area (some that I haven't tried and some that I want to try again.)"
6/15/2019,3 star rating,"Welp, I was thoroughly disappointed. I wanted to be really excited for the new location but I don't think BLVD is quite ready as they are clearly still trying to figure things out. 1) My reservation was at 1:30pm. I was not seated until 2:30pm. 2) Ordered TWO eggs any style and received ONE egg. 3) The Host, while nice, was extremely overwhelmed. 4) Where is the manager? 5) You can actually see the annoyance on the waiters face trying not to rage quit. After this experience, I'd actually like to offer my services. I truly believe I could turn this place around. The best thing about this place was Marquise. He was attentive, he kept calm under pressure and checked in regularly to ensure my overall experience was less shitty"
8/12/2018,5 star rating,To me BLV bistro is the best brunch spot in Harlem.I do adore their blueberry pancakes and their burger. The biscuit is also very good!If you go on a weekend it's usually packed 1-2h wait but you can leave them your phone number and they'll text you once your table is ready!Place is small and cozy with some outside seating as well and the staff is very nice and friendly!I took a lor of people there and recommended to plenty of friends and clients!

10/8/2020,5 star rating,"The food is real, full of flavor, authentic African American with that touch of southern root delicious!  When you can make a pork chop crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and full of flavor you are doing your thang'.  This place has it all and it is reasonably priced."
4/5/2021,1 star rating,I came in with my friend to celebrate her birthday around 12:15 and no body was there to greet . There was somebody in the back where the kitchen was the music was loud . I went back there to get his attention and nothing . He completely ignored us . So we finally left and went across the street to the tavern and had a great time .  This place was just very rude .
10/4/2020,2 star rating,"I want to love BLVD so bad, but they keep disappointing me. I love that they have a live DJ, and its the reason I want to go esp now during COVID. But its such a hit or miss experience. Some days the food is absolutely amazing, but I never know what I am going to get. Unfortunately, today was my last straw. We arrived at 5:30 and were seated at 5:40; PERFECT (no complaints) we did not get our food nor drinks until 7PM when the restaurant closes. We decided to pack the food and eat it at home. Only to discover that they DID NOT give us the biscuits that are meals should come with. The ONE thing I look forward to is the BLVD biscuits. So disappointed. All I wanted was my biscuits. I understand its COVID and the business is trying to bring in as much cash as possible before it gets cold, but they need to seriously consider what their kitchen has the capacity to do and focus on providing excellent customer service. Now Im just eating my steak and eggs biscuit-less."
8/14/2020,1 star rating,"So my experience at this restaurant was trash food was okay and I waited over an hour for my food. When asked to speak to a manger to see what they could do for the wait, they offered me free drinks. I don't want free drinks when I don't have anything in my stomach. I want money off my bill that you guys had me waiting for."
1/19/2020,2 star rating,"Blvd. Bistro took over for Street Bird and it's an incredibly busy for Sunday brunch. So busy that despite having a reservation for 1:30 my wife and I didn't get seated until 1:55. No apologies were given or anything like that. They didn't seem to care that they sat us nearly half an hour after our reservation time.We got the fried chicken and biscuit basket and the pancakes with caramalized banana. The basket came right away and I thought that was great until I realized why: it had been sitting out for some time, you know like they do at KFC. The biscuits crumbled really easily and they didn't think to give us butter or jam. They were pretty dry. The chicken was ok, but would have been crunchier if they fried it fresh. For $22 a expect a fresh made meal. If it was still Street Bird I would have paid $16 for it and it would have been made to order. The pancakes were light and fluffy. They weren't very sweet, though. They made those fresh. It's really loud inside. The music is blasting like it's a night club so everyone is shouting and with bottomless drinks it just gets louder. Street Bird was a lot more chill, the food was always fresh, was better and cheaper. Oh well, won't be coming back here again."

3/10/2018,5 star rating,"Wow I'm in heaven. . Came on a Saturday around 1 and the wait was about half an hour. Put my name down and they texted me as soon as it was ready. Had a sangria and my friend had a Bellini. Not too sweet and not too tart!! $12 each. (No boozy brunch) Also had the catfish and grits with over easy eggs ($24), crab cakes Benedict plus a side of turkey collard. I honestly am in bliss right now bc the catfish and grits was SO good. The meals also came with huge biscuits, hot sauce, raspberry jam and sugar cane butter (yum!). The crab cakes were not extremely breaded and was real crab. I would highly recommend this place. The waiters are very nice and attentive. I'd recommend booking a reservation for brunch though!"

1/9/2018,2 star rating,"I came into Bistro , because i was in the mood for some soul food, fried chicken , and to support local business, after reading some reviews i decided to try it out .We were greeted by server Malik Baldwin, and advised him that we are just dining small because we had later dinner plans , and was in the neighborhood. I agreed to try the Chicken Sliders, and to fully get the experience of the chicken we decided to add 2 pieces of chicken to our order . He seemed annoyed by such small order , and that we were sharing .    Chicken took 20 minutes as it says on menu MADE TO ORDER. .. as we waited for the chicken the whole restaurant smoked up with smell or dirty frying oil...sign of bad ventilation, and old frying oil.Finally food arrives , surprised to see it wasn't as portrayed on reviews, or menu description .Sliders chicken was chewy , and the 2 pc of chicken was overly salty, and burnt as seen in picture, and one piece was just breading.... was NOT impressed . To my surprise Malik charges me $15 for 2 measly over fried piece of chicken, and my clothes for the rest of the evening reeked of old cooking oil.Will never return . Hope the up charge gets you new cooking ventilation, or training class for your server."
12/4/2015,4 star rating,"I had a really good experience at BLVD. My boyfriend had been hyping this place up for MONTHS. We ended up going early in the day (pre-drinking hours)- I usually like a mimosa with my brunch so next time I will have to try one when I go back.We got there a little bit before it opened. We decided instead of going in (there were clearly people inside) we would wait outside for our friends. The manager came out to see how we were doing an to invite us inside.  He was extremely friendly, professional and personable to everyone who walked through the door.IT is pretty small. I feel like they could benefit from expanding a little bit. I can see that it could get packed on the weekend ALL day.  Unless I had a reservation I probably wouldn't go on the whim.  They also have some outside seating -but that is limited as well.I got the shrimp and grits.  They were tasty! The catfish was also good (I tried my bf's).  Some of the meals came with biscuits with an amazing honey butter-yum!  The service was good. Our waitress made sure our waters were filled.Good place to go! :)"
7/1/2018,4 star rating,"Came here for Saturday brunch with my best friend who was visiting from another country.  The line at 10:45 am was already long, though we made a reservation, they could not sit us until the parties're all there.  The service was very friendly and great.  And I love the fact that you see people of all generations and a lot of locals (made us feel that the food's gotta be authentic already).We don't eat so much so the food was a bit heavy for us.  I love my grits and the combination was good.  However, we both thought that the biscuit was a bit off -- I was hoping that it's fluffy but it grumbles off like cakes.  And although I know it's soul food, the lack of anything green was a little off-putting.They can also need a bit revamping with the space.  I love the fact that it has that converted townhouse feel, much like many restaurants I grew up with in Virginia (yes I'm actually from the South).  But the lack of daylight in this pace and poor ventilation can not be excused.  Though I really want to give a 3-star, I do think it has the potential to be great."
6/2/2019,4 star rating,"Place was packed on a Sat night, long lines to wait so definitely make reservations ahead of time. Table side service was spotty, as it seemed the staff was still getting their wings underneath them and a bit disorganized and could run a lot smoother with being more attentive. However.....we both got the Southern Fried Chicken dinner and let me tell you this, for the subpar service (although friendly), this was a 5-Star meal! The chicken breading was done just perfect and they give you 3 succulent pieces, but here comes the kicker....the best 2 side dishes I have ever eaten  at a Soul Food/BBQ spot in my entire life. The smoked turkey collared greens and the black eyed peas with andouille sausage were LIFE CHANGING. Please repeat this line to yourself over and over again, as this meal is worth the trip to Harlem alone.We would definitely recommend this restaurant on food and the atmosphere, and for a meal that you will surely be talking about for weeks to come!"

7/8/2019,4 star rating,"Came here with a friend for an early evening and were seated in a nice corner area. Surprisingly, we were told to move -- politely -- as there was a party of ten booked and we were accidentally sat at one of their tables -- not great. But the staff was super apologetic and nice about it​ and gave each of us a glass of wine on the wine as recompense. Aside from the little issue at the beginning, the staff was super nice throughout the evening and quite attentive, even when the house got full. The food was classic soul food, but some of the best i've had -- MUCH better and more reasonably priced than Amy Ruth's! Bottom Line: If you're thinking about soul food, there's no better place than BLVD Bistro!"
10/17/2020,5 star rating,Everything comes individually wrapped making your transition from tableside to takeout super easy. This also provides a sense of comfort in corona times. Abraham was super helpful and attentive his drinks also slap.
3/2/2020,2 star rating,"The people here were very nice, which is why I'm giving two stars, but the experience was bizarre and pretty bad. To start, neither the bartender or the server I spoke to understood the happy hour food menu. We asked where the menus were, and he said ""oh we don't have them anymore, we're trying to blend into the neighborhood""...uhhhh, ok??? I listened to the server ramble off the top of his head for a good five minutes about the happy hour sliders (""so there's a bun, then meat, then cheese, then some more meat on top of that. You're going to be very happy with it""--no joke, this what it sounded like). Eventually my gf who had been there before interrupted him and told the both of us what was actually on the happy hour menu. The way he proudly presented us our silverware and dipping sauces for our food with exaggerated showmanship, ten minutes before any food hit our table, was both hilarious and deeply confusing.We got three different sliders, all on biscuits. A basic cheeseburger on a biscuit is a horrible idea. Disgusting. The pulled pork had no flavor, and also did not taste very good with the biscuit. The biscuits themselves tasted microwaved and flavorless. The fried chicken slider in theory is a decent idea, but again--bad biscuit, underwhelming protein. I enjoyed nothing about the food.The drinks we ordered were basic, because I didn't trust that I would get a good cocktail at this point, but they were acceptable. The bartender tried to make up for the ordering debacle by being generous with alcohol. An owner was in the restaurant getting her nails done by a traveling technician, in plain view of all her customers. I know it was the owner, because her husband confirmed this to us as though there was nothing wrong with it lol.Overall, this was an amusing neighborhood place I will probably not ever return to. You hate to see it."
5/26/2019,4 star rating,"A group of us went in today unaware it was a soft opening. Limited menu but variety was good.Biscuits to die for. Chicken wings were excellent. I had catfish dinner, needed a bit more seasoning. My friend's grits were delicious, very cheesy and had BACON lol I suggest they invest in paper straws. Putting my mouth to your naked glass is not comfortingService was excellent. Overall, very good experience"
3/31/2018,4 star rating,"As a self declared soul food connoisseur, I can 100% vouch for the food here at BLVD Bistro. My boyfriend and I reserved our table on Yelp and immediately upon entering we were seated at our table. The vibes here were great- 90's R&B playing in the background and all of the staff was friendly. Once I looked at the menu I was immediately impressed by the option to have turkey bacon (yes, turkey bacon) on my seven cheese macaroni! The turkey bacon was hands down some of the best turkey bacon I've tasted. While we were waiting for our meals these superrrrr amazing biscuits were put on our table with a butter I can only describe as out of this world. I literally have no idea what was in it but it was great. The restaurant is a bit small and the food is a bit pricey for the portion size but the quality is there, every dollar is worth it . The food here is A1 I'll be back without a doubt"
9/6/2020,5 star rating,Had a wonderful experience at this establishment. The food was AMAZING the service was the best and the music was good. I definitely will be returning
3/21/2018,1 star rating,Omg where do I start? First of all the price is OUTRAGEOUS for the food we had!! My meal was $28.00 that doesn't include tip or tax. Catfish was OK the potato salad was disgusting! It was potatoes with the cheapest mustard one can buy and a sprinkle of scallions! It had a little color but no pickle relish and no onions. It did not remind me of southern potato salad at all. It was so bad I swapped for mashed potatoes and that wasn't any good either. The collar greens came out cold. The sangria was a joke. Overall everything was overpriced and just not worth the money or the time but I spent sitting in the restaurant. I have never been so disappointed in southern food before!!! To make matters worse the macaroni and cheese I ordered  was given to  another table which could've been a blessing because it was so small and the price was $20.
9/5/2020,5 star rating,"Staff was so sweet and everything was delicious! They have a great outdoor set-up. I had the watermelon goat cheese salad to start and shrimp and grits.

2/10/2020,5 star rating,"This place is great! I came for brunch and everything was excellent. Our server Ray was awesome. He was very attentive and his energy was contagious. Now the food was WOW. It came out fairly quickly which was great because we were starving. I had the fried chicken and biscuit and though it was filling, I couldn't get enough of it. The chicken was juicy and the skin was perfectly crunchy and flavorful. The biscuit was great. A little crunch on the outside, but very soft on the inside. My friend had the crab cake Benedict and loved it. For drinks, I had the spiked tea. That was really good as well. It was the perfect combination of Prosecco and tea. As for the ambiance, its loud, but not like a party. It's a nice low key brunch. They had old school R&B playing, but not to the point you couldn't hear your party speak. The decor is super cute. Kind of like a farm house. I will definitely be coming back."
10/24/2017,5 star rating,"I DROPPED MONEY IN THIS PLACE AND IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT! This place is a gem of Harlem. The food was simply divine. I didn't know what to expect and what I got was greatness. We ordered the fried chicken sliders as an appetizers, then the jumbo shrimp and grits and the pork chops with a side of potato salad. We also tried some beers and the sangria. Every single thing was great. The chef, Carlos is simply a magician. The flavors were beyond description. I don't even like grits like that  and it was the most amazing thing on the menu. The staff was very welcoming and checked on us every minute. We were smart to go on a Tuesday afternoon when it wasn't too busy and you can really feel the southern ambiance of the restaurant. I will definitely be back. The place is a bit expensive but definitely worth every cent."

3/30/2020,2 star rating,"Listen ... I am writing this review because I've been triggered after watching an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. That's not to say that the kitchen here is a nightmare but the service was so horrible that I can't not say anything. It's been a month and a half since my visit, and I am still thinking about how bad this service was. Let me explain, I went on Valentine's Day, in which they were offering a seafood only prefixed menu (bad sign #1). We were sat down, and then proceeded to wait 45 minutes before the server came to take our order (bad sign #2). After waiting an additional, 25 minutes the server returned with only one drink (My date and I both ordered our own drink). We proceeded to wait another 10 minutes before asking about the missing drink and then had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get the missing drink (bad sign #3). Now let's get to the food, we waited approximately an hour and a half before the food came out, and when it did unfortunately one of the fish entrees was burnt and was missing the sauce on it (bad sign #4). After sending the dish back, we waited an additional 20-25 minutes for the new one to come out.All in all, I was there for a minimum of three and a half hours, the service wasn't great, the food was subpar, the only saving grace was the biscuits."
7/4/2020,5 star rating,"Had a 1 pm Saturday brunch at BLVD, and would definitely return for more! I had the catfish and grits while my husband had the pulled pork bbq sandwich, and we shared a Bellini carafe. The catfish and grits were the star of the show, SO delicious, it's no wonder they're so popular. The biscuit was also great with the sugar cane butter. Props to BLVD for the most sanitary outdoor dining situation I've experienced so far in the time of Covid-19, where you place an order at the front of the house so the servers minimize exposure to unmasked guests.Would absolutely come back, thanks for a delightful brunch BLVD!"
9/4/2019,5 star rating,"Labor Day Weekend 2019.  I saw that BLVD Bistro was rated highly.  They did not disappoint.  Not sure which is better, the staff or the food.     Music selection was perfect.  Great R&B vibe.  I recommend the Eggs, Catfish and Grits.... best grits ever.  Don't think I can eat anyone else's again. Will visit every time I head back to New York, plus it's in Harlem!  * ask about the mimosas."
10/15/2019,5 star rating,"This place was INCREDIBLE! As a Southerner, I had a hard time believing a Southern soul food restaurant in NYC could ecome close to being authentic. Man, was I wrong. The shrimp and grits was unbelievable. The drinks, atmosphere, and food were all spot on! I would come back here in a heartbeat!"
3/3/2020,4 star rating,"It's all about the grits! At least for me it is. Not too watery and not to stiff. As Goldilocks would say   ""They're just right!""  I've been to Blvd Bistro about four times in the last few years and I've never been disappointed.  The Mac and cheese, the fried chicken and the collard greens are soulfully good.  My favorite is the fried catfish and grits. The biscuits - delish! The staff is attentive and courteous. The ambiance urban casual. Only complaint was my recent visit on Valentines Day weekend.  It was my first time at the new location on Douglass Blvd. There was a deejay and the music was too loud. I hope that's not the norm. Otherwise I highly recommend this restaurant.  It's food for the soul!"
1/4/2020,4 star rating,Food was great and big portions. The waiter was also amazing. She kept the mimosas coming and made paying for bottomless worth it. This is my second time at this location. the first time we waited an hour before they told us they were not seating anyone else. Highly recommend making a reservation before arriving.
11/3/2019,5 star rating,"Great food especially the collar greens! Nice vibe, brunch is fabulous...love the shrimp and grits served in cast iron!"
11/2/2019,3 star rating,"Pros: the food at this new location is still spectacular enough to make up for everything else. (The wings are crisp and juicy -- look for the accompanying glaze at the bottom of the basket -- and the shrimp grits are to die for.) The atmosphere is vibrant and lively. Great, upbeat playlist of R&B tracks makes for an instantly warm, entertaining atmosphere. Tab is very reasonable -- $50 pp or so (not including tip) for two apps, three drinks and two entrees. Kid-friendly (not so sure that's really a pro, though!)Cons: This is no longer the bespoke, genteel dining experience of the prior location. Sound levels can get screamy over the dinner hour. Service...needs work. Very pleasant, but it took almost a half hour to get our first round of drinks. A second round never arrived. Then, mid-meal, our waiter vanished. And when I say vanished, I mean in a timeline-was-reset-and-erased-him-from-living-memory way. From that point, I was basically our table's waiter -- having to go to the bar to get that second round, ask for someone to take another order from the table, ask for the check to be brought to the table... etc. And another thing I found odd-- one must have to know to request one of the empty booths when making a reservation. Which I guess the white patrons do? Although *all* of the booths were empty when we arrived for our reservation, we were told our only option was one of the side tables. Later, we noticed all the booths were filled only with white patrons who arrived after us. Strange optics to observe in a black-owned restaurant.All this said -- again, the food is still spectacular, but the service is surprisingly and aggressively amateur hour."

10/27/2019,3 star rating,"Unsalted fried catfish. Was there for brunch. But the grits and cheddar cheese with poached egg was good- but how can you go wrong with that. My husband said the French toast was one of the best he ever had- really sweet, if you're into that.The biscuit was amazing. I'd like to go back and try the fried chicken but if they don't salt the catfish I'm scared about the chicken."

10/26/2019,2 star rating,"Amazing server, and decent food. However beware of the bottomless. The drinks are all so sweet. We barely finished one drink. Our server tried really hard to make it right, but these may have been the worst drinks ever so there wasn't much to be done."
10/26/2019,2 star rating,"The food is good, but once again another greedy owner is alienating the neighborhood. The biscuit sandwich was $12 last month, now it's been raised 50% to $18. It's still the same egg, cheese, bacon and biscuit. Greed like this puts a bad taste in my mouth, and forces me out of principal to move on to another restaurant. Meanwhile harlem tavern across the street offers you a drink with their meals for a better price as well."
10/22/2019,4 star rating,Visited for brunch on Saturday and thankfully we had a reservation because it was super packed. We were served pretty quickly. I got the crab cake Benedict which was good just wish bigger portion of crab. The biscuits were my favorite (soooo good). The Arnold Palmer drink was refreshing an good as well. This is a great place to grab brunch on the weekend with friends
10/22/2019,2 star rating,"I booked a reservation for a party of 11 for my daughter's bday.  Several emails, a visit to the restaurant 2 days prior, with assurance that 'we got you'...a confirmed reservation and a promise to call to reconfirm, me calling to reconfirm the day before, us showing up an hour prior to the reservation... all this and they still wasn't able to accommodate us.  We were asked to check in when everyone was there, but not prior to the reservation time... checked in at 3pm and was told that the wait time would be 90 mins! Really so what's the purpose of the reservation? I would understand 'wait so we can prepare your table', but to wait 90 mins after the time our reservation was confirmed for?  That's beyond ridiculous.  With no one showing up at the host desk to explain, even though we asked to speak with someone with somewhat a little more authority to at least hear us out.  No one.  We eventually left.  Extremely disappointed.  Not even the courtesy of an apology.  Not very professional the way it was handled.  We had to find another place to go amidst my daughter's birthday!"
8/18/2019,2 star rating,"The food was amazing!!! However although a reservation was made we still waited for over 30 minutes to be seated. We asked 2-3 times about an approximate time and was told 10 minutes each time. The venue is entirely too small (even after a location change) to accommodate the crowd it brings. It was clear that the reservations were double booked and there was also a ton of walk ins. There was no place to stand while waiting and it was a constant shuffle. Once we were finally seated there were a ton of people standing directly next to us where they were waiting for a free table. We were very uncomfortable with our seating bc people were constantly banging into our chairs and talking around our food as we were being served and while eating. I want to again say the food was amazing however the space is not great, the service isn't good, the wait is atrocious and the air level is poor."

8/11/2019,5 star rating,I had Blvd's Southern Dinner and loved everything about it. The fish was good and crispy with lots of flavor. The potato salad was just right and the collard greens were addicting. It was all served with a fresh buttermilk biscuit that tastes as though it came from your grandmother's kitchen on a Sunday morning. There were multiple things on the menu that I wanted to try but I would def get this again. The ambiance of the restaurant is also amazing. They were playing good ol throwback r&b hits the evening I went. This place is perfect for a date or even just a place to catch up with your friends over drinks. I look forward to my next visit!

10/13/2018,3 star rating,"I'm a loyal patron here at BLVD Bistro, but today was a complete disaster that potentially compromised my view of this establishment. I was told that a table for two would be thirty minutes, which was totally fine. However, 50 minuets later, I went into the restaurant to inquire about the estimated wait time for my table and found out that I would have to wait at least an additional 20 minutes due to 3 tables that were ahead of me. Not sure what was happening today, but it seemed like people were being placed ahead of me. I was disappointed by my experience today, but will continue to support this restaurant with the hope that this will never happen again.Best,Mr. Ray"
7/25/2017,4 star rating,"Really cute venue.  It's quaint and charming with a real welcoming vibe.  The food was delicious and I caught a bit of entrée envy with the ladies seated at the table next to us.  The steak a ribs looked ultra succulent.  That alone will bring us back a second time! The server was great and attentive.  I would have loved to have been able to grab a table outside but alas the best seats were taken.  It's summer, after all.  The appetizers are all great.  If you are a vegetarian, you may want to stick to the appetizer menu.  The venue has more carnivore oriented menu, FYI."
11/11/2018,1 star rating,It was my first time visiting BLVD Bistro being that it was recommended by a friend and as they say first impressions are the lasting ones. First there were several items not on the menu because they sold out during the brunch and Friday crowds. Baked beans (something that is provisional) no desserts at all! (Was your dessert source on vacation?) No complimentary house biscuits But they did have biscuits with gravy for $8.00 for a pair. (this is a soul food/Southern Inspired restaurant)! ALL THIS on a  Saturday night!?! Fail!!Next we witnessed someone fall off a chair because it literally cracked and broke.The food was good service was good as well. But I will have to think twice before going back again.

Love  it at BLVD Bistro."
10/12/2018,2 star rating,"I've avoided dining here since they opened because the word of mouth told me the price point didn't match the experience. I hate to say that after finally being dragged here by an out of town relative who saw it on some TV show - I agree. But mostly I hate when our neighborhood places fail on such basic levels.So the food here was solid and portions decent - and restaurants often do skate by on food alone. But the experience of eating there - all wrong. No host when arriving. The space upon entering is cramped and jumbled and disorganized. The bar is covered, not with wine and cocktails and fun, but with kitchen supplies and glasses waiting to be dried and dirty dishes and hot sauce and ketchup and other condiment containers waiting to be filled. Then the seating - that unfortunate combination of too tall chairs/ too short tables where someone of my barely tall height can't cross their legs under the table. Then the menu - surprise - they're out of at least 25% of everything. Then the service - it's fine - it's friendly - BUT the entree price is well above $25 - high for the neighborhood and really high for the kind of service/ experience they're providing. You could eat at our local super fussy, very high quality local ingredient place for the exact same price. Other service problems aside (my dining companion spilled their entire glass of wine down the front of me and we could barley get the staff to bring us a napkin let alone help clean up the mess), the food IS good. Which prob keeps people returning. But without the basic service/ comfort issues solved - I'd rather get the southern home cooking/ soul food type offerings from Best Market down the street for 1/4 the price and take it home where my table's the right height, and it's not backed up super close to my neighbor, and I have a placemat under my slippery dishes, and I have half way decent wine and towels and cleaning supplies if I spill something."
1/15/2019,5 star rating,"Staying in Harlem for a weekend, we had a few options to choose from to nab some good brunch spots and the decision to come here was definitely a highlight of my food adventures that weekend. Got a reservation for 5 of us on a Saturday morning and it was ready in time, the friendliest service that had coffee promptly at our table to fuel us up. I'm not a big fan of southern style biscuits but that's honestly because my introduction to it was cheap diners in Canada. So it wasn't until recently I realised just how good a warm soft biscuit can be and I was excited to order their Homemade Biscuit and it was so heavenly!! I feel like I'm pretty much echoing what a lot of people here are saying, so I'm just going to say that the good hype is real here!!"
4/23/2017,2 star rating,"I came in on Sunday 1:30 pm for a party of two. It was 45 minute wait, so I came back about 2:15pm. They took our phone number down up drop in reservation, but they made no attempt to contact us from the local coffee shop. There really is no reason to have our phone number then.It took them to get us our food an hour after we ordered, making it a late 3:30pm brunch. We had the catfish egg with biscuit and grits, the other is a fried chicken and biscuits basket. The chicken, biscuits and catfish tasted fresh. The biscuits were very buttery.In summary, be prepared to pregame and eat before hand if you don't mind the 2+ hour wait time."

1/5/2019,3 star rating,"I honestly don't know how this place has so many good reviews. To be fair, great customer service, fast service (partly due to the fact that everything seemed pre-cooked).  My boyfriend and I went for brunch and the food was just okay but extremely overpriced.  For starters we ordered chicken biscuit sandwich. The biscuit was good, but the chicken was dry and cold. For our entrees I ordered catfish and grits which was okay but small portion for 25 dollars. My boyfriend ordered French toast with a side of home fries. He said his French toast was a little burnt and cold. I had some of his home fries and they were cold mushy and gross. Brunch for 2, no alcoholic drinks ran us almost 100 dollars. Sorry but second visit for me is going to be a no."

The place was packed and noisy which is fine I guess for brunch but I had to wait 15 min just for a hostess to show up. By that time the line to be seated was to the door. A new hostess walked up and a woman that was near me was inquiring if she would be seated for her 2:30 reservation any time soon! It was 3:15! All the hostess could say is ""we're really busy"". Great but then what's the point of a reservation?!?? I was so excited to try this place and I'm honestly turned off from even trying to go back. It seemed very disorganized and no one was explaining what was going on. I'm disappointed, the menu looked amazing but the lack or organization kinda ruined my interest in this place."
10/16/2019,4 star rating,"The first time I went to the new location on 116th and Frederick Douglas I was a little disappointed. We'd gone on a Sunday after the brunch crowd. It was four of us and, though the restaurant wasn't crowded at all the waiters seemed to have trouble being attentive to us. Also they'd run out of some key menu items by then. However I really enjoyed my shrimp and grits and liked the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. I went back a few weeks later and sat at the bar with my friend. The bartender made a delicious drinks and we both enjoyed our food. I had the chicken and biscuits. I'll be back when I'm craving biscuits and fried chicken."

Fortunately, we made reservations for BLVD Bistro.

The waitstaff were friendly, engaging and knew the menu well. We had a joke about the price of a side of grits, yes we know the resturant is a for profit business but wow.  They better be incredible.

The brioche French toast is perfectly caramelized. My banana, pecan pancakes were light and fluffy. My niece had blueberry pancakes that were over loaded with berries. My nephew tried the crab Benedict which was very rich but delish.Staff could not have been nicer. Don't be late as there is a huge line and you will lose your table."
1/24/2019,3 star rating,"Came here and i absolutely loved the vibe and the staff. Our server was so sweet and attentive the entire time. I had the ""catfish po boy"" and my colleague had the Mac and cheese. The Mac was about 20$ and definitely was not worth the price, TGI Friday's has better Mac and cheese in my opinion. The po boy may be good to someone who doesn't know what a po boy is, but I would hardly consider it to be a po-boy. The bread they use is not the bread for a po boy and the catfish seasoning wasn't the best either. In all, I don't feel like the food was great and I definitely would not recommend the Mac and cheese or the po boy.The biscuits were bomb however, and if I were to go back I would probably stick to the breakfast food"

11/9/2018,3 star rating,"UPDATED REVIEW FROM FRIDAY, NOV. 9TH:Initially I went here this afternoon and walked in (behind the mail carrier) and I saw a empty restaurant with one patron in the corner and a table with what looked like staff talking. I waited around maybe 5 to 7 minutes and didn't notice anyone coming over to take care of me, so I walked out the restaurant. This was my third time coming to BLVD Bistro. The first time I came I had a reservation that I had to cancel because the person I was dining with was late. The second time, I came on a Saturday and had just missed brunch. So I was a little frustrated this third time. I walked around, wrote my initial review below, and came back as I seen a man and a woman walking to the restaurant. When I came back minutes later, I was greeted and seated by a very nice waiter. The cook (who I believe is the owner) came out and apologized for what transpired earlier when I walked in. I appreciated him for that. So I tried the lunch special - the BLVD southern dinner which I had catfish fried, potato salad and greens. It was decent. The potato salad was very delicious. I enjoyed the greens with the meat in them. The fish could have been cooked maybe a minute longer, but that's my own preference and it was still good. Everything was cooked fresh, nothing sitting around in a warmer like at other places up the block! I think the place should be given a chance. I came here because a close friend highly recommended it. I just wish the space was bigger so that on those busy days like Saturdays people could get a seat. I may possibly come back when it's dinner to see what that's about. But glad I gave them a second chance. I give it an updated 3 starts because I never give a restaurant on first visit a 5. You have to earn it. INITIAL REVIEW ON FRIDAY, NOV. 9TH: Never go here. I've went here 3 times to try and eat and all three times either there is no seats or like the last timeI went the staff just looked at me in an empty restaurant and didn't help me. Sad that these places exists. You want to help your people, but they act extra. Nope! Won't get my coins!! I guess you have to be Caucasian to be serviced here."
3/19/2020,5 star rating,Amazing food!!!... this is the first time in my adult life i order grits and it was so GOOOOOD! That was 5 O's because it deserves 5 stars. The Fish  and mac and cheese are good too the only thing i would say needs improvement is the drinks those are a bit on the soft side. I have tried 4 on the menu all the same. Overall the food and service are amazing. And make a reservation!!!
1/18/2020,5 star rating,"I can't wait to go back to New York! I LOVED THIS PLACE! I called a couple of days before we went to make reservations and was able to do so without any issues. We got there and everything was GREAT! We sat down, our waiter was so friendly and  bubbly. I forgot her name but she reminded me of Storm because she had a short, pixie cut and her hair was gray. She explained the menu in detail. They bring homemade, fluffy biscuits to share. A sin and a shame! I ordered the blueberry pancakes...fluffy, hot, and absolutely AMAZING! I shared the Bistro wings and catfish and grits with my daughter and best friend! The wing sauce is like nothing I ever tasted. They need to bottle the sauce! The catfish was seasoned perfectly! Typing this now, makes me want to head to New York now!"

The wings were tasteful, making us lick our fingers to not leave leave anything. The quality of the steak added to the salad amazed me.

2/17/2017,5 star rating,"We went here for a late lunch.  The wait was a tad bit over 60 minutes, but it was worth every second.  We ordered the shrimp and grits and fried chicken platters .  We shared both entrees to have the opportunity to try both.  Both dishes were absolutely divine and scrumptious. The restaurant is extremely tiny so. Be prepared for that and the wait, It's worth the experience!"
11/17/2019,3 star rating,"We loved Blvd Bistro when it was on 121st- great, cozy ambience. The chef would walk out and talk to the guests. Service was first-class. Food was even better. Unfortunately, since the move it seems to have changed. We made a reservation in a Friday night and were sat right away, however we were sat in an area (not at the bar, mind you) that was supposed to be waited on by the lone bartender! So after 15 mins of sitting at our table with no water and no service, we asked to be moved. Luckily a table was open so we moved to a table where a regular waiter served us. He was not much better. Forgot my husbands beer (had to ask again for it and it came in the middle of dinner). We were supposed to get appetizer biscuits, but those didn't come out until we were almost done with the meal- again after we asked. The fried chicken sliders were just ok. The garlic mash, collards, and potato salad were awesome! But sadly, it doesn't seem like they pan fry the chicken anymore (like at original location). The chicken was greasy and came out in ten mins. Thanks understand pan frying is time consuming for a bigger location, but we were excepting the original and were dissatisfied with the regular deep fry. Finally, the server messed up the payment, rarely came back to check in and we practically had to hound him each time we wanted more water, more sauce, or the check. Hopefully they are just working out kinks... will give it another try next month."

We waited a while to be seated, but we got complimentary mimosas and biscuits, and a customized menu for my birthday. The food was amazing, and all my guests were happy. Our waiter was also fantastic. Thank you BLVD Bistro team for great service and a wonderful birthday experience. I will definitely be back."
11/4/2016,5 star rating,"Holy Moly!! This place was definitely worth the trip to Harlem...  when I tell you their southern food is on point, I mean it! And I know my southern food!! I had the shrimp and grits, which was very filling and very satisfying! While waiting for out food, we had homemade biscuits with homemade butter. The butter is addicting, you want to eat it all on its own. One of the waiters said that it's mixed with pure cane sugar, which to me makes it taste like a sweet cream corn *YUM*  On top of their amazing food, the service was great!! I have no complaints about this place and can't wait to visit the city again just to eat here!"

11/2/2019,3 star rating,"Pros: the food at this new location is still spectacular enough to make up for everything else. (The wings are crisp and juicy -- look for the accompanying glaze at the bottom of the basket -- and the shrimp grits are to die for.) The atmosphere is vibrant and lively. Great, upbeat playlist of R&B tracks makes for an instantly warm, entertaining atmosphere. Tab is very reasonable -- $50 pp or so (not including tip) for two apps, three drinks and two entrees. Kid-friendly (not so sure that's really a pro, though!)Cons: This is no longer the bespoke, genteel dining experience of the prior location. Sound levels can get screamy over the dinner hour. Service...needs work. Very pleasant, but it took almost a half hour to get our first round of drinks. A second round never arrived. Then, mid-meal, our waiter vanished. And when I say vanished, I mean in a timeline-was-reset-and-erased-him-from-living-memory way. From that point, I was basically our table's waiter -- having to go to the bar to get that second round, ask for someone to take another order from the table, ask for the check to be brought to the table... etc. And another thing I found odd-- one must have to know to request one of the empty booths when making a reservation. Which I guess the white patrons do? Although *all* of the booths were empty when we arrived for our reservation, we were told our only option was one of the side tables. Later, we noticed all the booths were filled only with white patrons who arrived after us. Strange optics to observe in a black-owned restaurant.All this said -- again, the food is still spectacular, but the service is surprisingly and aggressively amateur hour."

4/18/2017,5 star rating,"I've been here for brunch two times and both times the experience and food was excellent. As a southern/Western girl from Texas I can truly say I've found Soul food that feels and taste like  soul food. Too often in this city do  soul food restaurants use canned yams, greens and other veggies and low grade food and put it on a plate and serve it up. But not BLVD Bistro!!  Some say it's pricey but you get what you pay for and BLVD Bistro is serving up quality food.The biscuits are to die for. It's obvious they are made from scratch. The consistency of the grits are perfect! The mac and cheese and fish are well seasoned. The only thing that has prevented me from going back is I need a dinner partner! LOL It's a small space and you cannot make reservations for 2 people or less. Other than that if you haven't been you should make a reservation asap! Before I forget the staff is great and the owner Carlos occasionally comes out and chats with the patrons. The customer service is also on point."
12/31/2016,5 star rating,"This place is absolutely AMAZING. While in Harlem, New York with my hubby and friend she recommended this place for brunch/lunch and boi am I glad she did. This place reminds me of good ol' down south cooking, not typically what you would associate Harlem with, or least for me. The food was absolutely phenomenal in every way. No condiments needed here. We had the Shrimp and Grits (look just like the website picture); Collard Greens; Cheese Grits; Biscuit sandwich and the Blvd Spiked Tea. I don't eat cheese grits, seriously and these have changed the game for me. They were creamy, well seasoned and full of what tasted as smoked Gouda and topped with Cheddar cheese and baked to make it all marry together. Now I don't know exactly how collards should be cooked but I DO know what they should taste like and this is IT. Grandma was definitely in the kitchen a bit more turkey than greens but still seasoned to perfection and tender and full of flava.The biscuit sandwiches were just falling apart in a good way. The biscuits were buttery, fresh and just freaking delicious. I added the brown sugar butter (I guess that's the name) and it was soooo good, I can taste it now. PLEASE go to this place.Oh, one disclaimer this place is SMALL, EXTRA small but so worth the wait. Well, we waited for about 20 minutes but I can see it could be longer depending on the time of day you go. Don't give up, please wait to be seated. I wasn't a fan of the Blvd Spiked Tea more prosecco  than tea but hey that's a drop in the bucket considering all the other great things."

8/26/2018,2 star rating,"I really want to give 2 1/2 Stars I was halfway impressed. Being a Harlem native & watching all the restaurants pop-up & disappear to see BLVD stick around was enlightening. I was hoping for so much more seeing as every time I've tried to visit for brunch there was at least an hour wait. But finally the opportunity presented itself and there was only a 20 minute wait even after BLVD made its debut in the hit series Luke Cage on Netflix. Very cute, quaint location with a homely decor. PROS: To start the wait staff is awesome and friendly even when the place is jumping & busy. The food came quickly and the portions were large. My blueberry pancakes were thick and tasty and full of blueberries. CONS: According to my guest the french toast wasn't as tasty as he'd hoped & was missing the signature sweet cinnamon pop you expect in French toast. He wasn't a fan of the bread used either. My side order of eggs were a bit too runny for my taste although I asked for scrambled hard. We order 3 side orders which were way overpriced at $9 especially for 2 eggs undercooked. I'm somewhat of a lush but the watered down sangria did nothing to make me happier. But I must admit I might have enjoyed my food more had it not been Africa HOT inside of the restaurant. This place is making way too much money to not invest in better air conditioning and ventilation. It was turned off because it was leaking on diners as they enjoyed brunch so we all suffered. We were originally seated by the kitchen where we melted and received quite a few apologies from the staff as they walked by until I finally asked for the manager. Another apology later and I requested to change tables. Moved to the front table by the door slightly overrun by gnats we decided to give up and leave. My guests didn't finish their food so we payed our bill tipped our waitress (again super nice staff) and left. You would think after seeing the patrons suffer through the heat some kind of retribution would have been offered... nothing. I want to give this place one more try and maybe go for dinner in the winter. Lol"

That still doesn't take away from fact that the food was GREAT! I ordered the banana pecan pancakes.. my partner ordered the catfish, grits and biscuit.. Tasty! The Executive Chef was hanging out in the dining area, receiving the praise for his work! He was confident about his work... his words: ""I don't worry about how my food tastes, I worry about my credit score!"" Lol.. The wait was about 50 mins long, so make sure you are wearing some comfy shoes to add comfort to your ""while you are waiting"" walk."

5/5/2020,5 star rating,I took my wife to Blvd Bistro in Harlem a few years ago for Mother's Day and it was the best food I ever had in Harlem. The place was clean the decor and art work was beautiful and the smell of the food when I walk in the door was mouth watering. We ate we drank we talk can't wait to go get my takeout this coming Sunday damn u covid19 it won't stop us from getting our shrimp and grits. The staff is superb very attentive and professional love that place I highly recommend it
10/21/2018,4 star rating,"My good friend invited me and she share that the food is fabulous. So we waited, outside in the cold. A nice touch would be to offer hot tea in blvd bistro cups for your dedicated patrons waiting in the cold. It is an inexpensive touch that creates an experience we won't forget. Heated lamps in the outside patio would invite patrons when it's chilly, like in Paris!There is an odor near the bathroom in the dining area that must be dealt with. Clorox - and the rug covering the uneven flooring in the back - rug looked unclean and smelly. These are small fixes - you have the clientele- just pay attention to details so you can keep them coming"

9/15/2019,1 star rating,Hostess had a horrible attitude! My friends had made a reservation for my birthday at 2pm and we weren't seated till 2:56pm. When I approached the hostess booth to ask a simple question she responded in a matter-of-fact-tone with a hint of condescension ....  I'm the birthday girl just asking a simple question on our ETA and if there was music playing. Staff can greatly effect one's dining  experience I hope they rectify the situation. The owner did come to us with a pitcher of mimosa however I still left with a horrible impression. The hostess didn't come over to communicate the delays within the dinning area. We had to go up to her a ask on various occasions. I will not review the food because no matter how amazing the food was the service left a horrible taste in our mouths.
7/16/2018,4 star rating,"The only reason why this does not get 5 stars, is due to space/ service. Came for brunch and still had to wait an hr even though we made a reservation. Food is divine and overall delicious. Definitely a fan. Just be prepared to wait since its really a small dining area."
1/18/2020,5 star rating,The first time I came to BLVD they were located in a smaller location. I was invited to a birthday dinner there and my experience was okay. My best experience was going during the day for lunch and having their shrimp and grits. AMAZINGGGG. I will go again. Their customer service was great; the server was very attentive.
12/9/2019,5 star rating,Had some issues reserving for a large group on a Sunday but Markisha resolved the issue and our waiter Freddy truly made the experience. The food was AMAZING.
2/23/2020,3 star rating,"Delicious and authentic food and flavors - enough to make me a return customer but it's worth noting the service is really poor. It's not a lack of ""will"" but an obvious lack of training and standards being set. I want this new location to be successful and service will be critical to remain a mainstay in Harlem."
1/5/2020,1 star rating,"I normally come here and love it. This last time was a terrible experience. I ordered a burger medium. 1st time it came out rare, 2nd time it was cooked ""well"" which is not medium. It also came back with no toppings. 3rd time I asked for a new order, which the Head Chef actually came over and apologized for. He said a new order will be right out. Finally I got my order and this burger was the most overcooked burger I ever bit into. It was charred like 1/4 inch thick. By this time my girlfriend had eaten her meal and we were both ready to go. We really liked our server and the Chef seemed to be helpful BUT the food I had was terrible. Huge miss"
5/28/2018,2 star rating,"Two stars are a courtesy for being Black owned, having a flexible hostess, and their bread basket. Short answer for the low review: Extreme heatLow food quality Poor serviceCelebration ruinedLong version:My families Saturday brunch was ruined. The heat in this place was so extreme, no one could enjoy their food. The carafe of Bellini's at ($36) did not have mango purée as listed, it tasted like over sweet canned Goya juice at best, orange look aid at worst. I am so frustrated with the level of service and food received. I cannot believe I offered BLVD as an option for out of town guests, I was embarrassed! The food quality and pricing do not match. What exactly is in the seven cheese Mac & cheese that makes it $20? It isn't listed, but my guests wanted to know. Even the chicken basket was met with a 'meh'. Southern folks being dissatisfied with southern cooking is mortifying.I've been to BLVD before and it was much better, what is happening?! This brunch was for my cousin to celebrate her birthday and the birth of her twins. I discussed dessert at length with a hostess (called at an off peak time), days prior. We discussed plate fees as I planned to bring my own cake, but was discouraged from doing so because BLVDs homemade cakes would be available. I went forward and secured our reservation. Shortly after the meal began, the check was brought to the table. No option of dessert.No acknowledgement of a celebration.No thank you for joining us. Nothing.When I brought it up with staff: ""oh we don't do dessert on Saturdays, they probably just didn't know what day you were coming"". You're telling me to my face, the person making my reservation talked to me for 20 minutes and didn't know what day I was coming? We were offered a candle in a pancake, after our meal. Staff needs to be trained better. Menu and drinks need to be reworked, and maybe some acknowledgement for ruining my cousins birthday, before I would ever come back. Best of luck with the move."
1/4/2020,5 star rating,I love the vibe in the restaurant and the biscuits are EVERYTHING. The new location is very cute and spacious. They have an excellent brunch menu.
1/4/2020,5 star rating,I went to BLVD Bistro on a Saturday for brunch with a group of friends. The staff were friendly and the crab cake Benedict was pretty amazing! The biscuits were homemade and the crab cake was served with a generous amount of crab with the poached eggs cooked just right. I'll definitely be back and highly recommend it.
10/13/2017,5 star rating,"Ok--So, after a bumpy, disappointing start, I still love this place! I've been wanting to try it for a couple of years!

10/6/2018,5 star rating,"We made reservations through Yelp for a Saturday morning. We were promptly seated. Service was great - attentive and friendly. My coffee was good. The food was even better. I got the eggs with the home fries, turkey bacon and a biscuit. I love that the food comes out in small cast iron dishes - it makes the food more flavorful as the dishes probably get more seasoned over time. The biscuit was amazing! And I loved the side of cane sugar butter, hot sauce and jam that they provide. My husband liked his biscuits and gravy and declared his grits the best he has ever had throughout our many travels around the US. We have been coming to NYC for years, each time staying in and exploring different neighborhoods and this is probably one of the best breakfasts we have ever had."
7/18/2017,4 star rating,"I love this place!!! I was there last weekend and the food was absolutely delicious. Biscuits in sausage gravy were yummy. Crab cakes over eggs bennie? Genius. My mom ordered the French toast and she couldn't get over how soft and tasty they were. My brother ordered the pancakes and he didn't like them nor finish them (they did look a bit pale and odd - my only complaint food wise). What I really enjoyed was the fact that the chef was out there making sure his business was running the way he wanted to. He even came to our table to make sure everything was okay. The staff is also nice and inviting, not super attentive but they get around. However it's such a tight space. My chair was bumped several times by passing waiters and busboys. If you don't mind that then this is the place for you because the food is BOMB."

12/27/2019,2 star rating,"Shrimp Po Boy ($18) came with three shrimp on a huge roll that was very soggy on the bottom because no one drained the cole slaw that was served on the sandwich. The chicken on the chicken sandwich was covered in cheese, such that you could not taste the chicken."
10/11/2020,5 star rating,Amazing food and drinks!! I had the shrimp and grits and everything was so well prepared and fresh.  I had a side of potato salad which was delicious and the buscuits were to die for!! The drinks were strong just like I like them and the service was on point. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at BLVD BIstro!
4/25/2018,4 star rating,"First off I am from Houston. Ya'll know well our food reputation.I had the BLVD Catfish with the collard greens and potato salad. There were 3 catfish strips fried lightly to perfection. Beautiful golden brown exterior. The collard greens and the potato salad were both just delicious. She had the shrimp + cheddar grits and she loved it! It came with 4 jumbo shrimp and a small pan of delicious cheddarrrrrrrrreddd grits.But nothing was touching the light flaky golden home-made biscuits. They were so good we had to order another pair. Lawd! The butter that comes with it is just perfect. Not too sweet. Spreads easily. Perfection. 4 *'s because the food is expensive and you don't feel the value for the cost. 1. We both left hungry. For me, 3 small strips of fish and two sides smaller than the size of a side on a Popeyes meal (although much more delicious) for a full grown man.? For her, 4 pieces of shrimp, cheese, and grits for $30? At this price point the trade off should be you wont leave hungry. I think learning the portion size that relates to that satisfied place for the average customer could be a big gain for them in the near future. 2. If you know you charge a premium price and offer smaller portions you must have a good trade off. Free biscuits, cheap drinks, etc.  3. The place didn't set me in a mood. It didn't give me an outer body or outer city experience. No extraordinary decor. No fun surprises. Extremely mediocre customer service.         Just great tasting, small portioned food."
8/3/2019,4 star rating,"The owner greeted each guest personally upon arrival (nice touch). Prompt service, although we had reservations the wait time was short (apx 10 minutes). Absolutely no vegan options (I had the collards and picked the turkey meat out)...still finger licking delicious!"
1/28/2020,5 star rating,Love this place....the food is excellent. The buttermilk blueberry pancakes are the best in town and the fried chicken and biscuits are a must. Can't wait to go back! Yummy!!!!
8/16/2018,4 star rating,"This is by far my favorite brunch spot in Harlem. I have ate here a handful of times and you can never go wrong with anything that has a buttermilk biscuit.  The breakfast sandwich includes scrambled eggs and cheese with your choice of meat, on top of the buttermilk biscuit. Another great option is the chicken sliders with homemade ranch dressing, on top of the buttermilk biscuit.  I have yet to try the dinner menu but it is definitely on my list of places to try.Bonus:  The music here will have you dancing in your seat!"
11/8/2019,4 star rating,"Food Timelines of Table Meal Service Post Meal Service My Family and I were in town for the NYC Marathon and went to Brunch the day before my Race.  We had a party of 8 and we were sat approximately about 30-45 Minutes after our reservation time.  Our server did his best but felt like he had a lot of tables to cover.  Our orders were taken accurately and praise to the chef and his staff for being so quick.  We finished our meals and chatted before we were advised people that were people waiting for our table. Highlight: Busboy Staff was amazing.  Music was awesome.  Reason I Can't Give it 5 :We asked our bill to be split into 2 cards and assumed it was done correctly. A few days later, I checked my account and the entire bill of $212 was charged to my account by 2 separate charges. Make sure they charge correctly before you leave."
5/21/2016,5 star rating,"After a long bike ride from lower Manhattan, my husband and I decided to try BLVD Bistro as it was on our must-try foodie list. And it just might be our new favorite brunch place in Manhattan! We were blown away by the food - homemade, generous portions and high quality. Also great customer service. I ordered the catfish and grits because it came with BLVD's much hyped (and deserving of this) biscuit. The grits were creamy perfection, and the eggs were cooked just right. My husband ordered the pan fried chicken dinner (which is on the brunch menu), which was well-seasoned with a perfect texture both in and out.We will definitely be back soon!"
11/7/2018,5 star rating,"The food here was absolutely delicious. I went there for my graduation lunch and was not disappointed! I got the fried chicken and biscuits, an appetizer with chicken wings and was greatly satisfied. The chicken stayed hot from the first to the last bite. The biscuits were soft, buttery and delicious. The chef even gave extras which was kind of him. I'm definitely coming back next time I get the chance!"
7/12/2018,3 star rating,"This place states that it is ranked for best soul food in America; however, I was not that impressed. The green beans were not seasoned at all. The rice and beans little too salty. And the mac & cheese was dry on the top and lacked depth of flavor."
3/13/2020,5 star rating,Decided to come here instead of red rooster to give it a shot. And man it was the best decision. The food and the service was top notch!! The cuisine I had was the BLVD Southern Dinner with the fried catfish and for the  soup the lobster bisque. It was so so good. And our waiter was so friendly and attentive!! Definitely coming back!

3/7/2020,5 star rating,"The food and the atmosphere was absolutely amazing!  Hats off to the Chef! I don't normally eat grits, but I did this time and ordered some to go.   The pancakes, the fish, the chicken, the breakfast potatoes...all Fabulous!"
3/7/2019,3 star rating,"I spontaneously went because my friend wanted brunch and it popped was on my map app. I have also seen it on social media once or twice.The food is without a doubt great. I had a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit. The biscuit was a pretty good biscuit. I personally think you can get more food for your money at many other places. The place is pretty small and gets very crowded for brunch, so you may want to get there early or make a reservation. It was pretty tight in there with a few waiters going back and forth. At one point a waiter has spilled something on my jacket. It was very nice of him to alert me and clean it off for me. The small place really took away from the experience. The service was amazing although it was busy, the servers were very attentive to their customers making it bearable."
11/10/2014,4 star rating,"This right here, this right here. . is. . . good!  But heed my warming: you've NEVER had cheese grits this serious, EVER!  It's more like creamy cheese with a side of grits.  But I am not complaining.  Just don't feel bad about it afterwards.  The breakfast egg sandwich is the best in Manhattan that I have experience thus far, hands down.  Fluffy, tasty eggs mixed with bacon and surrounded by homemade biscuits.  Heaven on earth.  Then there's the fried chicken, loudly crispy, moist, seasoned to perfection.  The service is attentive enough but has room for some improvement.  You want brunch here?  Get your ass their early then.  Hah.  Lovely to have this in the neighborhood"
1/7/2020,4 star rating,What a spectacular place to visit.....it is truly a place to visit when in Harlem. Be forewarned that the place is much larger than the old space but it still gets packed very quickly. It is on a corner of goodness and people just like to see what is going on ... there's been some celebs trotting around there as well ....
7/27/2019,5 star rating,"This was a great experience. my friend order a peach and macadamia nut pancakes and I ordered the cat fish and grits breakfast. We made reservations on yelp and we were immediately seated when we arrive.  once seated I noticed all the wait staff and the cooks were all man. ( I guess that's a good thing) Our food arrived in a manner and the food was very delicious, not disappointed at all. Would definitely return."
3/1/2020,1 star rating,"For whatever reason this establishment can't seem to properly triage its clientele. We made a reservation, arrived on time and we had to wait an additional hour to be seated. What's the point of even making the reservation? What makes matters worse is they aren't apologetic nor are they accommodating. This is the third time I've tried to give the establishment a chance and each time I leave more disappointed than the last. I've run out of empathy and I won't go back to this restaurant."
11/24/2018,4 star rating,"This review started out with a 1  rating, but ended up at 4 s cause the food was so damn good; I had to be fair.   My waiter was way off with the service provided.  This was interesting to me, because I can tell he's actually really good at what he does... my vibe may have been off [not an excuse for him], but too many missed opportunities during our interaction.  Hence a lower than 5 star rating.    So, to the real deal ....no hot cocoa and very limited selection of juices.  I ordered well done beacon with eggs over easy... these are served with home fries, a homemade biscuit and a great selection of condiments.   My beacon was served burnt to a crisp and the eggs were actually well done.  The waiter offered fresh ground pepper and that all a well done plate really needs.  With the exception of the burnt beacon, everything was super delicious!  Even the well done eggs that should've been easy... do good, that I had to get some eatable beacon.  I asked the waiter if another piece of beacon was ready to go, meaning I wanted to have it right away to continue enjoying my meal, and was told I had to order a side of beacon for $9.  Not to delay my meal with a debate, I said go ahead with the order, as I intended to follow up on the back end.  After some delay, perfectly prepared beacon arrived and I finished my meal.  I disputed the $9 at checkout and it was credited... the waiter offered a handshake after checkout and I took this a some form of him acknowledging his misstep; I respected that.  I'm under the impression that the food is generally great here and will return soon... please don't mess with my meal for retribution"
12/30/2018,4 star rating,We waited an hour to be seated for 3 which was fine..all the staff were friendly  and you do feel at home . Food was good. Just disappointed in catfish n grits...it was more like a snack and for $24 we expected more...shrimp and grits  were good...im from the south so we make our grits thicker  but they were season good and shrimp  was cooked perfectly ..pancakes were good
8/12/2018,5 star rating,"Stopped in at BLVD Bistro for brunch after looking at a few menus in the area. We were lucky to get a table, only had to wait 5 minutes or so. The restaurant is quaint and cluttered with soul decor and incredible music from all decades. Our server Jasmine was exceptional, and it's obvious that the place runs like a well organized machine. We waited about 20-25 minutes for our food, which was the best part of our visit. I ordered the omelette with a side of cheese grits, which were unique and tasteful. A must have when you visit. I'm not in the neighborhood often, but I for sure have a reason to come back! Highly recommend!"

10/2/2019,5 star rating,"An amazing brunch spot. This is our go-to whenever friends visit us in Harlem and everyone is always incredibly happy. The biscuit sandwiches, pancakes, cheesy grits, chicken are all amazing. I've tried a number of other things on their bfast menu and it never disappoints. Even the scrambled eggs are amazing - once I nearly asked how the heck they make them so yummy."

9/3/2019,4 star rating,"If you plan on coming for Sunday brunch - MAKE A RESERVATION. I ended up waiting over an hour for a table but once seated, everything else was great. Music is good, servers are friendly and the food is well worth the wait! I ordered the shrimp and grits which came with a biscuit. The grits were perfectly cheesy and the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked. So looking forward to coming back!"

All in all, the food makes up for it and the drinks are AWESOME. It's cute and cozy but I really wouldn't recommend it for big groups it's cramped, and better suited for a date night."

My frieenda and i went there for brunch and it was GREAT !  The food was great, the service was nice, the prices werre good and the music was poppin! It was 90's and late 80's everything we could relate to (70's and 60's babies). DJ MsSaigon is the truth. She had us leaving out of there dancIng.

3/20/2016,4 star rating,"The biscuits are melt in your mouth delicious. I can't get them out of my mind 7 hours later. I also ordered the side of cheesy grits which are thick and filling. She had the banana pancakes. Light and fluffy, they were also pretty great for pancakes. The only complaint was the drinks. And we were a little surprised to be sat at a table for 4 along with another 2 ppl who were there already. I usually don't mind communal eating like this but Sunday brunch is a delicate matter. Our company was just way too loud and animated for us two nursing our slight hangovers. Come with a group of 4 and you won't have to worry about this issue. Will definitely come back for the chicken dinner one night."
2/27/2018,5 star rating,Guys. Eat here. I'm not even done with my meal and it's getting 5 stars. Authentic homemade soul food. Homemade ranch and cane butter! What?! I'm never bringing visitors anywhere else in Harlem for soul food in the future. Also quaint and precious - flowers on the tables in the ground floor of a brownstone. Eat here!
6/30/2019,4 star rating,Great food!!! Kind of slow but very nice accommodating hostesses and waiters. Would recommend.
9/12/2016,5 star rating,"Came here for Sunday brunch having made a reservation. Some places still make you wait awhile even with a reservation, but here we didn't make more than a few minutes. Great start!Our waitress was really sweet and recommended the spiked tea and catfish. Spiked tea was dangerously good and the catfish was so so tasty. They've definitely perfected the recipe. Also I don't normally like grits but omg I couldn't get enough of theirs. So cheesy and not runny!My report on biscuits matches the others I must say. Really moist and buttery! Couldn't get enough! Had it on biscuit sandwich form and eggs (which I'm also not a huge fan of) were cooked to perfection. Oh watermelon salad was great too! Watermelon was so sweet and I have no idea what they put in that heavenly dressing. If you have a sweet tooth definitely get the pancakes. The peaches didn't overpower the meal and the syrups on the table were fun to try. So fluffy!Can't wait for an excuse to come back. Atmosphere is excellent with church music and the grad chef peeking out every now and then. So much yes."
11/19/2015,3 star rating,"Adjoa S. and I had a very unusual experience here on a Saturday afternoon. Summary: BLVD messed up, and they messed up real good. But they made up for it.At about 1:30pm, we had a 30 minute wait. Luckily, it was still warm enough to eat outside, and our host did a good job making sure we knew he remembered us and was getting us a table ASAP. The brunch menu is short, but there's something on it for everyone. Adjoa opted for the Pan Fried Chicken Dinner, and I went for the catfish and grits. We had a lot of catching up to do, and we barely noticed time pass until we saw the people next to us, who sat down after us, getting their food before us. About 45 minutes into waiting, we flagged our host and asked what was up. He was shocked and said he'd find out. About 15 minutes later, we were brought complimentary mimosas an a big apology. We felt appeased and knew our food was coming soon.But then another 20 minutes later - with more of a buzz - we still had no food. We cared less in our heads, but our stomachs were growling. We checked in again. Everyone was shocked we had no food. We were immediately told our already-complimetary drinks, food, and dessert would be comped. An hour and a half later, we had our main dishes and another mimosa. We gobbled the food down, which was good but, honestly, at that point, anything was going to be good. I think we would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't been so hungry.We were never asked about dessert but, honestly, at that point, we had other things to do with our day and were finally satiated.I'd like to give BLVD 4 stars for their food, but I can't in good conscious given how badly they messed up checking on our order more than twice. Maybe sneak a granola bar in your bag if you plan to come here, just in case."
1/21/2018,5 star rating,"IN LOVE! I came here for my birthday. Sunday they played gospel music so i felt at home. The owner/cook came out to check on some tables to ask how is everything going. His wife was the one seating people and greeting them. It definitely felt like a family business. The waitress and waiters were perfect. They didn't focus on checking on just on their tables they went to every table to make sure everyone was comfortable and happy. I didnt get to take a picture of my food because I couldnt wait to eat haha but I had a homemade biscuit with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and turkey bacon. They also put jelly on the side just in case I wanted to add. I have nothing bad to say. I am going back soon so I can show my mother how great this restaurant is."

1/11/2020,3 star rating,"This is my 2nd visit to Blvd Bistro--my 1st at the new location. Although we had a reservation, we decided to wait for another table that was larger than a serving platter--that's what we were initially offered. We were told, ""a table will be open soon, the diners are getting ready to leave."" We then waited an additional 7 mins and were finally seated in the back room.The waitress was kind but inattentive. The food, delicious--especially the biscuits. The sides were too small, about a ""scoop.""Would I dine here again? Maybe later (Fall 2020) but not anytime soon."
12/3/2017,2 star rating,"As someone who never write reviews, based on my  recent experience, I am compelled to write. The food is good, the staff are friendly and the space is small but cozy.The CHEF makes the place what it is. He is clearly a great chef because of the reviews on the food. I have witnessed on many occasions, his interactions with his staff and patrons. He is relaxed and friendly. I love the way he comes out and mingle with everyone.Now for the two stars and the reason for this review!His wife is not a nice woman. She wears her emotions all on her face. When any of the staff members are handling the reservations/seating, it is orderly and courteous. Once she arrives, she becomes very aggressive and acts as if she is highly bothered by it all. She can be down right rude, then smiles and acts like it is a joke!  People stay around because the food is good and everyone knows that when she is not there and CHEF is running things, it's relaxed and everyone feels welcomed. She is clearly upset if CHEF comes out to speak with anyone. Hopefully, she will read this and make the adjustment. This is not meant to be a negative review. Justhate to see a great place in the neighborhood goes to the tombs because of attitude."

The chicken and biscuit appetizer was perfect but truth be told it was the ridiculous ranch dipping sauce that took it from predictable to inspiring! Don't miss the okra and please order the seven mac and cheese to start! The pork chop makes you wonder if you are in a ""steakhouse"" with the thick double cut... And then the dry rub flavor reminds you that you are dining with soul! From the meatloaf to the Mississippi style grouper you cannot go wrong. And... Don't forget dessert! Apple cobbler shouldn't be missed!"
8/27/2019,2 star rating,"I don't know... I think unless the owner/chef himself is actually in the kitchen cooking or, at least in the restaurant to check on things in the kitchen, the food is just not as good. I was a regular for awhile at the old location, until I had a not-so-good experience. The owners were very diligent in rectifying the matter, when I brought it to their attention. I decided to give the new location a try. I had brunch in the restaurant a couple of weeks ago. Everything was good (the owner was there). Tonight, I ordered take out and I'm sorry to say, that I had to throw most of it away. Biscuits were extremely dry, chicken was over battered, bland and undercooked. The greens were ok. What a waste."
2/23/2018,5 star rating,"Let me calm down before I delve into the greatness that is BLVD Bistro.I have frequented Harlem eateries over the past 10 years or so and have walked, driven, flew past this restaurant several times always glancing in like hmm looks quaint...but never indulged. Until today....blessed Father I come to you with great appreciation for bestowing this blessing upon my lap. Blesssss the hands that created this! I ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of collard greens. Now being the greens connoisseur that I am, I had to eat the greens first. Now I'm opposed to putting bell pepper in my greens but these babies hereeeeee?!?! My God, they taste like they were slow cooked by somebody's great grandmother back in the 80's in those big deep pots! The right amount of smokey flavor, spices and tenderness. 5 out of 5 for me. Onto the shrimp and grits...I am speechless! The grits consistency is perfect, the shrimp is fresh (not that sometimes fishy flavor), perfect amount of cheese and I dont eat bacon but the bacon added the perfect flavor. This establishment will get plenty more of my business. Next time instead of ordering via Uber Eats I will dine in.Greatttttttt job BLVD Bistro!"
3/12/2016,5 star rating,"O.M.G. I am never making grits again. It would be a crime! Birthday brunch with a loved one turned into an unforgettable present to me. It's a small place but packs a flavorful punch. The cheese grits have ruined anyone else's attempt to satisfy my tastebuds; and I'm from the South! We start eating grits after breast milk. The neighborhood is picturesque. The staff are professional, helpful, and engaging. It was a fabulous start to the day that made every experience after better just to think of it. Perfect for breakfast, brunch, lunch, casual second date, friends outings."
7/9/2018,4 star rating,"Stopped here for Saturday brunch after a long bike ride. The staff was friendly and accommodating; I arrived half hour early for my reservation and the hostess sat us quickly. They even let me and my partner store our bikes safely on the side, of the building inside the gate while we sat outside to eat. The biscuits and cane syrup butter are delicious. I also enjoyed the collards. I didnt try the drinks (bc I was biking lol) so I have to go back again. The organic eggs platter was satisfying; my partner devoured his jumbo shrimp and grits. The place has a decent menu with a variety of options; it can get pricey so plan ahead for that. However, I'm all for supporting a delicious, Black owned business and will be back."
4/2/2018,5 star rating,"I am all about enjoying fun filled brunch with goo food and drinks, BLVD Bistro did not disappoint. I hav had my eye on this place for a while and finally got the opportunity to visit over the weekend. If you plan to visit for brunch, do yourself a favor and make a reservation. The place is small and there were plenty of people that had to wait over an hour because they didn't have a reservation. I'm glad that I had one. I ordered the biscuit sandwiches with chicken. My friend ordered the Mac n cheese and to share we ordered bacon and cheese grits which came highly recommended by our server Jasmine. Thank god she low key made us get them because although everything was delicious, the cheese grits stole the show. I could totally go back here just for those grits. They don't offer bottomless brunch drinks, however, there are carafes of them that you can order. Between three of us we finished two carafes of bellinis. I don't know about you, but this is important information to know. All in all we had a great time here. Shouts to Jasmine for taking care of us. See you again soon!"
11/16/2017,3 star rating,"The food here is very good. Some of the best are the chicken egg and cheese biscuits, the catfish and grits and the blueberry pancakes! The staff is very hospitable, but the only down side is that the restaurant is very small and it takes forever to get your table - even with a reservation. During the summer they have the outside patio open, which helps. But when it gets cold, the wait can be extremely long (especially on a Sunday for brunch). Perhaps I'll try going during the week for dinner to see if that makes a difference."

12/27/2019,1 star rating,"I do not recommend this place! Very poor customer service. The waiter by the name of Zarius took about 20 minutes to acknowledge us. She was inattentive. I had to flag her down each time to order appetizers, drinks, dinner, glass of water... Not to mention there was no drink menu available. The only time she became attentive was when it was time to pick up the check."
8/23/2020,2 star rating,"Food is ok, if you think of fat and salt as food groups. The bad 80th music is too loud (people yell at each other and 6 feet distance is an idea not reality) . I get it, if you can't talk you drink, but the drinks are too sweet. I was really hoping they fill a void in the neighborhood, but they are trying so hard to be the 80th partyboys - bad sign and the food proves it."
12/26/2019,1 star rating,"WAY!! Overpriced and overratedI went here b/c I was told they had soul food.   The food was very bland and didn't taste good at all.  For the type of food and service this place is too expensive.  The portions are also very small.  I had the catfish greens & mac&Cheese. With a side of the soup of the day.  A Creamy Potato soup.  The entire meal taste like a microwave dinner! The soup wasn't creamy but chalky and was awful.  My friend had the Fried Chicken which was ok in taste and the same sides as me.  We both didn't finish our sides.  The hot sauce they serve should be called fire sauce.  I only tried a small portion on my cat fish, hoping that it would give it some flavor and it ruined it.  The hot sauce was so hot we had to order more water.  Only water and the bill came to $74 with tip.  Total waste of money and my time.  NEVER going back! Just awful food and overpriced.  They will be closing soon!"
8/21/2016,5 star rating,"Pros:- The food here is amazing. I have been here on several occasions for brunch and everything is always on point. I typically have the catfish and grits. The catfish is always fried just right, the grits are flavorful with the perfect amount of cheese and the biscuits, accompanied with the homemade honey butter, all come together for a really good, satisfying meal.- The service has always been quick and fast and despite how busy the place can get they are always attentive. - Just an overall really nice, homey feeling from the resturant.Cons:- The mimosas here were just ok but at the price point (about $10 for one!) its a negative point from me.- Minor but the place gets packed and you are not allowed to make reservations for 2 people.- Another minor point, but if you plan to eat here as a party of 2 be preparaed to share your table with another party. Because of the small space it is pretty much unavoidableAll in all still a 4.5/5 resturant, which I will round up to a 5 because the visit here is worth it."

12/22/2019,4 star rating,It was the perfect setting for a first date. I had the catfish dinner with potato salad & collard greens. It was delicious! My only beef was that there was no drink list  BUT our server & bartender Zarius was able to come up with something tasty  She was awesome & went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
10/26/2019,2 star rating,"The food is good, but once again another greedy owner is alienating the neighborhood. The biscuit sandwich was $12 last month, now it's been raised 50% to $18. It's still the same egg, cheese, bacon and biscuit. Greed like this puts a bad taste in my mouth, and forces me out of principal to move on to another restaurant. Meanwhile harlem tavern across the street offers you a drink with their meals for a better price as well."
10/15/2015,4 star rating,"This is definitely my new spot. I loved the ambiance, and the wait staff were all very friendly!I got the shrimp and grits, and a side of potato salad, and my friend and I shared apple cobbler for dessert. It was all delicious! The biscuits are awesome!I did take off one star for the seating, the tables and booth chairs are not bolted to the floor, so they seemed to move back and forth, it took a while to get them in a place that were comfortable. The servers were EXTREMELY friendly, but it did take some time to get them to attend to us at times, but in their defense it was a fairly busy night. I can't wait to come back for brunch!"
6/16/2018,2 star rating,"That was a mess. Took Auntie out for her birthday. She is an older woman who doesn't eat much, so she only ordered wings. They said it would take a long time because it's raw. Well, I'm glad it wasn't pre-cooked. Then the kitchen didn't time it right with the entrees and ended up burning the chicken. So they gave her biscuits to hold her over. But that hold over was forever. She was never served any food. She was disgusted and asked to be taken home. At least they eventually tried to make good by comping drinks. They even brought out a slice of cake with a candle in it, but she was already gone.The atmosphere was nice, music was good, servers were pleasant. And at the they tried to address things. But the kitchen is apparently a shyte show. And this is a restaurant so... that's not good."

9/8/2019,4 star rating,"Great ambiance with an amazing Afro-centric vibes. Food was seasoned well and they gave good portion sizes. Being that you should make a reservations is not a problem at all. It just makes a night out into a nice dinner with good vibes. Only two things I didn't like were the seating was close to others, in which it made it seem like everyone was in the same conversation but talking about different things. The seconds was we were told the biscuits we ordered would take some time to come which is fine, but when they arrived it seemed like they were sitting because they were cold which interfered with the taste. Overall it was a great place to go to and I will definitely go back."
2/13/2016,4 star rating,"Came here with my friends for dinner after going snowboarding upstate. So with that in mind, we were hungry. The restaurant was filled so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 5 people. We sat in a raised table that had a party of 2 on the end.Complimentary baby biscuits and cinnamon butter. There one one biscuit for each of us. We definitely craved more of them but knew we had to save space for our food and alcohol. To drink, we all had the ice tea mixed with Prosecco. We had two rounds of drinks. For our meal, my friend and I split the fried chicken sliders. Then, we each got one of the Mac and Cheeses respectively. We got our Mac And Cheese first and started devouring it. I love my Mac and Cheese burnt at the top. It was a delicious overload of cheese. The chicken sliders came late to the table so I was already pretty full. I ended up putting the chicken on my Mac and cheese and leaving the biscuit behind. I was super bummed that my friends and I did not save room for dessert. I was eyeing the peach cobbler with ice cream. Bill came out to $60/person. (Including tip). I blame the drinks for making the bill a bit high for my liking. Service was good!"

12/6/2018,4 star rating,Came here this past Sunday with no reservation was seated within 20 minutes of arrival. Atmosphere was perfect for brunch. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly! We all ordered the Chicken and French Toast which was delicious! The portion is resting enough for 2 people to share. Mimosas were nice and strong! Will definitely come back !
12/2/2018,4 star rating,"Came here yesterday afternoon we had a reservation for 1:30. When we arrived it was very packed. The hostess was very friendly and seated us when a table opened up. I got the pan seared shrimp and cheddar cheese grits. The portion was a great size. The meal was tasty but i would definitely try some other things off the menu when i visit again. Overall, my experience was great. Our waiter was very attentive, the restaurant was clean and they played good music the whole time we were there. I would definitely recommend."
8/30/2019,5 star rating,"First time I've been to NY in many, many years and never to Harlem. This restaurant had amazing brunch. The biscuits were light as air and the egg, potatoes and bacon were just what I was looking for. Rather a long wait but worth it. My husband had the homemade blueberry pancakes and they were to die for. I would go back in a heartbeat."
2/17/2018,5 star rating,"If you want real delicious SOUL food, look no further! We started with the sausage gravy biscuits, mind you they give you biscuits with apple butter sauce so I was full already. Then a 7 cheese Mac!!!! Our entrees were the BBQ ribs, the meat fell right off the bone and the sauce was finger lickin good! The fried chicken was crispy goodness and you can change sides so we had the baked bean with bacon and mash potatoes! The desserts looked amazing but we had to take half our meal home so we opted out but I want to go back for them! Sweet tea and Arnold Palmer was on point! You have to make a reservation because it's always packed! It's a small place but I hear they are moving to a bigger location but it's perfect for a date or group of 3-4."
11/19/2017,4 star rating,"This place is AMAZING! Here's the rundown:I came here on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner with 5 friends. We are from the D.C. area. I initially planned for dinner in Midtown but my AirBnB was closer to Harlem and traffic is a mess on Saturday night. This was myPlan B, should have been my Plan A from the start!Although it doesn't seem to be a typical birthday dinner spot, the vibes here are really welcoming and it was exactly what we needed! We made a reservation for 9 through Yelp, changed it to 9:30pm by phone with no problems. The only issue is that once we arrived, we waited for 20 minutes before getting seated but we took pictures while waiting. I suggest calling ahead and preparing for a wait because the place is small. Don't let this discourage you, the food is great! Once seated, the service was excellent! We were offered the drink menus and suggestions for good dinner options. The menu is soul food and although I'm not crazy about soul food, it was really good. I got the pan fried chicken meal with potato salad and greens. Absolutely delicious and I had enough to take with me. My friends got the shrimp and grits and everyone loved it! When we were leaving, the restaurant was closing but they sliced me a huge piece of chocolate cake on the house. This wasn't some basic piece of cake y'all, this was a decadent slice that 2-3 people could finish! One of the waitresses also gave me recommendations for where to go out in Harlem after dinner. Super helpful! Overall wonderful hospitality and great service. Really enjoyed myself and made my trip to NYC worth it."
9/29/2015,3 star rating,"So this is a cute quaint place and local, me and my girls randomly selected this venue based off reviews and locale and the need for girl time. And my desire to eat at every new establishment in Harlem. The staff pleasant enough though at times one may have felt rushed with the persistency of the bussing staff (normally I would've admired the attentiveness, but our guy just gave the air of......""your holding up a table"").Also disappointing was the limited bar situa which I and a few of my girls had missed in reviewing the menu prior to arriving. My recollection was that there was some sort black business participation/restaurant week type thing was happening (I've now fallen into the habit of writing my reviews several weeks or months after visiting a place, so certain info escapes me at times......bad habit I'm trying to break). In any event, the regular menu was limited and pricey (I think everything was al a carte (so don't go hungry) compared to the prixe fixe menu which had some decent choices but equally limited as most prixe fixe menus go, yet I still wished certain items were on the regular menu like the bed of greens with watermelon and some kinda Cajun shrimp......very #Yummy.It was also pleasant to learn that the former manager of Cecil is now managing Blvd Bistro. He has a very out going attitude and attentiveness vibe about him and generally makes you smile.Alas his good nature unfortunately will probably not have me go back to this establishment even with the quaint environment, pleasant staff......well almost pleasant (bus boy needs work) and interesting yet limited menu that I could live with on occasion. I think the priceness and lack of a decent bar menu did me in."
10/11/2015,2 star rating,"Small and lively sit-down restaurant with modern take on soul food. Ultimately overpriced and underwhelming. Two people ordered for sharing:Appetizer Fried Chicken Sliders $14Side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes $7Seven Cheese Macaroni $18One Blvd Spiked Sweet Tea $10One Red Sangria $11Total bill $65Pros: -service is very friendly. In fact, I was late, but they still held our table despite having some people already waiting. Really appreciated that.-Fried chicken, even just in the sliders- delicious! Moist and perfect. I would imagine the pan fried chicken main course is also delicious. -biscuits were pretty good, but the butter is what makes them worth it-music selection is on point! Provides great ambiance to your meal, but is a bit too loud for conversation. Cons:-price for portion size. The side of garlic mashed potatoes comes in a skillet the size of my tiny palm. Literally maybe like three scoops. The two starter biscuits are SMALLER than the size of my palm, more expensive than the potatoes! Lastly, the macaroni is about two handfuls; almost the price of the other two dishes combined.-taste: underwhelming. Again, apart from the chicken, nothing blew my mind. The potatoes were extremely bland; you can't even taste the garlic or any salt. The macaroni was also bland, and extremely greasy. There was literally a pool of grease in the casserole when we would scoop it out. The macaroni also claims to be topped by bacon, but it must have been invisible bacon because I couldn't see or taste it. -smoky interior. Very smoky. I assume the kitchen has bad ventilation and therefore the dining area looks like everybody had tree cigarettes going. Summary: I'd pass on this place. The cost just isn't worth any of the food. If you live nearby and want to spend some money, get the chicken."

9/17/2015,4 star rating,"Came here last night for dinner as it was participating in Black Owned Restaurant Month (s/o to I Don't Do Clubs). Upon arriving, I was impressed by the quaint outdoor seating and greeted inside by who I assume was the owner. The gentleman was very polite and told us that the wait would be about 20 mins. As you can imagine, the restaurant was very small, maybe about 4 booths and 4 tables, and it being BORM, there were a lot of patrons. Several people left due to the wait, but my party stuck it out. When we were finally seated, we waited for our waitress and menus for about 15 mins. I finally told the owner that we had been waiting for so long and he was so kind, apologized, and offered us two rounds of cocktails on the house :) The first course was a delicious mixed greens salad tossed in a wonderful vinegarette. For the second course, we had the choice of a 1/2 rack of BBQ ribs, catfish, or baked chicken. Unfortunately, but fortunately for us, the kitchen had run out of catfish and the BBQ ribs, so we were able to substitute with fried chicken. That chicken was to DIE for! It took a while to cook, but my God was it good. Seasoned to perfection and just the right amount of juiciness. It came paired with a side of collards and potato salad - and I'm not a fan of potato salad, but HONEY, that stuff was IT. I could not stop singing the praises of that meal. The third course was a banana bread pudding a la mode (with ice cream) and that too was so good. Although, the restaurant is small, I would definitely come back because the chef is doing something right. And the owner is so hospitable and makes you feel at home, I had a wonderful time a BLVD :)"
3/6/2016,3 star rating,"I've been to BLVD bistro before and this was my second trip. I've ordered the shrimp with grits which is always pretty good. However, this time I ordered the catfish and grits. The breading was a little soggy but I enjoyed the cheddar grits and the biscuits. After we finished our brunch we decided to order the banana bread as a dessert. Mid way through this banana bread my boyfriend orders another glass of sangria. The waitress then says ""oh just so you know we have other tables waiting to be seated Oh but don't rush."" I haven't even finished my food but you're already inferring that we should be mindful and prepared to leave? The idea is that you make reservations for a reason and you eat your food and enjoy the ambiance. Then the wrong bill is brought to the table. It would be more efficient if the time limit was specified during the time reservations are made. Also we were only there for about 50 minutes and other tables had been seated well before us ans were still there at the table enjoying beverages and were not rushed. The manager came over to apologize for the waitress' sad delivery."
11/17/2019,5 star rating,This was a great experience. Special thanks to the hostess who held my reservation even tho I was late. My waiter was DeSean. He knew the menu very well. I like that he did not hover around us nor did we have to look for him.  Our food came out fast but not suspicious fast. I had the country fried steak meal with eggs and cheddar grits. It was a good cut of meat flavorful. Not too much breading. Grits were thick and creamy. The highlight that comes with the dishes were the biscutis.  Nice soft flaky biscuits will keep anyone coming back for me.  If you're needing a veggie go with the collard greens. Cooked with turkey meat for flavor. These were some of the best restaurant greens I've had and most importantly they NO STEMS.
8/11/2019,4 star rating,"I got here at 5pm with a friend but they told us they actually open at 6pm. So we had a drink and waited at another place until it was time. The waitstaff is very friendly, attentive and sometimes funny. We shared the biscuits in gravy which tasted more like béchamel sauce than gravy, but still really good and filling. I had the southern dinner with catfish, collard greens and potato salad. They serve it with a thousand Island sauce and a spicy, but not overwhelming, red sauce. The portions are pretty big, I had to take some home. The bathroom is clean, rustic, big and unique. I do want to come back to try the shrimp and grits and other items on the menu."
3/24/2016,4 star rating,This place was on point.  We came here for Saturday brunch and I have the fried chicken which did not disappoint.  The greens were full of flavor and the potato salad was tasty.  The restaurant has a fun vibe with an outdoor patio when there is nice weather.  It is a small brown stone and some table with parties of 2 were doubled up. I love in the south and visit NYC often.  This place is right with the same flavors of American Soul food I am used to back home.  Great meal and Great service.
8/4/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down, the BEST biscuits in the City.  You'll never be able to eat them anywhere else after these.  Beautiful renovation, genuinely warm and welcoming wait staff.  If you could prep some grits without cheese, for the lactose intolerant among us, that would be a real treat!So happy to witness your success in this more high profile location."
10/23/2015,5 star rating,"Came here for Saturday brunch recently and was so happy that this place lived up to its full potential - and thensome!The manager/host was very accommodating when we needed a table for two with no reservations at such a busy time.  I arrived about 20 minutes before my friend and tried to put my name on a ""list"" so that we wouldn't have to wait.  But - as most places - they won't seat you until your entire party is there.  No biggie.  Once she arrived, we were seated within 2 minutes.The service was excellent this time around - not too fast, not too slow.  Our server was very friendly, as were the others, who smiled at most of the patrons.The food was - again - amazing.  I ordered the banana pecan pancakes.  They were heavenly delicious.  Seriously - I imagine if you ordered pancakes in heaven, they would be these exact pancakes!  My friend ordered the blueberry buttermilk pancakes and she thought there were really good.  We shared a side of turkey bacon and home fries.  Both were good.  I enjoyed the unique homefries because they were not the traditional greasier fries - and trust me, I love me some greasy home fries - they were cut potatoes seasoned and served with, I think, sauerkraut.Only suggestion I would have is to have alternative milk options - my friend is allergic to milk and dairy, so she couldn't have any coffee because there was no almond milk, soy milk, etc.  If the muffin cart on 135th now has almond milk for an extra dollar - no reason for a restaurant not to have an alternative.Overall - so happy that I had the great experience I was hoping for.  Will absolutely return!"
8/1/2014,3 star rating,"I'm not sure how to review this restaurant.  I like the modern decorations in the mostly-brick walled establishment - makes it feel hip and cozy.But - like most other Harlem restaurants and bars, the service is lacking.  Our server was nice and friendly, but our drinks and appetizers took a while to come out.  During the wait, we were basically forgotten by our server.  I figured we'd get some sort of explanation as to why our drinks and apps took so long - as did our dinner - but we didn't.  That experience, sadly, fell in line with most of my experiences in Harlem spots.  HARLEM - Please, pretty please, I love ya - so I ask that you step-it-up in the service department.Drinks - We both agreed that, although good, they tasted a bit weak.Food - Mine was 5 stars.  My friend was 2.5 stars.  I ordered the beef short rib tacos and my friend ordered a salad.  We were both very happy with our apps.  I ordered the mac 'n cheese for entree - and mine came out hot and delicious.  I rarely eat a mac 'n cheese that can even remotely compete with my own amazing mac 'n cheese - but this place was a close competitor.  Very good.  My friend ordered the braised beef short ribs.  Unfortunately, her food came out cold.  She said the flavor was very good, but it seemed like the food was sitting around for a while.We shared the apple cobbler for dessert - this is LEGIT!!!  Seriously amazing.If they can improve their service, I'd easily up this review to 4 or 5 stars.  I'd love to have regular places to patronize in my neighborhood, and this would certainly be a go-to for me if I could count on more attentive service."
5/24/2020,5 star rating,Just got some shrimp and grits with sangria. If this is heaven or my last meal...I am satisfied. Perfectly cooked shrimp with grits made with bacon and cheese and scallions. Thank you for this blessing. Please come and support this amazing restaurant.
3/17/2020,2 star rating,"Arrogant, aloof and inattentive waiter made this experience a challenge. The shrimp and grits which have been great in the past was horrible.

6/17/2015,5 star rating,"Man oh man!  A diamond in the rough this place.  I'm so glad I was able to get the experience here.  I never have nothing nice to say about soul foo spots in NY, but this one is good!I wanted to get out the house so I decided that myself and little one would go for lunch.  I've had bad experiences at Sylvia's and Amy Ruth's so I was a little skeptical about this place.  We walked on over and the rest was history. The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about all menu items.  I ordered the fried grouper with okra, tomatoes and corn and the baby got macaroni with bacon.  As I wait for our food I looked around and the decor is nice and chillaxed. It's a small spot but is nicely decorated and comfortable. I also loved how they have the soundtrack of my high school life playing in the background lol. The music is perfect for this place. We received our food at a good time. The baby's macaroni was good and my grouper was so delicious!!!  I was honored to meet the chef himself and he's a nice guy. This is most definitely my spot to visit when I come. They also have brunch on Saturdays."
10/19/2015,3 star rating,"Cute little restaurant on an otherwise sleepy block on Malcolm X. The service is nice and warm, and the atmosphere is energetic. Highly recommend making reservations for brunch because the waits can be crazy, and everyone was looking real sullen at the door, waiting for their turns to stuff their faces..The food was pretty good:- Biscuit sandwiches were delicious - eggs scrambled with pecan bacon and placed inside the fluffiest biscuits. We saved the tops of the biscuit sandwiches for the awesome brown sugar maple butter they place on the table. Like melty, melty goodness.- Chicken dinner plate came two boneless chicken breasts to a plate with (usually collard greens, but today, thin long green beans) and potato salad. The chicken came a bit cold and soft, which was disappointing, since all of the other reviews on here proclaimed 'BESTFRIEDCHICKENINHARLEM,' which isn't true. It might've been different if you ordered the chicken and biscuit platter, as the chicken comes served in a little fryer basket (yes, so cute) and maybe that means you get a more freshly made batch. Who knows. Anyway, the chicken was also bland, but instantly tasted better with a slather of the ol' sugar butter.We had wanted to try the bread pudding that everyone was RAVING about here also, and the waitress assured us there was plenty to try at the beginning of the meal, however, at the end of the meal, there was no bread pudding (why she couldn't reserve a piece for us since we specially requested at the beginning of our meal, no clue), so that was a bit disappointing.I know. Life can be so sad without bread pudding !"
5/30/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing!! This place is a hidden gem with a great vibe. The staff is incredibly nice , and they all seems to work together very well. We ordered the Wings and they were just incredible. Perfectly fried and had a wonderful lightly sweetened glaze that was mouth watering! I had the Blvd Southern Dinner which is fried chicken with collards and potato salad. Again, the chicken was perfectly fried!! And the portion was big! I would order this dish over and over again. My friend had the catfish poboy and she bragged about the great tasting combination of the fried fish with the coleslaw. We also had the Mac and Cheese, which to no surprise was great. They use 7 different cheeses and each piece of pasta is smothered in amazing flavor. They also give you complimentary biscuits which are served warm with their own butter mix. The biscuits were very light and delicious. If you like fried chicken you must come try this place. You will leave stuffed and happy!!"

12/16/2018,1 star rating,"Super small restaurant with tables way too close together. Very loud place with Terrible service- I asked for the fried chicken basket ($22) and they gave me the blvd dinner ($28) instead which includes fried chicken. I didn't realize this was not the original meal I ordered until I got the bill and saw I was charged for a different, more expensive order. I explained to waiter that there was a mistake and they gave me the wrong meal and the waiter blamed me for not pointing out the difference right away even though I've never been to restaurant before and didn't know the difference between the two different orders... never EVER going back again."

12/15/2018,4 star rating,Wonderful food for brunch and dinner. My only complaint is that they are amateurs when it comes to reservations and seating efficiency. Been turned away twice because they didn't have the ability to accommodate basic reservations we had made. Embarrassing for out of town guests.

12/6/2018,4 star rating,Came here this past Sunday with no reservation was seated within 20 minutes of arrival. Atmosphere was perfect for brunch. Our waiter was so attentive and friendly! We all ordered the Chicken and French Toast which was delicious! The portion is resting enough for 2 people to share. Mimosas were nice and strong! Will definitely come back !
12/2/2018,4 star rating,"Came here yesterday afternoon we had a reservation for 1:30. When we arrived it was very packed. The hostess was very friendly and seated us when a table opened up. I got the pan seared shrimp and cheddar cheese grits. The portion was a great size. The meal was tasty but i would definitely try some other things off the menu when i visit again. Overall, my experience was great. Our waiter was very attentive, the restaurant was clean and they played good music the whole time we were there. I would definitely recommend."

12/1/2018,5 star rating,"This place is like a scene out of one of the classic 70's movies Claudine. I had such a great dining experience here for lunch and can't wait to share it with others. The only time I travel to Harlem is when I'm in the mood for down home southern cuisine at Amy Ruth's . I had my doubts coming due to the reviews here but the service exceeded my expectations. My friend suggested we dine for lunch with her 1 year old. Our server was Malik and he was great. The staff here was so friendly and the food was very good. I ordered the Catfish Po Boy served with a nice pickled Cole Slaw and a skillet of potato salad. My friend had the pan fried chicken and biscuits. Our food arrived in perfect time. There were other locals dining and conversing but it wasn't crowded around 2:00. The catfish was perfectly breaded, light and crispy. I've had a Po Boy previously and this was the best. Everything was fresh and the presentation of the food was perfection. The potato salad was nice and light not covered in mayonnaise. My friend's 1 year old loved it.Above all, I loved the ambiance here. The selection of classic 70's rhythm and blues oldies like the OJAYs and Gladys Knight and The Pips being played while we dined was so dear to my heart and gave me the feel of the old Harlem. I loved the art work here ! The James Baldwin piece is so dope. Check out the bathroom walls here. So cool! Covered with the spirit of Harlem. The essence of black history. I can't wait to return for dinner and dessert."

2/23/2019,1 star rating,"This place has so much potential. I wanted it to be good I was excited to eat here because the food looked good. The wait time was about 30 mins but we didn't wait that long which was the only good thing about coming here. Although the space is very small it wasn't the issue for us. The service is terrible, I asked for more coffee and they just pretended to not listen or hear me but I never receive it. I ordered the biscuit sandwich and my husband ordered Mac and cheese. He got his fairly fast but I got my order maybe 25 mins later and it was the wrong order I didn't want to say anything because I was starving at this point. He comes back maybe 10 mins later after I'm half way done with the wrong order and gives me my right order doesn't say sorry but said you can take it to go if you want. I will never come back to this place nor would I recommend it."
10/5/2019,2 star rating,TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I waited 30 mins for a sprite. An hour for food. A disappearing waitress named Latoya. She also was a bit snappy with her attitude. The shrimp and grits was good. That was the highlight. Im disappointed to say the least. Smh UPDATE: current wait time for a to go container is 15 mins
8/1/2015,3 star rating,"I have been anxious to try this place and I am glad I finally made it. There were some things BLVD Bistro did amazingly well and some hit or miss items. The service was awesome! The wait at 2:45 p.m. on Saturday for two was very short. Our waitress was attentive and very nice. The atmosphere was a bit hectic with some loud patrons around but nothing too annoying. I ordered the catfish dinner and it was comme si comme ca. The fish was undercooked so I needed to send it back but the cheese grits and biscuit were awesome. The crab cake benedict was delicious. The ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" appeared to be pretty watered down so I won't order that again.The peach cobbler was good. It is made with a biscuit crust which is unique.Overall, it is a good restaurant to try and maybe I will come back but not any time soon. The first attempt was pretty disappointing as far as food and drinks go."
2/15/2019,2 star rating,"This is my second time here. I am very disappointed with my order. I ordered the pan-fried chicken dinner: not worth the money. Chicken lacked seasoning and the potato salad was mediocre. I also ordered the mac and cheese and it was not as good as the first time. The first time I ate here it was dine in. Tonight, I ordered through Postmates. Maybe it's busy or maybe they do not put much thought and effort into take out. Either way if I ever decide to dine here again, I will stick with the brunch items such as the pancakes and the biscuit sandwiches. I'll continue my search for good fried chicken."
7/8/2020,3 star rating,Ordered the wings and Mac n cheese. The wings were butter and had no flavor. The Mac n cheese was oily and tasteless. Not a fan of what I ordered but service was good so I may order a different meal next time just to give them another chance.

1/20/2018,5 star rating,"Today along with 8 friends ventured out for brunch. We made a reservation the night before. Upon arrival we were greeted by one of the owners Markisha and a wonderful greeting it was.  In less than 5 mins our accommodations were ready and we sat down. Initially we were tended to by Solomon who had an amazing personality and took the time to go over the entire menu in great detail and never once seemed to be bothered by all of the question. When asked what he suggested off the menu he literally named everything on the menu ( unbeknownst to us at the time he was dead on correct). A moment later out waiter Ray came over and made his introduction and proceeded to take our orders. Being that the table was full of some very picky folks every order had changes and do's and don'ts, upon him leaving we all joked that someone will inevitably get there order wrong because there was no way he would get that all correct. A few minutes later he began to bring us the bread until our order was ready. The biscuits were melt in your mouth amazing. It came with other little pastries and the most amazing flavored butter (I forgot to inquire as to the flavor).  At this point I'm blown away and sure that this is a fluke and then the food starts to arrive. Time for Ray to mess up this order, not only did he get every order correct he also nailed every little request. As the food arrived all of it looked so delicious. Upon tasting it I knew my eyes didn't deceive me. I had the shrimp and grits. There was a flavor explosion in mouth that was unexpected but very welcomed. Every person in my party completely cleaned the plates. This place is quaint and well worth the price of admission. I highly recommended this bistro. They have immaculate staff and service. The food was phenomenal."
6/4/2015,4 star rating,"I wanted to go for a nice, casual brunch on my 30th birthday (a Sunday) and my husband found BLVD Bistro for us on the same morning. We called ahead to inquire about reservations but they don't accept reservations for two people for brunch. It didn't turn out to be a problem, though. We rolled up at 11am and were seated outside immediately, which was fabulous on a sunny, warm day. The inside was quite bumpin! Note: the seating outside is at communal tables. We had a table to ourselves, though. I can't remember our servers name (Che? Chad? Tre?) but he was awesome. He was  friendly, smooth, funny and professional. He was like the epitome of a good server in my books. Onto the food! I ordered the strawberry pancakes and my husband ordered the biscuit sandwich. Holy Hannah that thing was huuuuuge! I still can't believe he finished the whole thing. My pancakes were really delicious - fluffy and soft on the inside with a slight hint of crisp on the outside - wow. And the serving was huge, I couldn't finish them. I only wish there was a bit more fruit on them. I walked through the inside of the restaurant to get to the washroom and the room seems really cozy and cool. If I ever found myself in this neighbourhood again I would certainly like to hit up BLVD Bistro again and try some other delicious dishes from their menu!"

12/16/2017,4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of this Harlem bistro! The vibe is warm and homey, and the food is delicious. The restaurant only seats about maybe 25 people max, so I would recommend making a reservation. The staff all are incredibly friendly, and I LOVE the soundtrack of R&B classics from the 1960's-80's. Our order began with the homemade biscuits with (what I think was) a maple corn butter. Absolutely addictive! I also took advantage of the happy hour deal and ordered the chicken biscuit appetizer. While *this* biscuit was a little bland and chalky, the chicken was juicy, tender, and went perfectly with the ranch dipping sauce.Now to the entrees. I LOVED their seven cheese mac, topped with bacon. This was probably my favorite dish in the place. The sauce was savory, but not overwhelming, and the pasta (big macaroni curls) tasted fresh. I also enjoyed their panfried chicken dinner. The potato salad was a little meh, but the crispy chicken and flavorful collards more than made up for it.On top of this, BLVD is reasonably priced, especially considering how much I loved the vibe of this place. I hope this becomes a neighborhood institution!"
7/6/2017,4 star rating,"As soon as you walk in your welcomed by the sweet greeting of their homemade biscuits baking in the oven. They are paired with balanced cane butter and are delicious. Another must try is their spiked tea , the flavor they had today was watermelon and it was amazing. It was reminiscent of a watermelon jolly rancher and was amazing. Fried chicken is good as well with their hot suace"

10/29/2017,4 star rating,"Great spot for authentic southern cooking. The biscuits were the perfect mix of crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth buttery soft inside. Unsure of what to order? SHRIMP & GRITS. Even if you aren't a grits person, GET THE GRITS. Cooked to perfection and blended with gooey cheese and fresh grilled prawns.Fried chicken was good, but way too greasy. Yes, I understand grease is a key component of fried chicken, but after eating a wing I'm confidant that my fingers could have solved the oil crisis of '73.Our server was absolutely HORRIBLE. Sweet, but could not have been worse at her job. Luckily, the food was good enough to make up for it."

The collard green is especially amazing given it's made with turkey not pork (which is a plus because my husband won't eat pork!)The biscuits are little salty to my taste but I usually eat more bland than others.Staff is super nice and the chef came out and check with us if the food was good. Will definitely come back!"
9/5/2019,1 star rating,"Let me start with the positive. The hostess who greeted us was warm and lovely. All downhill from there. One of the water glasses was dirty. Then one of the cloth napkins was stained and dirty. Ohkaaaay I had the catfish dinner. HORRIBLE!! The fish was clearly microwaved and not freshly fried. It was super dry and barely warm. Same for the collard greens. My Dad had the turkey meatloaf which had a weird metallic taste. The biscuits were good. That's all I got! Do better Blvd, do better!"
2/22/2015,5 star rating,I had the shrimp and grits and loved it. It was so thick and creamy. It also came with a buttermilk buscuit which was to die for.

Be sure to look at the celling. Ive been twice and the food taste consistent.  Be sure and make reservations.You gotta check out this place!
7/10/2015,4 star rating,Cute little spot tucked away in Harlem. It was the perfect location for an afternoon lunch. Away from hustle that often moves the city. There's a cute outdoor area (with umbrellas) so if you'd like to people watch while you eat knock yourself out. Let's get to the good stuff.. The services was great. Waitress was very spunky and just buzzing with a great energy. She start us off with drinks..letting us know the refreshing summer drink of the day. Which was sweet peach ice tea. I must say it was really good. A great summer refresher. On to the food... I had the Mac & cheese..I couldn't resist they top it with bacon!!!!! You can't go wrong with bacon!!!!! Lol.. Omg the portion size was perfect.. It was delicioussssss.. Yummy kinda of delicious.. Cheesy  kinda delicioussssss!!!! Mouth watering kinda delicioussssss!! Ok ok I think you get the point. My friend had the pull pork sandwich served with rice & beans. Ok ok that was yummy..delicious.. And finger licking good. Would I go back??? More like I can't wait to go back.

4/22/2015,4 star rating,"Came here for brunch with a reservation and was seated promptly. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and the bf got the Shrimp & Grits. Everything was excellent and packed with flavor! It's rare that every single component of the dish is cooked so well, but that was the case with what we ordered. It was also the very first time I had grits, and I'm pretty sure BLVD Bistro has raised the bar sky high for whenever else I had grits. The consistency was excellent - creamy and cheesey. I took off one star because we felt a little rushed in the end when the bill came. Also, I would prefer the crab cake to be a tad less salty and bit fluffier. Otherwise, the service was good.If you venture out to Harlem, this is a must-try!"
5/4/2018,3 star rating,"Blvd Bistro is charming and has great potential which is challenged by the extremely skimpy portions of side dishes and quality of food for the prices. Expected golden fried chicken ($28), but it was dark and salty. Catfish ($28) was okay, but not fantastic. The black-eyed peas, southern potato salad, collard greens and red beans and rice, were so-so, although the last are prepared like Jamaican peas and rice--not New Orleans style. Highlights included Fruity Spiked Lemonade, great music and atmosphere, and a wonderful staff. Note: Macaroni ($20), generally a standard option at soul-food restaurants, is served as an entree ONLY."
2/17/2018,2 star rating,"This place has a lot of potential. However, the reservations need to be better organized. The drinks are very good and the drinks were on the house due too the wait time. However, the chicken was too salty. Maybe reduce the salt."
2/14/2018,5 star rating,I loved the food I ordered the biscuits with sausage gravy as an appetizer it was really good- but if you're not that hungry don't order that with a big meal bc it's heavy. For the main I got the Mac and cheese while my fiancé ordered the cat fish dinner meal which was amazzzinnnng so much good flavor not too salty but not bland at all. Great flavor! Very well balanced.

2/6/2019,5 star rating,"We made reservations for a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed as expected. We were a little bothered by the fact that we had to wait 15+ mins for our table. However, after being seated, ordering and eating our meals we quickly forgot about the wait time. I had the catfish and grits and it was amazing and a great portion. The service was also pretty good. The waiter was friendly and conversive. We did have a small issue with one of the plates ordered but they quickly fixed it and the manager even came by to make sure we were ok. Overall I'm looking forward to coming back but maybe on a less busy afternoon."
8/23/2019,4 star rating,This is my updated review. We went to the new location of BLVD Bistro and had an amazing time! The food was good of course but this time the service was great as well. Though they were super crowded with the after church rush the host managed to find us a seat within a few minutes so we could order. The waiter and the rest of the staff were polite and over communicated with us which I really appreciated. When we went on June 30 they had only been a short time and didn't have bottomless yet so we ordered a pitcher of Bellini. The Bellini wasn't mixed well but it could've just been a bad batch. I'll definitely be adding this place of my list of Harlem spots to frequent!
11/8/2017,2 star rating,"I went here about two weeks ago. I went with a group of 8 and we had a reservation for a Sunday at 230. We arrived for our reservation and were told that they were running behind and It would be about 30 minutes before we could sit. It was raining so we figured they had planned on using outdoor seating and then we're not able to. The manager offered us drinks while we waited. She brought out the first 3 drinks, gave 2 to 2 other guests that had been waiting and 1 to a member of our party. She didn't return with anymore drinks. Once our tables were finally ready (40 mins after our reservation) we were told that we would have to sit at 2 separate tables. As soon as we were seated two different waiters came one behind the other to ask us if we already knew what we wanted. After we were asked for a third time in 5 mins we placed our orders. The food came out quickly and tasted good but the gravy was cold. We asked for more gravy and the manager said ""the chef went in the back and made this just for you all"" as if It wasn't supposed to be hot. After we had been seated for almost 70 minutes waiters began clearing away our table and we felt rushed to finish. One person in the party was still eating after everyone else and we watched the wait staff stare at us and whisper behind their hands presumably because they needed our table.I gave this review 2 stars because the food was very good, the manager did try to be accommodating, and we did end up getting the free drinks once we were seated but collectively there were too many disappointments for me to want to return.As an edit: per the comment I received It appears we interacted with the owner, not the manager. My mistake, but the rest of the review remains. We showed up with 8 people at 2:23 for a 2:30 reservation. While we were waiting an additional person showed up which then made our party a party of 9."
2/2/2018,4 star rating,Food is GREAT! I Love a good Bellini! Waiters very friendly and knowledgable of the Harlem neighborhood. Love the outdoor seating option. Room for improvement : develop a strategic plan to notify customers when their table is ready. It feels as if its the customers responsibility to check to see if the table is ready.
6/24/2019,5 star rating,"Overall, a good experience. We had a group of 7 and had to wait past our reservation time. However, all of the food was really good. I got the eggs any style and it was delicious. The biscuits are to die for. If you are planning to drink, get the sangria or mimosa pitchers."
8/15/2019,2 star rating,"Nothing pisses me off more than piss poor service at a restaurant or anywhere customer service should be priority! . No drink or food for almost an hour and then asks me to remind him of what drink I had.... NEVER AGAIN! And I live in the neighborhood which is heartbreaking because I was trying to find a breath of fresh air from Harlem Tavern. I'm only giving 2 stars because the drink was decent... won't be coming back here, sad because I had high hopes. Just not enough attention to the customers. We only saw our waiter a time or 2 while trying to constantly flag him down smh"
5/16/2017,3 star rating,"I took my friend out to this place and at first the cute low key relaxing vibe won my heart! And the service was spectacular. However the food is not worth the price. I started out with the fried chicken sliders. Which had a butter biscuit bun I truly enjoyed. This appetizer was raved about online so I just had to try it. When it finally arrived at the table, I saw only the biscuit. Reasons being is the chicken was extremely tiny. For $14 dollars the chicken was barley the size of my ping pong ball. I would have been paying for just the biscuit. (Insane) To top it off my friend ordered the same thing and her chicken & biscuit was partially burnt.Luckily the waiter was super sweet and had no problem taking the food back and replacing it with a fresh new meal, with the correct chicken portion. But by then after waiting a while we were no longer interested in ordering an entree. I will say this, their signature drink is deeeellliiiccciiiooouussssss!!!! I believe it's the BLVD spiked tea. I would definitely come back for  that."
11/8/2020,3 star rating,"Today my food was good besides them taking over an hour and a half and the manager dismissing my friend by saying it was his steak that took long to make... come on miss we seen multiple tables that came 20-45 mins after us being served before us, we deserved a better explanation. Another thing I didn't like is that I ordered ""catfish"" and grits without eggs ( I don't eat eggs) and under my ""catfish"" there was a large piece of cheese egg and a piece of bacon stuck to it as if they took it off one plate to put it on mine . I just took the piece off and tossed it to the side because I was starving after waiting so long ....oh and I put catfish in quotes because it I ain't catfish it's basa lol I know that a lot of restaurants do that because it's cheaper and you get more fish. I don't eat meat anymore just fish and I hate basa  the first few times I came to BLVD i was served catfish and it was delicious but that was at the old spot. You guys should just call it fish and grits because it's not catfish......the grits,biscuits and half/half are dumbbbb good tho that's why y'all got 3 stars.....,,Miss I know you have to maintain the appearance of it being catfish but let's be real catfish is a meatier texture and this is basa lol I know the difference"

3/8/2019,3 star rating,"Went for brunch last week and the food was good. The biscuits I really loved however, the whole time I felt a little awkward when we got there, the grade was pending, and after the meal when I went to use the restroom it smelled like dead mouse.

From the first call to the very last thank you and have a great day, the staff (Rey) went above and beyond to make sure our food/drinks and over all experience was a great one.  When you are greeted by the owner and she makes you feel like you are at home, then it's a great day.  The food was good and the music had us singing and dancing in our seats made driving in from Jersey worth it.  Make sure you go there, you won't be disappointed.  Tammy C."
8/12/2018,2 star rating,"This was my second time at restaurant, i was disappointed. I invited someone i hoped would enjoy it as much as i had in the past.We were seated quickly, which i like. My biggest complaint  stem from wait service. It appears all wait staff service all tables yet do not talk to one another. So therefore, if one person take an order and get busy,  the next person who come to table wont know of the request that was made. We placed order for drinks which we had to remind to get. The coffee situation, no substitute for sugar which i found strange as well as only whole milk, no cream.  My guess asked for more coffee which never came. Waitress told us she was going for condiments but never came with it. Everything my guess wanted she either got late or not at all.I left a tip but probably will not return."

2/22/2020,3 star rating,"Came with a somewhat large party for a late dinner on a Friday night and was promptly seated by the friendly hostess.  My Spritz cocktail was tasty and interesting.  Our food was hot and delicious.  The wings were super crispy.  I want to give Blvd all of the stars but our server's (tall, med complexion man w/curly flattop) attitude left much to be desired.  Yes- he did his job, but that's it.  Whenever we asked him for something, he usually acquiesced, but he made it clear he was annoyed.  You know how some doctors have terrible bedside manner?  Well, this guy had the service equivalent to that.  He was just unpleasant and kinda marred our dining experience.  However, the man (Latino, well built) from the kitchen who assisted our server bringing the food to the table was amazing and even sang while delivering our biscuits.  They need to trade places.  I'd like to give Blvd another try, but I'll dine at the bar to avoid that mean, ole server."
8/10/2019,4 star rating,This place was a pleasant surprise. Their scratch-made biscuits and gravy is great. And their shrimp with grits is far more filling than it looks. Never before have I had grits so rich. Would definitely recommend...
8/8/2019,3 star rating,"I went to the Blvd Bistro with my family. My son and I ordered the catfish with two sides. He got potato salad that was a large chunk of potato, not blended well in the mixture. He also got the turkey smoked collards which were very good but there was a long piece of cartilage from the bone in the dish. We did bring it to the chefs attention. He did acknowledge what it was, he did indicate that it should not be in there and apologized. However, he took nothing off the bill, which I feel he should have. It is simply courtesy. The hostess was very welcoming and polite. Our waiter was so welcoming and friendly, the music was good. My Daughter had shrimp and grits which she enjoyed. The biscuits were also good, along with the catfish.  Again, if I am paying almost $100 for 3 meals I do not expect ANYTHING to be wrong, you could do better."
11/8/2018,5 star rating,"Came here early on a rainy Saturday morning with a bunch of my girlfriends. Even at 10 am there was already a line and a wait. The place was packed and had great ambiance with lots of mid thirties to forties folks, young families and lively conversations. The hostess waited for our whole party to come and then sat us down. The place is fairly small and intimate with the waitstaff winding up and down the aisles quickly to serve everyone. They brought us coffee and gave us some time to look over the menu.  They had even run out of some of their specials. I went for the omelet with a side of grits. The omelet was good and up to nyc standards. The grits however were AMAZING. They were hands down the best I have ever had. If I knew grits could taste like this I would get them everywhere too like my southern friends. The biscuit was also really delicious with this special butter that was salty, sweet and spicey...everything you crave. Then the bill was totally reasonable...only around 30 per person including everything. Loved this brunch. Definitely a must to try!!"
3/11/2018,2 star rating,We came here for my birthday and made a reservation for 9pm. We got here early and was sat on time. 10 mins in the waiter finally came and took our orders we waited almost an hour for our food. We got an appetizer the chicken sliders which were good. The spiked lemonade was also good I guess that's why they got two stars from me. When they brung our food my cousins steak was rare and she asked for well done. My food had no type of seasoning. Only thing that was good on my plate was the rice. When my cousin said to switch her order because they messed it up let's just say 30 mins later she still didn't have any food. The waiter apologized and said no bill because everything was just that bad.
9/23/2017,4 star rating,Food was fantastic. Fried chicken was cooked perfectly although slightly underseasoned. All our food was delicious but the tab wasn't cheap. The sangria pitcher was $42 each which is pricey and adds up on the second one. Otherwise great experience
3/4/2018,1 star rating,"Trying to make a reservation over the phone. Impossible. Phone kept on going to VM. Past two days. Then I went in on Sunday hoping to get a table. I asked, if I had a reservation. Dah!!! If you would have picked up the phone!!!No, I don't have one. With a wait time 45-1h I chose to go to Cheri next door. Which was fantastic."

3/16/2017,5 star rating,Just went to Boulevard Bistro. Thoroughly pleased. Food was well seasoned and the portions were healthy. The staff was very courteous and attentive. They even fixed me an unexpected to go plate. The vibe was old school Harlem with classic R &B in background. I recommend coming on a random weeknight because brunch is sometimes crowded.
2/11/2018,5 star rating,"Blvd Bistro is a small nook of home made soul food. The executive chef comes out and speaks with everyone in the restaurant, the food is amazing and the decor is classically Harlem. I had the Pan fried chicken and biscuit basket. My girlfriend had the crab cake benedict and we shared a side order of the cheesy grits. Man, oh Man was this food delicious. The grits seamed to melt the moment they touched your tongue leaving behind a flavor you'll never want to forget. The biscuits were soft and fluffy, they seemed to crumble the moment I put the cane sugar  butter and raspberry jam on to them. My girl is raving about the crab cake Benedict and the spiked lemonade. We'll definitely be back to BLVD Bistro soon."
7/20/2019,5 star rating,"I love BLVD Bistro and am glad they have relocated.  The food remains excellent!!  The staff is interested in making sure your dining experience will make you want to return. The response, increased clientele, to the new location, is a good sign. I am sure the rhythm of service will improve as the staff adjusts to the large number of new diners frequenting this well appointed new location."
8/29/2015,5 star rating,"Dined here last night with the ladies from my dinner club. What a nice experience!!! We had 8pm reservations and were a few minutes late but we were seated promptly. The hostess, servers, chef and all other members of the staff that we encountered were personable, so much so that it felt like we were regulars. As a group we ordered...Sangria (tasty)Chicken sandwich appetizer (be sure to take the buttermilk ranch dressing)Watermelon salad (dressing was delicious)Shrimp and grits (amazing)Shrimp po-boy (two thumbs up)Catfish po-boy (nice flavor-I hate coleslaw but enjoyed this one)Cheeseburger (yummy)And everyone loved their food and we will absolutely be back with others :)"
7/15/2018,5 star rating,"We heard so much about the place so we came to celebrate my friends birthday. The place is small but everyone's seated comfortably. The meals are cooked to order. The food arrives hot. The Birthday girl had catfish, scrambled eggs, cheese grits & biscuit. I had ribeye steak, home fries, scrambled eggs & biscuit. EVERYTHING was delicious. Steak was seasoned & cooked to my liking (well done) it wasn't dry, but tasty hot & juicy.  The fish was crispy but flaky. Our server was Ray & he was pleasant with a big smile & even the bus guy was quite pleasant & polite to us. Atmosphere is calm, everyone's talking quietly amongst themselves & eating. We had a great time until a mess up with bill payment. The way the staff handled the situation was CALM & PROFESSIONAL. THANK YOU! The problem was solved when the money was found on the floor under my chair.  I'm so sorry for the mix up, but truly appreciated your patience & professionalism.  Also thank you for the benches outside to allow us to wait for our early arrival for our reservation & wait for our ride home. Thank you BLVD for the great food & great customer service. I hope you will welcome us again."

1/27/2015,3 star rating,"Best biscuit in town. I repeat, Best biscuit! Blvd Bistro brings some soul to a charming brownstone on Lenox. This is a lovely 1st floor dining room in a corner residential brownstone. There are a few booths and communal tables. As a solo diner, although I was the first for dinner, but still relegated to communal table, wasn't too happy about that. Now to the biscuit. HOT, perfectly baked, buttery biscuit served with cane sugar butter.  This is a knock your socks off biscuit. Next course was a Florida grouper with tomatoes, corn and okra. The grouper was somewhat under seasoned, but the okra was nicely done which can be tricky to do. The dissapointment was the corn- it  wasn't fresh corn. I expected more from one of the priciest dishes. Otherwise, friendly service and that bangin' biscuit might lure me uptown for another dish."
3/1/2015,3 star rating,"(February 27, 2015)Came here to have dinner w/one of my friends. As a first-time patron, I was impressed with the professionalism, menu design and friendliness of the staff. Although, the space is quite intimate, I enjoyed myself and the dish I ordered. Most dishes are made to order - which is rare in NYC. I was mainly impressed that they didn't sell hard alcoholic beverages! That's a first! They do have watered down sangria and cheap house wine (don't recommend) but you will definitely enjoy the soul food here."
9/19/2015,3 star rating,"The food was fine. The service was too. The ending was extremely inconvenient.I tasted my friends' meals: the shrimp & grits and fish of the day were awesome. The pan fried chicken, my dish, was disappointing. Our server was very nice though. She switched the potato salad that came w my dish for sweet potatoes.The sad part was at the end when she charged my card twice. Instead of coming to apologize, she had the manager come to the table & tell me about the mistake. The difference in the charge was only $2. I feel the server should have taken the $2 out of her tip instead of keeping all the cash ($60 for a $48 bill). Having to wait 3-5 business days for my $46 to return is annoying. If you go, I suggest bringing cash to pay."

8/7/2019,2 star rating,"This was one of the worst service experiences of my life. We had a reservation for brunch but were seated almost an hour after the correct time, with people who did not have reservations being seated despite coming after us (note that we arrived punctually for our reservation). We asked multiple times when they would be seated and they still did not prioritize us. The manager comped us drinks for the inconvenience, but then got our drink order completely wrong (out of a party of four, two drinks were wrong and they forgot to bring the fourth drink at all).  The table was incompletely set and they got one of the food orders wrong as well. Service was slow and not particularly friendly. The only reason this is not a one star review is that the food is absolutely incredible. It might be worth going for a weeknight dinner when hopefully the service is better."
6/25/2019,2 star rating,"What to Say?  Pros1. The food we did receive without issue was good.2. Staff friendlyCons1. Blueberry pancakes sent back because mix around the berry was uncooked.  They must be using frozen berries. The second batch, same issue.  My daughter was hungry so we ate around the berries2. Taste like brown water, at $4 a cup with no refills 3. Tip included without written notice on the menu or announcement from the staff4. Management not identifying they should not have to charge us for the pancakes.Not the worse but not the best.  They can do better.  Especially if you're charging $36 for steak and eggs"

7/9/2017,3 star rating,Food was good but the air quality is very poor!! it was extremely hot the entire time we dined. Idk if I would go back for dinner or brunch or just wait for the cooler months to approach that's how bad the heat was in the restaurant
10/3/2017,4 star rating,"This was a referral glad I went. I had the catfish poboy (tartar sauce & coleslaw) with potato salad and my niece had the poboy dinner with potato salad and greens. The tartar sauce is the bomb. Everything was delicious I definitely would go back again. Ask for the sweet tea (non-alcoholic if you don't drink). The only downside, the place is small."

6/16/2019,3 star rating,"I will say, when we visited.. the location was doing a soft opening and had only been open at there new location for 2 weeks (per the waitress). We had a limited menu to order for brunch which was a little disappointing as their website advertised a bigger menu for brunch. Website didn't say anything about the limited menu or soft opening either. Overall the atmosphere and new venue was beautiful. Definitely more space than there previous location(per one of our attendees). Chicken and biscuits was delicious, and we tried the biscuit sandwich was decent."
4/23/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious food ! Wonderful atmosphere and amazing staff. The chef even came out to speak to us ! Great guy. Hopefully he opens that restaurant in Silver Spring, MD like we mentioned lol ! I can't wait until I'm in Harlem again visiting because this is definitely a repeat offender"
5/17/2015,5 star rating,"I'm not too fond of the seating policy here. Even if you have a party of 2 , they won't seat you until the entire party arrives and there isn't a bar area. Nevertheless the husband and wife who own this place is amazing. The food is awesome and the service is even better. Please support this business, it won't disappoint you. I ordered the Pan Seared catfish with eggs and grits! So delicious."
3/1/2020,3 star rating,"I've been to BLVD Bistro on a few occasions and, each time, it's been a different experience. I'm not particularly  crazy about their chicken and biscuits; however, they seem to be a favorite among some of the patrons. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday (mid-day) and it was packed (as usual, so not a big deal). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal (cheese grits and collards) and would give 5 stars for the food only. The service, however, was abysmal, hence the 3 star rating. We sat at the bar and the bartender was completely inattentive. He barely made eye contact with us and didn't take our order until about 20 minutes after we were seated. He spilled our drinks more than once and didn't replenish the wasted alcohol. I noticed that he was much more attentive to other patrons at the bar, so our experience was probably unique. It was such a terrible experience that it was enough to offset the more positive experiences that I've had. We definitely won't be back."
9/30/2019,3 star rating,"I was disappointed by this place. To start, I had a 2:30 reservation the hostess explained to be it would be a 20 minute wait before I could be seated. My party wasn't actually seated until 3:15. Upon sitting down, the glasses were filthy so when our waiter came we asked for new ones. He kindly got us new glasses then poured our water. Once the water was filled there were multiple things floating in the water that I noticed along with the waiter so he apologized and offered new glasses but we just decided to for to the glasses all together. Now I order the catfish grits and eggs. The grits was delicious!!! The catfish on the other hand was a huge let down, it was doused and grease and also it appear the oil used to fry it was old because it didn't taste fresh at all. My friend had the shrimp and grits which she thoroughly enjoyed. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowd and it def showed in the quality of their food. I may return but when they're less busier because then they will hopefully pay attention to intricate details such as dirty glasses, dirty grease and polluted water. My three stars is solely based on the delicious grits I had."
10/15/2016,5 star rating,"Came in to BLVD with my girlfriend and our 6 week old baby and my girlfriends sister. For an early dinner. We knew we had to get in early before the rush because of our new infant. The place wasn't dead, i must say.  But it was the perfect blend of mellow with enough energy and 'life' to make it such a pleasant dining experience. The ambience and atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. The music that was playing was the most amazing mix of Motown soul ever. And the waitstaff was so friendly and cool. And they loved our baby:)The food was amazing.  We all loved our dishes. We moved to the neighborhood a few months ago and it was our first time here. We will DEFINITELY be back!"
11/10/2014,5 star rating,"Went here the other night before a show at the Apollo - it was amazing. The drinks selection could use some tweaking overall, and the space is tiny but they make it work & I found a beer I wanted, as did my partner in crime. We were seated at the communal table which gave us a chance to ogle the food before we ordered it - it also smells so good outside that we knew we were in for a treat! They start everyone off with biscuits - which were delicious. Asking bottom layer of buttery flakey carboholic goodness. And the butter they give you for it - oh man. So delicious. We ordered the okra - which was REALLY hot when served but absolutely delicious. Breaded and deep fried or baked to perfection.  The okra was clearly fresh and deliciously crisp. The ketchup it came with was even good! And I'm not a huge ketchup fan. I had the Mac n Cheese as my main course - it was basically my dream come true. Served in a deep dish, spiral cheesy creamy pasta cooked to perfection. And super warm - so you know this isn't easy mac. Baked to delicious taste and super amazingly creamy and cheesy. My partner in crime had the fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes / collard greens, which I tried and was DELICIOUS. I also recommend the apple cobbler - so so so good. Should also say - the service was fantastic. Overall, fantastic little Harlem spot. I want to go back. Soon. Must. Have. Cheesy Mac!!"

1/17/2016,3 star rating,"My husband and I had a Sunday brunch here. There were many customers so most of customers had to share table with strangers. Which is ok for us but the gap between tables is a little too narrow....One good thing is their service was good. Even they had a lot of customers and still provided a nice service. :)Sadly, the food doesn't look that good as on everyone's photography. (You can see the French toast is very burny.... from the pic I post) also, we have ordered jumbo shrimp and grits. Well, personally speaking, maybe it shouldn't be the first meal of a day. It was delicious when I had the first bit. So I gave them 3 stars review.Thanks for your reply. I mentioned the French toast was burned because we saw our neighbors' french toast wasn't as burnt. But actually I like the taste expected the crust."
10/10/2016,4 star rating,"I came here for Sunday brunch around 10:30, didn't have to wait, and overall had an enjoyable experience. My friend and I shared the Brioche French Toast and Shrimp & Grits. Shrimp and Grits: Delicious. Perfectly cooked shrimp and perfect consistency of the cheesy bacon-y grits. Brioche French Toast: It was okay. It may just have been me, but the edges of the french toast tasted a little burnt and I thought the french toast could have used more of the caramelized bananas. -The coffee was delicious, and the complimentary buttermilk biscuit was a nice touch. Service was excellent and the space is cozy. Prices are reasonable, except $4 for coffee is a little steep (despite the free refills). All in all, I recommend this place for some of the clearly stand-out dishes on the menu like the Shrimp & Grits and the top notch service."
10/22/2019,2 star rating,"I booked a reservation for a party of 11 for my daughter's bday.  Several emails, a visit to the restaurant 2 days prior, with assurance that 'we got you'...a confirmed reservation and a promise to call to reconfirm, me calling to reconfirm the day before, us showing up an hour prior to the reservation... all this and they still wasn't able to accommodate us.  We were asked to check in when everyone was there, but not prior to the reservation time... checked in at 3pm and was told that the wait time would be 90 mins! Really so what's the purpose of the reservation? I would understand 'wait so we can prepare your table', but to wait 90 mins after the time our reservation was confirmed for?  That's beyond ridiculous.  With no one showing up at the host desk to explain, even though we asked to speak with someone with somewhat a little more authority to at least hear us out.  No one.  We eventually left.  Extremely disappointed.  Not even the courtesy of an apology.  Not very professional the way it was handled.  We had to find another place to go amidst my daughter's birthday!"
10/15/2017,5 star rating,"Don't worry about the wait the food will over compensate! If you love a little Southern comfort food, Blvd. Bistro is your go to.

I can't wait to return...beyond 5 stars!"

Every time I go back and promise myself that I will try something different and I failed everytime.This is a great experience eating, great food - they want their customers to be happy and satisfied.

9/22/2019,1 star rating,"It really pains me to write this review, but alas.  The service is horrible. We had a 3pm reservation, and were not seated until almost 4pm.  The hostess/owner refused to seat us in a booth, and instead sat a party of three, who did NOT have a reservation.  Another party that also had a reservation decided to leave. The food was good, but not that good.  Go somewhere else."
9/5/2014,4 star rating,"Simply Awesome. The Banana Bread Pudding will change your life.  The BF and I stopped in on a Tuesday night and were not disappointed.  The food was very tasty and served piping hot (like you literally saw the steam rising off the plate).  We had:Complimentary Biscuits (really really tasty -- if anyone remembers the Copeland restaurant chain, these biscuits are comparable, but less dense -- served with a butter that was whipped with something delicious that I couldn't put my finger on)Macaroni and Cheese (the crispy bacon was a nice compliment to the sharp flavor of the cheese), Pan-Fried Chicken (made to order, very well seasoned and crispy -- I had to exercise a great deal of self control to not eat the skin.  I don't even want to talk about.)  It was accompanied by Collard Greens and Potato Salad that we solid, but nothing extraordinary.Salmon (I had a tiny piece and liked it and the BF, who rarely ever expresses anything beyond ambivalence about food, thoroughly enjoyed it.)Finally . . . the Banana Bread Pudding.  Words cannot begin to describe how amazing the experience was to eat this dessert.  It is hands down on the very best desserts I have ever had -- mind you I love banana bread and bread pudding and them together was the ultimate foodgasm.  It's basically freshly made banana bread turned into bread pudding.  The banana flavor is rich, the texture is hearty, yet smooth and moist.  It's so simple, yet innovative. And it was such a generous serving.  I honestly would go back just for the Banana Bread.The service was good.  Our server checked in with us frequently.  Chef Carlos stopped by a couple of times to introduce himself, ask about our experience, etc.  I was a little sad that they don't have real cocktail options (just beer and wine based), but I forgive them.  The hours are similar to the area restaurants, as they open each evening at 5 PM.  They do not have dinner on Sundays though and are closed on Mondays.Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood.  And a great alternative to the mainstay soul food restaurants which are not as appealing to eat-in.  I can't wait to go back and try the brunch at BLVD Bistro."
7/15/2015,5 star rating,"One word to describe the food...yummy!My coworker and I both enjoyed our meals. I order the shrimp and grits and he had the fried chicken sliders, mashed potatoes, and sweet potatoes. I was stuffed. My coworker left clean dishes!"
2/22/2015,4 star rating,"First, Bistro is pretty small.. It's a cute, quaint restaurant. The ambiance is welcoming and has almost a small town feel to it in the middle of south Harlem. I went with my family for Brunch.. We were five adults and two children, not the most comfortable for large groups. Our table seats 6 so we added a high chair and were fine.. But it was a tight squeeze. The hostess was very nice and accommodating.. And our server, I think his name was Deandre? Was one of the best waiters I have had in a very long time... If not ever! The bread bowl is actually from Balthazar's and amazing as expected ... My son loved it and dug in to it full force.. The infused butter and preserves were delicious as well. The lattes and cappuccinos can beat out almost any cafe in the area. A few of us had the crab cake Benedict and it was seriously delicious.. The crab had no fillers tasted very fresh and well seasoned.. When living in NOVA I loved the crab cake Benedict from Artie's in Fairfax and this beat it out by a landslide. I didn't get pictures of everyone else's meal.. Sorry.. My husband had the brioche French toast and thoroughly enjoyed it.. It is a huge order so with a side of eggs and bacon it was more than enough to share with our son.. And still some. It was a hit with both of them. My nieces had the bacon and egg on a biscuit.. The bacon is scrambled into the egg and is also a huge order so they shared and cleaned out their plates as well. The kids had fresh squeezed orange juice which was great and they only have boylan sodas, but who doesn't love those? Over all the service is great and food is delicious.. Not great for parties larger than 6 people so expect to wait at least 20 minutes if not more for a table and our check was more than expected but still well worth it. Food and service get five stars..."
12/1/2016,3 star rating,"I've passed by this place many times, I've always been curious about it because it's always busy. Yesterday I tried it and I gotta say I was disappointed. Mainly because I ordered the steak and it was TERRIBLE. I ordered it medium well and it was well done , the worst part was the seasoning, it was too smokey, too spicy , too salty and too over seasoned. Everything was wrong with it. I sent it back and got something else the ribs which were alright . I gotta say though, best string Beans I've ever had"

We arrived on time it was crowded told the hostess on 3 people and we were all here she said great you are checked in your table will be ready.  I will call you. We waited my BFF inquired after 15 mins she was told a feeler mins for a table.  30mins we inquire again I'm told the table behind me is cashing out. After the manager told us we were next 10 mins prior.  Other people are seated and finally we demanded the manager a Whole 45 mins after our reservation.  She comes over and says ooh no you still waiting I told you 15 mins ago you were next.  So sorry she says we will seat you now.  We sat in the back were it was quiet and cozy.  She gave us a bread basket immediately and took our drink orders.  She apologized and checked on us.  The manager did what a manager is supposed to do...provide customer service and admit when you make a mistake.  Our waiter, the food and service there after was back at four star.  The new location is bigger and the food was great.  Today could have been bumped up to 5 Stars if the hostess didn't play games with our reservation juggling us around like we didn't matter or couldn't pay the bill! Don't wait 45 mins fooling with the hostess like us, just ask for the manager.  She handles business and is fair!   I forgot to get her name but she saved the day for real because it was about to be a problem.  Fried chicken dinner, catfish and shrimp and grits meals. Grits are still so creamy and dreamy..."

Exciting little menu...Turkey meatloaf and chicken sliders. Sound delicious...."
11/7/2016,3 star rating,"It was good, but nothing to write home about. My friend and I spent about $70, with tip, on two entrees, two non-alcoholic drinks, and the bread plate. I got the crab benedict, and it was really very good. It came with a delicious biscuit. I would definitely get this entree again. However, my friend got an omelet and it looked so sad on its plate by itself. I don't think it was the best choice on the menu. I will say that she got the bread basket and really liked it. The homemade butter was delicious. I had to ask my server three times to get a coffee refill, which was very frustrating. The worst part, though, was that it tasted horrible. I know it was drip coffee, but it tasted like instant. While I liked my entree, I wouldn't go back to this place because of the bad coffee, my friend's underwhelming omelet, and the price."
7/8/2016,4 star rating,"Boulevard Bistro hosted a large group of my clients (about 25) on a Wednesday for lunch. They provided us with a prefix menu l and treated us well (my clients loved the Harlem vibe--jazz and all).  Because my program manager was responsible for setting up the menu and I wasn't involved in every detail but next time I will request a vegetarian option as well as more drink options given the limited selections. The peach cobbler was excellent but had a messy presentation. Overall, a great spot that could enhance the experience even further by paying attention to more detail."

11/5/2018,4 star rating,"The reservation was very easy to make through Yelp. When we got there, notice the place was small and all the tables we full which is a good sign. By the time our late friends arrived, they were set to seat us. Staff was very friendly. Only major complaint I had through out the night was the smell of them using either an old mop or rags to clean with. The smell was very distracting and it's hard to enjoy the food with that sort of smell. Other than that, it was cool. By the time we sat around 8:45, they had already ran out of a few dishes which we were eyeing. Drinks were good (especially the spiked tea). All and all, it was a good night."
9/20/2019,1 star rating,"The service was horrible .. There was an argument with a off duty staff member and the manager the police had to be called .. We had to wait at least one hour and a half for our food .. The waitress kept asking us if we were ready to order at least three times we had to remind her that  we had ordered and was still waiting for our food .  Before leaving I had to use the ladies room OMG  I almost fell the floor was soaking wet a staff member was mopping up water from a leak coming from the sink unfortunately there was only one bathroom .. I will never go there again ., I do not recommend this place at all!!!!!!  I tend to believe that the good reviews came from the  staff family members !!"

5/29/2014,4 star rating,"I went to brunch here with 3 friends this past Sun. It's a charming little place on the corner of 122nd & Lenox with indoor and al fresco seating and is definitely an asset to Harlem's booming dining industry. We waited a bit, but that's to be expected - we were actually seated sooner than I anticipated. We ordered a couple adult beverages and I swear if I remembered what they were called, I'd implore you to get them. Yum! Anyhoo, we all ordered something different to swap forks. In total, we had the chicken & biscuit, mac n cheese, shrimp & grits and the reg breakfast plate with eggs/meat/potato. We all enjoyed our meals, but my friend's shrimp & grits were the best. Creamy grits, that clearly somebody's Granny named Pearl stirred all morning w/a a wooden spoon w/a hint of jalapeño...can't beat it with a stick.The server, Anthony, was attentive and on point. We never really had to ask for anything. Then one of my friends ordered the banana/bread pudding topped with ice cream. It was really awesome, although, it was really more like banana nut bread. Buuuut don't tell that to Executive Chef/Owner, Carlos Swepson. He wasn't feeling my interpretation of the dessert...although it's still bread. Haha! He was mad cool about it and an all around nice guy. Go for good eats in a cute place and stay for the banana bread!"

7/28/2017,4 star rating,"Ate here after a recommendation from my sister who saw the chef / owner on the Food Network.She suggested the double thick pork chop, knowing that pork chops are a favorite of mine, but I wanted to try the pan fried chicken, to see how it compared to my all time favorite served at ""Southern Fresh"" in Safety Harbor, Florida.It was very tasty, as were the greens and potato salad that it came with it, but did not dethrone my all time favorite.I started with a mixed green salad which was delicious and plentiful.My sister had jumbo shrimp and grits which she loved.The service, ambience and music were good as well.I'll be back for the chop."

11/18/2018,4 star rating,"Avoid the over hyped, overly salty soul food in Harlem and do your taste buds a favor.   BVLD is better than everything else, the service is better and the people are nicer.  The only complaint is that the place is so small.  For your first time, go during the week because weekend brunch has a crazy wait."
10/7/2014,5 star rating,Blvd Bistro what a nice restaurant. Went on a Sunday for brunch. The place is small and intimate. Met some of the staff who came over to day hello and welcome us to the establishment.  Ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Never have I had such creamy grits. The shrimp was cooked just right. Their famous biscuits were good but loved the butter to put on them. Definitely will be back to try dinner!
2/3/2017,4 star rating,"Great place for a solid meal. This is Southern comfort food, po'boys, grits, biscuits, and wings. The food is not quite 5 star but it's very good and very filling. The staff is warm and attentive, making us feel right at home. I also liked the look of the place, very cosy but not too crowded. I wonder if it might be a bit too crowded come dinner time (we were there for lunch) but that's not my problem!The only down side? This place won't do your diet any good! Luckily I don't live around the corner but I've already decided I need to bike up here more often (and I need to bike to burn off some of the calories I'm going to splurge on here)."

3/25/2015,4 star rating,Came here with a friend before we explored Harlem.- they serve biscuits with Steen cane butter. That butter is one of the best tasting things I have ever tasted and you must ask for it!- the service was exceptional. Our waiter was very pleasant and also gave good recommendation- I ordered the crab cake. It was a bit pricey and also a bit saltier than I would like

9/18/2016,5 star rating,"Several weeks ago I went to BLVD Bistro and loved my experience.The staff and owner were so welcoming. I was greeted immediately upon entering, the wait was not long and the waitress was great. The food! I was delighted with my Fried Chicken Sliders (perfectly seasoned) and ordered the  Georgia Peach and Macadami Nut Buttermilk Pancakes as my brunch entree, it was delicious. I'll be going back again soon. Check this place out, everything was just right."
9/22/2018,5 star rating,I've been to this restaurant for many years and the food has always been solid. If you're ever in Harlem stop and give this place a try. You can thank me later.
3/10/2019,1 star rating,"My friend and I visited BLVD for brunch today. Vestibule was overcrowded with waiting customers. We got on the waiting list & were told it take an hour. Texted approx 35 minutes later for update; told ""still looking for tables"". Returned 1hr later, and told that they don't take same day reservations and that the list we got on was some kind of secondary list. We left and found a fantastic meal elsewhere. Listen, BLVD. Train your hosts to tell folks upfront what the deal is with the wait. There is too much competition for brunch in Harlem to let folks waste an hour of their time to go hungry. Didn't even taste your food and I'm already rankled with this place. TIGHTEN UP."

7/10/2018,1 star rating,"Worst dining and customer service I have EVER experienced...My boyfriend and I were very excited to try this brunch place last Sunday but ended up very disappointed. We called in and asked how long the wait was (we called from across the street, a minute before getting to the restaurant), we were told 15 minutes. After getting to the restaurant, the hostess told us we would either have to sit at the table right next to the door (basically in the entrance, there shouldn't even be a table there) or we would have to wait a hour. We told her we would leave instead and then suddenly there was a table available for us....Even though it was INCREDIBLY loud in the resturant (lots of very intoxiacted people yelling across the room) we decided to stay. We ordered the Crab Benedict and the Catfish and Grits (eggs over easy) and iced coffees. The food came out literally 5 minutes later and the eggs were completely over cooked, and the catfish was cold. After talking to the waitress, she decided she would put in a new order just for the eggs instead of sending the food back. Ten minutes passed, no eggs and our food was completely cold. After that, we decided to give up on BLVD all together and try to find a new brunch place. The hostess apologized, gave me her personal phone number and invited us back for lunch. Hoping to give this place one last chance, I reached out to her. She never responded to my message. Overall, this place was really disappointing. The customer service was TERRIBLE, the atmosphere felt like a college tailgate party and the food was a HUGE let down. Save your money, and go check out other brunch places in Harlem. Trust me, this place is not worth your money or time.*read the response from the owner below if you have any doubts concerning the professionalism of this restaurant"
5/21/2017,3 star rating,"Nothing too special to write home about BUT, nonetheless the food and service was fare. CONS:A bit pricey with smaller portions then I would like. I ordered the Catfish and Grits, wish I had ordered something else to fill me up.PROS:Seasoned just right, waiters were nice. Wait time wasn't too bad. Get there before 11:30AM for brunch to beat the rush."
3/8/2020,1 star rating,"I highly recommend you do not go here. I'm so mad at the experience I had here. I'm trying to use my back dollars to support black businesses but the amount of disrespect I just experienced at this facility is unacceptable. I walked in at 315 pm, the current time is now 520 and I still was not seated. The waitress at the front told us a 30-45 min wait. I asked for a manager and they weren't even trying to seat us. Still waited another 30 mins as I watched other parties be seated. And supposedly I talked to the owner too. There was no sense of urgency to get my party seated. Their excuse, the other parties had reservations. I know for a fact all the parties I watched be seated did not have reservations and the fact they didn't even try and seat us and use that excuse is unacceptable. So this facility only takes reservation? 2 hours is unacceptable. And what you don't know is that I'm a student veteran at Columbia University. And I came here to observe the facility to possibly add it as a vendor to receive free money from the university for events. I will DEFINITELY not be recommending this ""establishment"" to receive vouchers from us. And I'm telling every soul that I know to not spend a penny here. I'm telling my veteran community that live in Harlem not to come here. I'm telling every black person I know to spend black dollars else where. Fuck y'all, you don't serve to be in Harlem. And I can't wait to see gentrification drive you out the neighborhood."
12/9/2016,5 star rating,"If you havent made your way here for brunch or dinner you are doing a disservice to your tastebuds. This is the first time that I have tasted shrimp and grits and loved them. The biscuits, pancakes , chicken you name it .....it's delicious. A hidden gem in Harlem, this is my officially my favorite brunch spot."
1/15/2017,4 star rating,"Like others have said the space is small. We went on a Saturday for brunch so it was quite packed, but despite this we were still pretty comfortable Service is amazing. Jasmine was our waitress and she was extremely friendly, alert, and informative.We ordered the crab cake benedict, mac & cheese, shrimp & grits and a Bellini karafe. Extremely flavorful! My plate was wiped clean and everyone was happy with their order!  I will definitely be returning to Blvd Bistro again."
2/3/2018,4 star rating,"We went to eat here today and was a bit nervous of their B grade inspection but we were to past that. I ordered the French toast, amazing. Not overkill sweetness like ihop but way better and they have these cute little jars of jam and syrup. My friend got the chicken sandwich in a biscuit. Delicious."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,"I took two colleagues (one Australian, one Scottish) with me. They wanted to experience American food, and I thought the most authentic fare possible was definitely soul food. To Harlem we went. BLVD did not disappoint. Service was impeccable. Friendly, prompt, full of suggestions and tips. This was the perfect compliment to BLVD's atmosphere, which reminded me of Auntie's dining room. Laid back and comfortable, where all are welcome.I introduced my companions to fried okra (I even had to explain what okra was!), shrimp and grits, and fried catfish. We were absolutely giddy by how good everything was. Flavorful, good-sized portions, fresh. And then I sent them home with BLVD's delicious desserts-- one of each of course. I can't wait to make my way back up next time I'm in the city."
6/29/2018,2 star rating,"Was very excited to come here after my friend recommended it. Have to say I was very disappointed with the service here and will not be coming back again. First of all, we waited almost 2 hours before we were finally served food. We were initially told that there were no seats available inside the restaurant and could only dine outside, yet guests who came after us with no reservations were seated inside without waiting. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed (not sure if she is new but she needs to learn how to adapt to a fast paced environment. It is not good for business). Our waiter just didn't seem to care about us. We constantly had to remind him that we needed something...utensils, our drinks, ketchup, or napkins. He never came out once to ask how our food was. Not to mention one of my friends found an uncooked noodle in her gravy and when she asked for new gravy, he caught an attitude with her. The only reason why I am giving this restaurant 2 stars and not 1 is because the food was pretty decent (despite the fact the presentation was so sloppy and it was way overpriced ). I ordered the catfish and grits. In addition, the worker Solomon was a saving grace for us. He came around to refill our water, asked us how we were doing, and pretty much made up for the areas our waiter lacked. We did end up complaining to management about our experience and they offered us a card to eat there again for free. Sorry, you can keep that offer. Will not be coming back here again."
5/12/2018,2 star rating,"50th Birthday dinner. 6 o'clock reservation. Party of 10. First ones seated. A number of things went wrong here and I'll list them below:1. We were told that the soup of the day was Lobster Bisque. They brought out what looked to be Tomato Vegetable soup. ME, knowing that Lobster Bisque looks nothing like Tomato Vegetable soup, questioned it. Their response: ""Oh yea, that's crab soup. I don't know why the kitchen changed the soup."" My thought in my head was...so, you're just going to serve me soup I didn't order? Conclusion...we all sent our soup back.2. We arrived at 6 o'clock. Our food didn't come out until about 7:30pm. The folks at the table behind us had about the same wait and they were livid and left. If we didn't have such a big party, we would have left also.3. The chicken was left under the broiler too long and was burnt.4. The macaroni on the top of the macaroni and cheese was hard and inedible because they made the macaroni and cheese with a roux and put it in the oven without topping it with cheese, causing the top layer of macaroni to dry out and become completely inedible.5. We sent an email request for the reservation, as per their requirements. We were told because it was a birthday, the chef would prepare a special dessert. There was no special dessert. There was no dessert of any kind.I'm disappointed and surprised because this place received such good ratings. I could forgive the delayed service, but what I can't forgive is the way the food was prepared. A chef should know that food should never come out of the kitchen the way I described it. This is Culinary 101.My hope is that they make some changes in the kitchen because what I experienced this evening was completely unacceptable for an establishment of that caliber."

Ahhhhhhhhhhh.   Just the right flaky on the outside and pillow soft on the inside.   Slather it with their honey butter."
4/20/2017,3 star rating,Was here last Sat with a friend. Seating for two on a crowded day didnt take much of a wait i would say like 10min.Once seated we have to flag down a busboy and informed him that we were seating for a while and no one has taken our order yet. The table next to us who was seated after us already had there brunch drinks I would say we waited 20mins and the place wasnt that crowded. The busboy was very accomodating and apologetic which wasnt his fault.Now the order. We started of with the biscuits and gravy while the biscuits was moist and excellent the gravy was salty and a little liquidy like. I was expecting a thicker gravy. I ordered the catfish and grits which was excellent and my friend had fried chicken dinner  with collard greens and pototao salad on the side which was also good.Will i go back to this place again? Maybe
10/29/2017,4 star rating,"OK, the place is small. Make of that what you will. It didn't bother me,at all. BLVD Bistro does get crowded. That tends to mean the food is good (Great is more accurate). We arrived at 5:30 (because that's when the the web site said they opened). We were informed that they wouldn't re-open for dinner until 6:00 PM. We complained and the owner came out to speak to us. She was gracious, charming and personable.  She offered us a beverage and biscuits, while we waited the half hour. We were the first customers to be seated. The place was at capacity within 15 minutes. We had the Double Cut Pork Chop and the Pan Fried Chicken. THE FOOD WAS GREAT (have I said that already?). The portion size was excellent. The bill wasn't cheap but it was very reasonable for great food in NYC. Get there early when you visit, but make sure you get there. It's worth any small inconvenience.By the way, our leftovers were even better for dinner the next day. That bill just looks more reasonable."
11/6/2016,2 star rating,"I was pretty disappointed in this place, but I'm willing to give it a second chance as the staff was so nice.Drinks:The wine tasted cheap and was over priced for the quality.Food:The watermelon salad was like eating a salad with a dressing made of 'warheads' and the biscuit dishes were dry.Price: I some how ended up spending $65 for three appetizers and two glasses of wine... seems like a rip off as the food wasn't that great. I might try it again as some of the entrees sounded good but the prices definitely seemed a little high when there are so many better options in the city."

11/4/2019,3 star rating,"I loved the intimate vibe of the previous location and the food is still great - happy to see the restaurant doing so well. Brunch was packed and really loud. We were not seated for our 2:30 reservation until 3:15, and then crammed into a corner by the bar. After we were seated, we waited another 30 minutes before anyone took a drink or food order. It was annoying to watch the server take orders of other diners who were seated a long while after us. The server also did not know about items on the menu (like what is the country fried steak) - and disappeared for a looong time.  Would have ordered more drinks but was not given the chance. I love the food but I'm not sure the service and crazy waits are worth it."

The melt in your mouth biscuits were to die for and because he is a foodie like I am we split our entrees ^o^ ! The pork chop was very tender and seasoned; My chicken was finger lickin good!

The front of house is mismanaged, though. We walked in and were told it's up to an hour's wait. Put our names on the list. No message for an hour. When we went back, several tables for two were available but hostess told us at least 20 more minutes. Asked to be taken off the list. Got a message that a table was ready literally as walked out of the door. Despite several separate two-tops being available, got seated at a four-top with other people. During all of this, a group of 8 with a reservation waited 90 minutes in the narrow entryway to be seated. Oh, and the hostess spent most of her time hiding in the kitchen/bar area at the back, rather than at the"
6/6/2016,5 star rating,"AHH-MA-ZING! Literally the best dining experience in Harlem. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff, owner and chef's were an added delight. When we first arrived, we explained that I had limited time and had to dine-and-dash and geez Louise were they accommodating! The owner greeted and seated us and made sure the brunch item I wanted (chicken and biscuits) were available in under the 20 min suggested prep time. Now, once the food hit my lips, it was over. I missed my transport back to DC and it was well worth it. You have to sit and enjoy the food - definitely not something you want to rush through. Also, what made me love the place even more was the service. My goodness. The place may be tiny, but they take care of you like no other. They helped me with my luggage, too. One thing is for certain, you can tell the owner is very involved in the day-to-day of her establishment and it pays off. She has a certain aura that translates to the warmth of her restaurant and staff, which resonated with me. I watched her flow throughout making sure that EVERYONE was taken care of. A+++"
10/26/2019,2 star rating,"Amazing server, and decent food. However beware of the bottomless. The drinks are all so sweet. We barely finished one drink. Our server tried really hard to make it right, but these may have been the worst drinks ever so there wasn't much to be done."
8/25/2018,3 star rating,The whole experience was just ok. The service was ok until our food ticket was lost and we waited an extra 25 minutes for our food. They gave us a round of drinks on the house so that was good. But truthfully the food was just ok. My biscuits and gravy barely had gravy on them. Both my husband and I didnt care for the collard greens and he wasnt impressed with his ribs. All and all very underwhelming experience.
1/30/2020,1 star rating,"Came here for dinner with a friend. The waiter forgot our drink orders and brought out the wrong entrees for myself and the table next to us. He kind of plopped down the plate and ran away before I could tell him that it wasn't the correct order. I got his attention and let him know I ordered something different. 15 minutes later I got the correct order but my friend was finished with her meal. Same thing happened to the table next to us. No apology, no compensation or discount. I think the waiter was really avoiding us because he was no where to be found the rest of the night. The food wasn't bad but  my chicken was under cooked (I assume from trying to rush the entree) and I was sick all night so this is a hard NO from me."
10/21/2018,2 star rating,"My husband, daughter, and I checked in at 6:50pm for a 7pm reservation. We were told that it would be ""a little while"" until our table would be available. There were 3 women already waiting who, we found out later, were walk-in's. As we waited, other parties walked in and left after hearing the wait time. A few people with reservations came in and the hostess informed them that they were behind on reservations and that everyone was still seated from the 6pm reservations. We continued to wait, considering it was Saturday night, and getting in somewhere else at that point would be a futile attempt. Around 7:30, the chef/owner came out to the hostess stand. He stood there looking around the room, and went over to one table to talk with some patrons who he apparently knew because he hugged one of the women. He didn't come over to apologize to his patrons who had been waiting well past their reservation times. He actually never even looked over at us. We were finally seated at 7:45pm. The hostess brought us water, but we waited over 5 minutes for our server to come over to introduce himself and tell us that he would be back. Our server took our order and my husband asked if we would get bread before our meal. (Everyone was beyond hungry at that point). He replied that as soon as there was room in the oven, they would make more biscuits(?). The walk-in party was seated after us, and they were given bread right away. Our bread, and our meal, came out at exactly the same time-8:23pm. I don't have any complaints about the food, but I can't say that any of us enjoyed what we ate because we were starving. I also don't have any complaints about the staff. The hostess and servers were very pleasant and apologetic. I do, however, feel that the owner could have apologized to us, considering he was standing 10 feet away. A free drink or appetizer would have been a nice way of saying thank you for your patience and patronage. It definitely would have made a difference in my star rating."

I viewed the Yelp information, and there was no requirement for reservations, so I took a chance.  I invited an out-of-town friend and her husband as they were in town for a television appearance.When I arrived, there were open tables and a couple waiting to be seated. When their hostess greeted me, the first thing she asked was if I had a reservation. I informed her I did not. She told me that the wait time would be 20-40 minutes. When I asked how she came up with the time, she told me that other people had made reservations. It was storming outside. There was NO ONE waiting other than me and another couple, yet the anticipated wait time was going to be up to 40 minutes?  I started to leave. It would have been the best move in hindsight, but my friends were in a cab headed my way.The hostess informed me that they took reservations via Open Table. I went on Open Table while I sat in the restaurant and made reservations for 7:30 p.m.  It was 7:20.  So much for the 20-40 minutes wait time, right?  Not so fast.And let me say this, this hostess wasn't the most welcoming individual. One would think I wanted a table where there was a line of people waiting, and I was asking for the impossible.  She had ""rules.""   When the clock hit 7:30, I jumped up and caught another server. I showed him my reservation and without hesitation, he told me that a table was open, and he would prep it. I informed him my guests were in a taxi, but I would order drinks and appetizers for all of them. Unfortunately, this server consulted with ""the hostess"" before seating me. The new ""rule"" is that although I have reservations for 7:30, there is another party who also has reservations for 7:30 p.m. Because their reservations were made first, I would need to wait until 7:45 to give them time to arrive. Again, another warning. I should have left.Needless to say, NO ONE came at 7:30, 7:35, 7:40 or 7:45. I was the only paying customer still waiting in the foyer to be seated.   By 7:50 the hostess finally ""allowed"" me to be seated.My friend arrived by then, and we ordered.FOOD: Was it worth the effort? ABSOLUTELY NOT.I ordered the $24.00 plate of shrimp and grits. The shrimp was good, but the grits were UNDERCOOKED. I also ordered red beans and rice. I am almost certain that what I got was a Zatarains boxed red beans and rice. It was not anything that a chef would make. It was mostly rice, with the beans cut into tiny pieces. It was very salty. Sorry, but this was not made to order.  And it was COLD. By cold, I mean it was sitting and waiting somewhere and started to turn cold.The red beans and rice were sent back. What I did like was the blackeye peas and sausage dish.  My guest also ordered this. When my dish came out, there was steam coming from it. She remarked, ""Oh, yours is hot?  I assume this means her dish was cold. Her grits were also undercooked.My other guest ordered a hamburger. He said it was good. The only thing I noticed is that his side of fries consisted of FOUR large steak fries stacked in a pattern on a platter.  FOUR fries. That was it. To be honest, I believe it was three, but I'll throw in a fry for good measure.PORTIONS: The sides were very small. If I had a measuring cup, I would put them at approximately 1/2 cup. Small enough for your iPhone to be used as a platter to hold it. The iPhone platters of sides cost $7.00 each.SERVICE: Our host, Tracy, was a lovely soul.  He was tipped generously. He was very gracious and a pleasure.   It's not his fault that the food was not up to par.   The hostess, however, needs training.   When your restaurant has no waiting customers, you should take the customers who are there and willing to pay.    Chef: He was there. Never came over to our table. Never said a word. I saw him at other tables, but not ours. I'm all for small business, but the food has to be good. Maybe people who give this food a high rating has never had actual soul food. I'm not talking about unhealthy soul food, but pure soul food with flavor. Maybe this is what this location is trying to do, but when it came to OUR dishes, it fell short. Undercooked grits and boxed red beans and rice is an abomination to any good southern cook. COST: Our bill was $103.00 for a dish of shrimp & grits, two small orders of blackeye peas, one hamburger with four fries, one plate of grits and two glasses of wine. We had planned to split the bill, but I felt so embarrassed with the quality of our dishes, that I paid the bill in full myself. By the end of our meal, not a single guest arrived after us. So much for the ""reservation enforcer."""
10/16/2016,5 star rating,"I was at Boulevard Bistro last weekend and the catfish and cheese grits were fantastic! I have been thinking about the brunch the entire week, to the extent that I promised to go back before the month was out. It is a small venue, but the staff is great and the chef is warm and friendly. He genuinely seems to care about his clients. Fortunately, I was at an event last night where Blvd. Bistro showcased those tasty grits, cheese oozing and jalapeno poppin' off my taste buds. I felt like I hit the lotto!"
7/19/2018,4 star rating,I absolutely love BLVD Bistro. It is a black owned restaurant in Harlem that has been featured on Food Network many times. The food and the service here is excellent. If you want to get in on a weekend you absolutely have to make a reservation. But I can guarantee you that any wait you have is well worth it!
11/17/2016,5 star rating,"OMG their food is so good.  This place is definitely a hidden gem located in Harlem.  Nice decor, friendly staff, and good size portions for the price.  No mixed drinks only wine but their red sangria is delicious.  The only thing is the ambiance in this place can get very loud and the space is a bit tight.  You won't be uncomfortable though.Definitely returning soon.  This establishment has themselves a new customer!!!"
6/24/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing service! Awesome food! My first visit since they moved. We had a reservation for 7 people and while they were behind on seating us because they're still in soft opening, they made it up and ensured we were comfortable while we waited. The owner brought out a pitcher of mimosas, sangria , and biscuits while we waited and thoroughly apologized for the wait time. The place is really cute and they open the windows to let the breeze in which was a nice summer touch. I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits with cheese grits, so good! The chicken came out piping hot, crispy. The grits were so creamy, definitely a signature of theirs, and the biscuits came with jam and honey butter - Everything was good! Despite us waiting long, I highly recommend this place, like the owner said, ""it's not how you start but how you finish!"" I'll definitely be visiting again soon."
11/11/2016,4 star rating,"Ambiance is so charming, cozy, and romantic. Went there for the shrimp and grits and it did not disappoint!! 5 big shrimp and super rich thick creamy grits loaded with cheddar, bacon, and jalapeño. The service was awful tho. We got there around 5:15 pm and the place was empty but they literally ignored us and left us at the front lobby for 25 minutes. Outrageous!! Luckily the food was delish."
4/15/2016,4 star rating,"The food is Great!!!! However, I should recommend that the manager/employees stop taking walk-ins when they have over 5 groups scheduled for reservation with only 15 minute intervals in between reservations. I mean the place is too small and becomes extremely over-crowded and uncomfortable, no one wants to eat with people nearly on top of them. Other than that all the dishes on the menu that I've tried (chicken sliders, egg benedict, pancakes) was delicious......"
9/20/2016,5 star rating,Absolute slam dunk. Some of the most delicious soul food I've ever had.I went there with my wife and another couple. we had:- fried catfish: absolutely delicious. tender. flake. perfect buttery breading goodness.none of this over fried nastiness you often encounter.the grits that come with it are a creamy treat. it does not hurt that there is a poached egg on top.and the little biscuits with gravy... - warm out of the oven. a little crunchy on the outside and perfectly soft and flaky on the inside.we also had some peach pecan buttermilk pancakes that were fantastic.and they have very tasty little fried chicken sliders.Needless to mention we overate. And their stuff is not exactly light. If you go for brunch you don't really need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.Staff is very friendly and supportive. They relocated us to a better table. Then offered to comp drinks for the inconvenience which we gladly accepted :-)We until we couldn't move anymore. Check came out to about $ 35 / person which is not bad at all.
8/6/2016,3 star rating,"*sigh* Reluctantly giving this place 3 stars.... The service, the atmosphere and drinks were great... The food however, not So much. I had the catfish po boy... Fish was well undercooked and the bread was a bit too soggy. We also tried the potato salad, Biscuits (yummmmmy) and the collards. I'd skip the food next time and go straight for cocktails"
11/20/2015,5 star rating,"I would like to put this restaurant in my pocket and take it out whenever I need my fix. I went here last Saturday, without a reservation. But with a face and charm like mine, who needs one?! The host was extremely accommodating and even tho there was an hour wait, I was seated in less than 30 minutes!Received the biscuits with the crack... I'm sorry, cinnamon butter. I'm not sure if I was hungry but baby Jesus smacked me into heaven when I put this tiny biscuit in my mouth. May I add that I hate biscuits? Don't care for them. But THIS... I think I'm going to go pray now. Seeming as this sweet little biscuit produced a party in my mouth, I was extremely excited for the rest of the meal. I certainly was not disappointed! Service was amazing and the visit from the owner towards the end was the cherry on top.I can't wait to go back. #feening"
7/11/2016,5 star rating,Guys. This place is outstanding. I had some over the top delicious watermelon salad and the biscuits with the homemade butter is quite possibly the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.
7/16/2018,3 star rating,"The food was good. The service was crap. The waiter had a bad attitude and was too forgetful to not be older than 40 years old... everything we asked for, he forgot to bring.: an addition cup for water, burger sauce, a new fork, another drink, the check. Smh. The shrimp and grits were good, as was their sweet tea cocktail (or whatever it was called)."

The food was delicious, the biscuits were to die for I would come back just for the biscuits they were so fluffy and soft to the touch. I would recommend BLVD Bistro to my friends, however I have one (1) complaint, when I order chicken I don't want a chicken back, I didn't realize I was giving a chicken back until I got home. Other then that everything was wonderful again the food was delicious and the waiters were very friendly. I definitely would recommend BLVD to family and friendsand I would return"
12/10/2016,2 star rating,"Came to this spot to kill some time on a Saturday afternoon, ambiance was okay ( small space ) service has to navigate between the tables but that's nothing new for Harlem, NYC... what is new ( to my knowledge ) is $52.00 for 4 glasses of a house Malbec and a sub standard chianti! During brunch mind you...Now I don't consider myself to be particularly picky over price, but this was utterly ridiculous! Not feeling it at all. The menu was so so didn't eat, just wanted a nice experience with a glass of wine for my wife and I, dissapointed to say the least."
12/17/2019,1 star rating,"Yuck. We started with the fried chicken sliders, the cheese was shredded and not melted which made me think it came out of a bag. My friend got the shrimp and grits. The grits where literally like lava (and stayed that why for 15 min you can't tell me that didn't come out of a microwave)! Shredded bag cheese on top... if you're going to serve grits at this price at least mix it in. I had the Mac and cheese with bacon...again like lava. The bacon was like bacon bits out of a jar, and the cheese was separated, did not finish. The server was more interested in the table of women next to us then us. He took our order and left the check. I wrote a similar review on another site and the ""Proprietor"" respond back that I should have man upped and let someone know... What the hell does that mean? Is he going to break my legs? As a gay man I also took this as extremely offensive, If your going to run a restaurant in this neighborhood I suggest you loose the homophobic lingo. For those that are in the neighborhood, go across the street to Texas Fried Chicken, its just as bad but more then half the price. You get 1 star because the biscuit was good (although it seems all the other tables were given baskets of them except for us...again our server was really bad)... Not as good as a Bo's Bagel."
8/5/2018,4 star rating,"So came here with friends of mine  from Virginia  and the other from Alabama. The place is small quaint. If you do not like small this not the place for you. We had the pan fried catfish grits and biscuits and the pan fried  chicken. The grits are to die for. The chicken  was a little  dry but tasty, well seasoned nothing a little country gravy  couldn't fix the catfish was perfect  I would  definitely  recommend  this place."
12/15/2018,4 star rating,Wonderful food for brunch and dinner. My only complaint is that they are amateurs when it comes to reservations and seating efficiency. Been turned away twice because they didn't have the ability to accommodate basic reservations we had made. Embarrassing for out of town guests.
10/9/2018,4 star rating,We made reservations for Brunch for 3pm.  When we got there the line was outside and people were waiting. We asked about our reservation and the hostess who was inexperienced with dealing with the public stated we had to wait still because the reservations were backed up. She said we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. We waited about 30 minutes and we were seated.  The service was good. I had catfish and grits and it was delicious. We also had Sangria.  I would go again. It is small inside and the tables are close together. Hopefully the reservation process will improve.
12/1/2018,3 star rating,Proficient but mostly unexceptional takes on soul food classics at (con) inflated prices in (pros) a charming brownstone with a congenial staff.

4/10/2018,5 star rating,"As a brunch lover BLVD Bistro has been on my list for a while and it did not disappoint! I ate here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30. Thankfully, I made a reservation because the wait for a table would have been an 1-1 1/2hrs. The hostess was very accommodating. My friend was running late but she held our table until he arrived. The food was AMAZING! Our waiter was very energetic and told us his recommendations (any dish with biscuits or grits). My friend and I each got a mimosas. I decided on the Homemade Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwiches with Tomato & Chives. I wasn't sure if I was going to be full but I was satisfied. My friend got the Catfish and Grits and he throughly enjoyed it. As someone who is often described as ""hard to please"", I was pleased with BLVD Bistro and will definitely be returning!"
8/20/2018,3 star rating,"When I first visited this location , the quality and service were all great. Came here for brunch recently and was a little dissatisfied on how the quality how decreased and just the general appearance of the location. There were many flies everywhere which I would consider unhygienic . I also do not understand how a Resturant which is very busy for brunch runs out of most of their brunch items. Hopefully some things change ."
3/29/2015,5 star rating,BEST BRUNCH I have had. I had the omelette with fresh herbs and home fries and my boyfriend had the French toast . Absolutely delicious ! The service was great and attentive . The mimosas were good and strong . The atmosphere of the Resturant was very homey and I will definitely be visiting again !
10/24/2016,5 star rating,"Super tasty food, reasonable prices (especially if you get there during happy hour!). The waitstaff are attentive and helpful. I look forward to returning."
2/21/2019,1 star rating,"I had very high expectations for BLVD Bistro after reading many glowing reviews.  Very disappointing.  The restaurant is so small that my chair was hitting the chair of the person behind me.  The coffee was terrible.  The bread basket was completely uninspired, something you could find in a airport or a crap bakery.  The cinnamon roll, blueberry danish, and whatever else they threw in there were cold and very mediocre.  Then the biscuits.  You would expect biscuits at a souther soul food restaurant to be out of this world.  These were bland, cold, crumbly, and overall unappealing.  Biscuits from a can would be better.  I ordered the fried chicken sliders only to be served a slate with two biscuits that were crumpling and 2 small, cold pieces of boneless chicken with flavorless cheese.  I for one do not consider small pieces of boneless chicken to be fried chicken.  I was served chicken nuggets.  My uncle got shrimp and grits.  Definitely the best dish we ordered, but it was overpriced.  My aunt got an omelet that was very uninspired and boring. And again overpriced.  Overall, BLVD Bistro is overpriced and not worth it.  If you want good fried chicken and biscuits, go to Jacobs Pickle."
1/4/2016,5 star rating,"Me and my boyfriend went to this place on a whim on New Year's Day for brunch, and we are SO glad we did! The place was rather busy since they are normally not open on Fridays, but made an exception for the holiday. We were told that the wait would be at least and hour, but they took down our number to text us when our table was ready. The space is relatively small. It is very cute and cozy in the bottom of a brownstone. We we seated a table with another pair already eating. It was a little awkward because the table is set-up as if we were a party of 4, but split between two couples. Once we were seated we just focused on enjoying the space and the arrangement really didn't matter.The service was GREAT! From the General manager to the waitress and servers, everyone was very attentive. The FOOD was amazing! I ordered the catfish and grits and my bf ordered shrimp and grits. They had to be the best grits I have ever had at a restaurant. We throughly enjoyed the food and would return!"
8/6/2016,5 star rating,"My friend and I went here Thursday and had the most AMAZING time! We had okra (which I didn't think I would like until I tried them)  and chicken sliders for apps. SO GOOD! Our server, Star, couldn't be anymore lovely! Let me start by saying I don't like grits. The texture is weird and I personally think it's just an ugly food. So why I order shrimp & grits is really beyond me but I did. Did I regret it? NOT ONE MORSEL!!! I don't know what kind of voodoo they do in that kitchen but those grits were creamy like Mac & Cheese and tasted like heaven! I was beyond impressed!"
8/2/2016,5 star rating,"The food was amazing!!! I had the biscuits and gravy, porkchop (which was huge btw) and apple cobbler with a side of cinnamon ice cream as well as the red sangria while my husband had the corn chowder, Grouper and banana bread pudding . Everything was delicious and authentic tasting. Could've sworn they had my grandmother in the back. The service was great and the restaurant is cute. I will definitely be back. I recommend any and everyone stop in and try it out."
11/17/2019,5 star rating,"Wonderful food!! I went there for breakfast recently and had the catfish and grits. The grits were amazing the eggs were great ( if you get them scrambled, ask for them to be scrambled hard they came out a little runny but they cooked me a fresh batch) and the fish, while a little bland, was fresh. I ate allllll my food. Usually I eat just a portion. The service was great and the vibe was good as well. I will most certainly be back. Maybe for lunch next time. This place is a Must to stop by and eat."
9/5/2017,3 star rating,"Food is bomb. Some of the best I've had in Harlem! I got the biscuits with sausage, egg, and cheese. My friend got the crab cake. Both entrees were to die for and I was very full by the end. I give it 3 stars because of the price-- it is a little expensive for how much food you get, and for the small space. It feels packed with people. It took a while to be served (typical Harlem), but the waitstaff was very nice. I'll def go back anytime I'm craving a biscuit."
7/4/2018,3 star rating,This place was pretty good. The prices were a little overboard- I paid $30 for shrimp & grits. At most it would've been reasonable if it were about $10 less. However the shrimp & grits were delicious! The amount of shrimp was pretty decent as well. The only thing negative was that it was sooo smokey inside the restaurant and there was little ventilation to the point where my eyes were burning most of the time I was there. Would I go back? Probably so ‍
4/22/2018,4 star rating,"The food was delicious! My favorite was our drink, we had the ice tea mimosa, definitely a first. The biscuits were amazing and they had little tiny jam n raspberry jam! The jams were soo yummy on the biscuits. The only reason i am giving them 4 stars is because the space in the restaurant is very limited."
11/9/2018,5 star rating,"Brunch here is a WOW... my bf and I were looking for a good last minute brunch place and ended up here. He loves it so much we have gone 3 Sundays in a row. Great food, Must try the shrimp and grits."
1/10/2016,2 star rating,"We came here for brunch on Sunday and the wait was an hour, which is normal for popular brunch places. We got seated in a communal table outside after they refused to seat us in an individual table even though there were two tables available right next to us -- apparently they had people waiting to be seated yet nobody actually sat there until we left. The table was wobbly and the couple next to us spilled their water. We asked a waiter to either clean it or give us napkins and he said ""we're not cleaning it, it's raining outside."" Someone eventually got us a few extra napkins.We ordered pancakes and French toast and they were okay, nothing special and *definitely* not worth the terrible service."
2/20/2016,5 star rating,"By far the best service ever! The food is phenomenal. Anywhere your lucky enough to experience, great service, great food, great location deserves a review to help spread the word.

And it helps that it's reasonably price! Thanks BLVD BISTRO. My wife & I had a great time!"

11/5/2016,4 star rating,"Walked into BLVD for lunch on a Saturday around 12pm. We didn't have a reservation but only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated. The place serves good solid southern food and has a cozy vibe. As a vegetarian, southern food doesn't always provide many options, but I was pleasantly surprised with the choices at BLVD. The biscuit sandwiches with egg, cheese, tomatoes and chives were great. Service was good and the food came out quickly. Definitely recommend for a weekend brunch."
8/25/2018,5 star rating,Anybody saying anything bad about the food here are absolutely lying to you . I went here today with my wife for brunch and everything we had was GREAT. The biscuits are freaking awesome. My shrimp n grits were amazing. I don't know who made the grits but whoever it was put they foot in it BEST GRITS I've ever had and I eat grits everywhere I go. My wife had this bacon egg n cheese thing on a biscuit which she said was awesome. I'm assuming it was because she wasn't trying to share it with me. The Blvd punch was good as well. Overall every was amazing and we definitely will be back. It's a small place so if you not into small places it may not be the place for you but other than that everything else is awesome. I'm already planning my next visit I literally can't stop telling people about the grits
2/6/2018,4 star rating,"Came here after church!  The food was pretty good, we had to wait since we didn't have a reservation.  It's just kind of tight in there if you have a big group your kind of screwed.  But the staff is nice!"
10/8/2019,2 star rating,I first ate here when they were in the basement of the brownstone.  I thought the food was amazing.  I recently went in their new location and was not impressed.  The chicken wings were not tasty.  I did not like the sauce.  The collard greens were just ok.  They could have been seasoned better.  The beans and rice were good but looked as if the dish was not freshly cooked.  The biscuit was the best part of the meal.  The service was excellent and the entire staff was friendly.  I doubt I will be back though because I was not impressed with the food.  My advice.  Whatever recipes you used when you were in the brownstone go back to that.
10/7/2018,1 star rating,"I give this place one star ... our Sunday funday turned into hangry Sunday.  I had 3:30 reservations , was seated at 4:30 because we opted for the picnic table.  fine it is NYC  so  the occasional sewage smell was tolerable.

1/23/2017,5 star rating,"This brownstone restaurant is quaint. Seating is tight which, at times, felt as if everyone was seated together. But that's also part of the charm. The layout was magical and intentional! As we were deciding on what to order, the woman to my left said, ""They gave us an extra biscuit, would you like it?"" I was really hoping she was offering up a piece of her crunchy, munchy fried chicken, but maybe next time. A few minutes later, the woman to my right, who was indulging in a plate of oversized waffle goodness, looked over and said, ""This is absolutely delicious!"" I smiled, thinking a waffle was coming our way. And yet, as my niece and I engaged in conversation, everyone seemed to disappear. People were classy and respectful of the space, and of each other. Thank goodness our food came quickly, and it did not disappoint. My catfish, cheese grits and eggs made me forget all about my friendly neighbors. The catfish was moist and perfectly seasoned, not salty. My niece ordered her favorite, the waffles and eggs with cheese grits. Oh, those cheese grits are YES! Thanks bunches to Owner and Executive Chef, Carlos Swepson, for this Harlem jewel. Kudos to my niece, Raean, for the selection."
2/11/2018,5 star rating,This might be the best brunch I've ever had in NYC. We visit NYC 4x a year and we always try 2 new places each visit. This place is TINY. We waited an hour and 45 minutes. The food was worth every minute. I had the blueberry pancakes and crab Benedict's. The pancakes didn't even need syrup. The crab was fresh lump crab. My fiancé had French toast which was just ok for him. My future sister in law had the fish and waffle. She finished it in five minutes and she's a picky eater.
9/26/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent food AND service!I brought my Mom here on Sept. 24th [at about 1:30 PM], to celebrate her upcoming 84th birthday.This was our second time at Blvd Bistro ... after it had been recommended to us by my daughter-in-law.  Our first visit was back in April, when my sister and daughter-in-law had come.My mom and I both ordered something different this time -- than what we had eaten, (catfish shrimps, grits and eggs) -- when we were last here.This time we ordered the fried chicken, collard greens and potato salad ""dinner"".Everything was DELICIOUS!     We complimented the owner and I wished him continued success. Mom and I both had some chicken left over, so we took it home.I live in NY/Westchester and Mom lives in Connecticut -- and even after a few hours of local shopping, and our respective trips back home, our boxed up food was just fine. The price is just right, and I left a generous tip!Well done, Blvd Bistro!"

Been planning to come here for a minute... so when my sister hit me up and said 'lets do brunch, pick the spot my treat' I immediately said, ""Blvd Bistro!"" She let me wild out... so I ordered the shrimp n cheddar grits, the egg biscuits, and a mimosa. She had the catfish po' boy with a side of grits and the peach ice tea. Everything was on point and flavorful... but those grits tho! Must've had like three cheeses up in there including mozzarella... cray! Tasted my sister's peach ice tea and had to order one too... (i'm greedy) but that's none of your business right? Will definitely be back for the weekend brunch one day... maybe I can convince Carlos to be a little more generous with the grits for that Fifth Star."

9/3/2015,5 star rating,This is truly the best soul food I've had in New York City in an extremely long time. Like EXTREMELY.COM/BEENHERETENYEARS.PHP I have returned to BLVD three Sundays in a row with different people. It's damn near sad yet endearing. I bet the waitstaff are confused but I DONT CARE. I love it.Here are the best items according to moi:1.) Mac and Cheese2.) Biscuit Sandwiches (Brunch)3.) Fried ChickenThe greens are on point and the service (which in Harlem usually sucks) is on point! Please support this business. The key to scoring a seat is arriving 20 to 30 minutes early. It's a small space.
4/16/2018,1 star rating,"I went to brunch at this establishment a few weeks ago. It's safe to say I won't be coming back. The food was average and the customer service was HORRIBLE. The women at the front had a very short attitude. It felt as if she thought she was doing everyone a favor and not doing her job. It didn't feel welcoming at all. Also, just an FYI this establishment isn't serving any alcohol at this time because of a liquor license renewal."
5/15/2015,4 star rating,"We brought Mom here for Mother's Day Brunch. While waiting, I had my eyes on the blueberry pancakes that had been served to another group.  I love pancakes! Unfortunately, a great pancake is not easy to come by.  In no particular order- a good pancake has to have a combination of just the right texture, thickness & taste. I was reluctant to order the blueberry pancakes just because I was too hungry to deal w/ disappointment. Whatever, I decided to throw caution to the wind & give 'em a try. Welllll, this place has gotten it right! The blueberry pancakes are a winner!! Texture, taste & thickness on point. Idk what brand of syrup was used but it was the perfect compliment. Very delicious! Can't wait to return for another brunch...& dinner."
9/28/2015,5 star rating,"Had a great brunch experience here. The place is small, but somehow not crowded at all. The service is very detail and customer-oriented. Service staff and owners were constantly checking on our table, even with a packed house. The food was awesome. We shared the catfish and grits, shrimp and grits, and biscuit sandwiches. They were all very flavorful, and portioned generously. Get the biscuits! For sure, get the biscuits! Will definitely return."
8/1/2015,5 star rating,"This place is wonderful. We sat at a communal table, which we expected, ordered the brunch and it was MAGNIFICENT!! Great food, great drinks. Everything on the menu is spectacular and it has a real family feel to it.We will definitely be back!"
12/26/2017,4 star rating,"My friend and I came on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty so I liked that. It's not a huge space, but it's very charming. To start, they provided us with biscuits that came with this special butter. My god, it was tasty! I ordered the jumbo shrimp and cheesy grits (shrimp and grits virgin over here) and my friend ordered the pan-fried chicken, which came with potato salad and collard greens. My dish was excellent! The grits were nice and creamy and the shrimp were so succulent and delicious. I tried my friend's collard greens and potato salad. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad, but the collard greens were divine! I would most definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Harlem area."
6/9/2015,3 star rating,"I'm torn. Visited BLVD to catch up with a girlfriend who I hadn't seen in a long time. This isn't the place to have a few glasses of wine and share appetizers. You come, sit, eat, and leave because you're on the waiter's time and they don't have to time for you to be hogging up precious real estate in their narrow quarters. Get a little too comfy and they will certainly let you know. Fair enough. Just a heads up.The biscuits are the best! I'm not even sure how to describe them. I'll just say that I ate two of them and they are fairly large.The menu...I don't know. I feel like the menus selections were odd. Why mac and cheese as a main course? Did it come with greens at least? Can the menu at least mention the sides or is that too pedestrian? Maybe I should have asked. I ordered the cod po'boy and surprise, it came with potato salad! The Po'Boy was amaze. Seasoned to perfection, crispy. Perfecto. The potato salad was ok. My friend ordered the fried chicken sliders and let me have a bite. I was disappointed as the chicken was dry and bland. Maybe some dressing would have helped. If a friend invited me to BLVD Bistro, I wouldn't object, however, I wouldn't take a friend or hubby there again."
3/21/2018,5 star rating,"Fantastic restaurant, Chef Carlos has done an amazing job curating the menu here. What I like the most about this place is that no mater how busy it is, no matter how packed it is, Chec Carlos makes sure he comes out to greet every guest that is there. I've enjoyed almost everything on the menu. Definitely a place I would suggest you visiting. If your thinking about going on a Saturday or Sunday make sure you call to check the wait time. It's worth the wait though."
4/18/2015,1 star rating,"I'm yelping from my table at the restaurant because this place sucked that bad. Nothing that I had was better than anything I could make at home. The French toast was flavorless (it comes with three slices of bread cut in halves I could only stomach two halves). The blueberries in the pancakes weren't fresh. The home fries tasted like you were biting into solid salt. The bacon was $6 for like 4 pieces; you can get a whole pack for $5 in the grocery store. Also it's advertised as maple Apple bacon and it tasted like regular bacon. Super over priced for not great food. We asked the server how many glasses come in a carafe of mimosas and she said four. (There are three of us so we didn't do it.) Then the table beside us got it and all four girls got at least two mimosas. We would have done it if we knew that were the case...they lost out on money and lessened our brunch experience. Also they never brought out the mimosa that was ordered...To say the least, I was not impressed.I'm editing my comment because after I posted the review, one of the chefs came to our table to ask how our food was. One of my friends was in the restroom and the other was at the table with me. My friend said it was good and I gave my honest opinion, that I wasn't impressed. He was very combative and made my friend uncomfortable as he was screaming at us in the middle of the restaurant. My other friend came back and said she liked the food just fine. Apparently, he read my review and wanted to confront me. As we were getting up to walk out, the owner/head chef asked what the problem was. And I told him oh that guy just asked my opinion and I told him. (I assumed he wanted to know why I was being yelled at) And he called me names and told me to leave. His wife asked us to talk for a bit and she was very nice and hospitable. She invited us to come back to get a second opinion of the place. And I would probably go back if I were staying in NY longer. After the incident, my friends and siblings tried to convince me to give more stars. My friends argued that they enjoyed it. And my siblings argued that it's NY so of course it's expensive. But I can't give more stars because this is about my experience there, not my friend's. And it wasn't about money. I've been to plenty of expensive places and spent more and was happy to do so. But I just didn't think this particular place was worth it. But I'm just one person so don't base your dining experience on my one opinion."
7/18/2019,5 star rating,"Love it!! Had the pork chops, went during the soft opening, wasn't a full menu. Can't wait to try selections on the full menu."
5/10/2015,4 star rating,Came across this restaurant at this link and wanted to support it: idontdoclubs.com/2015/05…What a great decision! The food and service were great. The portions of the meals were ample. The servers were all so attentive. Will definitely be back there soon!
8/4/2016,5 star rating,"We love their food!  Brunch is usually very packed and I wish they accepted reservations for small parties, but we've always been over the top satisfied with their food during brunch.  Dinner menu is not as attractive as the brunch.  It seems as though they've recently made a few improvements to the restaurant which was great to see.  Their biscuits are amazing!!!!! :-)"
5/21/2017,3 star rating,"Nothing too special to write home about BUT, nonetheless the food and service was fare. CONS:A bit pricey with smaller portions then I would like. I ordered the Catfish and Grits, wish I had ordered something else to fill me up.PROS:Seasoned just right, waiters were nice. Wait time wasn't too bad. Get there before 11:30AM for brunch to beat the rush."
5/16/2017,3 star rating,"I took my friend out to this place and at first the cute low key relaxing vibe won my heart! And the service was spectacular. However the food is not worth the price. I started out with the fried chicken sliders. Which had a butter biscuit bun I truly enjoyed. This appetizer was raved about online so I just had to try it. When it finally arrived at the table, I saw only the biscuit. Reasons being is the chicken was extremely tiny. For $14 dollars the chicken was barley the size of my ping pong ball. I would have been paying for just the biscuit. (Insane) To top it off my friend ordered the same thing and her chicken & biscuit was partially burnt.Luckily the waiter was super sweet and had no problem taking the food back and replacing it with a fresh new meal, with the correct chicken portion. But by then after waiting a while we were no longer interested in ordering an entree. I will say this, their signature drink is deeeellliiiccciiiooouussssss!!!! I believe it's the BLVD spiked tea. I would definitely come back for  that."
5/13/2017,4 star rating,"+++- Spiked tea (two thumbs up)- cheddar grits are some of the best i had++- The boast that they have the best biscuit (it is up there)- shrimp are huge- dope mac n cheese- awesome and personable service+- apple cobbler was good, but could have used something to offset the sweetness (more on that later)- the burger must have been good, my friend failed to share some with me-- No ice cream or whipped cream- They only give four fries with the burger"
5/11/2017,5 star rating,"Loved this place for brunch.. the outdoor patio was super cute, the wait wasnt bad, and their biscuits were the real deal.  I've been in the neighborhood for 3 years and shocked that I have missed out on this place for so long.. would go again and again."
5/9/2017,5 star rating,"My friend commented ""I want to make a yelp just to give this place 5 stars,"" so I will do it for both of us!!This place is slightly more $ than your average brunch place, but this place is by no means average! The staff here is phenomenal, creating a super warm and inviting vibe. We started with the bread basket, which comes with delicious pasties and their outrageous biscuits (2.) While the shrimp and grits and the mac and cheese were delicious, the crab cakes Benedict were truly another level. I definitely plan on visiting again soon just to get the crab cakes again! Perfectly seasoned and SO fresh!"
5/7/2017,5 star rating,"BLVD is Southern food done right.  Many places that do Southern are so greasy and salty that there is no style to the food at all. BLVD chef makes his food fresh and perfection. Comfort food that is crispy, buttery, and has balanced seasoning. You leave completely stuffed from the overly generous portions but without that ""lump in your stomach"" feeling you might get at some of the more ""famous"" grease pits. This is Harlem food done at the caliber of Melba's or Samuelson's places. Brunches are popular and command an outrageously long wait from lots of patrons who don't live in the neighborhood. Folks around here know to go on a weekday lunch or week night to be able to savor the deliciousness without feeling rushed."
5/6/2017,4 star rating,"Came here for Sunday brunch with my sister. I was initially put-off by the long wait time, but the staff's hospitality quickly changed my mood. Our waitress (I can't remember her name, sorry!) was very polite and easy-going. When I notified her that it was my sister's birthday, she made sure that my sister had the best service. Their biscuits taste amazing. The pancakes are to die for! This is definitely a go-to spot for Southern Comfort/ Soul Food. The only other thing to know is that this venue is small, hence the long wait time."
4/23/2017,5 star rating,"So we came on a busy Sunday for a late brunch. Seated outside on a beautiful day we had no problem waiting for our fried chicken and biscuits (which they say takes 20 minutes as it is prepared fresh). After almost an hour of waiting we are told that our food is coming but they ran out of biscuits! HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF BISCUITS WHEN YOUR MENU AND REVIEWS ALL SAY HOW AMAZING THEY ARE??  We were both really disappointed and ready to leave to find another place to get our fix when the owner came out and literally begged us to stay. She was so sweet and caring that we agreed. Boy am I glad I did stay, the Fried Chicken was outstanding.  Almost to the point that I might say it's the best fried chicken I ever had...! The owner gave us her card, comped the meal, gave us a mac and cheese order and invited us back to make sure we could taste the biscuits. This could have been a 2 star review but all the staff felt so bad and were so nice and truly caring about having screwed up our brunch that I have to bump them to 5 stars. And by the way...the food, oh the food.....!! We are coming back next Saturday night to try those biscuits. Thanks for showing us what great customer service is all about."
4/23/2017,5 star rating,"So here's a happy story that started sadly and ended happily.  We had wanted to eat at BLVD for a while and were on a mission to find the best fried chicken on the island.  We ordered the chicken & biscuits, grits and drinks and waited......and waited, and....  Eventually it was revealed that something had gone wrong in the kitchen and worse they had run out of their signature biscuits.  The staff was sweet & apologetic.  My food partner was ready to just bail. The owner came over and was genuinely apologetic and upset. When my partner in deep chicken withdrawal sighed that ""she didn't care"" she hugged us and swore she deeply did. Delicious sumptuous fried chicken arrived with sides immediately and the whole meal was comped.  We were warmly invited back and we will.  Shit does happen it was the end of a busy Sunday we get it.  It's how a place responds and deals that won our hearts.  The chicken was perfectly crisp juicy and spiced.  The mac n cheese, grits were great too. We will be back for the biscuits and more chicken & cool ambiance soon!"
4/23/2017,2 star rating,"I came in on Sunday 1:30 pm for a party of two. It was 45 minute wait, so I came back about 2:15pm. They took our phone number down up drop in reservation, but they made no attempt to contact us from the local coffee shop. There really is no reason to have our phone number then.It took them to get us our food an hour after we ordered, making it a late 3:30pm brunch. We had the catfish egg with biscuit and grits, the other is a fried chicken and biscuits basket. The chicken, biscuits and catfish tasted fresh. The biscuits were very buttery.In summary, be prepared to pregame and eat before hand if you don't mind the 2+ hour wait time."
8/25/2019,1 star rating,"This is my first time here but it will probably be my last time. I'm all about supporting local businesses but I refuse to give my business to places that are not organized. We came here without reservation on a Sunday afternoon. I understood that we would not be seated right away but I did not think it would take this long. We have been waiting to en seated for over and hour and a half. When we try to speak to the hostess/hosts they did not acknowledge us right away and seemed confused about what they were doing. They appear to have a system of texting you when the table is ready when I went inside to check on our wait time, they seems to be calling people out loud even though there were people waiting n outside, no one went out to check if the patrons were maybe outside waiting. They would just call out your name (not in aloud voice either) and if you did not respond within 2 seconds they would move on to the next and the next. It seems like it's just the new kid in town, and if they continue the way they are, they won't last long. Sorry, I can't review the food or service because guess what, I'm going on 2 hours and still don't have a table."
10/12/2015,5 star rating,"Oh my god!!! How didi I not find this place sooner?  The place is amazing. All the staff is super attentive, the food is delicious and the ambience is really cute. I love that Chef/owner Carlos is walking around and talking to his guests.  I wish they gave more biscuits and had more of a wine selection but other wise this place is perfect."
6/25/2019,2 star rating,"We went for the food (June 25 Tues) and it disappointed. We went based on the great reviews from its original location plus one of our party raves about the old place. First the atmosphere, music selection really fit--classic r&b and not too loud. Second our server was Ray and he was excellent: knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. But our entrees, fried chicken and catfish were barely warm, and noticeably had been prepared a long time ago and maybe re-fried? Potato salad was average. Collard greens and watermelon goat cheese salad killed! Both superb. Come on y'all--this is your chance to shine-new location. Get your fried food game on and stay consistent. Tighten up the kitchen and you'll succeed."

2/10/2015,5 star rating,"SUPPORT BLACK OWNED BUSINESS!!!SUPPORT HARLEM!!!This magnificent brother and sister own and run this incredible little gem.My ladies and I got there after a show, and we were told the kitchen was about to close. Sad faces all around. Whatever, we decided to stay and order some cocktails, but a few moments later the head chef/ co-owner came out to chat with us! Even though it was late he made us a few small snack and salads, all of which were amazing! His sister/ co- owner also came out and chatted with us about how they got started and where they're headed. Beyond the amazing service, food and atmosphere-  they are an inspiration to the community. Born and raised just a few blocks from the location their hearts reside in Harlem- i respect the shit outta stuff like this. I LOVE when people have pride in Harlem, it's a beautiful part of NYC and these folks make it easy to continue to love and support the neighborhood."
8/17/2019,3 star rating,"Went here today for brunch with my mom and aunt. The service started off great then spiraled downward in the mist of our time there. My aunt and I both ordered the catfish and grits while my mom ordered the shrimp and grits. For drinks they both got the granddaddy punch while I got the spiked tea. The drink was good it had Prosecco so it was bubbly and fruity. The granddaddy punch had henny and some fruit juice which they both enjoyed. When we first got seated our waiter was very warm and welcoming. Prior to the arrival of our food we asked for hot sauce and napkins which was never delivered we had to ask for it again once our food arrived.   Once the food arrived and we began eating our waiter never came back to make sure everything was ok nor did he ask if we needed anything. But we heard him asking the men sitting behind us if they wanted any condiments so he could bring them out as he was bringing the food out. This made my mom ask him why didn't he give us the same treatment. We had to ask twice for the condiments. He proceeded to say ""Oh they got catfish and grits so I assumed they wanted some sauces."" As mentioned previously, my aunt and I both ordered the catfish and grits. Now on to the food, the catfish was fried using cornstarch which would not have been my choice but hey. It was not friend hard enough - the coating began to fall off the fish. The biscuits were dry and our server never asked or brought us honey, jelly, etc. to put on them. The eggs were watery and seems as if they were not all the way cooked. My mom enjoyed her shrimp and grits, which we decided was the better option. I do like that the new location is more spacious but the customer service this visit wasn't as great as the first time around."
12/15/2018,3 star rating,"I would have loved to give this place 5 stars but the spacing inside this establishment is unacceptable. This place is way too small and was wayyy too packed when I went for Sunday brunch with a girlfriend. People were literally on our backs as they were waiting to be seated. Aside from that, the food was great I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the Sunday dinner with catfish. My dish was filling I couldn't finish it. My friend enjoyed her dish as well. We had a pitcher of spiked lemonade which we didn't finish it was really good. The food here is good but they need more space to accommodate their customers."
11/11/2015,5 star rating,"I loved everything about this place! From the food, to the enegy of the restaurant/crowd but the 5 stars is well deserved for the service of the amazing staff @ Blvd Bistro. I looooved our waitress. The manager came & spoke to us about the menu suggestions. The owners were sooo gracious & sweet. Even the bus boy asked us if we were OK. We were treated like Harlem royalty. The food & drinks were amazing. I tipped the waitress well & didnt even pay attention to how much the food was bc I was having such a good time. Other restaurants should take notes on how to treat their customers & professionalism of an establishment. F I V E   S T A R S."
9/24/2018,3 star rating,"I went in really wanting to like this place, but was let down. It's really pricey. I wanted to order the crab Benedict and the server informed us that they weren't serving that on that day. Bummer. I ordered the eggs because they came with a biscuit, bacon and home fries, and many of the other brunch entrees didn't come with as many sides (I'd normally order something more interesting than that, but I wanted variety). It was not of fine dining caliber. The eggs were greasy and because of the skillet serving dish, the grease got all over the rest of my food. I'd have thought that a place like this would put some care into their eggs and maybe add some more gourmet touches. Based on the price pint and what you actually get for the money, I don't know if I'll go back. I was intrigued by the fried chicken biscuit though..."
8/6/2015,4 star rating,"Downside in general, is that it is a very tiny place so you can wait a bit for seating (they have outdoor seating but that is very limited as well & not ideal on a HOT summer day.)I had the shrimp and grits with (cheese/bacon) - this was ok until it got cold (I like a more smooth consistency grit but other than that, the flavor was awesome)The buttermilk buiscuit & spread (was ah-mazing...buttery and delicious and hot; the biscuit didn't need the spread but the fatty-girl couldn't get enough)The raspberry sparkling tea (was pretty good, not too sweet and refreshing)Home fries (well seasoned and really good)Peach cobbler w/cinnamon ice cream- phenomenal...needed a lil more peach in it.  I think it was an end piece..My companion had the poached eggs/crab cakes, she enjoyed her plate and pulled the CHEF to the side and raved about the plate.  We shared the home fries which she enjoyed as well.  Since we arrived early, we weren't able to partake in the ADULT brunch beverages that were being served after we had already finished our meals.  I'll be back b/c there are a few other items I would love to try.Last but not least in your dining consideration is you can't make a reservation unless you are dining with 4 or more people."

9/1/2015,4 star rating,"This little hidden gem in Harlem is the bestest.  Ooh the biscuits.  Did I mention the biscuits.  Great contemporary soul food. Still true to tradition with just a little twist here and there. I am a grits snob and their cheese grits are the bomb dot com. We had spiked iced tea, catfish and grits, mac and cheese and biscuit sandwiches.  EVERYTHING was delish! I had absolutely no complaints. The chef came out to greet us.  The staff was super friendly. Especially, Mr. Pugh! This place could be my Cheers. So nice and pleasant! We came on  Saturday afternoon and it wasn't really that packed.  Which was prefect for me.  I really enjoyed my laid back lunch with some good music, good company and good eats.  The only reason I won't give a 5 is because of the gnats flying around.  The side door was open so that may have been a factor but it was a turn off.  The bathroom needed some tidying up too. These are easy fixes."
6/14/2018,5 star rating,Best soul food EvER!!! A must experience!!!great ambiance-excellent service. Biscuits delish! We had to try the different dishes at the table. All happy food.
6/14/2016,5 star rating,I had Sunday brunch here with a couple of friends. There was a 30 minute wait but they gave us mimosas to help make the time go by. I loved the vibe of the restaurant. It felt like I was getting a home cooked meal. I ordered the French toast which was amazing. Highly recommend this place!
10/27/2015,4 star rating,"Had brunch here this past Saturday. When we arrived we were told the wait would be 45 minutes. That turned into a little over an hour. The host was very apologetic and told us our first round of drinks were on him! Loved that. Not many places are that accommodating. The food was well worth the wait. I had the shrimp and grits and The grits were very creamy and delicious. My mother ordered the shrimp and catfish. Even more delicious. The biscuits were buttery and flaky and the honey butter and jam complimented the biscuits so well that I had to order another order. This is a super tiny establishment so be prepared for a long wait, but trust me it's worth it!!"
6/10/2016,5 star rating,"Very good soul food!! The fried chicken is perfect and the collard greens have a touch of vinegar, which is great. The spiked iced tea was all that and some. I will definitely come back."
11/17/2017,4 star rating,"Amazing shrimp and grits, biscuits (including the spiced butter they bring), pork chop, and bbq ribs.  The fried chicken is not the best I have ever had, but it is delicious.   The venue itself is really small and quaint and located in a fun part of Harlem.   They do not have liquor but make up for it with wine cocktails and local craft beers.   The heat was a little over bearing the night I was there as it is a pretty small venue with the kitchen right off the dining room."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,"Most amazing southern/soul food I've had in a long time. The food is simply great. Had a few different things on the menu and was disappointed by nothing. Accommodations are limited, so plan accordingly."
11/6/2015,5 star rating,I decided to dine at Blvd bistro because it is a black owned business that I wanted to support and I heard nothing but good things about their meals. We were first greeted by our waitress who was amazing and offered great advice on helping us select our meals for the night. We started off with the short rib quesadillas which was beyond delicious. We followed that up with the Shrimp and Grits and the catfish meal. Both dishes were equally delicious and very flavorful. We washed our meals down with the sweet tea and prosecco drink... Such an amazing elixir.Overall the experience was amazing. The wait staff has the best customer service I have ever experienced. I also discovered that the head chef is also the owner of the restaurant. He was so nice and charismatic . I was very satisfied with my meal and I have declared this place as a go to spot for whenever I am in the mood for comfort food.
3/5/2015,4 star rating,"Second time's the charm!I wrote a review a few weeks back describing an unpleasant experience at Blvd Bistro. Shortly after publishing the review, Mrs. Swepson, who co-owns the restaurant with her husband (who's the chef), contacted me and apologized for my dissatisfaction. She also invited me to return to Blvd Bistro with a friend, on the house. Since I was visiting New York  and leaving the day after the offer was extended (and they're closed on Mondays), I asked Mrs. Swepson if my friend who was unable to be seated at my original gathering could take my place and invite a guest, which she agreed to do. My friend and her friend went to dinner at Blvd Bistro on Tuesday and immensely enjoyed it. Their server was amazing and very attentive and they had the opportunity to meet and speak with Chef Swepson, which they really liked. I never had a problem with the food at Blvd Bistro  (the breakfast biscuits at brunch are amazing!) and my friend said the dinner was really good, so I'm glad to know that the quality of food is superior across the board. I don't like writing less than positive reviews about businesses unless I feel so strongly about something that I can't keep my peace. However, the hospitality the Swepsons extended to me in seeking to remedy my experience at Blvd Bistro and the service my friend subsequently received is commendable. I'm glad to know that my initial visit was the exception to the Blvd Bistro experience and not the example of it. On my next, hopefully longer, trip to New York, I'd love to return and delight in those biscuits again."
2/22/2015,3 star rating,"DELICIOUS food, less than delicious service. This is my first time in New York and I wanted to see a group of friends at once in order to maximize on what little time I had here. Apparently, every restaurant in this city is known for its ""fabulous"" brunch. I chose Blvd Bistro because it's a black-owned business, my friends recommended it, and everyone said the food was delicious. Food: it was divine! I had the biscuit sandwiches and the biscuits were almost melt in your mouth moist. I could have eaten just those without the eggs and bacon, though that was really good. My friends seemed to enjoy what they had, too. You certainly get your money's worth both in terms of the quality and quantity of the food. Service: based on the service alone, I was torn between giving this restaurant two or three stars. My party was originally 10 people and the person I initially spoke with when I made the reservation was extremely accommodating. I called back to amend that to 6-8 people. When five members of my party arrived, we were seated. A sixth showed up rather suddenly, but there was no seat for her. The hostess, Joy, was very visibly and verbally annoyed. She huffed her breath out, rolled her eyes, and gave a less than tactful spiel on how the extra person couldn't be accommodated since this was such a small restaurant  (as though I couldn't see this). I understand that she was placed in a precarious position, but there was a better and more professional/hospitable way to say this without adopting a passive aggressive tone and demeanor. It should also be noted that this was at about 3:00 p.m., and the restaurant was not as packed as it normally is; there were no lines at all. The second incident arose when we attempted to pay. The waiter came to collect our money and we had three credit cards. Apparently, the maximum per table is two. We asked if this rule could be waived since it was only one extra card and he literally said a terse no, tossed our money back on the table, and walked away. Again, the delivery of these answers and the attitudes with which they were accompanied were just uncalled for. When we finally figured out how to get down to two credit cards and wrote how much was to be charged to each card ($42 to one card and $22 to another, having specified which card got which charge), this was improperly done and there was a huge consultation as to whether the store would even correct this, which they didn't; rather, my party had to figure this out amongst ourselves. My friends and I tried to be as uncomplicated as possible. We weren't rude, we didn't unnecessarily linger, we split the check evenly, and we weren't demanding to our waiter. The treatment we received was unnecessarily rude. So, again, the food was delicious, but I'm not sure that's enough to make me want to return in light of the subpar treatment my friends and I received."

10/10/2015,2 star rating,Went for dinner . My friend got there at 5 but yet they didn't open the restaurant till closer to six even though on their website & on Yelp it states they open at 5 . Aside from that when we finally got in all the tables were taken due to reservation. Mind you the place is small. They should let people know reservation is recommended. The place is so small it should be first come first serve . The food was good but nothing specifically wowed me overall just ok ..
10/8/2015,4 star rating,"I constantly find myself looking for new restaurants in Harlem so when I stumbled across BLVD bistro I was ecstatic. The ambiance embraces true Harlem culture. The spot is quietly kept away in the bottom of a Brownstone and the decor features local Black art. Definitely nice for a date night or even to have a night out with friends.The service was amazing. Everyone is so warm and inviting and attentive to the customer. I have mixed reviews on the food. We had delicious biscuits to start with a not too sweet cinnamon butter. I also had a spiked sweet tea that tasted more like prosecco and sugar but was still pretty tasty. I ordered the herb roasted chicken for my entree which came with dirty rice and market veggies. The veggies were AMAZING but the chicken was dry and nothing about it tasted ""herb roasted"". I was so hungry but asked to send the meal back anyway. The waiter kindly obliged my request and removed it from the bill. My boyfriend had the cajun rub t-bone steak with a baked potato. The rub of the steak was different and had a flavorful  kick. I will give this place another try just because the people and atmosphere is so well received but the food isn't necessarily worth the second trip."
2/8/2019,4 star rating,"Excellent service, and delicious creative games on classical soul food fare. The ambiance is cozy and casual. The price point is good, and the portions are excellent. Our first time dining at BLVD, we enjoyed BLVD's Southern Dinner with chicken, and Jumbo Shrimp and Grits. Both delicious and perfectly prepared. The shrimp was fresh and tender, juicy. Just perfect. The grits were creamy and weren't overpowered by the shrimp. That dish took me to South Carolina in one bite, it was so good. The chicken in the BLVD's southern dinner was juicy and the the collards were tangy and flavorful. The potato salad was a bit saucier than i prefer, but it tasted reminiscent of my mom's potato salad, so it was still tasty. I have also ordered the shrimp and grits to go and they help up well when reheated. This restaurant is a gem! Minus one star because the door seems like a hazard. It wouldn't close, and it was a blistering cold winter day. The restaurant is so small, any tiny draft was felt throughout the restaurant. I hope that door gets fixed soon."
9/3/2017,5 star rating,"This was the most amazing brunch meal ever.  Best shrimp and grits.  Best biscuits.  We spent two weeks in Charleston last summer in search of the best soul food, but this is where it's at.  So good, you guys."
12/28/2014,3 star rating,"I have to say that overall the food was good.. We were a party of 4 and ordered two shrimp and grits, the steak and eggs and a crab benedict. The crab benedict didn't come with a biscuit and was rather small and served directly on the plate. The shrimp and grits received mixed reviews from over done to ok. And the steak and eggs was said to be good. We ordered bellinis which were good and finished the meal off with the apple cobbler which was nice.Regarding service, in the beginning it was ok but as we finished dessert and paid, we were asked to leave the table because another group could use it. As we were still in the mist of finishing up our drinks I was a bit thrown by the request. When we stated we weren't ready, there was a bit of resistance from the waiter but a few moments later a party of two in the booth behind us had left and we were able to stay for a few moments longer.But just as we were discussing our next move, the hostess comes over to say they have a party coming in in a few moments and another at 5. Hmm, it was 4:35, two tables to seat in one booth in 25 minutes, can we say ponzy.. Overall food was good 50/50 between our party of 4 but service could be a bit more pleasant.  I understand it is a small place but it's all in how you speak and communicate with your guests.. A good demeanor goes a long way to getting want you want. In these case, our table."

5/21/2015,5 star rating,"I went here for Dinner last night with a good friend.  I love the atmosphere here, perfect for a date or a girls night out. I ordered the Meatloaf and it was soooo good.  My friend had the Chicken, which was a little dry in my opinion but he loved it. We shared the apple cobbler which  is to die for.  Overall this place is a great restaurant, quiet cute and in harlem. I definitely recommend."
2/16/2019,3 star rating,My first time going there and will be my last.   I went with some friends and some of us ordered appetizers along with our meals.   Apparently biscuits are supposed to be given but was told they ran out.   We requested two orders of the fried okra but only one over was given because they ran out.  I ordered the catfish dinner which comes with collard greens  with smoked turkey and potato salad but they ran out of the potato salad.   I ordered the wedges instead which you only get four.   The catfish was fried well but very salty. They should've just put high blood pressure on the menu cause that's how salty it was.  One person ordered the seven cheese macaroni which was pretty decent.  The fried chicken looked really good and was fried well.   There's not a variety of drinks.  The bathroom doubles as a locker room.   Be careful coming and leaving the establishment as we saw a huge rat milling around the place.   I won't be going there ever again.   FYI:   The owner will get an attitude for posting a review on Yelp.
11/26/2014,5 star rating,"This review is about a biscuit.Ever know you're going to love a place before you go, then know you absolutely love it when you finally put down your fork? This has been my experience with BLVD Bisto.There are a lot of restaurants in Harlem that masquerade as soul food spots, or run on a legacy thereof. A few of them excel. Many of them leave a lot to be desired.Which brings me back to BLVD's biscuit. It's perfect. It's authentic. It's buttermilk. It's moist and perfectly salted. What it is not is the dry, sweet (or bland) brick sold elsewhere that is about as authentic as I am rich. (Not at all.)I went on a Tuesday night. I waited 10 minutes for one of their 10 indoor tables. It's small and intimate. Between me and love were mostly couples. I looked on jealously until I got a corner table.After the complimentary biscuit, I ordered the fried okra (piping hot, good, a little too salty) and the double cut pork chop (piping hot, juicy, enormous -- I told the chef-owner that I'd finish it eventually). For dessert, I ordered the apple cobbler, but I'm saving it for my Thanksgiving at work.Everyone in the restaurant who seemed to have something to do with it took an interest in my well-being and checked on me. The chef-owner, Carlos, struck up a conversation, and everybody watched the DWTS finale with a light-hearted side-debate over the authenticity of Alfonso Ribiero's hair texture (""S-curl or nah?"" was the question). Everyone was happy he won.I usually mention cleanliness up high, but I had more important points to make. It's clean. I'm eating here again. Biscuits, of course."
7/15/2016,5 star rating,"Had dinner with an old friend. She'd been here previously and thought it was pretty good. We had considered Sylvia's or Amy Ruth's. So glad we came here. Our server, Sabrina, was very engaging. From the biscuits served with butter infused with with cane syrup (yum), to the Blvd Spiked Tea (Delish!), the Shrimp & Grits, the Double Cut Pork Chops.......sheer Heaven to our tastebuds. Will DEFINITELY be returning the next time I'm in NY!"

6/27/2017,4 star rating,"So I finally got to experience BLVD bistro and I must say that they delivered. Upon entering the smell of soul food greats you which definitely gets your tastebuds ready to party. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday evening but nothing too crazy or overwhelming. We were seated within 10 mins of arriving and they honored our desire to be near an outlet so my son can charge his iPad. Deciding on what to order was quite the challenge since everything smelled and looked so good. We finally decided to start with fried okra, my son ordered chicken sliders and a side of baked beans as his entree, I ordered the fried chicken with pot salad and collard greens, my fiancé ordered the Mississippi cornmeal fried fish with succotash and we ordered the black eyed peas with andouille sausage as an additional side. We also ordered a few beverages which we later learned were sold out. Biscuits came out within 15 mins and were soft and fluffy to the touch. The honey butter was to die for! We had to stop ourselves at just one each to ensure that we had enough room for the rest of our meals. The fried okra was awesome. Crunchy and very well seasoned plus the Cajun ketchup had a nice kick to it. My son enjoyed his chicken sliders but decided it was best to eat it with a fork and knife since the biscuit was so light and fluffy, it could not withstand being picked up and eaten as a sandwich. The baked beans made me long to be at a BBQ with the harmonious blend of sweet and heat. The fried chicken and the fish entrees were amazing. I like to consider myself a potato salad and collard greens connoisseur and I must say the salad was on point. I'm not the biggest fan of vinegar based dolled greens but chef Carlos got the balance just right so it gets my approval. The cornmeal fried fish was cooked to perfection and held its crunchiness even under the succotash. I can say that we enjoyed the food very much minus the black eyed peas. It was a little too salty for my taste. However we will definitely be back to check out brunch very soon. I would have given them 5 stars but they were out of the beverages we ordered and I felt like for $9 I would want a little more than a tablespoon of sides. Either way this place was worth the trip to Harlem!"

2/3/2020,3 star rating,"BLVD has been on my list for a while, and some of my friends were in town this weekend, so it felt like a good time to try it out. Unfortunately, it didn't really live up to our expectations. The food was overall pretty good, we ordered the crabcakes Benedict, banana pancakes, and their kale salad. The pancakes were super fluffy with a crisp crust, and the topping was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The portion of crab in the Benedict was pretty small, but everything tasted good and the eggs were poached perfectly. We didn't really enjoy the kale salad - the dressing was overwhelmingly citrusy. Unfortunately, the main drag on our meal was that we were seated in their back room, and during our meal, there were dozens of flies swarming around the table and landing in our food. We tried several times to flag a waiter down to see if we could be moved, but being towards the back, no one really came to check up on us - I realize slow service is sometimes the deal when you're at a crowded restaurant, but it also meant that we weren't able to actually tell the waiter what was wrong until the end of our meal. The restaurant was super nice about it - once we told them, they offered to move us immediately, but we were basically done eating by that point so it didn't matter - and they ended up giving us a discount on our check as a result. I'd probably give them another try in the future, but I was definitely a little underwhelmed by this experience."
10/28/2014,5 star rating,"There are a lot of noobs reviewing this place so I had to make a visit with the hopes of exposing this place as a fraud.  Fortunately for BLVD Bistro and for me, this place is phenomenal.  My wife and I took part in their Prix-Fixe menu.  It's a choice of the Soup du Jour (Potato, Bacon, Cheddar) or the House Greens Salad for the first course.The second course is a choice between the Pan Fried Chicken, St. Louis Ribs, or the Grouper. I had the St. Louis Ribs, which were outstanding.  It was served with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and house-made coleslaw.  I've had St. Louis Ribs before, and this version stacks up handsomely against Dinosaur BBQ.  The portion was perfectly sized and included the sternum bone.  Most places don't include that portion, but it's not legit without the sternum.My wife had the Grouper.  It was served with sweet corn, okra, and tomatoes.  It was a perfect pairing and the grouper was cooked to perfection.  It was lightly breaded and not oily.  I wasn't sure if it was fried or baked because it tasted so light.For dessert, you have a choice between their German Chocolate Cake, or two scoops of fancy ice cream.  Unfortunately both ice cream flavors my wife wanted were sold out (cappuchino kahlua and bourbon pecan).  She wound up choosing the coconut almond bar ice flavor.  The German Chocolate Cake was outstanding.  Light and airy and was paired with a coconut frosting. I'm not big on cake, but German cake is a bit different from the norm.  It was served with a scoop of the coconut almond bar ice cream.Seating is limited in the restaurant.  I counted 11 tables.  But the decor is clean and rustic.  They make great use of the space.  The General Manager and the Executive Chef came to visit my wife and I at our table.  We felt like big shots.Aside from the prix-fixe items, my wife had a prosecco and I had a glass of their house pinot noir and a glass of pinotage.  The pinotage was magnificent.  At $13 a glass, it was well worth the price of admission.So dinner for 2 in Harlem cost us $90, but I left full with a slight buzz.  I was really impressed with this restaurant.  They really put out some quality food.  I hear that their brunches are the talk of the town.  My wife and I have already made a reservation.  Harlem has change..."

6/11/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious. best biscuits ever. Such balance in the food with noticeably higher-quality ingredients than many other Southern restaurants. Incredible fried chicken and pork chop (not over-cooked, which was great and hard to do with such a thick cut). Fun ambiance. Service still learning, but friendly and efficient. Nice beverages and some interesting wines."
7/20/2018,4 star rating,Great southern cooking with a flair - modest venue with outstanding service. No doubt the shrimp and grits a winner but the Double-cut pork chops is seasoned brilliantly and atop black-eye peas. Outstanding restaurant in the midst of a bunch of great restaurants.
1/27/2019,3 star rating,"Let me start this review by saying the food here is amazing which is why I gave this restaurant 3 stars and not lower my issues is the service and staff overall. Walking into the restaurant felt cozy and the music was lovely but shortly after our arrival we noticed one bus boy extremely aggressive and cursing just completely unhappy with his job. Our waiter was very forgetful and we found ourselves asking for things like Milk Cream and sugar several times once our food came no one came to check on us and the aggressive bus boy just got worst. At the end we requested the bill that took about 10 mins and to top it off the waiter charged the wrong bill to our cards which was a huge inconvenience because now we have to wait a few business days for charges to come off our cards that we didn't authorize. So with all this happening the bathroom light was not working so they have lanterns which doesn't do much if you want to use the mirror to touch up your make up, hair or even check your teeth. Overall experience wasn't pleasant at all and by the time we was leaving the hostess was just as aggravated about her job as the bus boy. This place serves good food can't take that away from the chef but the staff here is almost unbearable and hurting the brand we won't be returning any time soon hopefully they hire better help."
2/13/2018,5 star rating,"You will need a reservation or be ready to wait for at least 90 minutes. But, it is worth the wait. The food was tasty. It doesn't taste like every other place. The greens had a subtle sweet taste as opposed to a vinegar blast. The service was very nice. I was provided a cocktail as we awaited seating. We had the honor of being seated by Executive Chef Carlos.  He is very involved with the overall management. The prices are a tad high for the portions received but I attribute it to the overall service and ambiance. For Brunch, we started off with gospel and ended with house music. It rained he whole time and trust the rain did not kept the crowds away! Real New York Style! Totally recommend!"

Their cheese grits are worth every calorie, and their wait staff is always friendly and attentive. I've heard that they will be relocating to a bigger space. If that's true, then this will be my favorite brunch spot in Harlem. Would be even better if they start offering some brunch deals and/or bottomless mimosas ."

It was a mess-up that we realize half way through.  The bun was burnt as well.The fried chicken which was well made but nothing spectacular. The potato salad on the side was great, but I'm not a huge fan of potato salad.I really don't know what are the other options around, but I don't think I would come back"
7/18/2017,4 star rating,"Why haven't I eaten here sooner. Lazy, just plain old lazy. Boulevard is within walking distance of my home and I've been hearing not just good but great things about the food there. Once a month I have brunch with two of my friends from my old neighborhood. One of the ladies sister who lives in New Jersey had recently had brunch at Blvd.  and suggested we try it. I was a bit embarrassed because here it is my hood and I hadn't eaten there. We had a 3:00 reservation however we were not seated until 3:30, okay. Met some interesting people as I waited for my friends and table. At this point we are very hungry and thirsty. Our waiter seemed nice and competent. Our drinks came quickly. Try the iced tea with Presecco. Refreshing. We noticed folks who arrived after us had their meals. Hey what happen to our order? To add insult to injury I noticed our waiter standing at the bar eating. That  did it for me. I called Miss Thang over and asked where is our food. Her excuse was lame. Much to my surprise the owner exited the kitchen so I told him of our missing food. Before I could throw a hissy fit our food appeared. Was it worth the wait? HELL YEAH!!"
11/14/2015,3 star rating,After a wonderful and tasty dinner are Blvd Bistro.. The manager or hostess ( we don't know her title since she never introduced herself ) on duty comes over to the table and proceeds to question the tip amount that we left the server. Instead of giving a tip on a credit card we chose to give her cash. As a result the manager felt we did not give enough tip. Tipping is subjective and should never be questioned. There are places in the world were tipping is frowned upon. It's such a shame to end a perfectly good night in such a manner.

2/12/2015,3 star rating,"I really wanted to like this business and was so looking forward to it, but sadly the food was just not that outstanding. The place itself is in a great location with plenty of cozy booths and a very friendly staff. Definitely a neighborhood joint with lots of potential. After ordering a few of their beers to cheers to the weekend, (they don't serve liquor, btw!) we were served some complimentary biscuits with maple butter. The biscuits that came out were warm, soft and buttery - exactly how you'd want a biscuit to be. Unfortunately, there was a long brown hair on the inside of the napkin, but I ate my biscuit anyways. Next, we  ordered the kale caesar salad to start. My mistake. When it came out, the meager portion of wilted kale leaves were barely dressed with a mayo-like concoction and the amount of cheese on the plate left much to be desired. We were starving at this point, so my bf ate the salad anyways, resembling a dinosaur whilst doing so. There were clumps of dressing throughout the salad, but it was by no means tossed to coat all the leaves. The croutons also tasted like they came from a bag of pre-made ones at the grocery store.For our entrees, he ordered the double cut pork chop and I ordered the St. Louis Ribs with a side of smoked turkey collards, which were the highlight of the entire evening. The collards were cooked to tender perfection and perfectly seasoned.My meal, while delicious, wasn't anything that I couldn't have made myself. The ribs (4 pieces) were tender and slathered in BBQ sauce, with a side of whipped sweet potato and a small dollop of  tangy coleslaw. His double cut pork chop, while also delicious, was completely charred on the outside. As with most of the food we experienced there, it tasted good, but not amazing.Come here if you're looking for hearty home-quality cooking, but don't expect it to come cheaply. I noticed the owners / chefs walking around and talking to some of the regulars, so I can definitely see the neighborhood appeal of this place. For true restaurant quality food, next time I'll be heading to the West Village or Brooklyn."
1/14/2018,1 star rating,"0 Stars. I made a reservation for Saturday for 3 people. I arrived and was told that I could not be seated until my whole party arrives. I repeatedly asked the hostess why they had this policy but she would not answer. she was rude and seemed annoyed that I had asked such a question. 10 minutes after my reservation, she gave the table away as my party was not there. Within a few minutes my party arrived and we were told our reservation would not be honored as they do not hold reservations after 10 minutes. The rudeness and the comment ""i make the rules"" and the complete disrespect shown by the hostess was so bad, my friends and I were completely taken aback. What a terrible first and last impression. My advice? Lenox Ave has amazing restaurants, you never need to go to BLVD and be treated with such disdain. $30 overpriced pancakes are NOT worth being treated like a problem."
1/13/2018,1 star rating,"Was really looking forward to eating here, but the hostess was so awful, we decided to go to Harlem Shake instead. BLVD is missing the very basics of customer service. We had only one person missing from our party trying to park their car with the unexpected church crunch and the hostess, fully aware of this, still cancelled our reservation, rudely yelling at us that ""she makes the rules"". Would give zero stars if possible. With all the great restaurants nearby, BLVD needs to focus on customer service or will be out of business soon."

The owners and staff (Andre, Joy, DeAndre helped us) are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable and the food is excellent.  Our entrees included the Double Cut Pork Chop, Grouper, Shrimp and Grits, and Fried Chicken were all crowd pleasers - all our plates were cleaned.  The Kale Caesar and fried Okra apps were yummy (my only advice to BLVD would be to offer a larger portion of the fried Okra).  And of course the biscuits, which others have written about, are exceptional.  Cant wait for our next visit to BLVD!"

MY. MIND, the food was so good.  She'd had the grits, eggs & bacon two weeks before, and couldn't stop thinking about them since!!The new owner & chef hails from Natchez, Mississippi, and is FABULOUS! The food is scrumptious! Southern-inspired but never heavy or greasy, everything on the menu is to die for delicious.  Making home fries light and fluffy is no mean feat, but somehow Carlos' kitchen delivers! The table next to us had the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich, and raved, too.  I opted for the banana bread pudding for dessert, and my oh MY -- oh MY!!! DIVINE.It is a small space and could be better configured, especially the outdoor seating, which is communal and wedges you together like sardines, hence the one star deduction, but that's just me being persnickety.The staff is accommodating and adorable, too.  The new Blvd Bistro gets two thumbs up!"

The servers are down to earth and welcoming. I can't wait for summertime to dine in front of the townhouse. I ordered the Biscuit Sandwiches of soft scrambled eggs, aged cheddar, chicken apple sausage, served on delicious buttermilk biscuits. I was overwhelmed and I'd order it again and again and again.

Portion sizes could have been a bit larger. Service was good, it could have moved a little faster. All of the staff kept busy and assisted in running a very tight ship. We received a complimentary round of drinks to make up for the our food delay.I am concerned however about the bricks in the front area, I almost fell gong in.We had the pleasure of meeting the chef and his expected-wife, they are doing a great job serving up very good Soul Food.We saw the restaurant on TV, I am in no way disappointed with my experience. I gave them a 5 star but they're is some room for improvement, the small size of the restaurant and the music was way too loud...some tweaking!Great place to eat!"
