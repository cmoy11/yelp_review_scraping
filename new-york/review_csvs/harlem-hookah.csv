5/24/2022,4 star rating,"I only had hookah and drinks so I do not have any notes on the food.I came here for Kwanzaa Crawl and I had a wonderful time. The drinks from the price menu were pretty basic but they tasted good. The hookah was set up quickly and correctly. Overall, the restaurant was clean and the staff was working hard to make sure all of the patrons were taken care of. I will definitely be back."
4/12/2022,5 star rating,"Dope lil spot. The drinks were strong & the food was pretty good. The sliders are honestly bomb, so definitely recommend those. The hookah is great! You have to get the ice hose & the alcohol in the bottom for a top tier experience. It's a little pricey, but the music was good & so were the vibes. I'll definitely come back to support this Black Owned spot next time I'm in Harlem."
3/21/2022,1 star rating,"There were so many things wrong with my visit that I doubt you have enough time to read it. Long story short.Before even walking in was met with unprofessionalism, should of been my red flag. I spent a lot of money in this establishment and to be treated by everyone that works here as an inconvenience is wild! I will not find myself in here ever again. My advice support a business that will appreciate you as a patron."
8/24/2018,5 star rating,"I visit NY often, I live in Florida. My brother took me here for the first time in June. This place is awesome. The music, wings and Henny Punch! Oh! And not to mention the Hookah of course! I returned to NY in August and didn't know where to go it was pretty late like 2am by the time I decided to go out I wasn't far from here so I stopped by. I didn't get there in time to get the wings actually was only 8 mins after kitchen closed so I enjoyed a nice margarita and the music of course. Next time I will be sure to get there on time for wings! Great place and atmosphere."
3/4/2022,5 star rating,"We had a nice time here. Food was filling but just ok. Hookah  was good on service, flavors were abundant but couldnt taste it that much.Bathroom was nice, had 2.Vibe was great, seating was nice.Servers were so nice and workers are friendly.I felt welcomed.10/10"
6/12/2022,3 star rating,"I enjoyed Harlem Hookah and the vibe. I would suggest just to go for drinks. The sangria was nasty in my opinion, so I wouldn't get that again. I would return for a stop after dinner or brunch."
4/10/2022,3 star rating,"I've been in the past pre-Covid and I can say the environment now is definitely different. Luckily my group of 3 made reservations earlier and were seated pretty quickly but there were several groups waiting outside hoping to get a seat when available. The music is pretty decent but it doesn't make up for the lackluster service. We waited awhile before anyone came to our table so we could place our drink and food order. The server did make a suggestion for the hookah which we opted for. There wasn't too much of a wait after ordering before getting our food, not anything spectacular but it was decent enough. The table next to us ended up leaving due to issues with their hookah and not having it addressed properly and I don't blame them. Ehhh not sure if I'll find myself back here again anytime soon."
4/9/2022,1 star rating,"....here we go. So my bestfriend and I were in town for a weekend trip and we wanted to checkout Harlem Hookah so we decided to go. When we arrived we had to stand outside in ""a line"" no one was out there but us waiting but okay. So we waited outside for about 40/45 mins (which yes in hindsight should've been a  flag but we really wanted to try it out). After being given a small table and told we have a strict 90min limit we decided to make the most of it and order the triple H drink and a hookah. So the drink was fine--my friend thought it tasted like juice. Which I agree it wasn't strong and wasn't worth $17 but I digress.Let's get to the hookah--the specialty of the venue. We received our hookah and the end of the hose was broken. I asked our server about it in hopes of getting a replacement one that was in better shape and not broken. To no avail. I was told ""oh they all look like that""Well okay then. They're charging top tier prices for subpar hookahs with raggedy equipment. Then when our hookah wasn't pulling properly we realized the spring around the hose was broke so they replaced the hose with another one (also had a broken end) (see pics below). On topppppp of that, they charged us $10 extra--so $55 at this point because we wanted blueberry, watermelon, mint. The hookah guy was very nice and tried to fix it but at this point we were at the end of the road.Long story short we decided to get the check and pay for our drinks and go on our way. Our Mariyah-Lynn look alike server tried to force us to pay for the hookah saying we had it for a long time. when in reality it wasn't working because Of their faulty equipment. After some back and forth the manager agreed to remove it. Save your money and time and go elsewhere.Not worth the wait and inside is tiny. Front security was really nice though. But never again.Also looked at their health code violations on here and eek. Glad I didn't order food."
12/25/2021,5 star rating,"My friend and I headed here after eating at Ricardo's on Xmas Eve. HH happened to be the closest hookah bar and we trekked about thirty mins to this spot. We were seated quickly and handed a drink/hookah menu. We got the bubblegum which was good but eventually the owner and his friend came over and changed our hookah to a blueberry mint blend I think and it was amazing. The music and vibes are great at the place, the employees were also very cool as well. I will def be visiting this spot if I'm in the area."
10/10/2021,3 star rating,"The music will have you bumpin' just enough to look passed the unwelcoming and a bit harsh customer service of the staff! Their menu is limited so if you're looking for brunch or an actual meal, this may not be the spot for you. The food/appetizers were not as good as I had hoped to be honest. My friends had the shrimp tacos because they don't eat meat and that was the only real option for them. They didn't like it at all and mentioned that it was very bland. They ended up not even finishing it. However, I will say that the French fries were pretty good. Hot and fresh, just how I like it! I'd definitely recommend getting the hookah with the ice hose. The regular one wasnt as good."
6/27/2021,1 star rating,This place is insane it's Sunday and after waiting in line for about 40 minutes while I watched a 4 top a 2 top and a 3 top available!! We finally got seated only for the server to walk past us 3 times . I'm currently here and we've been sitting for about 12 minutes she has not taken our order or brought us any water . Shes taken so long that I was able to go to the deli and grab a bottle of water ( check photo ) before our water finally came to the table . This is horrible! I am a general manager at a restaurant and I don't know wtf is going on here but you need to hire new employees ASAP I don't think you guys understand the concept of turning tables over or guest service . As I finish this I'm still waiting for a server to find the time to take my order
10/28/2021,1 star rating,"This place is horrible. I'm not even going to waste time writing another review. I'll just post the screenshots from the review I previously wrote and the disgusting response I got from the general manager who I see was a little calmer in here with her response. Save your time and your money on their wack reservation policy and just go to Ricardos Steakhouse in Harlem. I believe they have hookah. But if not ,The food is great and their customer service is an example of how Harlem Hookah should operate."
5/2/2022,1 star rating,I recently went on Saturday before the busy rush. Our waitress took our order and never came back to table. We had to ask Hookah to get her to order more food. I wasn't given napkins with my food. Also had to ask.  Food was ordered as well as 2 Hookahs . After 2hours we're up we were told to be ready to leave as they had people waiting. We asked for manager and ... low and be hood our Waite was the manager. We were told because it was so busy is there reason for lack of service. That's never an excuse. An apology ... not needed but some kinda of compensation should have been made. I told 2 other friends about experience and they said it's alway like that . They really don't care when it's busy they do the bare minimum
3/26/2022,1 star rating,"I came to this establishment in the middle of the early evening on 3/26/2022 for a party of 15  which was empty by the way the staff was completely overwhelmed and decided not to serve us before this occurred a party next to us was so gracious to move to a more private setting and we decided to pay their tab as a sign of gratitude and send a round of drinks at this time we were ask to leave without ordering anything and paying a total of $200 for another table so the establishment wouldn't lose money as it was N the empty side nevertheless I personally have frequent this place and never have received such service the only two people that seemed to care about the business and not losing profit was the young gentleman with the dreads and the security officer everyone else SMH , we also tipped the waitress that didn't want to accommodate us"
12/23/2021,5 star rating,came here for happy hour every wednesday and thursday 6-12am the atmosphere is so much better super chill and no ones here so definitely come if you just want to smoke hookah alone or with a friend is warm and quiet rather than the loud crazy atmosphere during the summer or weekends you will find either no one or 1 or 2 people besides hookah is $35 rather than $65 and up.
6/26/2021,4 star rating,"When I found out that I this lounge was black owned, I was excited to patronize it. Overall it was lit vibe, good music and a cute atmosphere. Cons: We didn't have a reservation so we had to wait like 45 minutes to be seated, we were a party of 5. Once we were seated around midnight, they only had select food options available, crab cakes, sliders and fries. All food options were okay but the sauce that came with the crab cakes was good.Pros: Hookah was nice and strong, we had mango mint. The drinks?? The henny punch tasted like straight alcohol so we loved it lol. Sophia our server was so sweet and even though it was packed in there she was attentive to our table.Overall, this is a great spot for hookah, drinks and good vibes. Would definitely come again"
2/21/2022,5 star rating,Best hookah spot... the food is amazing right along with the hookah.. i don't drink so i can't tell you about the drinks but over all a beautiful calm spot
1/8/2022,5 star rating,"Came here for the first time on Thursday January 6, 2022. It was a nice mature crowd, music was mellow where you could hear it and still have a conversation. The staff were very attentive and polite. Constantly checking on you. The food was decent, had to send wings back to be cooked well done but when it Came back, it was delicious. Spinach artichoke dip was tasty but tortillas were a bit salty. Chicken quesadilla were good. Drinks were just right, not too strong. I had one rum punch and one henny punch and I felt nice but not drunk/intoxicated. No hangovers the next day. The hookah was strong and it lasted a long time. Hookah was refilled once totaling $35. For 3 people with 2 orders of Buffalo wings, 2 orders of spinach artichoke dip, one order of chicken quesadilla, 3 drinks, the total bill was $145 plus $35 for hookah. COVID cards and Id are checked at the door18% gratuity includedI will return soon!!!!!"
8/28/2021,1 star rating,"Made a reservation that my sister PAID for and they gave up my sisters table because we were 10mins late and they have a 15min grace period. Then the owner was not letting us come in. Like common it's my sisters birthday. Not only did she cry but then he got  ""his"" people's inside who took OUR table and refused to speak to us cause he was too busy smoking hookah with them. Listen, just know that if you reserve a table they might just give it up. After almost an hour we get a table. The owner also gave us stank faces. And the owner is busy in her getting high off the hookah with his customers wattttccchhh outtttt! They unprofessional af in there. Not to mention they took forever to give us a waitress. Not the mention they also couldn't give us a refund for the reservation we paid for if we decided to leave before them taking forever to seat us."
12/13/2021,5 star rating,"I love coming to Harlem hookah, it's like family away from home. My girls Justiana and Sophia be holding it down, my fave bartenders Kelvin and Q always makes the best drinks. Couldn't think of a more welcoming place in my fave borough ."
9/12/2021,4 star rating,"Definitely overpriced hookah, but if you're looking for a place in Harlem with good music, cocktails, and aesthetic, go for it. The wings are lit"
12/3/2021,5 star rating,Q is always the best bartender. He is extremely attentive and diligent. Holds great conversation with each customer while making each customer in the establishment feel as they are the only person around. He is extremely professional and gives great drink recommendations every time.
2/24/2022,5 star rating,Food was amazing drinks were great hookah was fire! The owner so happened to be there while we were there and he was such a pleasure. Very personable very humble. Loved the company. 10/10 would recommend
6/18/2021,1 star rating,"I am really disappointed. I have been wanting to come check this place out only to receive the most disrespectful attitude. I was told that I had to wait to come inside, fine. However, I observed a young man who identified as the owner's brother allowing a party enter and essentially skip the line. I spoke to him and let him know I was next, and he stated to me that he could do whatever he wanted because he was the owner's brother. I am surprised that during these hard times, a business would turn away paying customers."
11/12/2021,1 star rating,"I wish i can give this place a half of star. This place is very unprofessional. They have a bunch of notices on their website about you not receiving a refund for reservation cancellation but nothing on their website about bottle availability and they call you the day of your reservation to confirm if they can provide what was in your reservation notes. I had to cancel my birthday party after spending large amounts of money on set up for them to tell me ""oh i dont know why it says 2-4 reservation "" mean while everybody of my party of ten was supposed to buy bottles how in hell are you gonna finish a bottles of liquor in 2 hours? But never mind that because the host told me they dont even have the bottles on their list in the establishment I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HORRIBLE PLACE AND I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND FOR MY RESERVATION DEPOSIT EVEN AFTER I WAS INCONVENIEN!!!!!!!!"
7/22/2020,4 star rating,Food was ok. Hookah was good but my drink was the best! The staff was super friendly and the outdoor dining was convenient and social distanced. I would be back for more drinks
11/7/2020,4 star rating,"Expensive but worth it, the hookah is of very good quality and the drinks are strong and delicious. The food isn't anything special.  There is always a really long wait on weekends as it's a popular place, so I'd check them out earlier in the evening or during the week"
11/22/2020,3 star rating,"Let's start with thanks for accommodating a table of 8 during a pandemic. The waiter was great and made sure we had what was needed. Ordering food... You will get catfished, the picture of the shrimp and grits on the menu is not what you are about to receive, I was absolutely disappointed to the fullest. My group ordered eggs with their entrees but the eggs never came out and by the time we got a hold of the waiter they had already finished eating. If your short staffed admit it, it's a pandemic and we would of understood that better then given us the it will be out in 5 minutes. Drinks are good. Hookah was good."
6/10/2021,5 star rating,Yes Karla and Carissa  was  very nice  I enjoy my drinks and food and the Service and the hookah was on point
12/4/2021,5 star rating,"Kalvin made this the best experience I could have ever imagined. He anticipated all of our needs and was so kind and respectful. Anytime he passed by our table, he made sure to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He is a very valuable employee to this establishment and i spores I ate his attentiveness and kindness X 100. You could NEVER lose him! Kalvin, thank you so much for everything! You are appreciated! And management is great helping out staff especially on a busy Friday night!"
8/10/2021,5 star rating,"Great spot. Hookah is great they have a wide variety of flavors to choose from for about the same price as other spots that only have mint or blueberry mint. I wasnt going to order any food at first but my server, i believe her name was Justina suggested i try the Sticky wings and they were BOMB. Justina gave us great customer service she was very nice and although seemed very busy she made sure to check on us. It was my husband's birthday, Justina also suggested that we order the Birthday Hookah, although i wasnt a fan of the liquor base, my husband loved it!!! The Hostess Demi was also very sweet and hospitable. Overall great experience. Only thing i would suggest you make a reservation because we waited over an hour to get in on a saturday night. I'll be back next time with a reservation."
8/10/2021,5 star rating,"The literal best place ever. Food is amazing, hookah is the best in the city, drinks are out of this world, and music is ALWAYS on point. But the best thing about Harlem Hookah is the customer service. Carla the bartender is the sweetest, most personable person ever. She treated every customer as if they were the only ones in the room; paying extra close attention to their orders ( even sending food back that wasn't up to standard before customers even saw it). That level of detail and customer- facing understanding doesn't go unnoticed. Even security for the place is amazing and respectful. This is my new favorite spot in the city!!"
5/16/2021,2 star rating,"First time I went there was in 2019 & they let me in, the hookah was okay. Mind you, this was back when I was living in North Carolina. I've been back multiple times since & the bouncers wouldn't let me in, always came up with an excuse saying that it'll be at least an hour wait just because I'm by myself & they did the same thing to me last night. I know it's a business but at that point I ended up drivin' to Babylon Hookah Lounge."
1/7/2022,2 star rating,"The service was not up to par. The waitress provided the food , hookah and drinks and did not check in until We had to wave her down. She was friendly and honest But did not tend to our table as she should have. unfortunatly, the guac comes from the store and s not fresh. honestly, it should have been 5 bucks and not 12. They don't serve tea but I guess that may be expected. I wanted a hot toddy because it was cold but they couldn't make it. They don't have food that addresses Veggie or vegan focused patrons. There Is hummus as an app, but.no other food."
8/16/2020,1 star rating,"If you don't know the staff personally, don't bother going! We waited 40 minutes,  and when a table cleared, they called us up. As we were waiting to sit, a friend of one of the staff members, (the really thin guy with the green hair), walked up to him and i heard the staff member say, ""if you can get 2 more people, u can have this table"" and he pointed to the table that we were waiting on. He told the staff, ""i can see if such and such can pull up"". Once he said that, he told him to sit down. Then had the nerve to tell us we had to wait again for another table! At this time I was so frustrated we just left. Straight up and down B.S.! It's a damn shame they have inconsiderate staff, because now I will NEVER try to go there again, and I will ENSURE to let EVERYONE I KNOW, TO STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM HARLEM HOOKAH!IN RESPONSE TO YOUR RESPONSE:I will say it again. After waiting 40 minutes, and being told we can sit st the 4 seater, all of a sudden a friend of your employee walks up, ALONE, and said ""I can makes some calls to get 3 people"", and was able to take the table we waited 40 minutes  for! He just walked up. Did not have a party of 3. But yet was able to sit at a 4 seater table top. What part of that is 1st come 1st serve? What part of that is ""seating ""accordingly""? NONE OF IT! Train your staff on professionalism, or make it clear that friends of staff come first!"
8/9/2020,5 star rating,"I came for hookah and had an unexpected wonderful time with my girlfriend. This location does a great job at staying clean (you have to wash your hands/sanitize before being seated). The entire staff was so nice, we preferred sitting at a different table and they accommodated us as soon as they could. We had the frozen margaritas which were pretty good. The hookah was great (they use coconut coals and come around changing coals & checking on it), we had the peach and mint with ice hose. We got the sticky wings - SO GOOD! The waitress gave me so many options to fit what i like. Music was good, overall super chill vibe. Some little facts: there was a long wait for other groups starting around 4pm as they don't have too many tables outside, but we came around 3pm on a Sunday and were seated right away. There's a 2hr seating limit. They don't take reservations at the moment. Gratuity is factored in with the check. Everyone leaving negative reviews based off of wait time ... it's COVID ‍ they're doing what they can with limited space. 100% coming back!"
7/22/2020,1 star rating,"In response to Renee****STILL 1star!!! It only takes a restaurant to mess up once and they will stop getting my money. The host didn't accommodate us by moving us to the bar. In reality there was no other choice but to move us and the surrounding tables because that's profits to be made with each person that walks into the door.  You can't accommodate a person with a new seat after seeing a roach in the previous seats. You also stated we ""we ate our food"" when we did not eat there. My one friend sent the Mac and cheese back to the kitchen. You also stated we tried to come back and was dented entry. You must have us confused with someone else because we never returned or attempted to return after leaving. We went up the block to cove lounge and got food and drinks. There was no reason for us to return.  It amazes me how you try to shift the narrative as if you were there and had some insight on what was happening. Which you didn't because no one personal came out the back to talk about the pest problem but a manger made time to tell a customer he couldn't come back because of something he did prior. Conversation like that should be discussed in private and away from other paying customers. As I stated in the first post I will not be coming back nor will my friends and I'll be sure to share my experience. Have a blessed"

11/16/2019,1 star rating,"November 9, 2019 my 2friends and I visited Harlem Hookah. This was my 3rd time here and I didn't expect to receive horrible service because the other times were good minus the lack of staffing. Let's start out with Initial seats. We were sat at the 3rd table which was too close to the door for me. I asked to be moved and was told there was no seats to be moved to. They only had seats for 2 people but there was 3 people in my party and then the host walked away. We asked the waiter whom said she would ask the host. I did some investigation my self and noticed seats were reserved for a big party which would have been understandable had we been given that response. I took a look and saw tables for 2 that had previously sat 3 people and people walked  and filled the other tables. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the host said she had a corner table that was meant for 2 but she could sit us there if we didn't mind. We were fine with that so we moved to a corner booth. We started having a good time, talking and taking pictures. We all settled down and then I saw a roach.. yess I said it. There was an adult size roach crawling on the couch. I told my friend to move because it was crawling turds her.The 2 tables near us heard our commotion and started flashing their backlight on the coach and now 7people saw the roach. The host come by the table and asked us what happened because we were standing up and we all told her about the pest problem. She asked where and my friend showed her behind the coach where the roach was relaxing. The host then went and got a guy from the back who just asked us where the roach was. He may have been there to kill it or see it. But with 7customers looking to move tables he become distracted with changing everyone seat so the roach was never found. After being moved to the bar our waiter told the bartender the drinks we had been waiting and she closed out our bill at the table. When she did that I assume those drinks would have been free being that she closed out our bill and the orders were already put in. It was fairly busy and there was only ONE bartender in the restaurant so I can see how he forgot. So me and my other friends now had to reorder our drinks and wait even longer. When I went reordered the fishbowl I initially was waiting for before we had to switch tables I was told they ran out of fish bowls. I hardly seen anyone with a fish bowl so that meant they either never ordered enough to supply a high demand or they really had fishbowls and didn't want to sell that because you make make profits with single drinks. The bartender asked if I wanted anything else to drink but I didn't want to order anything else. Getting 1 fish bowl would have been better than getting 2-3drinks. (I learned this from the last time) I'm literally annoyed because I'm sitting in an establishment with no drinks, I don't want to eat from there no more, the last fish bowl was given to a table that ordered after me but since we had to move it was like I never ordered it, and we were sitting in front of the door so every time the door open the cold air would hit me so I ended up putting my jacket on.So now that I'm irritated about the whole experience and am ready to leave but my friend had ordered food. So now I'm just cracking jokes about the roach because I'm mad. The staff just cleaned the table and sat more people in that seat. The Food was taking long to come because the kitchen was backed up so we decide it's time to go. We got the bill so we could leave and not one drink was Compensated after encountering the pest problem. (I say problem because roaches are asexual. So they can reproduce on their own. And it was an adult roach) The Bill came and every drinks is on there so my friend tell the man to take off one drink because it's was free after the whole roach incident. Everything else was paid in full. After we get the bill fixed and everything squared away the Mac and cheese finally came out of the kitchen but by then it was too late. My friend already told the bartender to cancel the food and we were on our way out.I will not be going back nor will I refer this place.. I can't do the bad customer service. At first I started waiting to talk to the manger but we were hungry and I needed a drink . I, the customer shouldn't have to reach out to the manger/ assistant manger/supervisor/ or lead about a situation we could not control or fix. I shouldn't have to tell them to give some type of an apology or even a half assed apology because the staff acted like nothing happened which makes me think this is a regular occurrence. I'm completely over Harlem hookah. It's a hit or miss with this place. First time I went it was good vibes, good food and music , 2nd time I went there was one waiter, one bartender but still good vibes and music, 3rd time here and it was a complete fail."
8/20/2020,1 star rating,"I am utterly discontent with the service Harlem Hookah provided me, or lack there of. I ordered two desserts from the establishment one late night & upon my arrival, to my surprise, the order tickets had not been received and the desserts were not ready. I inquired about how long it'd take to prepare the order, but the chef decided he actually didn't feel inclined to making the desserts due to it being close to closing. I then pressure the establishment to either make the desserts or refund my money. After a 10 minute back and forth - I finally receive a brownie with the sundae omitted and no funnel cake fries. I am highly disappointed."
12/8/2018,4 star rating,"This place is nestled in Harlem and is quaint and cute. It's a good size spot with not tons of seating. The bouncer was telling us there max capacity is 72 with no standing. As such you have to wait outside...despite the inside not being terribly full - remove half a star for this. However it was only two of us so we entered quickly. The hostess was sweet and offered to move us as soon as a back table opened up as we were seated next to door. I got a Moscow mule first - gin, fresh lime and ginger beer. However I did not like it - tasted of older like and couldn't taste the ginger. Informed the server i didn't like the drink and he switched it for me to the Lenox cocktail which was good - gin, orange juice, grapefruit juice, lime juice, and salt. This was good. The hookah we got was grapefruit mint. It pulled nicely and wasn't burnt tasting. Our coals were never changed but we were only there about an hour to an hour and 15 min. But I also didn't see anyone's coals being changed - which could be a potential problem. Also removed half a star because service for our drinks was slowwwww. I mean I waited a good 15 min for my replacement drink after ordering and it took about 10 for the server to take my order for it after removing my first drink. Overall a nice small spot for hookah and drinks in Harlem.  Btw pricing Cocktails range from $12-14Hookah basic was $25 and 30-45 for exotic and liquor flavors We had no food."
8/8/2020,1 star rating,"If I could give them no star i would !My last week In New York ,my family wanted to spend time with me. We decided Harlem Hookah would be a great option . Due to the fact  the owners family was here my table of 7 was told we just have to wait (3hrs)  . Every other party had a 2 hour wait . If I knew this we would have left when we came . Customer service !!!! I think  a lot of business owners in NY miss that message ."
4/19/2018,4 star rating,"So this was a must try on my list......I love the ""bar"" life and hookah.......for it to be a weekday the crowd and ambience was pretty nice......my friend made reservations for 8........when we arrived we were ID at the door before being allowed in.....they only accept official state ID ......for New Yorkers with the city ID will be denied entrance......it is some what small inside but very nice decor.....when I arrived the rest of my party had not arrived so I could not be seated......the majority of my party arrived 10 min.  Later and we were still missing one.....so we had to wait.....leave it to my friend to be super late and we lost our reservation.....the hostesses was real cool and told us not to worry.....she would accomadate us.....Once all my party arrived we were seated and immediately attened to....we ordered the lemon ice mixed with blue mist pinapple head hookah.....and rounds of drinks.......they have a full bar and the drinks were pure and strong.....the hookah smoked well and was real nice and smooth.......it did not burn extreamly fast so we did not require more than one refill the entire night....We also ordered food......the Mac Attack....  Spanish and artichoke dip.......Southwest eggrolls....and wings....(double order of all) all the food was on point....and while many rave about the mac and cheese I took a liking to the eggrolls....portion size was ok.......standard appetizer.......between smoking....eating.....and the litt music the time went by fast....So all in all of course I would recommend you going HOWEVER be prepared......this place is NOT CHEAP.........between drinks .....food ....and hookah for 4 ladies we spent $538.......but I am not mad about it or complaing because I  enjoyed myself......and like with many things in NYC......you pay for the experiance more than the food and drinks......and we are 4 ladies who can throw a few back and only drink  premium liquor......"
8/7/2021,4 star rating,"I revisited this spot again for the 3rd time. It's a hot spot in Harlem because it is one of the few for OUR ppl. The music and vibes is right for people of colors even though all are welcome. My hostess Demi was everything.. she should be promoted because in Harlem with that customer service skills .. it is unseen. I am a native New York but not of Harlem and I drive because she has made the experience that more enjoyable. I invited about 8 ppl from out state to this spot and they loved it. They said they have never experience something like this in their state ranging from Seattle to Jacksonville FL. She was super accommodating. Then she introduced us to Justina who put the icing on the cake with impeccable first class love. She brought out the food timely and continued to check on us. It was a Saturday and truly wasn't expecting that. The bouncers were different then the last time I came too. They did a complete change of staff since I came a few year ago and I couldn't be happier. I am a black woman who live to see black business thrive and do well because there is competition out there and we have to remain A1.  I would highly recommend. Come early to get a good seat. Prices are good, food good and drinks are good. Thank you Harlem Hookah for a good change."
11/23/2017,2 star rating,"Since opening the service in this spot has now gone down. I mean from entering, to sitting down, the workers are not warm or welcoming. We came in to the spot being told that they can only hold three ppl because they do not want it to be over crowded (understandable) then when two ppl left we were allowed to have our party of 5 enter but was told there are only 3 seats at the bar and 2 can stand. Ok whatever we went with it. We enter and order food at the bar and then a table opened up and we took it. Shortly after we were approached to say we needed to pay for food and drinks we never received since we moved from the bar. Left confused because we are being told to pay for something three times but our response was of course we going to pay but Janay(one we weren't told that policy when we said we are going to take that table and 2 we will pay as soon as we receive our food) Janay proceed to roll her eyes and went and got the food. She plopped the food down in front of us and put the bill down again. That type of service behooves me because I have been to Harlem Hookah a few times and appalled at the shift in service.  Shawna came over and changed our experience. She apologized for their behavior and continued to serve us. The workers need to be trained on how to speak and handle customers. There is a level of professionalism that should be maintained at all times. My party of 5 will definitely think twice before we come back. There are too many spots throughout the city that provide the same service to deal with this one. PleAse train your servers, hostess and busboy. Thank you! Food was good, warm! Drinks was good! Service was bad! Hospitality was horrible! Service and Hospitality is key to the success of a business especially in New York!"
5/6/2017,4 star rating,"Harlem Hookah is a great afterwork or weekend vibe. It has great music, awesome crowd. Every time I enter HH, it makes my heart sing to see black working class young ppl coming together to enjoy an evening out. The drinks are strong but I like It that way. The food taste delicious, I just wish it was warmer. The few times I have supported this business, the food was lukewarm. The servers are always welcoming and providing good service. The servers are always accommodating to make sure every experience is A1.  How can I forget the hookah.... The hookahs are good as well. I wouldn't recommend spending money on the extra pineapple addition or liquor flavor hookah because it doesn't make a big difference for the money. The basic hookah will do the job. All in all, this place is a little gem in Harlem. It's great for afterwork, girls night out, fellas night out, a quick date and more. I will definitely return."
3/11/2020,2 star rating,"Updated review. Dropped it another star because this person decided to leave a snarky message in my inbox about using frozen fries, yet charging an outrageous price. It's one thing to have overpriced items for frozen food, but it's another when you provide bad costumer service on top of that."
3/5/2020,3 star rating,"Ordered the sliders and fries. It was decent, but overpriced. Especially the fries. It think they use frozen fries.They taste like the exact same type I can get from cheaper fast food places. I tried ordering one of their desserts on more than one occasion, but they're never available."
3/4/2020,4 star rating,I would love to go on Caribbean night to see the vibes. I would go back for food and drinks. I don't do hookah so I can't tell you about hookah but the smoke wasn't over whelming at the time.
5/21/2018,4 star rating,"After sadly missing dinner with my friends, a couple of us came here to chill and hang out for a bit. As soon as we got there, the bouncer let us know that they were at capacity and wouldn't be letting anyone else inside. We were so annoyed, but started looking for another place nearby. As soon as we found someplace and started to walk away, the bouncer called over to us and let us know that some people just left and that they had 3 seats available at the bar! Look at God!I was a bit annoyed when we walked in because I didn't see why we were stopped from coming earlier. The place was not full at all, but I suppose they don't want people standing around and will only allow people in if they can be seated. Antyways, once seated, we immediately ordered our hookah and some dranks... and since I missed dinner, I got some wings and fries. The food came out so quickly I almost sent it back in fear it wasn't cooked enough, but it passed the taste test! Or maybe I was too hungry to tell the difference haha. The buffalo wings were good and the fries were nice and crispy. I had the Triple H drink, which was Henny, Henny, and some other stuff. Also, you guys, the hookah was ELITE! Nice and smooth, great flavor (we got mint and mango) and they change the coal frequently. Shoutout to the real MVP, our bartender Shelby! She was so cool and down to earth and makes amazing drinks!"
5/25/2021,1 star rating,"This was probably one of the worst experiences in a venue EVER!!! I wanted to make reservations for a group of 8 but due to the pandemic wasn't sure I could do so and wanted to speak to someone. I called everyday for a week without answer. I also sent in an email request from their website. Never received a response. I ended up reserving two separate huts To make sure we could accommodate our entire group. Now I read all the information that was available to me on their site and in my confirmation email so I understood the 15 minute grace period policy. We were 5 min over that and they still manage to give both huts away that I paid deposits for, very much a hassle since we couldn't call to speak with anyone. We spoke to the bouncer who was the only help in the situation and he explained they gave the huts up and that we would have to wait on line for a table. Now, had I known that was an option in the first place I would NOT have reserved the huts, but again NO ONE was answering the phones or email to provide this information. As were in line with one group in front of us the bouncer comes over and explains that seating will end in about 45 minutes and not everyone will get in. He ends up telling one of my friends that it may only be the group in front of us that gets in. Thankfully after speaking to him again about the situation he was able to squeeze us in. After we sit at our table we find the chairs are quite small for any normal size adult and the bench seating is extremely hard and uncomfortable. Then came time to order, they were out of most hookah flavors, by the end of the night I heard one of the servers say they were out of coal. They had no lemons or limes for drinks, and they were out of a lot of liquor; worst of all out of Hennessy which is like a crowd pleaser. It seemed like every time we asked for something they were out. All in all this was a terrible experience (for my birthday btw).This is in Reponse to Renee,If you bothered to read MY REVIEW, you would notice that one not only was I aware of the 15 min policy, I also acknowledged it. The problem is not only about being busy but I called SEVERAL TIMES for a week AND SENT AN EMAIL. None of which was responded too. I'm also a small business owner as well as a claims manager for a online furniture company so I'm well equipped to try and review all information provided to me. Also those chairs you refer to as being normal size are actually sold by the company I work for and I can guarantee you anyone with even a hint of a behind will have trouble sitting on them. I also know this for a fact because I had four of them in my home. My suggestion is that you actually READ your customers complaints and understand them and assist them in the best way you can. I literally NEVER EVER leave bad reviews and this would be my first but the utter disrespect and lack of customer service is appalling. PS when we arrived all the huts were full and the bouncer said they pulled the next person off the line to fill it."
11/23/2019,1 star rating,"I consider myself a regular at HarlemHookah. Often bringing visitors here to have a good time and yesterday i had such a terrible experience. My friends and I ordered multiple drinks food and hookah and as we attempted to get more food and drinks we were told  ""y'all have to leave your time is up"" never in my life have i been forced to leave an establishment. I could totally understand if we sat there ordered one drink and bought nothing else-- okay fine i get that business is business. But we ordered multiple rounds food and attempted to order more when we were completely dismissed. To make matters worse there was 1 person in line outside. The rude waiter didn't thank us for our business and simply dropped a check off and collected our glasses. Sad to say i won't be bringing my business here anymore."
10/12/2019,1 star rating,"Horrible customer service, understaffed on a Saturday afternoon and claimed that ""were not usually this busy at this time"". Upon entering we were never properly attended to nor greeted. I had to walk to the bar and get the bartender's attention to get seated. How is that an excuse to be short staffed and have poor customer service?!!? Took about 25 min to get water for the table. The entire stay with the group of 10 was about 90 min and in that time I never received my food order. i ended up telling the waiter to cancel and I was so hungry I stepped out to the local deli to grab something. Although all of these concerns were expressed to staff the bill was not being compensated for and then after some back and forth was adjusted with a discount which still doesn't make up for the horrible service I received in this establishment for my first time. I've always heard such great things and this was the last thing I was expecting. The place was packed and just didn't add up to me how they were staffed to fully operate. Truly disappointed and I won't be returning here anytime soon."
6/30/2021,5 star rating,This is really one of the Best Hookah Lounges I have ever been to. Everyone was really nice from the security josh to the bartenders. Especially our Waitress/Hostess Sophia. I literally watched her take care of the whole room at the same time making me and my guest feel special. I will definitely be having my birthday party here!!!!
1/13/2020,1 star rating,"I visited this establishment on 1-12-20 at 7:45pm. When my party and I were seated the hostess didn't  tell us it was still brunch so when the waitress finally came to services us she told us that we had 15 min for the unlimited mimosa okay that wasn't a problem with us but instead of putting our order in Bersalles  decided to take two other tables orders, so now when we got the first drinks it was 7:55pm. She came back really not trying giving a F@#& and we also ordered Chicken and Waffles so the waffles were basically made with just flour and water had NOT TYPE OF TASTE TO THEM but the chicken was good. We sent back three orders of the waffles and when we told the waitress that it was nasty she just looked at us as if we were crazy & she really try to charge us for the nasty waffles we didn't eat. I can say I will not go back for the food but the Hookah was good."
8/28/2019,3 star rating,"I'm a regular at this establishment, actually since they first opened. Service is generally good, but today I felt profiled against by my own people. After arriving for brunch (in which there was no champagne available for half an hour), the service was subpar and there were only three people working... on a holiday weekend. Employees seemed overwhelmed and snappy with paying customers. After two hours my friends and I were asked to leave because they ""needed the tables"" but there wasn't even a line outside. Displeased.Update: I forgot the owners name, but she was right - I came to YELP out of frustration. I've since returned to the establishment and despite service being alittle meh at times I had a way better experience and the hookah was on point . Went from 2-3 stars"

Really good tasting drink, came with gummy worms, shared it with my friend wasn't completely strong, but cool.Gummy bear hookah was tasty, smooth, and coals were changed so it wasn't harsh.Bathroom was clean too, so 5 Stars for me.Calm crowd, not rowdy. Hip hop music, current and up to date. Parking is metered too which is a plus."
1/29/2020,4 star rating,Came here late one night with my girlfriend. We both got fish bowls. It was nice. The music was popping but the vibe was still chill and relax. Hookah was also good too!
11/20/2020,5 star rating,I got the chance to go back a couple of weeks ago on Nov 7th. They opened indoor dining.  it was a pleasant experience. The wings are back to being delicious (fried a little extra hard- but I'm not Goldilocks). Mac and Cheese still BOMB. They took the egg rolls off of the menu completely but I respect that. Drinks are always good. I had a great time.
7/24/2020,3 star rating,"Before COVID this was my favorite place to go. I'm so very sad they changed most of the staff but more so the CHEF. I swear I used to ALWAYS look forward to their egg rolls and sticky wings. Like legit dreams of them... (dont judge me yall, im a picky eater so when i find something i like, i love it!)The new egg rolls have way more veggies and are just seasoned hella different. They don't really taste ""Southwesty"" to me. The sticky wings aren't sticky or friend hard enough, it's like a light fry and covered in a slippery sweet chili sauce. It might be okay for newcomers but as someone who has been going to HH for a couple years now, the changes are very disappointing. I haven't tasted their new mac and cheese yet (if it is new) or fries but I'm hoping that at least those did not change. The crab cakes are good though!The drinks and atmosphere are still pretty good as well. I always love the music and the vibe, some people say the hookah is too strong but it always works me. The new staff is friendly and attentive but it's kind of sad to see people you've become accustomed to leave. I'm just hella disappointed in the food. Hoping they get it together so I can get excited again about going here. I'll never give up hope and will probably try them again but I'm going to wait a while before my next attempt."
8/19/2019,1 star rating,I find it incredibly ridiculous that Harlem Hookah re require you to show ID to enter their establishment to eat. So basically they are denying patrons food. And the managers thinks that is acceptable ?Their meal portions are skimp and their wait staff has very entitled attitude. I would not suggest this place for brunch.
12/14/2019,5 star rating,"This place is a gem. Came here on a Friday night, it was actually the night going into my birthday. The place had a good amount of people but no one was on top of anyone. My friend and I say at the bar. We both were unfamiliar with Hookah but the bartender Christian was AMAZING! He gave fantastic recommendations on flavors. I think we got the blue mist mixed with Kiwi. Also the drinks were good and strong. The hookahs lasted awhile. The music and vibe was on point. Playing mostly hip hop with a mixture of Spanish and West Indian. We didn't get to try to food but the kitchen was opened really late. Everyone around us was nice and we had pleasant conversations. The music was good and the volume was not overwhelming that it drowned out conversations. It was a great chill spot to bring in my 30th. I cant wait to return."
7/28/2019,2 star rating,"this update is for the business owner renee...of course I know if I'm sitting outside you can't control nature and the bugs... but the drink came from the back with the bug, meaning it was handed to me with it already being there..... also your hookah staff has a difficult time controlling the heat of a hookah and I suggest getting the many available heat management devices which will keep the temperature to exactly where it needs to be"
6/2/2019,2 star rating,had such high Hope's for this place... I really did...the brunch food is wack!!! the chicken n waffles are wack wings are fried to perfection but have zero flavor!!! the waffles are just blah.. dont get the crabcakes they are disgusting...straight freezer taste...the bottomless drinks are useless if ur waiter shows up once every 30min..sangria is good tho... hookah is ok...make sure ur waiter isnt Amanda...
6/8/2019,1 star rating,"First time coming on a Saturday and my first impression was ""wow this looks like a cool place"". Unfortunately, my excitement did not last long.My friend and I had to wait/ form a line like the place was full when in fact it was not. As soon as we walked in we were immediately told that there is a two hour limit in a way that made me feel like we should feel lucky to have gotten in. The issue is that this was the first and last communication we had with anyone who worked there for almost 20 minutes.I ran to the bathroom and the person at my table, as well as the large party next to us, alerted me to the fact that there would be a wait because they were told that the waiters were all gone due to having a meeting at 8:30 on a Saturday. There I was rushing to the bathroom to make sure I did not miss placing my drink order only to have to wait even longer. I decided to go to the bar to ask for some water because I was extremely thristy, and when I asked I was told someone would bring it over. That never happened. No standing room and 2 bartenders, one who asked how they could help me only to not.The service was extremely atrocious. We placed our drink order and hookah and had to flag someone down to order food. Food came without plates or napkins, something we had to again flag someone down for. The waiter service was non-existent, not once did anyone come over to ask if we needed anything or how we were doing. Also, they have portable chargers they will lend you and they are all dead. Nice offer but would be even better if they worked. I spent half my meal flagging someone down to ask for a new charger. While this service is greatly appreciated, there was no consistency of understanding of what the charger looks like charged. At the end of our meal, I realized that the one drink I was lucky enough to order was $14 and that gratuity had been added to the bill even though we were a party of 2. If the first thing you are going to tell me when I arrive is that I have 2 hours to stay at your establishment, it would be nice to also be told that gratuity is added no matter the party size in that same breath. This made so much sense to me regarding the lack of service, why worry about your tables when you know that you are still getting tipped?Wish I could rate 0 stars."
9/1/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down some of the best customer service ever! First time visit and I will be returning! Upon entering, we were immediately seated and the gentleman behind the bar was beyond attentive. They have a great happy hour and so many hookah flavors it's unbelievable! The coquito hookah actually came in a hollow pineapple which I had never seen done before. The quality of the hookah is evident and authentic. Additionally, I can't emphasize the amazing customer service!"
9/23/2019,1 star rating,"Customer service is horrible. Especially as for as the manager goes. Saturday, my sisters and I tried to speak with the manager and we were told she doesn't speak to guests. Now who ever is responding here to the reviews is a liar and very unprofessional. My sister diamond wrote a review and your response is wrong because that's not even what happened. We weren't even in the establishment trying to get a friend in. So before you come on here trying to call someone else a liar make sure YOU HAVE YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT AND ACTUALLY KNOW THE SPECIFIC SITUATION PERTAINING TO THE REVIEW. Period! Now you be blessed! Save your self the frustration y'all don't come here! The manager doesn't speak to guests! Unprofessional"
6/30/2019,2 star rating,"Hookah me up! For the first real hookah spot in Harlem. It's definitely a disappointment! The wait was pretty long. The wait alone gives the illusion harlem hookah is a super trendy spacious spot that screams luxury. Surprise, Surprise! Definitely, A mega fail very narrow and not even close to luxury. After a 45 minute wait for a seat that had burns on it's exterior. We then ordered food and drinks.... three cheese watery quesa no flavor dillas (quesadilla lol) and the Mac attack. Which took about another life time too arrive at the table. The only mildly okay thing about this experience was the actual fishbowl. Even the drinks were destroyed in some crazy way. Unlike my friends Under The Sea Fishbowl (Drink of choice last night) . I had no sea lol the candy nerds at the bottom were mia.Not a major deal but it took the excitement out of the actual drink. So after my fishbowl was made incorrect. The long wait for terrible food and another 40 minute wait for hookah. Then an additional surcharge on my bill after they swiped my card. The increase was 4 dollars per check (me and steph split the bill). I wouldn't mind if the disclosure was on my original receipt. Yet, that is bad for business and very misleading. So please check both Receipts!!! Or use cash. I give this a hell no don't waste your money!  Way too many negative and it's sad cause I love to support Harlem. I'm going to the les or dyckman for my hookah fetish. P.s i wish I could say more positive things but I can't!  Ultimate fail! Also too leadership, The uninformed, Sorta biased wait outside not a great look.As well as the bill surcharge was a major deal breaker for me. I have to make sure everyone understands how shady this is. If My bill is $196 before you charge it. The return receipt should never be $102! ( we split $196 ... it was suppose to be 98 and both receipt came back $102). The adorable waiter who I barely seen the whole night.Explained why my bill increased after my card was swiped. Once he seen my face expression. Not a good look ...."

1/22/2020,5 star rating,"So I just moved uptown a few month's ago, and I've been dying to find a spot where I can just catch a vibe. I found that in Harlem Hookah! The music was rockin and the service was amazing! Shamel is THE MAN! Literally pointed my friend and I in the right direction my entire time there. From the food, the drinks, and hookah combination, his recommendations were on point! He was assertive (but not too assertive) which is hard to find out here. Overall I had a great time! To make a long story short, I will become a regular here. This place is a whole vibe!"

Hookah was pulling, thats a win! Music was hittin, thats a win. And they had the BIGGESSTTTT BROWNIE DISH IVE EVER SEEN! Now, me, I love me some brownies and ice cream but the size of this one took the cake. Definitely a shareable portion. Prices are reasonable, ambience is cute. Would definitely come back here again!"
10/26/2020,1 star rating,"I enjoyed the food for the most part but I don't think I will ever go back to celebrate anything due to the way they force me and my family out after 2 hrs. I had a party of 6 and we spent $809. In some change which including drinks food and the birthday hookah plus shots. They started the 2 hr seating as soon as we sat down not after getting our food so of course once we ate and then got to the hookah our two hrs was up we explained to the security plus the waitresses that due to us eating our food can we at least finish our hookah all we got was ""sorry but it's another party that was waiting"" and they starting cleaning up the glasses and plates while we was still sitting. Also a party was there before us it look like the manager knew them but they wasn't asked to leave and still was there after we packed up to leave. Not only did we purchase the birthday hookah with all flavors but we wasn't able to enjoy it. I felt it was a waste of money and if you need proof I have the bank statement with the charge to prove how much I spent. Didn't like the way we was treated. The owner response after I wrote my review on the website was ""the website, menu and security tell you at the door"" smh that was a rude response and for this reason I won't ever spend my money here again."

We got to the place and they had us wait outside in the rain till everyone showed up even though the place was empty.

Over price and 2. Taste weird. Basically paying for the sparklers and the pineapple head."

The decor is awesome as is the music. The hookah here is also great (and affordable). Ordered food and drinks here which were also delicious (shrimp quesadilla was awesome!)The breakdown:- Make an online reservation have valid id and don't waste your time if you're under 21.- Hookah is $25-$35 (dozens of flavors!) and food and drink are $12 for plate which range from wings to sliders to quesadillas.- Drinks are $12 and they're delicious!- The chandeliers are gorgeous the vibe is great, very Harlem very chill.They automatically tip themselves 18% which is kinda ehh since our server wasn't the greatest but nevertheless I had a great time."
10/2/2018,3 star rating,"I'm giving 3 stars only because I think that they're slightly overpriced. My friend and I ended with a $200 tab for simply drinks and a hookah. Granted, we left thoroughly inebriated, I'm sure that I've been out to hookah spots with 4 friends and paid roughly the same total bill.  The ambience is clean and sleek. They treat it like a club experience, from the line that they create to enter the venue at 8pm even when there's only 8 people inside at the time.  That almost made me want to leave and just find a with less pretentiousness. We stuck it out for the roughly 10 minutes as we didn't want to do standing room at another bar on Lenox Ave.  The drinks were cool, and both bartenders (Latin guy who left midway through the evening to make way for a darker skin woman) were friendly.  The latter very fun and inviting.  I believe they do some food here also but we came after dinner and weren't checking for it.  The music was good and then there is also a DJ on weekends later in the evening on weekends, at least.  This is a nice spot to come and be seen I suppose."

They serve my favorite gin, Hendricks. *rolls eyes to back of head*3. Their food choices are really good! And they have dessert! Whaaaat?!?!? Can someone say 'fried oreos'? (SHUT UP, I'M NOT FAT! I just like chocolate)4. They have happy hour. *drops mic* (Need I say more???)And they stay open 'til 4am for you insomniacs and late work folks. Their servers are cool. They are attentive and don't bother you. Great!And they #BlackOwned. *Walks away LIKE A BOSS*LMAO. Check 'em out."
2/11/2019,5 star rating,First time today! The staff was sooooo nice! From our security to our waiter to our cook! Everyone was just so genuinely nice! They all communicated very well. And always checked to make sure we were okay/needed anything. The ambiance is great. I would definitely come back or even become a regular here! Super clean! The furniture the lamps super cute! The food was great and our hookah was topNotch!!Thank you for a great experience!
12/1/2018,3 star rating,"Hello, is a nice place to be comfortable and have a nice time with friends. The hosts Shatima gave great customer service. The food was okay I wasn't impressed. The drinks were good but for the price $14 each on a small glass cup, I don't think it was worth it. Last but not least, the hookah was great. I will not come back again because the price and the quality don't match."
9/7/2020,2 star rating,"Ok so here they don't take names when u arrive you basically just have to wait for however long on a line until there's enough seats. You'd think since it's Covid they'd opt for a ""we'll call you when ready"" as to not have people waiting in a crowded line. After waiting almost 40 minutes we were sat down at a table during the last 30 minutes of happy hour. We ordered two drinks( which tasted like medicine) and a hookah. We smoked the hookah for a bout a hour replacing the coals during that time then opted to change the shisha inside the hookah. We were assisted by the hookah girl Nya ( whom we saw more than our own waitress). Our waitress brought us drinks and we didn't see her until they decided they wanted to kick us out after our 1.5 hours. That would have been fine if they would have told us upon sitting we could only stay for 1.5 hours, also we literally JUST paid another $25 for a hookah refill and a large sangria and they were trying to kick us out!! The waitress abruptly brought me a ""to go"" cup for my sangria which puzzled me because you're not allowed to have open containers on the street. They then took the last hookah refill off my bill because I literally only had 5 mins to smoke it. When I received the bill I realized why the waitress was so inattentive, her tip ( mind u it was 5pm) was already built into the tab, which I hate because the service never matches when this happens. Overall I don't think I'd return. I didn't like being rushed out, a man literally came and tried to snatch my hookah while I was smoking it without even saying there was a table limit."

2/24/2019,4 star rating,"pros: hookah is amazing , tons of options for flavors, there are fruit heads, and ice hoses as add ons. Vibe is nice, establishment is clean and aesthetically pleasing. Good music. CONS: we waited outside in the cold for almost 2 full hours, they don't allow for standing around the bar area so everyone inside needs to be seated. Thus if there aren't any open seats... you will be waiting for an unprecedented amount of time.  so while my angry cold heart wants to give zero stars.... the hookah and our extremely fast and kind waitress made up for it ."
8/6/2018,1 star rating,"First of all the pompous giant at the front door needs an attitude adjustment.  That uppity, ""miss thing there is no guest list"" demeanor went out in 1995, get a grip! After looking and scanning our ID's for 10 minutes on a humid, hot, summer Sunday evening he finally let my friend and I inside to this EMPTY and overpriced establishment.   I have no issues with the place being empty early Sunday evening.  Our party was large enough to make it lively.   My issue is why the 10 minute scanning of ID's with a scowl on the face, only to walk into an empty establishment. My boyfriend went to park the car and apparently someone from our party had to go outside and confirm that he was part of our party before letting him in.  Again this goes back to the bad vibe from the bouncer and the pretentious attitude given from the minute you walk in the door.  No smile, no hello, not even a ""Have a good time"".   We are high paying customers in our 40's and 50's walking in on a Sunday evening which is not prime time for party goers.  Do you want our business or not?The bottle service with sparklers is all a bunch of hoopla.  A $350 package among a group of 8 ultimately got me ONE solid cocktail. Huge waste of money for some Henny and cranberry juice.  The two hookahs were mediocre at best but thankfully the waitress checked and refreshed it midway.   In other words, kudos for doing your job!Three of us started dancing a little bit, the middle space was completely open and we certainly were not bumping into any patrons but we were told we could not dance as they do not have the appropriate license to allow dancing.  Total buzz kill!!  We finished our drinks and left!  I do not foresee us ever going back."

10/19/2016,4 star rating,"Checked out Harlem Hookah on a humbug on a Tuesday night around 9ish.  They been open since October 1st and I have been meaning to make my way here.  We were greeted by the hostess and grabbed two seats at the bar.  The bartender handed us menus, but then it took him a little longer than expected to get back with us to take our drink order. When he finally took our order then another bartender came over to take our order again.  I am assuming maybe they were changing shifts.  Anywho I ordered a glass of Riesling($12) and my friend opted for the Red Wine Flight($16).  After looking at her flight I felt like that is what I should have went with.  I also tried the specialty cocktail called Lenox Ave, and I got it because I am a gin lover.  It was great drink but the salt was a little overpowering.  During the time I was there they apparently ran out of wine glasses and the staff was hovering over patrons for empty glasses.  For this to be a bar with wine flights they should have more than enough wine glasses, and especially on a Tuesday night.My friend ordered hookah as well, and I believe she got watermelon and mint.  I tried it once because I have a respiratory infection that would not allow me to enjoy the hookah.  The one time I did try it had a very smooth flavor which I loved.  We had people come by several times to change the coals, and they were very attentive.The establishment's decor is beautiful and has this clean and chic look to it.  The marble bar is what your eyes are immediately drawn to and also the beautiful chandlers.  The bathrooms are pretty tidy and have mirrors have the log illuminated which make great for photo ops. LOL.  This is a great place for large groups, and I recommend making reservations.  And this seems to be a popular place for people to celebrate birthdays as well.The place also serves up food and the chicken wings seemed to be popular with everyone at the bar.Overall, I can tell they are still working out a couple of kinks which is expected with any new business.  I will be back soon regardless!P.S. - They have happy hour for the month of October from 4-6pm.  Also, don't forget to check in and get 5% off :)"

2/1/2017,4 star rating,"Very nice hookah place. I like the decor as well as the service. The staff were very attentive and polite. The drinks were very good and strong. The hookah wasn't good tho, and it didn't last long and we had the pineapple head and ice hose. So they should definitely look into fixing the hookah to make it taste better and last longer with out the harshness or coal taste. The music was nice too it was a mix of R&B and hip hop. We came here after dinner so we didn't try the food. I'll try them out again but it's not in the front of my list. Also it was a Thursday around 7 o'clock when we went so the next time I'll come later and on the weekend and maybe it'll liven up a bit."

5/27/2018,1 star rating,"This is the review you need to read. PLEASE believe the stories that follow every 1 star review. I should have. I didn't. I said to myself that the people make the party, not the place. I was wrong. This place tried its best to ruin my birthday celebration. Our waiter was awesome. That's the end of my compliments.The wait to get in to a half-empty place is hilarious. My girl who arrived before me had to come get me at the door like a promoter at a club. The FOOD is unseasoned unless you are eating wings. We ordered a bunch of things and they were all mediocre. And after an argument with management in an attempt to get a hookah -- we had a party of 5 so they tried to make us buy 2 hookahs, even though 1 of our party wasnt smoking -- they finally agreed to give it to us, only to have the waiter come to tell us that he would ""take it away"" if more than 3 people were observed smoking. We promptly cancelled the hookah, paid the bill, tipped the waiter well and left.If you want HOOKAH go someplace that doesn't have a per-person hookah policy. This is New York. You have options."

And I've been here before on a Friday night, but on a Tuesday night it was lit with the 90's Reggae from DJ SunKiss!!  And the drinks were dope from one of my favorite bartenders, Akua!!  Had a good night and guess what Happy Hour is 'til 12 Midnight on a Tuesday. Dope!!  You know what is is."
9/7/2018,3 star rating,I really wanted to give this place a better rating but I must tell the truth. For my birthday my girlfriends took me here. We were a party of 5. After telling us they will not seat us and me explaining to them that we drove all the way from Queens they asked us to wait 15 minutes to get in and we agreed. 15 minutes quickly became an hour standing up outside and dresses and heels. After getting in we were told that a party of five couldn't share one hookah. One of my friends didn't smoke but they still wanted us to buy another one. After talking to management she over looked it and allowed us to purchase one. On The bright side The hookah was great the music was good and the drinks were good to. I will definitely come back here and give them another chance. It's a cool small Black owned business but I'm sure they were just having a off night. Oh the ice cream brownie was amazing
10/27/2016,5 star rating,"Since it opened it been here about 4 Times... in a month, I think I have a problem! The decor is beautiful, classy, elegant, but comfy. I'm a vegetarian, so I am glad they have some yummy veggie options. I've had the fries, guac and homemade chips, and the quesadillas, all were yummy. I tried a few of their signature drinks too, which were great as well. I only had hookah once, but it was good (I don't remember which flavor it was) but based on the menu they have a lot of options, so for hookah lovers that must be a good thing! But I think it's great that you do not need to smoke hookah to enjoy this place. Also the music is always great a good mixture always has me dancing at my table. Will be back soon!"

Your host on the other hand was very nasty and yelling at him. He still remained very professional during the whole ordeal and still did his job.   I do like this place and the atmosphere...I'm truly thinking about bring my group of 15 to Karaoke Night that Tiny was explaining to us. PS: if a lady calls you about being outside late stating she got there at 3:10am . She did say around the corner as I was walking to my car she was going to get him in trouble.

It was smooth, flavorful and not harsh with excessive coal. I will be returning soon before it's too cold for outdoor dining to enjoy some other items from their extensive hookah menu."

6/9/2019,1 star rating,"I have been here on more than several occasions. I even celebrated my 29th birthday here two years ago. However i will say that last night service was definitely lacking. Pros : good music food hookah Cons: Based on my experience last night the hostess informed us that there is a two hour maximum occupancy . Which wasn't the problem because this is communicated on their website . The problem however is that it isnt specified until YOU inquire if that time starts upon being seated or upon when being served . Because we waited a half hour before even being acknowledged by the waitress . When we asked if anyone will be seeing us soon , we were told that a team meeting was taking place . And as a service manager for several years i do understand that it takes a lot to run a service based business. However , timing is everything . And having meetings during peak hours is not a good idea . And I'm saying this as a service manager for a business located in Times Square. It wouldn't be a good idea to pull your staff in a large quantity in the back for a huddle or meeting for that long when it's Saturday night.Another con : our table had to go to the bar to ask for water and the bartender forgot. Never brought the water . This does happen when it is busy and is understandable however on top of informing us of our limited occupancy we should have been informed that the waiters are being held up due to a staff meeting and please give them a few mins to set the expectation. And setting expectation requires communication. Another con: we weren't asked if we wanted a refill on the hookah or anything else . Waiter was polite however did not ask us was everything okay nor checked in Another con: hookah took almost 25 mins and we did not order an exotic flavor . Those who came after us received their hookahs before us. Another con : table spacing could be an issue . Hookah should be placed on the floor versus the tables . I've been coming here for almost two years and i wouldLike to keep supporting the business however after last night i think i would be going elsewhereLastly i will state that i primarily decided to stay loyal and support the business though my experiences have been mediocre . Let me also say that i have always shown support despite the mediocrity . I have the social media post and tags to prove this . So no i do not only write reviews about negative service . I actually have brought more people to the business ! People who don't even live in New York ! So the comment below from management is disappointing . I also have a constitutional right to express my experience . The reason why i didn't ask for management last night was because i was tired and ready to go being that everything else took forever. Just remember management is about doing things right and leadership is about doing the right thing . And clearly the lack of leadership is evident below in managerial response . And with that response you have lost a customer . And I'll be sure to inform my following of your abrasiveness and matter of fact response"

I had the Mac Attack which was decent but not amazing. Our server could've been a little more nice but that's okay.

We were a party of six they told us the wait was 30-45 that ended up being an hour and then they skipped us and gave our spot to the people behind us and then made us wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated. We wanted to get one hookah as everyone in our party would not be smoking, our waitress told us that we had to get two hookahs in order to buy one after many failed attempts to explain to them our entire party does not smoke we decided not to get a hookah and only do drinks. I ordered Ciroc mango and was given house vodka instead as if I would not notice.  By the time we were done with our drinks they told us we could split our table and get one hookah if we closed out our previous tab which they added a suggested gratuity to the bill and charged it without asking us if we wanted to give the suggested 18% then once we paid that bill we got a hookah and more drinks and by the time we were done they charged us the price for a hookah and an additional ""suggested"" 18% without asking if we wanted to pay the suggested gratuity amount.

2/6/2018,3 star rating,"Went here with a party of 6 in mid January. We had a late reservation on a Saturday night after midnight. By the time we all found parking (3 cars) we were about 10 minutes late for the reservation with a 15 minute grace period before cancellation. The bouncer had us wait behind the rope while he turned a few walk-ups away stating 'reservations only'. We were informed that 'we just made it' and seated right away. We decided to order a bottle of Ciroc, a bunch of appetizers & a hookah. The waitress told of we had to pay for the bottle 1st and that it would be a separate bill. It was strange but we went with it. The bill for the bottle had gratuity included. Next was the food & hookah order. They told us we had to order a minimum of 2 hookahs because their 'policy' is 3 people to 1 hookah even though 1 of us wasn't smoking. We went with that too.So the food was good & the hookah was 'okay'...I've definitely had better. The pineapple head was supposed to make it burn longer but we needed new coals which took at least 20 minutes because 'they were being heated'. When the bill came we realized another gratuity charge was added for the same waitress that bought the bottle we ordered. There was some kind of small altercation at the table next to us & they kindly packed up their food after a brief conversation with the bouncer. Overall my biggest issue about this place was being charged twice for tax & gratuity & forced to order more hookah than necessary. One hookah would have sufficed as we couldn't even finish the two we had even if the new coals came faster. The vibe was kind of stiff with all the 'rules' in place although the music was good and the staff could be more friendly."

The limit should begin when our food and bottles arrive!! How is the clock running on the 2 hrs when we are waiting for them to come take order???? That's FOUL!How about our orders were not taken as soon as we sat down, the floor was soaking wet from previous party, they didn't even want to clean it up. Then waitress was slow & every time we had a question about something, she said "" let me find out"" for 15-20 minutes each time gone. I can't with this place. Then they had the nerve to rush our party as if we had our full 2 hrs. We was  still eating & ordering food. I am 43 years old,( I been to a lot of establishments)I never been rushed to leave when hot food and bottles still coming out??? That's CRAZY!!! If you are still eating, spending money on HOOKAH drinking don't harass the customers.. Grown ppl with class would like to come there but, young & dumb staff. Don't tell us about a contract for 2 hr limit. It should be contingent upon when our food hookah and bottles arrive @ table. This spot will remain a lil. Ghetto spot, never to be elevated to  it's full potential. The owner, if they care, should make some changes to contracts & such.Or not & slowly lose business like the rest of them.Eventually going out business too. I.B"

My last time coming here! It's really sad and disgusting.

They have many different types of flavors also they have hookahs with alcohol ice hookah etc. i've had a few things off the menu. The sticky wings were amazing. I've had them a couple times since I've been there and they're always so good. From now on I'll be going there just for them and the hookah will be just extra for me. Service is always been pretty good waitresses are very nice kind and attentive. Just don't get rid of the wings on the menu and you guys will never go out of business! Lol

They were good at accommodating my semi large party, the music was good, the lite bites were good and the Dranks were good! Not to mention the ladies will get some eye candy at the bar! Check Em Out if ever in Harlem on a Tuesday afternoon."
8/1/2019,1 star rating,"Came here because we assumed the long line indicated a good night 45-60 min wait to get in on a Saturday night before 11 pm? Thank you, next. (I will add for clarification, the line was to create the illusion of having a full house which was not the case. I appear to be one of many who noted this.)"

4/15/2018,5 star rating,"I came here with 4 of my friends Sunday afternoon 4/8. We expected it to be packed but there was only 1 couple there which was a plus. Because there were 5 of us, you must order 2 hookahs with brunch if interested in hookah. We ordered a pina colada hookah and mint flavor. The music was a perfect mix of r&b and hip hop. Most importantly THE FOOD. As a group we had the chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. We also got the funnel cake fries. Everyone had great things to say about it all. Oh I also forgot about the drinks - bottomless mimosas. We literally spent hours there and had to force ourselves to leave we had such a great time. Our waiter David was amazing! He was friendly and checked in on us often. I recommend this restaurant if you are in NYC. I'll be back for sure. I'd like to come at night next time to see what it's like."

3/28/2019,1 star rating,"Horrible customer service they do not have enough employees for the amount of people in attendance, extremely weak drinks for the price the hookah is horrible and all flavors taste the same. Management is not much of a help!"
12/16/2018,1 star rating,"PATHETIC. Speaking from several different experiences I've had here. Read on...***Warning this review is VERY LONG.First Experience - my license expired (literally) the day before we came here and we were not let in. I automatically knew something was off with this place, seeing as we immediately went downtown to Babylon (our usual spot) and got in without issue. Second Experience - Got in, and literally before we even sat down we were rudely given a list of rules- I don't remember all of them but one in particular stuck out to me - ""we only accept cards that have a chip"". I was confused bc for one, I thought all cards had chips on them by now- and two, as a business you should be able to accept any form of payment someone gives you from cash all the way to gift card. This is common sense. Overall from this experience, outside of being totally turned off by the list of rules, it was mediocre. The hookah wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, although it was still subpar, and the music was pretty good. They are serious about the 2 hour time limit too (one of the rules we were told about before sitting down). That's a shame bc we actually would have stayed and got another hookah, but oh well.Third Experience - We sat at the bar on a late afternoon. Everything was OK until I realized that the water turned brown in the base. They said it was bc the oils from the pineapple were dripping down into the water. After smoking hookah at least once a week for several years I've never seen that happen before. Not at Babylon, Falucka, Zoe Cafe, Pergola, my own home- literally I have never seen that happen so clearly, something isn't right.They ended up changing out the base for us, and it turned brown again. At this point we were over it and just wrapped up. I guess they tried.Fourth Experience - The base turned brown again. We complained again and they said the same thing. The manager gave us a new one- and I expected the water to turn brown again, but surprisingly it didn't. What was done different I wonder? Still very weak on the flavoring. Despite that this experience wasn't horrible.Fifth AND FINAL Experience - Came yesterday evening 12/15/18 around 7pm and (like all the other reviewers) waited outside for someone to come and seat us only to walk into a damn near empty place- it's only two of us so it's not like we would have taken up a lot of space just standing inside. Laughable. The hookah again was not great but we were still going to vibe. We preferred to sit at the bar, so when we saw some seats open up we moved over there. I go to the bathroom real quick and come back to a combative, pathetic excuse for an entry level ""manager"" aggressively moving my stuff back over to the table. What he was trying to say was ""I'm sorry guys, we have some people waiting outside for these seats so we'll need you to move back to the table""- or he could have sat them at the table??? Instead he came over questioning my fiancee- ""who told you to come over here?""(bar seating is always first come first serve) ""Did you even close out at the table?"" (the waiter can very easily close our bill while we're sitting right here)""We can do this the easy way or the hard way"" - EXCUSE ME?! NOPE, NOPE, NOPE - BRING US THE BILL. We absolutely will not tolerate hood rat behavior from any so called ""manager on duty"". YOU ARE TRASH. The fact is that we live so close to HH so we've given it several tries. After that last exchange with that miserable ""manager"" that really put the nail in the coffin. I hate that this place is the way that it is. There are so many little changes that can be made to make this place somewhat desirable. Stop reading off a bunch of rules, making people wait outside for literally no reason, having rude staff, having malfunctioning hookah's - to name a few. We never have these sorts of problems at any other hookah place we go to, so that's where we will continue to spend our money. I advise other's to do the same. At least we gave it a few good tries."
7/5/2019,5 star rating,"Great Place all around. I have been to many hookah spots in nyc and this is by far my favorite. Highly recommend to anyone that that loves great food, drinks and hookah. Place was busy and everyone is having a good time, service in on point every time I have went. Harlem Hookah never disappoints! Also The Mac and cheese is the way to go!!"
12/5/2017,2 star rating,"Good experience! We initially tried to go here on a Saturday night and found out that on Friday and Saturdays, they only accept parties with reservations. We went back on a random Tuesday night after happy hour and grabbed a Bob Marley hookah with ice. We also ordered dessert (fried oreos, to be exact). This place was a great little night cap and our server was very helpful. I ordered the Tripe H cocktail (Harlem Hookah Hennesey Punch) and it was great, quite the cocktail."
6/11/2017,3 star rating,"First of all I'm going to state some good and some bad. I found this place on yelp when I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday dinner. Since I had more than 8 people who wanted to come I had to make a reservation. Any reservations over 8 people need a deposit for $100! You have to schedule your reservation at least a week before depending on what day you want to have it on (the weekends are very busy). I called a week in advance like the lady said and paid for me deposit. A few days later the receptionist said it didn't go through. I was able to pay over the phone the day before my reservation. Fast forward to the night of, my party of 10 became a party of 5 because everyone was running late. The lady who made my reservation (I don't know her name but she makes EVERYONE'S reservation) she was beyond rude and did not want to let us in. It was my birthday night so I just wanted to leave because we was embarrassed for standing outside. Luckily my bf spoke to the manager and she was nice enough to let us in. The manager was literally the sweetest lady and checked on me frequently throughout the night. If it wasn't for the manager I would of gave this place 1 star!! Everything is pricey and will add up so be careful. Oh and your deposit can be used once you are in there but the bill have to be together and the gratuity is 18%. My bill ended up being $149 even with the deposit already added so really it was $249! My Besttriend had a tab open and ended up paying $70 for about 4 drinks and a shot. This place is high end and NOT WORTH GOING TO."
12/6/2018,1 star rating,"This is a update reply to Renee the business manager: People of color have nothing to do with the establishment it, was the lack of service and water down drinks that i wasn't happy with. As a manager that was an inappropriate statement being that i am a person of color myself and support businesses own by people of color. Instead of throwing the race card you could've just taken my complaints into consideration for future customers or still give the invitation to fix it. very unprofessional."
12/5/2018,1 star rating,"Not worth your time or money.Reservations: We made reservations for 8pm for 8 people. 5 of us got there before the other 3 and they did not let us come and wait inside or at least let us sit and start a tab at the bar. Instead they insisted they needed the complete party of 8, in order to be let in the establishment. Please keep in mind, IT WAS  EMPTY IN THERE!! I can count on one hand how many people were there -__- so there was more than enough space to accommodate. So we waited close to 20-25 minutes outside in the cold and rain, until our friends arrived and we were seated.Drinks: Average $12-$14 water down and simple syrup drinks. pointless since you are there to get some type of buzz.Food: the food was okay, until i left and immediately got a stomachache from the food! I got the Mac attack ($15) and the Chicken Quesadilla ($12). The Chicken Quesadilla had a bland chicken taste and cheese. no pico de gallo,  no nothing. (but i guess this is expected since it isn't a Mexican restaurant). How do I know it was their food? 4 of us all got the bubble guts immediately after leaving. Service: The waitress was more concern with jamming to the music playing than servicing us correctly. We had to ask for water and other condiments since she did not bother to bring it to us from the start. I found myself having to get up and walk over to her and ask what me and my guests wanted to order. Hookah: The birthday person we were celebrating got the BIRTHDAY Hookah. SAVE YOUR MONEY! OVERPRICED! $70!! you are basically paying for the sparkler and the pineapple head smh. The flavor was ""skittles"" and it smells like a nasty fake candy and smoking it was even worse!Overall experience: Definitely not coming back ever. If you notice the negative reviews on yelp about Harlem Hookah, they show they do not care for their customers. They respond to negative reviews by saying ""thank you"" instead of apologizing and trying to correct the problem. SMH Save your money. Don't bother with this place."
11/27/2017,2 star rating,"On the weekends it is hard to get in if you don't have reservations. It's pretty small so that's why they are strict with who they let in. I personally don't like the fact it's so small and can't really have fun in closed in spaces. Overall the music was great, hookah is huge but super expensive."
5/27/2019,3 star rating,So we had to every minute run after the staff for everything.... waited long to be served .... and the worst thing was the calamari !

3/15/2019,2 star rating,"So we went here Friday night & stood outside for 30-40 mins in the cold for us to over hear the host say to another party, she only has tables available for 2 sets of people at a time ( Idk what that means ) No one said anything..no one came out to tell us. We did call prior they told us it was no problem to have a party of 5We went to another spot before going to HH the owner came out & told us the place was pack and we were allowed to at least go to the bar but he at least gave us our options.I am just annoyed no one came out to speak to us. Questioning coming back."
1/26/2019,1 star rating,I thought I liked this place. Ordered an Apple martini. Ok. Not once but three separate times in a row I received a glass with lip stick stains and water marks. Who wants to drink from a dirty martini glass?! I was super polite but 3 times in a row? WOW. Not to mention never was there an apology. Bonus: I never got my drink back after 3 attempts to have a sanitary beverage.  not cool. Don't waste your time.

4/13/2017,2 star rating,"I came here on a Saturday around 1:30am to celebrate a friends bday. My party had already been at the restaurant for about an hour. When I arrived, I was rudely told by security and a hostess to stand on line outside in the cold. I complied and didnt debate the issue. I was the only person on the line for 25mins. After 25 mins, I politely asked why exactly I couldn't go inside. His response ""its our policy. The place is packed. Your party is already here and we dont allow ppl to join parties after everyone is seated."" I called the birthday girl to let her know the situation. Within, 5 minutes I was allowed in the spot. I guess she spoke to the manager. The security guard and hostess seemed annoyed that the manager decided to override their decision.  Funny, when I entered the place.. it was not packed at all! Other than that ridiculous policy, the music was great, hookah was solid and the spot is cute. I didnt drink or have anything to eat. I live in Harlem and I love supporting black owned businesses but treating customers rudely and trying to act like the place is some exclusive celeb club is not cool.Not sure I will be back unless i come after work for a drink."
3/17/2017,1 star rating,"It's my first time here, and I was waiting outside like every other person in line to get it. We had a reservation which was good. The Maitre'd was very cordial and got us seated fairly quickly. She was also fairly nice. At this bar, they search mostly men for weapons which is reasonable. I had my hood on when I was outside because of the cold. The bouncer approached me and asked me if I had been convicted of a crime; I assumed he was joking so I said no. He then proceeded to ask me if I was a woman; I wasn't offended because I think women are great. He said he can't let ""chicks with dicks"" in. (I kid you not) I was shocked and I told him that was a very rude question. He said he wanted to know so he could search me and there were no surprises. This is NYC, im not trans but I felt that was incredibly rude especially in the current political climate. No one deserves to be treated like that and I don't think my friends will be returning. As someone who is an ally to women and people who identify as trans, I wouldn't advise that you visit here. Our experience was reprehensible"
5/27/2018,4 star rating,This place is awesome... The manager Ms. Nicole was amazing and catered to my party and needs she was very accommodating.. Our server Alaysia was fantasitic.. she was polite and very attentive.. food was great!! Buffalo wings chicken and shrimp quesadilla and the Mac and cheese was all good.. food came out perfectly hot.. also our hookah was customly made by Amirita so enjoyable... and the decor is very chic and elegant.. great place to go with a group of friends... music is pumping!!!!
3/16/2018,3 star rating,"Nice ambiance. The bouncers are firm but friendly. The establishment isn't terribly spacious but it is well appointed and set up in such a way it doesn't feel claustrophobic. I personally do not smoke hookah, however, the group I was with was comprised of regulars, all whom love this spot. The crab cakes were good, not Maryland Harbor style, but very tasty. The patrons were mostly in the early 20 - 30 range with a peppering of a maturer group. I would consider vibe urban hipster....LOL. Again, I don't personally smoke hookah but i'll come back for the food."
5/21/2019,4 star rating,"The service was not the greatest however was far from the worst.. I went there around 7:30pm in a Sunday..It was not too crowded...The hookahs are reasonably priced around $38 and they dont charge for coal refills..the drinks are strong as well...the bathroom was not the cleanness and it is unisex..just be be careful because they add GRATUITY to ALL BILLS..It was me and another person; Party of (2) and they still added gratuity automatically to the bill and almost charged me for food I didnt order...however they were quick to fix the bill; just read over your bill carefully and know that it doesnt matter how big your party is, everyone pays gratuity automatically.....lastly, music wasnt bad, DJ mixed the music pretty well..."
4/19/2017,4 star rating,"Finally made it!!!! =D A bartender from Cove Lounge (check them out!) told me about Harlem Hookah and a friend and I tried to go that same night. Needless to say, that did not fly. It wasn't even the fact that it looked filled to the brim inside either, there was some drama at the door that we found best to avoid.I decided to finally go after work on a Friday and made a reservation for a mere one for 10:30. I arrived at 10:15 and was seated! Not sure if the ladies in the line were happy about that, but I think they were waiting on their entire party.Decor is pretty sleek, the chandeliers are a fantastic touch against the white marble. It gives the venue a sophisticated edge that I NEVER see at hookah places. I got the vanilla hookah and it was, without a shred of doubt, the smoothest hookah ever. The owners mention on HH's site, that they're avid lovers of hookah. The quality shows! Coals were always tended to and if I had the lightest hint of harshness or decrease in smoke quality, they were on it. A pal decided she wanted to come through and when I asked the host about it, it was no issue. Initially she was told that she couldn't come in, but that was only because the doorman wasn't informed. Easily solved. She loved the hookah too! We're both hookah novices (aka we choke often lol), so the smoother the better!Drinks were so-so, I got something made on the spot as a suggestion by my waitress (it was essentially a strawberry lemonade with vodka) and a cosmo. Both were lacking on terms of liquor, but one was free so hey! I got the sliders which were a bit dryer than I would have liked, but my friend got the hot wings and devoured them like they were her last meal. My server, whose name I kept forgetting but I'm so certain it was Tatiana, was THEEEEE BEEEEEEST!! Though she was busy, she was attentive and super chill! Like, I would totally ask for her again! All in all, a really fun time! Recommended!"
7/22/2020,1 star rating,"I had a horribleeeee experience here yesterday. I got there around 7:30pm and waited on line for about 2 and a half hours. The line was barely moving. The staff allowed two groups to skip the line and seated them before my group and those who were on the line longer. The reason I waited was because the waitress made it seem as though we would be seated soon. Harlem Hookah claims to have a 2 hour max on dining, however, I witnessed multiple groups there stay past two hours. When we finally were seated around 10pm, the waitress told us we could not order food because the kitchen was closed. No one made mention of this to us and watched us wait there after we told them we came for food. The staff completely disregarded us and was rather rude. This was not my first time here and I am appalled at their lack of care and horrendous customer service."
1/30/2017,2 star rating,"First of I would like to say that I am a frequent customer of this establishment and have been here quite a few times since it has opened. Never had any complaints before this, Love the decor and the service and the crowd it pulls in.. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. My last two experiences here was the absolute worse.. With a reservation I waited 45minutes (unacceptable) And not only that but the bouncer was letting others in with no reservation at all. All Awhile telling me and my party there was no tables available, But when we finally did get inside the same guys with no reservation were at table. Once I seen this me and my party was completely turned off and just ended up leaving. I'm assuming he was only letting people in that he personally knew. But it was completely unacceptable. My second experience with a reservation made also.. I was told that it was a party going on with no outsiders so me and my guest would not be able to get in. Once again disappointed, I proceeded to show my reservation confirmation after being told I couldn't have made one for this particular night. Needless to say we ended up leaving. I haven't been back here since because of these two incidents, customer service means a lot to me in any establishment I go to. And I was not pleased at all."
2/5/2017,4 star rating,"First off, this is a beautiful establishment. I was a little put off by a couple of things. One thing being that I was left to wait outside in the snow for the rest of my party. There was a snow storm so it wasn't extremely crowded. I thought that having me wait in the snow was a bit rude, especially since they were only excepting guest with reservations. But I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Once my party did arrive, we were seated immediately and the service was OK. We placed or drink orders to have the waitress come back 10 minutes later to ask, ""what did you guys order again? I forgot"". That took me by surprise because I swore she logged it into an IPad or something. Still that didn't upset me. She was sweet and attentive from there on out,  so I looked passed that. We each ordered 2 drinks. And a 2 rounds of botton shelf rum shots...We ordered a hookah with a the pineapple top and gummy bear and blue mist flavoring. We loved it.    We were a party of 4, and only 2 of us ordered food which were  2 orders of wings and the mac attack (which were not as cheesy as the IG pics). Our bill with tax and gratuity was $350-400.  A little expensive but we enjoyed ourselves. I would go back for happy hour. Hopefully it won't be as pricey. PS. The bathroom mirrors are DOPE. Check them out if you visit."

12/6/2017,5 star rating,"My friends and I had a great experience here. I made reservations a few days before the time I planned to go for 11:45 pm which was a Saturday night. I received a call for confirmation, which I thought was cool of them to do so. We arrived about 10 minutes before our scheduled time and was seated within a few minutes. I will say the server seemed a bit pushy for us to get our drinks and order placed but maybe it was because of the two hour limit on tables. We ordered a hookah (bomb), wings and fries(bomb) and drinks (bomb) and we were in heaven! I can't forget the music (bomb)!! The vibe was very nice and it wasn't too crowded. Everyone was having their own fun! I would definitely recommend checking this lounge out and I must add that it is black owned. One of the main reasons I wanted to check it out. Visiting from Alabama and what we enjoy in lounges I will say that we really enjoyed ourselves."
1/10/2019,1 star rating,"UPDATE #3 Since the manager of this place wants to keep responding to me I feel compelled to respond. The person who does your karaoke events work for you. Therefore you can control what's said and done in your establishment by the people you pay to perform. If the remixes talk about black womens hair, EBT cards, the stereotypes of black women then you can give as many turkeys as you want but you won't be able to change my mind regarding this. Everyone in your establishment including Steve chanted and was happy but the black women. Those remixes are not fun or cool and they are offensive. So please take this into consideration. Also please don't assume my religion and don't use phrases such as be blessed. This is a professional platform and should be free of religious and racial connotations. Thank you for promising to handle the security and service issues. Also I see I am not alone judging from your rate and other reviews mostly from black women. I hope you read and go back and forth with all of the other one star reviews like you targeted me :) good day UPDATE #2Not sure why the management of this business responded to me in such a personal manner and aggressiveness but if that was J3000 and he was just a customer why did he promote the karaoke night and asked everyone to come to his event ? Let's not lie. Overall the idea is the karaoke event you have is ANTI-WOMAN. And Steve And obviously you let that slide. Please. The problem here is not even the owner. The point is your owner/ owners husband (which technically makes him the owner and according to him he is an owner ) was around but he wasn't paying attention to anything happening and you the manager I suppose was also nowhere to be found so I am sorry if I was confused by this whole thing. The reason you got one star is the experience you failed to provide at the door from the get go. Instead of addressing this you are on a roll regarding who is the owner and who is not. If the owner did not change the words to the songs he was enjoying the sexist lyrics because his participation was 100%. Overall yes you can control the content of the music you play or sang. You can provide a less hostile environment to protect black or any woman from this. But you failed to do that and have been going back and forth with a customer without addressing anything said and done I am so done with this place and I will discourage everyone I know from this place. Please do not respond back to me. Thank you . UPDATE the response I got from this business needs a response so here it is: We know the owner is a black woman and her husband was there who identifies himself as co-owner. My karaoke comment was based on Steve's performances which had very troubling sexist lyrics that he obviously made up. Thank you. -We went there last night (Wednesday) and it was very cold. There was a very unprofessional, unhappy, aggy security guard who was extremely rude and inefficient. I and my girlfriend arrived in high heels celebrating my birthday. There was nobody in line and this gentleman would not let us in until someone lets him know the table is available. Ok we work in the restaurant business and we get it. After 10 mins we got cold and asked if we can wait inside. The guy said ""well I'm supposed to be in the cold until 4am so I have no sympathy for you"" WHAT well why don't you work at a library then? Or maybe in the boiler room of a building since it's hot in there? Or maybe you should get a job in the kitchen and enjoy the warmth. But you are a freaking security guard and your response was nothing shy of disgusting. My friend and I proceeded to leave because we were literally too dolled up to receive such a stupid experience. As we were leaving someone else magically appeared and told us the table was now available. The server apologized saying they do not have walkie talkies so for him to pretend like he was talking to us to get you a table was a lie. He is a liar. We were shocked Why would he have us wait without even telling anyone ? This perso is a sociopath and needs to be removed from that door. I will tell all my promoter friends , Harlem friends and coworkers to not come here. The drinks were also watered down and our server rarely came over The owner was on the mic doing karaoke with nothing but misogynistic remixes to the songs. This was a whole mess. Never again. Oh and that security guard should be immediately terminated. He was a tall black guy with the worst customer service and interpersonal skills His misery rubs on others who just wanted to give you business Never again Done with Harlem hookah! Many other great places in the area to be power tripped and humiliated by a unhappy and generally unpleasant person"
2/4/2017,2 star rating,"Where do I start? I had high hopes for this establishment and I was let down. First, when I arrived myself and other people were made to stand outside on line in the cold. The person at the door did not give us any indication about how long the wait would be and he ghosted. I was there for a party and texted my friend, he came outside and collected me. The other people had to wait outside for quite some time.Now I have read comments from HH where they say that the wait outside is necessary for safety reasons. I find this hard to believe, but if this is the case it would be useful to share this info with your patrons instead of literally leaving them out in the cold.Second, I ordered a drink and twenty minutes later it still had not arrived. Sangria just does not take that long especially when it's not crowded. I noticed later on when I went up to the bar that was not crowded to order a drink that service was snails pace slow. It seemed as though there was no urgency to take my order. Third, a person in our party was told that she could not come into the bar from that line outside because our area was too crowded, she asked if she could just go to the bar to buy a drink for the bday boy and she was allowed to, however, at the bar she was then told that she couldn't buy a drink and had to get it from the server because she was part of our party. Makes no sense. If she is not allowed to stay because our area was too crowded, how was she supposed to wait to order a drink from our server?All in all the evening was filled with hiccups. As a resident of Harlem I always want to support businesses in Harlem, but sometimes it really is difficult.Had to edit my review since Tiffany from HH replied to my review. I don't know who is Yvonne is, you assumed incorrectly. My review is based on my experience alone and wasn't posted to coordinate with anyone else.I will be more than happy to pass on the information, please provide an email address as I don't want to put my friend's personal information on Yelp."
1/8/2017,1 star rating,"Mandatory positives: gorgeous decor, good music, and I liked the crowd.Negative: my sober friend was told she was too intoxicated to drink and ended up leaving the bar in tears. It was not explained until after we received our hookah that she would not be allowed drinks when we had been attempting to order drinks from when we ordered the hookah. No real reason was given besides that she appeared intoxicated... $45 for a hookah that we didn't get to finish because she was made so uncomfortable by the exchange. Absolutely awful service. Very disappointed because I live in the area and have been looking forward to visiting... Guess not."
7/2/2020,1 star rating,"I've been coming to Harlem hookah for many years and I have never experienced anything like this before. They were absolutely slow and unprofessional. Sophie was our waitress and then randomly switched us over to someone else that wasn't aware of our table and/needs. It took 1 hour to get my food, 1hour to get my first drink and 1 hour to get my second drink.  Then Shay(the manager) said that we had spent more than 2 hours at our table so we could not get a refill on our hookah. But then our new waitress came and told us that we can get a refill but that took another 30-40 minutes at that point I was ready to go. However, I would like to give a special shoutout to Judith for trying to remedy the situation, even though it it was too late at that point."

4/14/2019,4 star rating,"Food and hookah were overall very good, the only downside was the service provided... for as long as it took to wait for a seat was as long as it took for the server to attend to our table, which seemed much longer than need be. Other than that, we would definitely return to enjoy some good food on a chill night."
8/28/2019,4 star rating,Went on a Tuesday night and loved it! Happy hour was all night so drinks and appetizers were reasonably priced. I got the rum punch which was strong and delicious. DJ was good. No complaints! Will definitely be back.
3/12/2017,4 star rating,"My girl made reservations and brought me to this lounge. (The woman underneath this post w. the big head ) we came here with a group of 4. Walking into this establishment I was blown away by the environment. The decor was unique and set your mind into a relaxing state. The Skittles flavored Hookah was powerful, and definitely will have you choke up. The Duke game was on . The music was smooth, featuring a range of artist such as 6lack, Tory Lanez, Disclosure, Drake, & The Weeknd. The drinks were strong/flavorful, and the server was attentive to our every need. The downside of this night was the host asking us to move to the bar after an hour into our reservation. (When you have 6 people you're suppose to have 2 hours at a table). Once we moved the host gave us complimentary patron shots for the unfortunate removal. Overall I would come back to the establishment, but on a slower night than a Saturday. P.S. - They are strict on reservations and arrival time."
10/23/2017,4 star rating,I came here on a Friday night to celebrate my birthday I made reservations a few days prior and I tried calling to confirm my reservation was received since I did it online but when you call it's an automated voice messaging system that responds so I left a voicemail and did not receive a call back. The day of my reservation I tried calling again left a voice mail and still so answer or call back. I arrived to be place about 30 mins after my reservation time and explained to the hostess about my reservation and that I tried calling but she told me that they gave my table away and that I wound have to wait at least an hour and a half for another table it was 11 pm at this point and I asked her to see if anything Could be done because I didn't want to bring in my birthday on the street. Finally I was able to speak to a manger and showed her proof that i tried calling and she worked her magic and got us in before 12!!!Soo ... the place is kinda small but very nice inside the waitress was very nice and attentive. We ordered the bob Marley hookah and the coquito both are amazing !! And strong !! I had the Harlem mule . We ordered some appetizers the fries were fresh ! Loved it also the quesadilla was good also. My friends ordered the sliders but I didn't try it. I would definitely go back here and arrive on time . The bouncer also told us that Friday's and Saturday's are reservations only !! FYI
4/9/2019,4 star rating,"Good food, but the unlimited mimosa for 2 hours is a scam. I had table of 11 people and they would only supply the table two bottles at a time, then we would have to wait over 15mins  for a refill."
5/24/2019,4 star rating,This place is super fun and very classy for a hookah bar. They have a really good happy hour with good food and good priced hookah. They have a very thorough screening process for ID's and even have portable phone chargers which is super clutch since I had originally  came there cause my phone was dead ! Server was a sweetheart and hookah coals were brought often. Will be back !!

"" I think you should find some place else for today"" was her response. It's very clear that there are kids running this place, all I have to say is GOOD LUCK with all that.  NO STARS NEEDEDReply- Birthday was great! And business was appreciated else where."

9/23/2018,1 star rating,"Ater waiting OUTSIDE for OVER 15 minutes with NO line or anyone in front of us JUST for the hostess to seat us once we were seated BEFORE she even said hello , we were given the policies ...... Okay I UNDERSTAND policies  being I'm in management and the Director of a facility therefore I KNOW ALL policies have leeway  ! Okay now the sever takes 10 MINUTES to come , he was nice enough though. We order , two of us did Breezy , everyone was going to be eating and drinking. So one of the policies we were given BEFORE even being greeted was over four people,  you HAD to buy TWO hookahs. Now granted it was a WHOLE 5 of us , I asked to speak with the manager being 1 of our party does NOT smoke hookah. Tom came over nonchalantly and I spoke to him respectfully telling him one of our party doesn't smoke; his response it's our policy matter of factly. So I said okay we're leaving he said okay get up I have another party waiting..... JUST LIKE THAT  !!! THANK GOD a couple of us have badges to PROTECT I said we will once my wife returns being she had to go to the ATM because they dont take debit cards without chips. So they lost out on money because Tom rude unprofessional self couldn't rather wouldn't bend the policy. You cant FORCE people to buy something. Tom SHOULDN'T be managing a playground. The manager Nicole was ALWAYS pleasant and professional.  Harlem  hookah WON'T get ANOTHER dime of my money . Again I UNDERSTAND policies but ATTITUDE is EVERYTHING and ALMOST EVERYONE there ATTITUDE sucked."
3/18/2017,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Kind of upset with myself for not coming here sooner! Athough the venue isn't huge, the ambience is extraordinary. Great music, customer service, and the menu selections. The hookah they provide is strong, meaning you actually taste  the flavor and it doesn't leave that annoying itchy throat feeling like most places. The FOOD IS DELICIOUS; the Southwest Egg Rolls with Avacado Ranch dip is a must,  the Sticky wings, and Thai Sweet chilli calarmari are just as good. Looking forward to coming here again. Oh and did I mention that they have their own snap chat filter!"
5/14/2019,5 star rating,I really like this place. I went for hookah and drinks on a Saturday night . I got two of the Hennessy punch and it was made perfect. The place plays good music and the staff are nice. I also got the tacos as an appetizer and they were good. No complaints ! I will def. be returning !
4/16/2019,5 star rating,This place was busy on a Sunday night. Now you know people have work the next day so this speaks volumes about the tranquility of this space.After coming across this hookah spot on Yelp I knew I had to go. I have gone to many hookah places but no other establishment had a classy well thought out layout like Harlem Hookah. Their staff is very attentive and they pay close attention to change the coals and to assist when needed. We had some kind of mint hookah I cannot recall the name but I do plan to return to try it again! We placed an order of their buffalo wings they were sweet and hot so tasty! I would highly recommend this hookah spot for a calm vibe.
7/17/2017,5 star rating,"I went with a group of four people for a reservation that we had on a Saturday night. Our reservations were set for 9:30pm, and we got there around 9:15pm. We were greeted nicely at the door and taken to our table immediately.Sitting down for the four of us, I thought that the table they placed us at a tiny bit tight, but we sat and got comfortable after a while. I ordered some calamari with sweet thai chili sauce on the side. Let me tell you America, this is the absolute BEST calamari you will ever taste in your entire existence on this earth. It is seasoned to perfection and the tenderness of it is perfect; it's not too crunch and not too chewy. It has the perfect consistency. The sweet thai chili sauce was amazing as well, especially on the calamari. I ordered a Henny Punch and another drink that I cannot remember, but they both were good. The bartender's hand was a little heavy, so although the drink prices are slightly high, you will certainly appreciate it with the amount of alcohol you get in your drinks. The hookah we got was a mix of two flavors and it was very good. The servers are constantly coming by to check and see if your coals are still fresh. They are very polite and attentive to everyone's needs. The music was perfect there if you like Hip-Hop. Perfect blend of classics along with good songs that are out now. Music isn't played too loudly to the point to where you can't hear your friends, but it is loud enough for you all to thoroughly enjoy the ambiance there. I have been back a few times since my first time and I have been nothing less than pleased every single time I've been back. Highly recommended!!"
9/3/2018,1 star rating,I want to like this place because I live in the neighborhood and love hookah. The owners and management need to understand that it's not okay to hold people in a line to walk  into an almost empty establishment. Drinks are weak and over priced and the food is Meh at best. Not to mention the rude staff members. I'm a pretty nice guy and don't like to patronize establishments that don't make me feel welcome. Won't be returning.
3/23/2019,1 star rating,Trash ass bouncer in the front is for sure the reason people are not coming in to spend money on the establishment. Definitely did not make me want to come and spend money. I'll take my chances up the road.
10/20/2016,3 star rating,"I was really excited to check the place out after the pristine aesthetic showcased by their Instagram page. After arriving, I was a bit let down, the pictures looked a lot different so maybe it was just a rendering. Still a beautifully decorated space! I love the light fixtures, the bar, and table designs. Very inviting decor and ambiance. I strictly came for hookah and wine, as I had already eaten the day of my visit. The hookah was very reasonably priced and coals were changed efficiently. I wasn't at all pleased with the fact that one glass of wine is $12, I don't think I've ever paid more than $8-$10 for one glass of wine. I'm in the industry and well aware that typical wine pours are 5 ounces, at $12 per glass that's a crazy markup. My friend ordered wine by the glass, it looked more like 4 ounces. I opted for the wine flight, thinking it was a better deal; 3, what looked like 3oz pours for $16. No way I'd only do one glass lol I allowed my bartender to choose the wine for me, since Cabernet which is my Red of choice wasn't available. I was very fond of his recommendations, I had a Pinot noir, a Malbec, and a merlot. The Pinot was my favorite. Being such a new spot, I definitely sensed areas of improvement as far as operational structure and general flow of things but hopefully in time they will iron all kinks out. I definitely will be back, I'm open to giving them another shot and hopefully being able to give them a revised 5 star review."
2/18/2017,5 star rating,"I honestly enjoyed this place so much. The service is great, please make your reservations on time or they will have to waitlist you. Even 10 mins late can make a difference. I came with 6 girls and we split one hookah and it was enough because the hookah is strong but with a pineapple head it makes it smooth. The waitress was so fun and helpful.  All the service was great, the servers checked on us often as well. I got a patron margarita and a Hennessy side car. I would get the side car again the margarita like orange juice."
10/14/2016,3 star rating,"Went with some friends on a Thursday evening.  Cool spot - chill yet classy, I would say.  I ordered the sliders and the mac attack (3 ways).  I asked the waitress what the three ways were and she had no idea.  I also asked that she find out and she returned without an answer.  I decided to try it out anyway - I eat mac and cheese everywhere.  The sliders were bland and had no sauce.  The mac and cheese 3 ways were 1. mozzarella and chicken 2. basic cheddar 3. unsure of the cheese, but it had a nice crumble on top and contained shrimp.  THANK GOD I WASN'T ALLERGIC.  It's dangerous not having that listed on the menu and even more dangerous that the waitress did not know that it was in one of the macs!!!  I also had the Harlem Marg on the rocks, which is their play on a margarita. It was purely margarita mix so avoid ordering.  The service was good and the waitress was sweet.  They all need to be more educated on the menu and the food was mediocre.  I am, however, still interested in the hookah. I personally feel smoking and eating is odd, so next time - when they've been open for a bit longer - I'll give the hookah a try."
7/20/2017,5 star rating,"Wonderful experience, will be recommending to all who find themselves in Harlem. Tianna was our server - very lovely, sweet, attentive. All the staff are really nice actually - I didn't catch his name but the man helping us with the coals was also wonderful. It's great when people look happy in their work place! the hookah was great - double Apple had a licorice aftertaste, burned smooth and sweet. Music was great too, at the right volume. Also the place draws in an interesting crowd. I enjoyed watching the patrons at the bar - high fashion, vibrant people. Thanks Harlem Hookah!"
10/1/2016,5 star rating,"This place is so cool!  Went in here with some friends for some drinks, and hookah!  The atmosphere in the lounge is new, modern and clean!!  They surprisingly had great food!!  The mac and cheese was really good, and the wings had some good spice to them!  Staff all friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I'll definitely go back!"
10/16/2016,3 star rating,"So me and a friend came to visit this place last, night which was s Saturday. We ended up going there because it was 2am, (they close at 4am) it was new and I seen a few friends mention the spot on IG, haha. Now me Personally, I'm A HOOKAH HEAD! lol I'm sorry I love hookah so the fact that this spot was close to home I was so hype, I normally would uber to Dykman in a heartbeat! After Visiting I would give this spot and overall 7.5 /8 & it's only for two main things. Again as I said compared to other spots like Dykman (sh*t anywhere in Dykman) You know the dominicans don't play with their hookah, it's ALWAYS on point IDC which Resturant you go to and yet they have hookah at every single Resturant up there lol. This hookah at Harlem Hookah was not hitting at all, like the flavor taste a little off to me, I ordered blue mist and it was hard to blow smoke and then when I did blow the smoke it was low.Now listen I'm a realist lol when you smoke hookah you want to pull out you phone and take corny videos for IG or snapchat blow nice clouds. but the way that hookah was set up, yea not too sure about that lol. I asked the guy about the hookah and it not really blowing like I would expect it, he ensured me ""no problem that's what we're here for.. took it to the back changed the coals etc. & Still nothing.No I'm lying actually when he changed it, it was slightly better (by that time I was just a little over it) And on top of that there Air conditioner system is another ""something I would change"" it's like directly over you and it's blowing so hard that it's blowing the smoke from the hookah. And like I said I came to do hookah I wanna blow smoke clouds and the ac is just blowing the shit away lol that had me aggy as hell. --but listen I know I'm a bit of a jokester but overall this place is chill. The decor is BEAUTIFUL! it really looks nice as hell inside, I'm big on that. Really clean, the staff seemed pleasant. my waiter who was helping was really nice the whole time so their customer service I would diff give them a 10. We didn't eat I only order a drink a Long Island that I couldn't finish because I was already feeling a little nice and it was strong lol which is a good thing. other then that they should turn that damn ice box ac down and work on the hookahs some more and they'll be good.Sidebar: I was sitting right next to another group of people who were unsatisfied with their, what looked to be ""fried Oreos"". she told the waiter that they tasted like the chief fried the Oreos in the same oil he fried the fish with, said the Oreos tasted like ""fish whitings"" LMAOOOOO! true story I was crying smh the girl to the left me was fucking this Mac attack they have which is like 3 Mac and cheeses. Now I read another review where someone said that one of the Macs had shrimp in it smh it doesn't say that on the menu and that so scary because I'm allergic and I was thinking about getting that I'm glad k didn't smh they should change that up or warn people about that for sure.I'll probably revisit this place in a few months let them break in I hear they just opend up a few weeks ago anywho."
11/23/2018,1 star rating,Nearlt empty hookah lounge and they make sure they make you Wait out in the cold. Before the let u in they let u know that they only take cash and card wtf else are would you pay with. Also they let u know there is a 2 hour limit twice. What kinda service is this. Sounded almost like they prefer you DONT spend your money.
11/19/2016,3 star rating,"After 8 you need a reservation so make sure if you plan on visiting on the weekend you do that. That's 1.Decided to try this spot & luckily we were able to get a table. The decor is nice but the the spot is small. I love the marble tables, the chandeliers & how well lit the area was. The music was good. We were vibing & still able to hear each other talk. As a hookah lover, I was not pleased with the hookah what so ever. It was very harsh. The pull was whack. However, a very nice gentlemen came by & spoke with us offering his assistance anytime we needed but there was no saving it.  #dead...the coal is refreshed often. For food, my dude had the sticky wings that he said lacked seasoning. He wasn't too happy with them. I got the Mac attack all cheese cause i don't eat meat & im allergic to shrimp. It was good. Real cheesy so . Three cheese quesadilla was what it's supposed to be. We just got henny on the rocks so can't comment on the drinks. The shot was alittle skimpy.Overall, it's a new spot & recently opened so I'll definitely revisit for a second try. The staff was nice for the most part. My dude didn't feel like he got enough attention since he felt like the spot was small & more intimate then a typical lounge/bar."
11/28/2016,3 star rating,"Overall pretty nice spot. Love the decor. If you're a Hookah Smoker, you will recognize that their Hookah is HIGH QUALITY. They can definitely work on spacing but other than that .. very nice area with great urban music.

10/26/2019,1 star rating,Went here twice (once with a reservation & once without) both times were horrible. The bouncer always insist there's a wait when in reality there isn't. The food is horrible & taste like a child made it. The hookah & drinks are overpriced and the place is always boring. Also there's no DJ. Don't waste your money if your looking for fun spot with good food & service this is not the place!
7/14/2017,3 star rating,"The wait staff,  Paul,  was incredibly attentive and sweet. He had great suggestions on the best flavors and checked in on bus several times. I knocked one star off because we did have a short wait outside for a table and when we got inside there were many empty tables,  so the wait was confusing. As far as drinks go, I had the white sangria which I had to return, it was vodka based (unflavored vodka) and tasted like orange and cranberry juice with some fruit punch and LOTS of vodka.  Def not a sangria. Other than that I had a nice experience and will return"

11/10/2017,1 star rating,"Horrible customer service. Literally called in advance to secure a table and was made to wait outside in the freezing cold. I myself work in the industry and I'm aware of how others should be treated and how table rotation works. A guy literally came outside searching for a reservation and I told her they had left and she still refused. My friend was celebrating becoming a captain in the NAVY and they told us we had to wait despite calling in advance. I've been here on 3 separate occasions. We were disgusted and appalled with the treatment we received. The hostess 'Blondie' and whomever else working the phones lied to the bouncer and said they did not speak with us and I had to go inside and speak to her face to face in regard to the reservation. There was even a complete open table and she refused the seat us, explaining that her table may show up in twenty minutes. Then we all said our goodbyes to one another and 5 minutes later they asked how many and we looked back in disgust, like we weren't just at the door 3 minutes ago. Just all around bad and I've had the hookah here before and It doesn't even pull that well. Such a disappointment how they treat their own black customers who are coming to spend. Never again will I recommend attending Harlem Hookah. PISS POOR SERVICE! (Go to Sylvana's instead or Parlay Cafe at least you will be treated like a human being and not a dog)"

12/17/2016,4 star rating,"Went here for drinks with a few of my coworkers. We arrived at 4 p.m. when they opened, so the spot was empty. We were greeted by really pleasant waitresses. They explained to us what the Happy Hour specials were. I ordered a rum punch n it was really good! Although Happy Hour was at the bar only, the staff offered us a table where we could all be comfortable, while we still got to enjoy the Happy Hour special. We ordered food once we got to the table. My friend ordered hookah, she said it was the best she'd ever had lol. The food was delicious! I was surprised b/c I was only expecting their hookah to be great. I had a really good experience n I will definitely be returning!"

11/17/2016,5 star rating,"Chic upscale new spot in Harlem! The lounge is new and the decor is beautiful. This was my first time trying hookah, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with the pineapple flavor. They have lots of options for anyone more familiar with hookah.Menu has typical bar type food and the food was excellent. Sticky wings are a must!! Yummy! Also had the mac and cheese (plated and served 3 different ways)which was also yummy and the calamari; which was tender, not rubbery! I enjoyed the vibe of lounge and can't wait to go back. Heads up...place looks very busy, so make sure you make reservations."
4/4/2019,2 star rating,Horrible experience! I celebrated my birthday here where I RSVP for 15 people and paid for a bottle package. I was seated at 10:30 pm and the waitress  took entirely to long to bring out my bottles. Several Guest ordered food which we did enjoy. When it was time to bring out the bottles on theMenu the waitress had to run and keep checking the bar to see if the bottles requested was available. It was if the waitress didn't know anything and couldn't help.  When it was close to the 12:30 pm they told us that we couldn't spend anymore money because it was a two hour cut off period. What a horrible birthday and a complete waste of money. I didn't even get to eat a meal because I socialized with my guest for the first hour. The manager was rude he didn't work with me and the establishment was completely unprofessional. Both my guest and I will never attend again!!!!

She told us her preference on everything on the menu. She convinced us to get the Cocquito hookah , Henny punch and the sticky wings . It was all good and the drinks were strong .We had a lot of questions and she was patient with us even though she was doing everything by herself . She was even helping us with the hookah . I really liked this place and I'll be back"
9/9/2019,1 star rating,Came here for brunch with my boyfriend and the service and quality of this establishment was a extreme  disappointment. The hookah was horrible we expressed to the hookah specialist that the hookah wasn't good and he just kept flipping the coals we didn't even smoke it because it was to harsh. My food order came out wrong and the food had no taste.  My server was not attentive at all we came for bottomless brunch but only received two drinks.... our Bill came out to $152 and we only got two drinks from our bottomless and a kid size menu portion of food it was a waste and let's not forget the hookah we couldn't smoke. Our waiter wasn't good at all. I had to get up twice to get his attention for our drinks and NO IT WAS NOT BUSY it was very slow so it was even more frustrating to receive this type of service. I was eager to come here and visit for brunch but its defiantly not recommend or worth the money.
7/29/2018,1 star rating,"Horrible service, greasy food, terrible broken down look that really makes it look less appealing. Our waiter pretty much forgot every order we made. We ordered two hookahs and only got one. With all honesty just avoid coming to this place. Manager didnt even care about our discontent.

5/7/2018,1 star rating,"!!** BE CAREFUL AFTER MY FRIEND WROTE A REVIEW THE MANAGER CAME ON HERE AND ACCUSED HER OF ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS ATTEMPTING TO DISCREDIT HER**** !! I really was not going to write a review about this place because it's not even worth that, but considering how awful my friends and I were treated I must warn the world. Management does not only suck at this place, they are clearly crazy! We received the the worst service, having to wait for 30 mins, then allowing the party behind us to be seated before us ( same party size), then being told we have to purchase 2 hookahs for a party of 6 or we can't smoke hookah at all..... O YEAH they also gave my friend house liquor instead of the mango Ciroc he ordered. After making a complaint he got a new drink that actually tasted like mango ciroc. Sad! Why are y'all trying to rip people off ? O and by the way we had to experience some crazy party arguing and threatening staff. WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON THE BOUNCER WAS HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT TO KEEP IS INSIDE WITH THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. My friend had to ask the bouncer to let us out of the establishment. Why keep a rowdy person inside the establishment and endanger everyone else??? Again poor decision making on managements part. SO if you are looking for a place to sell you bottom shelf liquor for top shelf prices, Rowdy people, unaccommodating management this is the place to be.**Tiffany you can not accuse everyone who had a terrible time at your establishment that night of being part of that rowdy group. Sadly,  if you had put this much effort forth with customer service you could have received a wonderful review instead of a bad one. Be more proactive. ***"

I ordered shrimp tacos for $8, they weren't good it tasted like they were missing something. The Mac attack for $15 was good I tried shrimp & regular. It was awesome. The drinks are strong as well. I given 4 stars because you have to wait outside for a long time. This is a late night spot or if you're a big fan of hookah."
5/21/2018,4 star rating,"After sadly missing dinner with my friends, a couple of us came here to chill and hang out for a bit. As soon as we got there, the bouncer let us know that they were at capacity and wouldn't be letting anyone else inside. We were so annoyed, but started looking for another place nearby. As soon as we found someplace and started to walk away, the bouncer called over to us and let us know that some people just left and that they had 3 seats available at the bar! Look at God!I was a bit annoyed when we walked in because I didn't see why we were stopped from coming earlier. The place was not full at all, but I suppose they don't want people standing around and will only allow people in if they can be seated. Antyways, once seated, we immediately ordered our hookah and some dranks... and since I missed dinner, I got some wings and fries. The food came out so quickly I almost sent it back in fear it wasn't cooked enough, but it passed the taste test! Or maybe I was too hungry to tell the difference haha. The buffalo wings were good and the fries were nice and crispy. I had the Triple H drink, which was Henny, Henny, and some other stuff. Also, you guys, the hookah was ELITE! Nice and smooth, great flavor (we got mint and mango) and they change the coal frequently. Shoutout to the real MVP, our bartender Shelby!

5/18/2018,5 star rating,The vibe is amazing. Great music and great hookah. This is a great place for friends or a date. The drinks and food are tasty and so worth it on a Thursday or the weekend. Can never go wrong with Harlem Hookah.
5/10/2018,1 star rating,"Let's state the facts 1) if it is a law then you guys should have never asked us that if we closed our previous bill you would allow us to get a hookah. (Raised eyebrow) No where in the law does it state that. (lies)2)I definitely asked the waitress to remove the 18% ""SUGGESTED"" gratuity off my bill several times and she stated that it was mandatory. (More lies)3)I was never given a drink that I did not pay for (Even more lies)It's simply your business sucks.  I and everyone I know will never come here again. Good luck lasting another year.You have a great evening."
5/7/2018,1 star rating,"This place is the worst place i have been to in a long time. I would never ever go there again and I have also  told all my friends to not go there either. We were a party of six they told us the wait was 30-45 that ended up being an hour and then they skipped us and gave our spot to the people behind us and then made us wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated. We wanted to get one hookah as everyone in our party would not be smoking, our waitress told us that we had to get two hookahs in order to buy one after many failed attempts to explain to them our entire party does not smoke we decided not to get a hookah and only do drinks. I ordered Ciroc mango and was given house vodka instead as if I would not notice.  By the time we were done with our drinks they told us we could split our table and get one hookah if we closed out our previous tab which they added a suggested gratuity to the bill and charged it without asking us if we wanted to give the suggested 18% then once we paid that bill we got a hookah and more drinks and by the time we were done they charged us the price for a hookah and an additional ""suggested"" 18% without asking if we wanted to pay the suggested gratuity amount. I will never go to Harlem hookah ever again and I suggest you do the same."

5/9/2018,5 star rating,This was the best spot I've been to in forever. The service was amazing & the food was immaculate. I got the crab cakes and they were freshly cooked. My sliders where well done and juicy. I highly recommend this spot in Harlem. Bianca was my waitress and she brought out everything I needed without me having to ask her twice. She'll be getting a big tip from me.
5/7/2018,1 star rating,"!!** BE CAREFUL AFTER MY FRIEND WROTE A REVIEW THE MANAGER CAME ON HERE AND ACCUSED HER OF ALL THESE CRAZY THINGS ATTEMPTING TO DISCREDIT HER**** !! I really was not going to write a review about this place because it's not even worth that, but considering how awful my friends and I were treated I must warn the world. Management does not only suck at this place, they are clearly crazy! We received the the worst service, having to wait for 30 mins, then allowing the party behind us to be seated before us ( same party size), then being told we have to purchase 2 hookahs for a party of 6 or we can't smoke hookah at all..... O YEAH they also gave my friend house liquor instead of the mango Ciroc he ordered. After making a complaint he got a new drink that actually tasted like mango ciroc. Sad! Why are y'all trying to rip people off ? O and by the way we had to experience some crazy party arguing and threatening staff. WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON THE BOUNCER WAS HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT TO KEEP IS INSIDE WITH THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. My friend had to ask the bouncer to let us out of the establishment. Why keep a rowdy person inside the establishment and endanger everyone else??? Again poor decision making on managements part. SO if you are looking for a place to sell you bottom shelf liquor for top shelf prices, Rowdy people, unaccommodating management this is the place to be.**Tiffany you can not accuse everyone who had a terrible time at your establishment that night of being part of that rowdy group. Sadly,  if you had put this much effort forth with customer service you could have received a wonderful review instead of a bad one. Be more proactive. ***"
5/7/2018,1 star rating,"It's clear that you ain't got nothing better to do than to keep making accusations that are clearly false. Like I explained to your ignorant self before, THAT WAS NOT MY PARTY THAT U CLAIM WAS THREATENING YOUR MANAGER AND BOUNCER!!! TRUST ME, I would have NO PROBLEM owning it, IF IT WERE MY PARTY!! It's clear that you don't have an ounce of professionalism & are continuing to accuse my party for making threats that CLEARLY WASN'T  us! OBVIOUSLY, this just goes to prove, if multiple parties are making similar complaints, CLEARLY it's FACTS & ya'll ain't doing your damn job!! So instead of harassing me on yelp & talking nonsense about my party making ""threats"", why don't you go occupy your time by seeing what improvements you can make to improve your terrible management skills & customer service!!! And you're VERY welcome for the feedback!! Now you be blessed!!!"
5/6/2018,1 star rating,"This is probably 1 of the worst places I've ever been to....poor customer service & horrible management...my friends & I were told we would be seated in about 30-45 mins, so we waited, just to be skipped & have our table given away to another party...that should've been our 1st sign to leave, but we still decided to stick it out...we finally got in after waiting over an hour, to be told that we had to purchase a minimum of 2 hookahs for a party of 6! Excuse me management, but don't you think it would've been a great idea to inform your customers of this ""requirement"" before having them wait over an hour to be seated? Or at least put up a sign? The waitress informed us we either HAD to buy 2 hookahs or we wouldn't be able to get any at ALL! Ummm...I think it should be OUR decision how many hookahs we want to buy! You would've thought ""good management"" would've at least tried to accommodate us for the inconvenience of giving away our table! They also tried to get over on my friend & gave him house vodka, instead of the ciroc mango he ordered, as if he wouldn't notice!! Can you say highway robbery?! HH are CROOKS!! I only gave them 1 star because the funnel cake fries were the only decent thing there! But I can definitely wait for the next carnival to get some!! HH will not be receiving anymore of my business in the future!! This place will never last if they continue with these schemes!!!"

10/21/2018,5 star rating,"DISCLAIMER: I usually don't write reviews on spots I love due to it becoming too popular, but this is my one exception and sharing is caring! I've been going to/recommending friends to Harlem Hookah for the last 2 years. I've been here for dates, birthday parties and after-brunch wind downs. Let me say, HH hasn't disappointed yet! Yes, the bouncer does hold the line at times, but has been a sweetheart to me and my friends and I never had to wait more than 15 mins to get in (even when packed). The hookah is AMAZING, the best in Harlem (heck, even Manhattan), and the drinks are deliciously made and packs a punch. I had a few light fares (wings, fries and eggrolls) and we're all pretty good. I HIGHLY recommend this place! It's a great spot to go to for a more upscale experience without trekking downtown."

12/22/2018,5 star rating,"I'm not from NYC so this was my first hookah bar experience, the service as soon as I walked in was phenomenal. I came alone and was welcomed with an amazing staff who explained the menu to me thoroughly. The hookah flavor which was not told to me since I told the waiter to make me whatever was really good! One thing I will say, their AC is rly strong so it is hard to get big clouds of smoke since the air is blowing directly downI ordered the Mac attack which comes with chicken shrimp and beef inside. They let you switch it if you are not a fan of 1 of the 3 which is very thoughtful  It wasn't the best Mac n cheese I was a little disappointed! But it may just of been eating only Mac n cheese can be too much for me so that may of been more of my part. I do recommend if you come w a friend to share this order do not get more then one it's so fulfilling!Overall, great atmosphere and music! Even security was so kind and that is so rare these days"

My state ID was expired, and although we had reservations, I had to go back home and get a valid ID--good thing I live close by. That was the only hiccup of our Friday night. The tables are timed (2hrs), so we decided to sit at the bar instead. The hookahs were periodically filled without asking, smooth smoke, flavors were great and the music (DJ) was poppiiinnnn! Lol. Susie, (i dk if i spelled that right) the bartender, was attentive and drinks were strong. Everyone started dancing by 3am and the hour flew by. Brought my cousin out who visited from Maryland and we'll definitely return!"

The general manager although nice, was not aware of the check in offer and could not control her workers! The owner was there and did not do a thing!!! We all walked out! The rude waitress should have been fired on the spot and if not at least sent home. None of the group will ever visit this establishment again. They missed out on a huuuuge check and gratuity.

8/15/2017,2 star rating,"The place it's self it is beautiful, waitresses were friendly and attentive. Hookah was decent, we ordered the mint flavor nothing crazy. Food was ok, we had the wings. The real reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I came on a Friday night to meet up with some friends. I was late as always and arrived at 1:00am, all my friends were already seated inside. As I approached the front door there was a group of 5 girls waiting in front of me, mind you it is raining and none of us had an umbrella. After waiting about 10 minuets I asked the bouncer what was the problem and why are we all waiting outside. The bouncer then told me the the place is closed and unless I had a reservation I was not getting in. I explained to him that my friends were already inside with a table and bottle already purchased. The bouncer then said he needed to know a name in order for me to get in. I had no idea who's name the table was under so I texted my friend and he sent the waitress to come to the door and get me. Even after the waitress comes to the door saying my name the bouncer still gives me a hard time and asked me where do I think I'm going??!?!  Then once I got inside the place was Half EMPTY!!!   The whole process of trying to get in was so frustrating that I honestly wanted to leave as soon as I got in. I will never go back. Huge disappointment and it was a bunch of ugly guys with baggy jeans fitted hats. Waste of my Friday night."

Unfortunately, I was made to wait outside for a long time before the seemingly annoyed server finally walked me in. There was NO sense of welcoming or love shown...in fact, she seemed bothered to have to let me in. So weird! Anyway, I get inside and then I'm told I can't stand over in the section with my friends! She tells me that I needed to sit on the other side of the bar by myself, because there's a ""no standing"" policy or something. What?! My friends were in the corner a few standing already, and I was told I wasn't allowed near them bc of this strange policy. She literally stood beside me after I said hi to everyone to escort me away!!! So, I just walked out. Doubt I'll be back. Lenox Sapphire and Coner Social (neighboring bars) were perfectly happy to take my money"
5/1/2019,1 star rating,"(Im reposting this because instead of addressing the issue at hand this business reported my review due to the fact that I made the mistake of offering alternatives. So I'm reposting and removing anything that is against yelp policy. But this is my honest experience at this establishment)  I'm writing this day's after my incident at Harlem Hookah. I wanted to write this from a place of clarity and not anger. I'm a patron of Harlem Hookah. I went the first day they opened, celebrated NYE here, and have on multiple occasions brought siblings and friends here. I've even had the opportunity to meet one of the owners. The cocktails have never been great but they have excellent champagne. Their hookah is overpriced but it's done perfectly. And it has always felt good to be surrounded by people from the neighborhood especially on game nights. On Saturday 26th April, around 2 AM, I called from two blocks away to check on the status of the wait & or line. I was told if I arrived quickly I should have luck because a few guests were leaving and there was no Line. I usually NEVER go on weekends because I am not a fan of the wait, the chaos etc. But we got lucky, there was no line and within minutes 9 guests left, followed by 2 more, and another 2. I had my younger sister with me and we both needed to use the facilities. I asked how long, I was told he'll let me know when he knows. I asked if we could please use the facilities and come back and wait in line. I offered for us to go one at a time. And pretty much begged this man to have some understanding and empathy for two women, one of which comes here often, and are literally just waiting for tables to get wiped down and prepared. Instead of perhaps having the courtesy of checking with the host, manager, he chose instead to get aggressive, show no empathy. The more I asked, the more aggressive and scary and disrespectful he got. I called and Uber and we called it a night. His energy, his movement all of it unsettled me and scared me. This is a business. All it would have taken is to be hospitable, inquire within if he could make an exception for said policy, or even attempt to expedite our seating. Instead he decides to keep us out there longer. I work in the hospitality industry and the first thing I did is scope out the space before standing in line, even before 13 people walked out there were three bar stools empty. This was a vindictive act, a show of power, and an act that is utterly despicable. The fact that it's a policy to keep guests who are waiting to enter, spend money at your establishment waiting when they desperately need to use the facilities is messed up. I am a woman, who has spent countless evenings at Harlem Hookah, who tips generously and spends. I am not a person who is attempting to rob you; or do drugs in your restroom or whatever other twisted logic was use to implement this. Just because this establishment is in Harlem doesn't mean a black owned business needs to take these kind of measures as if we are barbarians or incapable of stepping into your lounge, using the stupid facilities and respectful coming back out and standing in line. We are people. Treat us like it. The way the owners run this business and the people you hire to greet guests and allow them in... needs work. Or better yet move your business elsewhere maybe then you'll feel safe enough to allow two harmless woman to use your restroom while you make them wait just because you want to, not because you need to. Because there is this d'illusion that having a line for a half empty lounge is cool, or more attractive. It's not. Treat people from this neighborhood like people instead of animals. Because that's exactly how this door man made me feel. The way he treated me was dirty, and the most racist thing I've ever felt from my own people. It was disgusting. Days after this incident i still feel utterly dirty for having to beg a man, with the same skin tone as me, from the same neighborhood to have some understanding. To be this embarrassed and treated as if I wasn't a person. It's just sad. We get this everyday in this country, we don't need it from our own. Harlem Hookah, I will obviously never ever come here again. But please don't mistake this review on some lack of understanding of how a lounge is run, I'm well aware of the issue of capacity and the need to keep guests in a line when necessary. This evening it was not. You were not at capacity as 13 people walked out and there were vacant seats at your bar even before those people exited the establishment. You could have been hospitable and empathetic and management could have been present and monitoring the door man you hire. So please don't berate me or insult me. It's better to say nothing then to insult a patron that was not treated well at your establishment and simply expressing their grievances."

They were out of it but one of the hookah makers- Maurice came by to let me know they were out but he was gonna try his best to make the same flavor or something similar.

12/6/2017,5 star rating,"My friends and I had a great experience here. I made reservations a few days before the time I planned to go for 11:45 pm which was a Saturday night. I received a call for confirmation, which I thought was cool of them to do so. We arrived about 10 minutes before our scheduled time and was seated within a few minutes. I will say the server seemed a bit pushy for us to get our drinks and order placed but maybe it was because of the two hour limit on tables. We ordered a hookah (bomb), wings and fries(bomb) and drinks (bomb) and we were in heaven! I can't forget the music (bomb)!! The vibe was very nice and it wasn't too crowded. Everyone was having their own fun! I would definitely recommend checking this lounge out and I must add that it is black owned. One of the main reasons I wanted to check it out. Visiting from Alabama and what we enjoy in lounges I will say that we really enjoyed ourselves."
12/5/2017,2 star rating,"Good experience! We initially tried to go here on a Saturday night and found out that on Friday and Saturdays, they only accept parties with reservations. We went back on a random Tuesday night after happy hour and grabbed a Bob Marley hookah with ice. We also ordered dessert (fried oreos, to be exact). This place was a great little night cap and our server was very helpful. I ordered the Tripe H cocktail (Harlem Hookah Hennesey Punch) and it was great, quite the cocktail."

3/6/2019,1 star rating,"This has to be the worst brunch spot in Harlem! My friend reserved a table for her birthday. When we all arrived, security informed us let there was no reservation. We asked to speak to the manager and security told us to hold on for a minute but never went inside or send a message/text to inform management customers wanted to speak with them. We were standing outside for over 30 minutes before I asked security if I could go in to use the restroom being that we were waiting outside in the cold. He told me no and to continue waiting for the manager. At this point I was piss, no pun intended, but really. If it wasn't my friend's birthday I would for left 31 minutes before. All story short, after about almost 2 hours me friend was able to get a table. I left about 20 mins after the first hour had already passed. Needless to say, I would NEVER go back to this establishment!!!!! They're way to many brunch spots in NYC for anyone to endure less then excellent treatment, service, food and great atmosphere! I'm disappointed in Harlem Hookah."

They went out of their way to make sure my boyfriend and I had an amazing experience. It was my bfs birthday and shay and Morgan went out of their way to accommodate us. They both would check back on us frequently to make sure everything was going Smooth. I didn't have to drag them down to be serviced. They were always there. The hookah was amazing! Morgan recommended the skittles and mint flavor and she definitely didn't steer me wrong. We had the grand patron rita and it was definitely worth every buck. My guests enjoyed themselves. The food was delicious and the kitchen is open til close. I'll definitely be back again! Thanks ladies!"
7/12/2019,2 star rating,"Nice decor with Lackluster Service and WAY Overpriced! I went to this place after searching on Yelp in that area. The decor is nice, place was clean. I had the unfortunate displeasure of being serviced by a young woman with a Nasty and unwelcoming attitude. Took her forever to bring a menu and I had to flag her down to order after 15min of simply sitting there. After ordering drinks and waiting another 20min for her to take my order the food and Hookah alone took abother 20min. A couple came in and sat right next to us and we all started to converse about how bad the service was. Orders the mac n cheese trio that was not worth the price. The hookah was never restocked with coal and they charged $35 for it. We had 1 hookah, 1 mac n cheese, 2 drinks...Total $128.00. Oh and yeah biggest complaint...they AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE GRATUITY! SO I paid this rude girl $17 dollars for crap service. In addition they charge you about $3-$4 more if you use your Credit Card vs Cash!...wtf is this a Gas Station!??? I ordered 5 shots after I paid the bill for myself and the guest we met.. .bill comes back $85 and you guessed it she added a $14.00 tip. This place is a joke. Never going back again."

10/30/2017,1 star rating,"If it was possible to give zero stars I would. I chose to celebrate my birthday here due to its beautiful decor. From the beginning, I should have left. As soon as my guest and I sat down we were greeted by our waitress. As she advised us of the birthday packages she kept continuing a personal conversation with a co worker which made it difficult to understand the items in which she was speaking about. My guest and I ordered our drinks and as the waitress was passing them out she spilled a full drink down my friends back. To make matters even worst she immediately cursed and walked off after realizing what had happened. After about 2 minutes she came back to our table and told my friend that she would accommodate her with another drink. Not sure if that was her way of apologizing but still not cool! The orders of food were completely wrong, the waitress brought other drinks to our table and to make matters even worst she attempted to give us someone else's credit card. The table next to us had the same horrible experience and walked out. All while the general manager was there walking around and did not do anything ! I'm just glad Saturday wasn't my actual birthday. I do not believe I will ever attend this place again."

11/25/2018,5 star rating,"I went for the first time last night with a few coworkers. I made a reservation online for a Saturday at 9:30 but got there a half hour early. The vibe was chill...not a long line and everyone was super friendly. My party was not only 30 mins late, but one person decided not to show up! The tall beautiful hostess was super professional and was okay with seating us with only 5 people once everyone showed up. I understand it's policy, and the manager accommodated us. When it got to be super late she told us she would have to get rid of our table which I totally understood. It's our fault not theirs! Fortunately the last two people showed up and we were seated! Their policy is set in place for a reason! It wasn't ratchet in there and had a nice grown and sexy vibe. Even the bouncer was chill! The hookah was lit. We ordered mint and coquito. Both were great, the mint was a little easier to smoke. Overall I had a great time! I wish it was a little bigger for dancing. They have a no standing policy, so if there is no space at the bar, you're going to have to wait outside. Price wise it was affordable. 2 hookahs, wings, calamari, fishbowl, 6 drinks...it came out to $230 not including tip. I definitely will be back!"
3/22/2019,1 star rating,Harlem hookah?? They had no charcoal and the service was trash. The bartenders were too busy talking and dancing to take care of the costumers. We waited a whole hour for them to say that they were out of charcoal. Once the hookah arrived it didn't work and you couldn't smoke from it. Save yourselves the trouble and the struggle.
11/18/2016,1 star rating,"At first, I thought it was a cool spot, good music, cool vibe but I was quickly bought to reality. Their Parton margarita was disgusting. The food was ok. We order the CHEESE slider but it seems as if the cheese were out of stock. It was more of a burger. The General manager was rude. To the point where he told my party and I quote ""No matter what, I'm going to make money when you leave."" At that point, we picked up and left. It wasn't worth the stay. They were lucky I'm classy and just didn't walk out on the check or made a scene. I would never go back there again."

Same guy comes out two minutes later telling us ""we are only taking cash only purchases at this time, sorry for the inconvenience "". Monday night. Cash only purchases? Came all the way from Queens to find out it's cash only on a Monday night. Maybe you should add that in you're info section."
12/16/2016,5 star rating,"Came in last Saturday night with some friends.    I have heard a lot of great things about this Place. Probably in 10 minutes I realized why. The food, drinks and multiple hookah flavors were awesome, but  the overall atmosphere was what stood out the most to me and my friends. Just an awesome spot to chill and kick it. The vibe only got better as the night went on. Great music and staff also helped get the night going. There was a surprise marriage proposal and then some dancing. It almost felt like I knew everyone there. Everyone was just chilling and enjoying each other's company.  And that's what you want any night to be. The flow and table set up allow strangers to meet and become friends. I can't express how the cool the vibe was, literally no one in the whole place wanted to leave. Def a spot I will return too in the near future ! 5/5 stars all day!"
10/21/2017,1 star rating,I come support this business and every time I get a extremely nasty attitude from the door staff ! It's just ridiculous how they treat you . Horrible . I will not spend my money here !
10/26/2016,5 star rating,"This place is so cute and chic! Usually, I'll take great ambiance over great food. However, this place delivers in both areas - great ambiance and great food! I haven't tried the hookah yet but I've heard great things from friends who have. I love that this place is in the heart of Harlem and owned and run by a lovely Black couple. The staff are also really friendly and accommodating. This is my go-to spot! Craving the sliders as I type! :)"
12/3/2018,1 star rating,"Listen, I love to support blackness. But this business has to get 1 star from because the service is HORRIBLE & OVER PRICED I don't understand why I'm being charged gratuity if it was only a table for 2 and the server was upset because we didn't leave a cash tip like BITCH You got your tip with the gratuity  ! my waitress Sophia wasn't friendly at all she seemed as if she didn't want to work, she gave my fiancé and attitude because we had an issue with our hookah it wasn't pulling correctly, idk what she did when she left and tried to fix it but it was too harass We couldn't even enjoy it we left the lounge in less than an hour. Sophia rarely checked if everything was okay unless we had to wave her down so we can finish ordering. The only good thing was the appetizers the Sticky wings & fried Oreos were delicious because they were still out & fresh. It was FIRST & LAST time spending my money here !"
12/10/2017,5 star rating,"This spot is so low-key but amazing. The vibe is chill and the staff is very helpful. I used Shazam a billion times because their music selection was great. My first time there was a success, probably the best hookah I've ever had. Get the egg rolls trust me!!"
10/8/2017,4 star rating,Very hip looking. Drinks are standard bar prices 14-15$. We had the triple H punch. There was hennessy in it. (Need i say more) the drinks are strong. We also had three cheese quesadillas. They dont mind sharing and bring you extra plates. The bouncer was very nice and even brought a inebriated woman a voss water. I thought that was kind. You need a reservation because it gets packed and is kinda small but by the time we got there (1230-1am) they just let us in. The hookah smelled good i have to try it another time
8/15/2017,2 star rating,Was having a great time til they charged 26 for a double whiskey and then had the gottdamn nerve to say they only accept cards with chips. I had recently misplaced my card and didn't have a chip. Buzz kill! Not cool! And then the music went from real hip hop to pop ! But we heart Bianca!
8/15/2017,2 star rating,"The place it's self it is beautiful, waitresses were friendly and attentive. Hookah was decent, we ordered the mint flavor nothing crazy. Food was ok, we had the wings. The real reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I came on a Friday night to meet up with some friends. I was late as always and arrived at 1:00am, all my friends were already seated inside. As I approached the front door there was a group of 5 girls waiting in front of me, mind you it is raining and none of us had an umbrella. After waiting about 10 minuets I asked the bouncer what was the problem and why are we all waiting outside. The bouncer then told me the the place is closed and unless I had a reservation I was not getting in. I explained to him that my friends were already inside with a table and bottle already purchased. The bouncer then said he needed to know a name in order for me to get in. I had no idea who's name the table was under so I texted my friend and he sent the waitress to come to the door and get me. Even after the waitress comes to the door saying my name the bouncer still gives me a hard time and asked me where do I think I'm going??!?!  Then once I got inside the place was Half EMPTY!!!   The whole process of trying to get in was so frustrating that I honestly wanted to leave as soon as I got in. I will never go back. Huge disappointment and it was a bunch of ugly guys with baggy jeans fitted hats. Waste of my Friday night."

8/11/2017,1 star rating,"Came here for a birthday celebration, Paty of 25. Was told at the door (not when we made the reservation) that they have a strict ""everyone here"" policy or no seating. 15 people  showed up by 10pm and still nothing. By 10:20 the initial 25 had arrived but still we had to wait for them to set up. When we got in, nothing was ready and they sat us cramps din the corner of the space. This is a hookah bar with no couches, that require people to sit to be served. Then they started turning away members of party who arrived later (aka normal NY club time). They were making up policies on the spot about cards for food and hookahs etc. Which was confusing and annoying. Not a good venue for a big group at all. There was hardly anyone inside jut they wouldn't give us ""reserved"" tables (even though our party only continued to expand and we took over the space). Terrible service. Never again."
7/22/2017,5 star rating,"Went for Brunch with my friend and was very impressed ! Was greeted with excellent service and my server Shauna was pleasant and attentive. The food was decent I had omelet with home fries and bacon. My bacon Was well done, not to my request but overall good meal. My friend had grits with shrimp and she loved it ! We enjoyed a mango sangria as well, and if we didn't have business to attend to we would have gotten unlimited drinks. Before my friend and I departed we were greeted at our table by the General Manager who was friendly and welcomed us back. I Definitely, will be back again. Loved the vibes !"
7/20/2017,5 star rating,"Wonderful experience, will be recommending to all who find themselves in Harlem. Tianna was our server - very lovely, sweet, attentive. All the staff are really nice actually - I didn't catch his name but the man helping us with the coals was also wonderful. It's great when people look happy in their work place! the hookah was great - double Apple had a licorice aftertaste, burned smooth and sweet. Music was great too, at the right volume. Also the place draws in an interesting crowd. I enjoyed watching the patrons at the bar - high fashion, vibrant people. Thanks Harlem Hookah!"
7/17/2017,5 star rating,"I went with a group of four people for a reservation that we had on a Saturday night. Our reservations were set for 9:30pm, and we got there around 9:15pm. We were greeted nicely at the door and taken to our table immediately.Sitting down for the four of us, I thought that the table they placed us at a tiny bit tight, but we sat and got comfortable after a while. I ordered some calamari with sweet thai chili sauce on the side. Let me tell you America, this is the absolute BEST calamari you will ever taste in your entire existence on this earth. It is seasoned to perfection and the tenderness of it is perfect; it's not too crunch and not too chewy. It has the perfect consistency. The sweet thai chili sauce was amazing as well, especially on the calamari. I ordered a Henny Punch and another drink that I cannot remember, but they both were good. The bartender's hand was a little heavy, so although the drink prices are slightly high, you will certainly appreciate it with the amount of alcohol you get in your drinks. The hookah we got was a mix of two flavors and it was very good. The servers are constantly coming by to check and see if your coals are still fresh. They are very polite and attentive to everyone's needs. The music was perfect there if you like Hip-Hop. Perfect blend of classics along with good songs that are out now. Music isn't played too loudly to the point to where you can't hear your friends, but it is loud enough for you all to thoroughly enjoy the ambiance there. I have been back a few times since my first time and I have been nothing less than pleased every single time I've been back. Highly recommended!!"
7/14/2017,3 star rating,"The wait staff,  Paul,  was incredibly attentive and sweet. He had great suggestions on the best flavors and checked in on bus several times. I knocked one star off because we did have a short wait outside for a table and when we got inside there were many empty tables,  so the wait was confusing. As far as drinks go, I had the white sangria which I had to return, it was vodka based (unflavored vodka) and tasted like orange and cranberry juice with some fruit punch and LOTS of vodka.  Def not a sangria. Other than that I had a nice experience and will return"

1/23/2017,1 star rating,"Unfortunately beautiful place, but unpleasant.  I went on a Sunday night with friends and one from out of town.  We were told by the hostess that we had to wait, which wasn't a problem.  The problem is we were told to wait outside.  Its winter not summer.  I asked if we can go to the bar, she said theres not enough seats and you cannot stand.  It was 4 of us and I saw at least two seats, but I didn't even bother to look on the the other side.  I was turnt off.  She was dismissive and nonchalant which was even more upsetting.  She didn't even tell us how long the wait would be and we were the only ones waiting.  I am expected to go outside in 30 degrees weather and wait for how long!? I spoke to a manager she told me the hostess could of been better.  I just left no reason to stay, if it was summer no problem, but its lack of customer service. Why would I come back here? if it snowed they'll probably tell me to play and make snow angles while I wait.  They have their policy and I have mine. When you offer no solution or feel I'm supposed to know your policy cause I guess I work there too is crazy. I will not spend my money here."

She never left us to just figure it, like most places do. The food was great. The drinks were good aa well (Henny Punch) The music was okay. (Being that it got later there was way more hip hop being played than expectedWill be back!!"
9/23/2019,1 star rating,"Adding on to review from Diamond B. Now Renee, what you are stating is by far the biggest lie I have ever heard. For one, we were never were seated at any table we waited outside for almost an 1hr and after waiting to put money into your establishment and your mouths, all I asked was to simply use your bathroom that would have taken all of 5 mins for me to come in and use it and walk out and still come back on line to wait. If anything I asked Sofia for the managers name because she told us 3 times that the manager would not come out to speak to me about using the bathroom at your establishment due to it being your company's policy, and that she does not come out to speak to anyone for things of that nature. We never came in, we actually left and took our money else where and we have videos and proof to prove that. Also since lying is your thing to make your business look so productive I will be making a review as well to the BBB so that you can truly understand my frustration and for future references when replying to a review to a former customer know how to speak to your guests, and not lie :) You have yourself a very blessed day ."

11/2/2016,5 star rating,Hookah and music are phenomenal! Food is traditional bar food but good experience. If you go please request tiana as your waitress best experience I had in my life with her!!
3/24/2017,5 star rating,I absolutely loved it here. I know a lot of people complain about making reservations at this location. It is relatively small but I had no problem getting in without a reservation on a friday night. I just wish this location was bigger and had a dance floor.
11/14/2016,3 star rating,"Waited about an hour outside for a table. We were meeting people there whose reservation was just 15 mins before ours; there were able to be seated before us. Once were we let inside, to wait some more, we asked if our small party could squeeze in with our friends' party since the table next to them was about to leave. The hostess said no because there were people waiting ahead of us. We found out the people ahead of us were a much larger party and would not fit in the two seats that we needed. As time passed, we could no longer watch the seats stay empty and sat down. The wait staff was amazing, kind and professional. Most of us stayed for 3 hours or so. The hookah was tasteful but the hose kept coming out. The food: small bites but tasty. The owner gave us all free shots for celebrating two birthdays. The music and vibe was awesome! Overall nice place but it doesn't make sense to allow reservations to be made if they cannot accommodate everyone. We will be returning but during the week. Never the weekend!"
12/11/2016,1 star rating,"Giving this place one star because there was no option to leave anything less! Website says Saturday after 8 PM reservations required. Walked in at 6:30 and denied a table, even though the place was nearly empty. Ended up walking out and attempting to get a reservation over the phone. Again, denied because they were ""at capacity""Finally found reservations available on opentable.com for about half hour later. When we walked in the hostess showed us to a small table directly behind her. When I explained we were there for dinner and that table would be too uncomfortable she rudely told us it was what opentable.com selected for us. We got up to leave and found her and a few other waitresses I guess discussing what had just happened without even offering a solution.. Total disappointment!"
3/23/2017,1 star rating,Just walked in and out of this place. When we arrived we were told you can't stand we were trying to determine if we were going to get a table. Then the lady rudely came over & said you can't stand by the bar. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! You can't treat people like that! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!
4/9/2017,1 star rating,Honestly the hookah here sucks and is over priced the food is okay and the drinks are alright definitely wouldn't recommend this place it's so many other locations in Manhattan that are so much better it's so not worth the reservation if you must smoke hookah In harlem just go down the block to Lenox sapphire
11/27/2016,3 star rating,"Delicious food, I got the sliders and Mac and cheese! Would def recommend the Mac and cheese! The drinks are little pricey in my opinion. Overall, a nice ambiance and one hookah lasted the entire time I was there. My waitress recommended the white gummi but I did not enjoy it. It tends to get crowded around 8pm just make sure to get a reservation to be seated with no problem!"
4/8/2017,3 star rating,"My first time In this spot decent, had trouble finding it without knowing the building number..mentioned my name for the reservation, WHICH was spelled all wrong..the lady at the front almost turned me away due to their error of misspelling!! I had to show my id, and they then apologized!!!..very small spot, relaxing, I was cold darn air was on blast..the food was bomb, drinks on point,  hookah was not strong the guys kept checking it to make sure it wasn't pulling harshly..vibrant, decor is nice..you must reserve in order to have a spot..wish it was bigger!!otherwise there are other hookah spots in Harlem that are also worth the try!"
1/26/2019,2 star rating,"So I went to Harlem Hookah for my birthday. Just a few people (5) and the service was HORRIBLE! The wait (in the cold) was ridiculous just for them to place us in front of the door, One waitress for what looks like the whole establishment so orders came very late or didn't come at all very pricey for mediocre drinks and hookah, only good thing was the wings WON'T BE GOING BACK AGAIN"
3/2/2019,1 star rating,"I went to Harlem hookah on Wednesday 2/27 and it was to celebrate a friend's birthday. First of all let's start with the bouncer, he was just flat out rude. It was freezing outside and he made sure to move as slow as humanly possible when getting a table. Only 4 were present but we were looking to seat 7 with no reservations and it's understandable that they wouldn't accept us unless the whole party was there so we decided to just seat the 4 right there. Upon getting seated we met our server and placed a pretty basic order, about 15 mins later we receive our hookah and apps I had only ordered a water from arriving and was trying to order another drink. After they dropped off our apps and hookah I assumed the server would return to see how everything was and ask if we needed anything .. he didn't .. we actually never saw him again. Our table had no utensils no plates no napkins just wings and quesadillas. I guess I was supposed to wipe my hands on my pants huh? I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited patiently when another server came and we asked him to grab small things like utensils and some drinks he told us, I kid you the F not ""I'm not your server guys"" I gave him a dead stare and told him to bring us our server. While we wait the ""birthday hookah"" we ordered was nothing shy of GARBAGE, listen I've been to plenty of hookah bars and even after 2 years they can not get this shit right, it was barely pulling, the flavor was all over the place etc. So now brings me to where my server STILL was nowhere to be seen, I pulled the manager aside and asked for utensils and plates and drinks once again and she handed us our items and reassured us the drinks would be sent over. About another 20 mins passed and still no drinks. Finally I recognized our server because like I said we saw him once and he was working the BAR and other tables. Look i was a server so I know those high stress high anxiety moments where you feel helpless so I empathized with him but it also reflected how poorly staffed the property was and where they fell EXTREMELY SHORT it was a Wednesday night and I can't imagine the service on a Saturday night. Period point blank is I didn't get my drink until about an hour and a half after arriving and I spoke with management and she apologized and discounted our bill but I wanted to share my experience."

I celebrated my birthday at Sunday brunch. The DJ shouted out my birthday and a few others that were celebrating too. The music had us dancing in our seats. Between the music, food and hookah I will definitely tell my friends to come to Sunday brunch. This Sunday Brunch is a Harlem gem."
10/30/2018,1 star rating,"Unfortunately, I cannot share in the glowing reviews of this establishment for the most absurd and unpatriotic reason ever. This past evening I attempted to patronize this establishment with my Air Force fiancé who had been deployed out of the country for the last two years. We were denied entry because they DO NOT ACCEPT MILITARY IDENTIFICATION!!! I was shocked.  I'm still trying to figure out how identification that is issued by the US military is insufficient; an identification that indicates a security clearance, but a state identification that does not provide similar assurances is. They can risk their lives to keep us safe but that ID/sacrifice means nothing to HARLEM HOOKAH. PATHETIC!!  While the business manager may think referring me to a policy justifies said policy she is incorrect. Just because it is written doesn't it make it logical or just. I would love to thank Harlem Hooker for its service but unfortunately for them that will NEVER happen. Beware servicemen, they may be grateful for your service but the identification associated with that sacrifice isn't good enough to get you in their front door. EXTRA PATHETIC!!!!"

I'm so mad I cannot remember her name but she was so attentive and amazing !!! The drive was well worth it. The chicken quesadillas were so juicy and huge portion. I had hookah flavor skittle and white gummy bear mixed. Soo good ! Also had fried Oreos. As well as a Harlem Marg frozen with mango flavor. Everything was so good and I will definitely be going back with out a doubt. Best service I've ever received Hands down !
3/29/2017,3 star rating,I've been here twice and both times I can say that they were severely under staffed. They foods not amazing but the calamari is different. The hookah was great. We had the birthday hookah and it was so nice and smooth. I would most likely be back on a late night when nothing else is open.
3/25/2017,1 star rating,Hi I came today as A walk in and the bouncer is telling me I can't get in because I have to reservations. Which is kind of Alarming because on the website it clearly say Friday and Saturday no reservations after 8pm. This is second time I have had an issue this is terrible customer . The bouncer name Clark would not contact the manager .

3/6/2017,2 star rating,"I heard from a friend that this place was great and that I should try it out. I was told to make sure to make reservations being that you need a reservation to enter after 8pm on the weekend. So my friends and I made 2 reservations since it was going to be 8 of us. Being that our number went from 8 to 6 they didn't allow them to keep the other reservation. I arrived after my friends and thought everything would be ok with me getting inside, instead I was told that the reservation was at capacity. I mentioned to the guy at the front that we had 2 reservations and I'm not sure how we could be at capacity, unbeknownst to me they cancelled the other reservation and put my 5 friends at 1 table. He said he saw that there were two reservations and said that my friends had extra people because there were 8 people at the table, which was a complete lie. I contacted my friends and they had to beg and plead for them to let me inside the establishment to wait for them to settle their bill because it was freezing outside and your staff didn't seem to care about that or that there was some confusion with the reservations. Upon entering I could see that it was not packed and there was an empty table and space at the bar. In fact the manager came and removed the reserved sign off a section at the bar. I was never offered a seat they wouldn't even allow me to have a drink at the bar while I waited for my friends to figure out the situation. I understand you guys have a strict policy to prevent overcrowding and to give a comfortable experience to your patrons however there was more than enough space  for me where my friends were sitting. What I also felt was insulting was that there were people coming in who were joining another party that was at capacity but were still allowed inside without a hassle. They were even seated next to their party at someone else's table. Not sure if they're regulars or friends of the staff but I was left standing by the door for over 30min. I don't understand why you would chose to treat your customers, or better yet potential customer being that I was denied service, that way. I am completely turned off by Harlem Hookah's lack of customer service. I will never return and I will definitely dissuade others from going as well."
3/1/2017,5 star rating,"I loved this place! My friend and I were here visiting from California and decided to come to HH. What a great decision that was! Thanks to Chelsea and Teanna, our first visit was poppin'!!! We came back a few days later and Paul and Nicole took great care of us too. The vibe here is so welcoming and everyone is just having a good time but the staff make it that much better!!! Whenever I come back to Harlem, I'm for sure stopping by!!!"
2/21/2018,1 star rating,"Went in there Sunday and ordered a pitcher of red Sangria. The waiter told us it was 35 dollars then came back and said 45 dollars. We agreed that we still wanted it. Ok so he brings out the pitcher of Sangria and it had no fruits in it. I said to him ""where are the fruits?"". He said ""oh I can go put fruits in it if you want"" I said ""yes we would like fruits"". He goes and grabs fruits and starts putting them in the pitcher with his bare hands. Didn't use any type of utensil to pick up the fruit or put it in the pitcher. He starts stuffing the fruits inside the pitcher. He did this all within eye sight of us like this is a normal thing. Meanwhile before this we had seen him collect money from other patrons ,he even touched the computer screen to put our orders in and the kicker is while he was pushing the fruit in the pitcher ofcourse his hand would get wet and he would lick it and then go back to putting fruit in. I was so grossed out I asked to speak to a manager . The manager Fannie came and just looked dumbfounded. She didn't apologize or anything. Another employee seen it and kept apologizing,by that time I was over it and left. I will not be returning there anymore."
2/23/2017,4 star rating,"I recently moved to the neighborhood and finally had the chance to grab a drink here. It was fantastic on many levels - the first of which was the incredibly friendly and attentive bartender Kenya. She has all the skills of a perfect bartender, and kept everyone at the bar happy. I went alone at around 6pm and it was already hopping. I made instant friends with the other customers, almost all of whom were couples and groups, because this place just has a great vibe. Definitely will become a regular!"
11/7/2016,5 star rating,"Went to this place last night (Sunday). Loved it. Didnt realize I was sitting next to The owner, who was smoking his hookah relaxing. He was extremely nice and approachable. Food was great and so was the White sangria. S/o to Jayde who was our bartender she hooked those sangrias up. She is a very Pretty girl and Extremely cool.  Oh and I can't forget the decor. The owner and his wife did an amazing job! White and grey marble counter top at the bar was very pretty. Chandeliers as well. Finally a hookah spot in Harlem!!! I don't have to keep traveling to Queens now. The owner said he gets a great crowd Wednesday thru Sunday! They've only been open a month and the place seems to be doing very well. Seen slot of familiar faces and friends. The place gets packed around 9. They are open 4pm to 4am every single day. Kitchen closes at 3:30. Fridays and Saturdays table reservations are required but the bar is open based on availability"
1/22/2017,5 star rating,I had so much fun here. The atmosphere was cool. We went on a Saturday night we had a reservation. The margarita was amazing and we had the birthday hookah with patron. I had chicken quesadillas which were good as well. My only complaint is that the space is small. Overall great time
4/29/2017,5 star rating,Harlem Hookah is flat out amazing!!!  Has a great vibe.  The lounge looks amazing.  The employees are great also.  So many different flavors for the hookah. If you go it's a must you have the wings (any flavor)!  Delicious!!!
11/2/2018,1 star rating,I would give Zero stars... This place discriminates against military and anyone that is not American born or has a state issued unexpired license.  They do not accept military identification or green cards.  Why is it that this place needs to scan your identification what are they collecting and why?
9/8/2018,4 star rating,I had a great time at this place I've been here multiple times and i love it. Sometime you have to wait in line outside if you don't make reservations but nothing too major. But overall I have a good experience everytime I go here
3/4/2017,1 star rating,"Yea this place is a no for me. I do understand the importance of reservations but just put this as a date night place. Even when I made a reservation I told the manager I just had one person who I haven't seen in years that just wanted to come by and say hi and she did not budge. The seat next to me literally was littered by coats, which leads me to say you really need a cost closet. I came here before and it was alright. There's tons of more accomodating places where the speaker isn't blasting in your ear in the Heights and Inwood.  We ended up going to The Kiosk which was very accommodating and did the actual thing I asked this manager to do which was can I have one person join. Cheaper and more chill. I gave this place maybe a year or so. Many have come through Harlem and many have gone due to minor things like this."

2/2/2017,1 star rating,"closed my old yelp account so have to repost from 10/28/16First and foremost let me start by saying this, Don't Believe The HYPE! Where do i start? Let me start by saying something nice. I was very excited about coming here, heard it was a cool new hookah lounge in Harlem and several people told me about this new spot, so why not check it out. Inside is very nice with chandeliers and white sofas, real cute. I had reservations for friday 10/28/16 for 11:45pm coming all the way from Brooklyn. Mind you, it was nippy that night. Me and my crew reached about 20min early. Do you know that they let us wait OUTSIDE in the cold until it was 11:45pm just to go inside? This is not a club! Anywho, when 11:45pm came, we had to sit outside even longer because they didnt have a table ready for us!! Yea, you know I'm pissed! No apologies no consideration whatsoever! Anyhow its 11:50pm and we finally get in. There better be some pot of gold in there somewhere the way these people went on. So...... you cant stand unless you using the bathroom or coming inside or leaving out. The tables are so close to eachother you might as well hug the person sitting next to you. The hookah was weak, had to send mine back and even on the 2nd round i wasn't impressed. Waitress said, ""hi, do y'all know what y'all want""? Really? How about, ""Welcome to Harlem Hookah, is this your first time here""? Another thing, my bill included the gratuity in the total. it was a party of 3 not 10 and the service wasn't good. for a new business that have A LOT to work on. Anyhow, moral of the story is, you couldn't pay me comeback here! That is all!"

2/9/2017,2 star rating,"manager was very unprofessional and rude ! I had a birthday event there had reservation at 11:30 .. I arrived at 11 pm and they told me my reservation was cancelled ! How Is that possible ? I also dropped off balloons earlier to be set up and called an hour before I was arriving for them to put it out ... I got there and there were no balloons out ..  when I brung it to the managers attention she replied ""no one told me"" I had to remind them which was annoying ... After we were done with our wings we ordered , the waitress walked past us a couple times and failed to even check on us , we had to flag her down numerous of times for more drinks and just to clear the table of the food we had just finished . A friend I knew who wasn't with our party was there and stopped by my table to say hello , the manager then comes over basically asking isn't he with another party and curious to why he was sitting with us . I asked what's the problem and she states ""oh nothing , I was just asking"" making us feel a bit uncomfortable . Besides that the vibes, music and hookah was cool"
2/6/2017,1 star rating,"Lol! When your running a business and a potential customer is not happy with how your employees handle themselves, disrespecting them on yelp is NOT the way to go! Clearly, customer service is not a priority to Harlem Hookah and they will NEVER GET MY MONEY! I've worked in customer service in every capacity, if I may not like what a customer may say about my business on the yelp, I won't go back and forth with negativity. That's not solving anything! Seems like immature, inexperienced people working at Harlem hookah. Let this end this now and be clear that perception is important and how the security guard that night talked to me was beyond rude and disrespectful and uncalled for! Regardless of you agree, I'm a potential customer. You need me WAY MORE THEN I NEED YOU! Always remember that Harlem Hookah! At the end of the day, it was light in the bar, I didn't have a reservation and the security guard was very dismissive and condescending to me. I wont take back what I said about the young people in the bar that probably doesn't understand the concept of tipping and using legitimate credit cards. It's true and you know it."
10/16/2016,1 star rating,"My friend and I went here on Friday at around 10pm just for a few drinks and hookah, we had dinner earlier so, we were interested in seating at the bar. It was a nice crowd, not that busy but chill. I can tell that this place is starting to become ""mixi"" bougie but, no real money in the room.  Young immature scammers that like to stunt on IG and Snapchat who don't tip the servers but expect exceptional service!  Now, I noticed all this behavior while standing outside the bar and was hesitant to go in but, I had a friend in there already. So, the bouncer tells me that they are only taking reservations all at this time..... WHAT! It's wasn't that busy in there, I have a friend already in there and we didn't want a table! The bouncer had a nasty attitude and I was so annoyed I spent my money elsewhere. This is a new establishment in the neighborhood and this is how they start to treat and act????!!!  I'm applauded and will never return!"
2/6/2017,1 star rating,"Okay so let's start off with the fact the staff is extremely rude and dismissive. Upon arriving they make you stand outside and wait even after a reservation, it's clearly not crowded but I stood outside for nearly 10 mins freezing pleading to just sit down. Then the music was horrible and out of date. The food was not great and the drinks were watered down. A glass of wine was a drop, the only thing that was good was the hookah. However we ordered the birthday hookah and they brought it so quickly I couldn't film it. Also there were balloons personally purchased and given to the venue for our reservation table, but nothing was set up. It was just a rude unorganized mess! Now the bill, $300 because the gratuity was 60$ alone which I really did not feel she deserved due to her rude and poor service. This place is really regular not worth 300 ever."
2/5/2017,4 star rating,"First off, this is a beautiful establishment. I was a little put off by a couple of things. One thing being that I was left to wait outside in the snow for the rest of my party. There was a snow storm so it wasn't extremely crowded. I thought that having me wait in the snow was a bit rude, especially since they were only excepting guest with reservations. But I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Once my party did arrive, we were seated immediately and the service was OK. We placed or drink orders to have the waitress come back 10 minutes later to ask, ""what did you guys order again? I forgot"". That took me by surprise because I swore she logged it into an IPad or something. Still that didn't upset me. She was sweet and attentive from there on out,  so I looked passed that. We each ordered 2 drinks. And a 2 rounds of botton shelf rum shots...We ordered a hookah with a the pineapple top and gummy bear and blue mist flavoring. We loved it.    We were a party of 4, and only 2 of us ordered food which were  2 orders of wings and the mac attack (which were not as cheesy as the IG pics). Our bill with tax and gratuity was $350-400.  A little expensive but we enjoyed ourselves. I would go back for happy hour. Hopefully it won't be as pricey. PS. The bathroom mirrors are DOPE. Check them out if you visit."

Most importantly the birthday girl was super satisfied! Bill was a few hundred & worth it! Love this place!!!!!  Will definitely visit again! Absolutely no complaints. :-)
2/5/2017,1 star rating,Trash!!! Got invited to a party and when I gotto the door I was denied but they claimed it was full to capacity. When we walked passed it was empty. Don't go here go downtown to the hookah bars that dont give you a hard time.

2/4/2017,2 star rating,"Where do I start? I had high hopes for this establishment and I was let down. First, when I arrived myself and other people were made to stand outside on line in the cold. The person at the door did not give us any indication about how long the wait would be and he ghosted. I was there for a party and texted my friend, he came outside and collected me. The other people had to wait outside for quite some time.Now I have read comments from HH where they say that the wait outside is necessary for safety reasons. I find this hard to believe, but if this is the case it would be useful to share this info with your patrons instead of literally leaving them out in the cold.Second, I ordered a drink and twenty minutes later it still had not arrived. Sangria just does not take that long especially when it's not crowded. I noticed later on when I went up to the bar that was not crowded to order a drink that service was snails pace slow. It seemed as though there was no urgency to take my order. Third, a person in our party was told that she could not come into the bar from that line outside because our area was too crowded, she asked if she could just go to the bar to buy a drink for the bday boy and she was allowed to, however, at the bar she was then told that she couldn't buy a drink and had to get it from the server because she was part of our party. Makes no sense. If she is not allowed to stay because our area was too crowded, how was she supposed to wait to order a drink from our server?All in all the evening was filled with hiccups. As a resident of Harlem I always want to support businesses in Harlem, but sometimes it really is difficult.Had to edit my review since Tiffany from HH replied to my review. I don't know who is Yvonne is, you assumed incorrectly. My review is based on my experience alone and wasn't posted to coordinate with anyone else.I will be more than happy to pass on the information, please provide an email address as I don't want to put my friend's personal information on Yelp."

The hookah wasn't good tho, and it didn't last long and we had the pineapple head and ice hose. So they should definitely look into fixing the hookah to make it taste better and last longer with out the harshness or coal taste. The music was nice too it was a mix of R&B and hip hop. We came here after dinner so we didn't try the food. I'll try them out again but it's not in the front of my list. Also it was a Thursday around 7 o'clock when we went so the next time I'll come later and on the weekend and maybe it'll liven up a bit."
1/30/2017,2 star rating,"First of I would like to say that I am a frequent customer of this establishment and have been here quite a few times since it has opened. Never had any complaints before this, Love the decor and the service and the crowd it pulls in.. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. My last two experiences here was the absolute worse.. With a reservation I waited 45minutes (unacceptable) And not only that but the bouncer was letting others in with no reservation at all. All Awhile telling me and my party there was no tables available, But when we finally did get inside the same guys with no reservation were at table. Once I seen this me and my party was completely turned off and just ended up leaving. I'm assuming he was only letting people in that he personally knew. But it was completely unacceptable. My second experience with a reservation made also.. I was told that it was a party going on with no outsiders so me and my guest would not be able to get in. Once again disappointed, I proceeded to show my reservation confirmation after being told I couldn't have made one for this particular night. Needless to say we ended up leaving. I haven't been back here since because of these two incidents, customer service means a lot to me in any establishment I go to. And I was not pleased at all."
1/23/2017,1 star rating,"Unfortunately beautiful place, but unpleasant.  I went on a Sunday night with friends and one from out of town.  We were told by the hostess that we had to wait, which wasn't a problem.  The problem is we were told to wait outside.  Its winter not summer.  I asked if we can go to the bar, she said theres not enough seats and you cannot stand.  It was 4 of us and I saw at least two seats, but I didn't even bother to look on the the other side.  I was turnt off.  She was dismissive and nonchalant which was even more upsetting.  She didn't even tell us how long the wait would be and we were the only ones waiting.  I am expected to go outside in 30 degrees weather and wait for how long!? I spoke to a manager she told me the hostess could of been better.  I just left no reason to stay, if it was summer no problem, but its lack of customer service. Why would I come back here? if it snowed they'll probably tell me to play and make snow angles while I wait.  They have their policy and I have mine. When you offer no solution or feel I'm supposed to know your policy cause I guess I work there too is crazy. I will not spend my money here."

1/19/2017,1 star rating,"DO NOT GO TO HARLEM HOOKAH IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PARTY! Initially the manager Tiffany was very helpful and makes you feel like you will be taken care of. Then when you actually show up don't call her because she will be in her office ignoring your phone calls. The food was not good, you're better off going to Manna's before you get there. The most important thing I want to let you guys know is they don't have their Cabaret license! Which basically means no dancing. The bouncers literally grabbed me to prevent me from dancing and said I could be kicked out smh. You are better off looking for a better place to celebrate your event. The only positive is that the hookah was good and they let you cut cakes without cake fees. Overall horrible experience and they will never get a dime from me again. They wouldn't get one star from me... Yelp won't let me take it back."

1/8/2017,3 star rating,"Went here on a Tuesday evening about 7:30/8pm, good music  and this Place has cool mellow vibes. So my mistake was I didn't check the menu before coming because I was really hungry. I know other lounges to have more selection of food varieties but this one get had just simple appetizers. So word to the wise, if you are starving do not come here first, go eat and then come here after! LolAnyway food was cool, hookah was cool and service was good. Bouncer, hostess, and waitress all polite. So it was a total of 3 of us and:6 drinks, (3 henny rum punches and 3 rum punches) a pineapple head hookah, (blu mist flavor) and 3 appetizers later, (buffalo wings, calamari and chicken quesadillas) the damage was $Somewhere around $200-230 I believe. Taxes AND 18% gratuity was already included. I think they charged us incorrectly to be honest. I mean being that we didn't get anything THAT stellar and extraordinary from here, I would say over priced! If you break it down that's 1 appetizer, 2 drinks per person and we all shared a hookah. Lol, sorry for the. Real down but as I'm typing this I can't believe it. Now again with taxes and tip that's about $73 a head.... for what? Lol anyway Be forewarned: they DO NOT take any type of card payments without a chip embedded in the card! I repeat they DO NOT take a card payment without a chip embedded in the card!! I get that it's for those lame ass scammers who can't get a real job and make real money but it's kind of a drag. MCU happens to be a NYC based bank that doesn't have chips in their cards, (yet-2017) and they wouldn't take it as a payment. Like what if that was legit the only card we had? They need better ""software fraud detection"" for their system or whatever other companies use so they don't take the ""L"" when a scammer hits. Would I come back? Hmmm, maybe! But only if I already ate, had a slight buzz and just wanted to smoke some hookah n listen to music."

12/5/2016,5 star rating,"Harlem Hookah is AMAZING! Celebrating my birthday here was a great decision! I wanted to choose a place that offered good music, good food, great drinks and of course Hookah! I booked a very large reservation and I wanted to make sure that everything would go smooth for the night. They are very strict with reservations on the weekend, which is a plus for me! I purposely told my guests to be there a half-hour before my actual reservation because we could not be seated if everyone was not in attendance. Thankfully, more than half showed up on time and we were seated right away. The food was delicious, the drinks were great and the hookahs were awesome. I love that they came around to our table several times through the night to refill our hookahs, without us having the ask. The owner even came by at one point to refill one of our hookahs. I love that the owners are very involved and helpful. Last but not least, I must commend the staff for doing an excellent job. It's not easy serving a table of 20, especially when everyone is on their third drink LOL. Tiffany was very helpful in providing all of the necessary details and information for me to book the reservation. It was also nice to meet her in person at the restaurant. Our waitress Briana was excellent. She was very attentive throughout the entire night and made sure we were all satisfied. Mitchell also was excellent and helped Briana throughout the night. There were a few others that helped out and took pictures for us. Thank you Harlem Hookah for a great night. I will be returning soon!"
12/21/2016,1 star rating,"So disappointed with my experience here. I never got to make it inside but the bouncer and mangers on duty were so disgusting. My friends and I made reservations for 9:30, half of the party arrived and they made us wait outside in the freezing cold for the other half to arrive, the other half were running a few minutes late due to traffic but the bouncer said he put it in their system (little tablet) that half the party has arrived and he did express that the reservation would be canceled after 10 minutes, we agreed and let our friends know. They made it within the 10 minutes, he asks for our IDs, goes inside for 1 minute , comes back out and tells us our reservation was cancelled... how???? How could it be canceled after you told us to make sure our party was there within 10 minutes?? They apparently couldn't do anything about it either. THEY DID NOT EVEN TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE! I Will never try this place again or recommend it. It's a shame, ruined my friends birthday plans."

A couple of friends and I arrived at around 3:30pm looking for a place to enjoy some music, hookah and drinks. We were immediately asked where was our reservation which as per the website is only required on Saturdays and Sundays after 8PM. We informed ""D"" we didn't have one. Her attitude immediately escalated and she proceeded to state I don't have a table for 7. Which was interesting because the place was half EMPTY!  Eventually she found us a table and fortunately we had Bella as our server. She is the only reason I gave this review a star. My suggestion if anyone is planning on coming here DONT!"
10/22/2017,4 star rating,"On a random night me and a friend stopped in. We got there around 2:30am which usually is still live yet the bouncer claimed they weren't letting anyone else in. I immediately told him how I had heard good things about this spot and how we had came all the way from Brooklyn just to check it out. He let us is which was really neat of him, I know he was probably following protocol and I appreciate that he bent the rules for us :).. so boom it was def packed.. nice crowd, nice vibe. Music was definitely on point and it wasn't too loud where u had to scream at each other to hear what the other person was saying. We was seated by the kitchen, usually I complain about things like that but it was all full everywhere else so we was cool with it. I didn't order food, tbh I was full and came for the hookah and drinks and I wasn't dissapointed. Me and my friend had patron margaritas and we ordered a hookah. I like that they use the big hookahs and not those cheap small ones that the coal goes out after like 20 puffs. Overall nice experience, the staff was friendly, we definitely would go back."
2/2/2018,1 star rating,The service is awful. You arrive 15 minutes early for your reservation and you are made to stand outside; Never mind the below freezing temperatures outside. Your patronage should not be inconvenienced because your establishment is small.
5/23/2017,1 star rating,"Harlem Hookah is the worst!! Every time I come here they have a fake Hollywood red rope outside blocking people from coming in. Ive came twice now and could not gain entry, for no reason other then the establishment pretending to be exclusive. Don't waste time and energy in a place that thinks your money is no good. I will gladly go to another hookah spot on seventh! Thank you I will not be coming back here.. this place sucks"
1/13/2018,1 star rating,"So unprofessional, got to the place They would not hold my cake for mother party had to stand in the cold for a hour waiting for everyone to arrive, servers are very rude, the website say one thing when it's a total different story , manager and assistant manager very is very rude ! I walked out and left my deposit i was so disgusted and will not return!"
9/21/2017,1 star rating,First off let me say the atmosphere is beautiful that's about it! The manager at this place is HORRIBLE (ms.nicole) her attitude is by far the worst and the reason why me and my friends will not be returning! I know business will get slow because of her what manager brings out a flashlight and go through the customers food that was so embarrassing and uncalled for my order was completely wrong I was very polite to her she storms out the kitchen with a flashlight in front of other customers telling me my order is not wrong and her body movement was like she wanted to attack  I can't get over that she is disgusting and need to be retrained! As far as the waitress I can't remember her name I think one was Tatiana and she was training someone they were very sweet and polite and helped us through the confusion keep up the good work ladies and this is not the first time the manager did this people warned me about her and I seen for myself that day will never come back here if it was the last place on earth!
8/11/2017,1 star rating,"Came here for a birthday celebration, Paty of 25. Was told at the door (not when we made the reservation) that they have a strict ""everyone here"" policy or no seating. 15 people  showed up by 10pm and still nothing. By 10:20 the initial 25 had arrived but still we had to wait for them to set up. When we got in, nothing was ready and they sat us cramps din the corner of the space. This is a hookah bar with no couches, that require people to sit to be served. Then they started turning away members of party who arrived later (aka normal NY club time). They were making up policies on the spot about cards for food and hookahs etc. Which was confusing and annoying. Not a good venue for a big group at all. There was hardly anyone inside jut they wouldn't give us ""reserved"" tables (even though our party only continued to expand and we took over the space). Terrible service. Never again."

10/22/2017,2 star rating,"Yesterday my friends and I were looking for a fun/chill place to hang out on a Saturday. We stopped at Harlem Hookah around 3:45pm and were greeted by a quite unfriendly hostess (I think her name is Dee). We were unaware a reservation was required (although the website says its required after 8pm). It wasn't what she said about us not having a reservation, we understood, it was the tone, facial expression and body language that was off putting. She did end up seating us and we were having a good time eating, drinking, some were smoking hookah. Another friend ended up showing up and wanted to join our table. We asked our waitress, Bella if we could add another chair and she did. When our friend arrived she was stopped at the door by the hostess. Confused I walked over to see what was going on. She told us she did us a favor by seating us without a reservation and she couldn't add another person. My friend offered to sit at the bar and she said she needed to talk to the manager. The manager, Fannie comes over with arms folded and a don't f with me face and states ""I'm not getting a ticket for nobody"" and walked over to the table to remove the chair. She then comes back and says she will make an exception but we have to squeeze on the couch. We didn't want the negative staff to affect our time so we continued enjoying ourselves in an uncomfortable seat.As the time went on the resturant began to empty out.  We couldn't understand why they wouldn't offer to relocate us to a larger area to accommodate our group - it wasn't like we weren't spending money. Overall we enjoyed our time and felt Bella, the security guard and bartenders were great! I hope for the longevity of this business, the hostess and manager are taught customer service skills. Again it is not WHAT they were saying it was HOW they were saying it."
10/2/2017,1 star rating,"The food was good but they made an error of charging my card twice. When I reached out I was directed to F. Fernandez. This individual was unbelievably rude. Very unprofessional. I was thinking of celebrating my birthday at this location. However, this experience has made me change my mind. Stay away unless you like to be disrespected."
10/20/2016,5 star rating,"First time there and had a wonderful time.  It's a little small, but we enjoyed ourselves.  Loved the Code 69 hookah, but they need to do something about the air which blows on top of the hookah and burns the coals faster.  They also put too many coals on at a time.  The need better tips and a larger liquor selection.  Nonetheless, I would definitely go back"
8/13/2017,1 star rating,They are very rude the mgmt there is very aggressive for them to be a black establishment they don't treat black ppl very nice first and last time going there
1/21/2017,1 star rating,"woulda love to post a review but my gf and i were not let in because there were ""two parties reserved."" strange because there was line of people when we arrived however when we passed by the line several minutes after it was gone.  maybe next time i guess..."
11/12/2018,1 star rating,"this was my review that was from Resy but, the site won't let you post the review no matter what length so, i took my talents to yelp what went wrong you ask? well, let's see...made a reservation for a party of four, at 6:30pm on a Sunday. We arrived around maybe, 6:16pm and the security guard checked our ID's and said ""give me a second, i'll go get the hostess"". At a normal establishment, you'd think that this would mean you'd be getting seasted shortly or AT THE LEAST, allowed inside to wait because it's only damn near winter outside. Nope, not here. Instead you wait outside while the hostess dances around, texting on her phone, chatting it up with all of everyone inside. Not to mention, it was dead in there. So there's actually no reason why the hostess was so very ""booked and busy"".  By now, frustrated as hell, we ask the bouncer what the hold up was and even he was saying how disrespectful what was happening was. By now the time is 6:36pm, asked to speak with a manager, takes him an additional several minutes to come out and I explained the situation and then the hostess comes out, says nothing to us...STILL all while the manager is being very combative with me telling me ""we don't seat guest before their reservation time"" meanwhile it is now after our said reservation time and yet still, no one even bothered to come outside to tell us anything in regards to anything. Long story long, we did not end up staying. When this place first opened service was phenomal. As time went by, service has declined IMMENSELY. You want to try so hard to support local black businesses but it's truly hard when they do not value their customers with respect and exude the worst attitudes possible. Please do not waste your time coming here unless, you could care less about being treated the way many of the reviews say this establishment treats their customers."
7/22/2017,5 star rating,"Went for Brunch with my friend and was very impressed ! Was greeted with excellent service and my server Shauna was pleasant and attentive. The food was decent I had omelet with home fries and bacon. My bacon Was well done, not to my request but overall good meal. My friend had grits with shrimp and she loved it ! We enjoyed a mango sangria as well, and if we didn't have business to attend to we would have gotten unlimited drinks. Before my friend and I departed we were greeted at our table by the General Manager who was friendly and welcomed us back. I Definitely, will be back again. Loved the vibes !"
3/18/2017,2 star rating,"I expected more. Especially for the prices. Yes you have to wait outside. The ambiance was nice, the place is small. Anyway my friend had her bday party with 15 guests. She paid for a table in advanced. When we got there, there were not enough seats for 15 people. The female waitress (can't remember her name) was very rude when we asked her about it. We were waiting for three more people and it was 14 minutes into our reservation, she pretty much said that's on them that they aren't here on time for a seat. What does it matter if my friend already paid for the table? And why wasn't enough seats ALREADY prepared in advanced? We talked to the female manager, who kindly helped us out and asked two other guests on the other side of the couch if they can move to another table so that we could fit our whole party. The waitresses and bartenders automatically get 20% gratuity so they probably don't care about customer service. There was a big burn hole on one part of the couch. The food was ehhh. Hookah ehhh. All in all I wouldn't return, there are better hookah places. For those prices you might as well go somewhere downtown."
1/19/2017,5 star rating,"This is my new favorite spot. The food is good, the service staff is friendly and customer service focused, the hookah is tasty. What more can you ask for?"
3/12/2017,5 star rating,"I've been here a few times now and it's been great so far. The food is good, the drinks are good, and the hookah was as well. They come around pretty often to check is the coal in the hookah is up to par. And the music keep the place live. I've only been been here on Fridays and Saturdays so it was the energy has been great."
6/11/2017,3 star rating,"Harlem Hookah delivers an overall solid experience for nightlife in upper Manhattan.I went with a party of six and though very polite the server forgot three of our orders.Also because of things like service fees it can get a little pricey with a large group, so be prepared for a hefty bill. Nonetheless, If your looking for a chill place in Harlem to hangout on the weekend this isn't a bad choice.The food is good and the music is ideal for this setting."
2/23/2017,5 star rating,"This is one of the best new lounges in Harlem! Incredible service, dope vibes, and the hookah/drinks are top notch. Special shoutout to Miranda the manager too for being so friendly and accommodating! I would def advocate for making a reservation Thursday through Sunday cause it gets super crowded. A++ to Harlem Hookah!"
2/6/2017,1 star rating,"Lol! When your running a business and a potential customer is not happy with how your employees handle themselves, disrespecting them on yelp is NOT the way to go! Clearly, customer service is not a priority to Harlem Hookah and they will NEVER GET MY MONEY! I've worked in customer service in every capacity, if I may not like what a customer may say about my business on the yelp, I won't go back and forth with negativity. That's not solving anything! Seems like immature, inexperienced people working at Harlem hookah. Let this end this now and be clear that perception is important and how the security guard that night talked to me was beyond rude and disrespectful and uncalled for! Regardless of you agree, I'm a potential customer. You need me WAY MORE THEN I NEED YOU! Always remember that Harlem Hookah! At the end of the day, it was light in the bar, I didn't have a reservation and the security guard was very dismissive and condescending to me. I wont take back what I said about the young people in the bar that probably doesn't understand the concept of tipping and using legitimate credit cards. It's true and you know it."
10/16/2016,1 star rating,"My friend and I went here on Friday at around 10pm just for a few drinks and hookah, we had dinner earlier so, we were interested in seating at the bar. It was a nice crowd, not that busy but chill. I can tell that this place is starting to become ""mixi"" bougie but, no real money in the room.  Young immature scammers that like to stunt on IG and Snapchat who don't tip the servers but expect exceptional service!  Now, I noticed all this behavior while standing outside the bar and was hesitant to go in but, I had a friend in there already. So, the bouncer tells me that they are only taking reservations all at this time..... WHAT! It's wasn't that busy in there, I have a friend already in there and we didn't want a table! The bouncer had a nasty attitude and I was so annoyed I spent my money elsewhere. This is a new establishment in the neighborhood and this is how they start to treat and act????!!!  I'm applauded and will never return!"
2/6/2017,1 star rating,"Okay so let's start off with the fact the staff is extremely rude and dismissive. Upon arriving they make you stand outside and wait even after a reservation, it's clearly not crowded but I stood outside for nearly 10 mins freezing pleading to just sit down. Then the music was horrible and out of date. The food was not great and the drinks were watered down. A glass of wine was a drop, the only thing that was good was the hookah. However we ordered the birthday hookah and they brought it so quickly I couldn't film it. Also there were balloons personally purchased and given to the venue for our reservation table, but nothing was set up. It was just a rude unorganized mess! Now the bill, $300 because the gratuity was 60$ alone which I really did not feel she deserved due to her rude and poor service. This place is really regular not worth 300 ever."
11/30/2018,1 star rating,"The service was abysmal. My party was outside and the rep took someone before us. I asked the bouncer what the issue was and how others were able to move in front and he responded that it wasn't his problem. He was extremely rude and the young lady was as well. If i could give them zero  stars,I would. This is unfortunate because I Patron this establishment and this is why, I am skeptical of devoting my energy to black owed businesses! As an individual that has a team and patrons businesses for my staff, I will NEVER patron this business again. I pride myself empowering and knowing that people of color can provide exceptional if not. Better service, and this was not the case. This was on November 30th. I am thankful that I did not indulge on the mediocre food and drinks here. Everywhere can show you a good time but it takes one time to never to return and encourage others to do the same. Blessings to them."
2/24/2017,3 star rating,"Hookah was ok I've had better, I only saw my waitress twice (we were there for 3hrs) and the price wasn't reasonable for the fact a fight broke out but the atmosphere was nice before all the craziness. They had good music"
2/18/2017,1 star rating,Don't go here the same night you make a reservation. For some reason their system does not sync up with open table the day of and they won't accept your reservation. The hostess was rude and did not seem to care about the fact that open table allowed us to make a reservation. Bad service.
3/1/2017,5 star rating,"I recently visited Harlem Hookah on Sunday, February 26 with three of my friends to bring in my birthday. First I want to say Chelsea our server was awesome! The food, drinks and hookah were excellent as well. As far as management she was very polite and professional and she made me feel like I'm always welcomed at her establishment. I think I found my new go to spot.thank you guys so much"
10/24/2016,2 star rating,"Let me be the first to say, I was really looking forward to this new hookah spot in Harlem.  It's a breath of fresh air because normally, I would have to go to Dyckman or LES - ABC City for hookah.  I stumbled upon this thru an ad on my yelp app, I clicked on it and decided to come here on Saturday night.  This is a reservation ONLY place.  I do feel that walk-ins should be available   I get why, the place is extremely small, however the decor was lovely, great ambiance, though the lights could be dimmed some.  The drinks could be better, very watered down.  They need a DJ, the iPod shuffle was not cuttin it.  The music should be louder, you can hear everyone's conversation.  I get that this place hasn't been opened a month, however some things are just common sense when opening a business."
10/23/2016,1 star rating,Sad to say it was the worse experience I ever had in a black owned business in harlem. After me and my sister ate drank and smoked hookah we were discriminated im guessing because we were dressed down and were told they wouldn't be able to take our card for payment. I then asked why is this there policy or did we get singled out. I stated how offended i was and how this policy should have been implemented at the beginning of me ordering. Its a shame in Harlem i get treated like this. Then ask why im so afraid to support a business in my neighborhood
7/29/2018,1 star rating,"I visited Harlem hookah for my sister's birthday and I wasn't pleased. The host at the door was very unpleasant. Her face screamed attitude. I told her I had a reservation for 6 people and she rolled her eyes and just began walking. No greeting, no smile, nothing. She was not welcoming at all. You would think they would hire someone nice and friendly who's going to try to bring people in not make them want to leave before sitting down. As we were seated our waitress greeted us with a smile and she was extremely nice!!! I seen her running around the entire time waiting all the tables by herself with a smile on her face. She could be the host and waitress!  That is the only good thing I could say about that place. Besides that the food was disgusting. None of the food was seasoned and it was so over priced. The place is a hole in the wall. Everyone was sitting on top of each other. Then we were rushed off our table by the nasty host who marched around the place with an attitude rolling her eyes. She came over even tho we were still ordering their nasty food and weak drinks and hookah she said you guys have to get up. We didn't even finish all we had but we were over that place anyway. Mind you they tell you that you have a 2  hour limit but we were there for an hour and was kicked out. Prior to my review I read reviews about this place and also heard about this place from other people and everyone has said the host has a disturbing attitude and the food and drinks are weak and overpriced. I was advised to not go to this establishment. But I tried it out only because from my knowledge it is a black owned business. I love to support my people but I didn't have a good experience. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would recommend Corner social (amazing food , good music, friendly staff) , Lenox saphire( hookah, drinks, amazing food)."
6/12/2018,1 star rating,"This place needs to be shut down immediately!!!! The manager is an extremely rude person not sure how the heck she even got hired to manage this place. I'm all about supporting local businesses especially blacked owned (if it even is), but this place here is definitely no longer on the list. The staff needs a training in customer service, like ASAP!!!! What kind of establishment lays down rules about what you can't do as soon as your seated, before even getting a menu to order food and drinks. (This one does). Also after the 2 of us were seated our friends stopped in to say hi, they decided to order food only to be told that we had to order another hookah to our table because it was now 5 people at the table. Our friends don't even smoke hookah, they came to say hi and also support local business. We kindly explained that they didn't smoke hookah and were still told that we needed to order a new one, not a refill but a whole new hookah!!! After attempting to speak with the manager, which did not go over well at all she was just rude and nasty soon as she came to our table. We left and will never come back to that place. I advise you do the same. Never go someplace to spend money only to get treated poorly, doesn't make sense. Sad to say this place is harlem. #closeharlemhookah #newmanagement@harlemhookah. Also the hookah wasn't even good!!!! WTF!!!!"
12/5/2016,2 star rating,"First I want to start with the positive and say the idea of this place is cool. The decor is nice and they play great music to satisfy everyone's musical taste buds. I visited on Saturday 12/3/16 and the experience could have been much better. The food was good but not original. The sliders taste like mini big macs and the sticky wings taste like Asian wings from BWW. We had a party of 11-12 and was accommodated within a reasonable time for us not having reservations (kudos for that), the waitress greeted us fairly quickly but we waited a long time for appetizers and hookah to come out and for someone to come back and check on us periodically. People that ordered things after us received things 1st. The waitress kept apologizing so we kinda felt bad and just tried to be patient since the problem may have been in the kitchen. Upon a few ppl leaving, there was a mix up with a beer that was ordered at the bar and not included as part of our bill. The bartender (don't know her name) brown skinned and a short hair cut reminded me about the beer and the person who ordered it. I expressed to her he paid for it and would ask him when he returned from the restroom. When he came out he said he had paid. I reiterated what he said to her again, and she then explained that the money he had originally given was not enough so she gave the cash back to him with a bill and because we were still eating, ""let him rock"". She NEVER said to him sir this wasn't enough, i attached the bill and the money back give it to me when you're ready. So he must have assumed it was change and never looked at it. So I said to her that should have been communicated and this is could have been avoided. Clearly this was all miscommunication but at this point I was beyond aggravated because this was over $8 after paying hundreds at our table. The bartender had an attitude while swiping my card. My friend came to ask what happened and as I am telling him the bartender chimes in and says ""the cursing is not necessary"" so that definitely ticked me off because no one was talking to her so I turned and said just that to her and we began arguing. I told her she was being very unprofessional and she kept going. Clearly, she was not afraid to get in trouble for acting this way regardless of she felt I was right or wrong.  After her talking tough and me becoming aggressive, she calls the security to have me escorted out.  Customer/patron service should always be an establishments priority. An employee should never conduct themselves in that manner. You can't offer A1 service with classless employees. I don't think I would ever return and will definitely spread the word."
3/7/2017,2 star rating,"They actually deserve one star but I'll consider how good the service was the second time around after my first horrible visit. Had a reservation for 1am. I get there with 4 out of 6 people and they wouldn't seat us unless the whole party was there. Doesn't majority rules? Anyway, the last two people come and suddenly they had nowhere for us to sit. I went inside to use the bathroom and it was more than enough room. Maybe it was because my friend started to tell them off after STANDING OUTSIDE FOR 45 MINUTES WAITING TO BE SEATED! They (lady/host at the door) was letting everyone and I mean everyone, in before us. Would they not let us in? If so, why not give an explanation instead of having us STANDING OUT IN THE COLD FOR 45 MINUTES!? So I finally ask in my most polite voice ever, are you even going to let us in? Mind you, hostess is dancing at the door entrance, right in front of us. Literally mocking me! Really? So around 2 o'clock, now an hour since we got there, the security says we might as well leave because we weren't getting in, which I totally figured. But why not say something sooner. I did not want to go back because somebody was taking me on a date I gave in. Second time around was cool. Won't ever go back after that"
6/12/2017,3 star rating,"Now, I wish I could give a higher rating, but this rating is more so about my experience with the manger rather than the venue or the support staff.  I decided to select this place for my graduation get together mainly for the decor and the location.  I've been here for happy hour which was a good experience.  I got to speak to the hostess that day to inquire about making reservations for a large party (20 ppl) for a graduation celebration.  The hostess told me the policy stating that a $100 nonrefundable deposit was required and in order to be seated the hostess stated that all or most of the party must be present, most meaning at least 15-16 of the party.  I verified with the hostess and spent time speaking to her that day and spoke with another hostess on the phone who stated the same information.   I finally decided to book reservations, I had to call to make the reservation over the phone and at this time I spoke with the manager Fany.  When we initially spoke I wanted to verify what I was told by the hostess, the manager informed me it was completely false!  She stated all of my party must be present, I told her I spoke with someone on 3 occasions and they told me the same thing on all occasions. She asked me who the person was so she can have a meeting with them, I wasn't about to cost no one their job. Although Fany wasn't necessarily rude, she was not compassionate and she did not have a welcoming attitude and she definitely was not accommodating.  She stated that even if 1 person was late or did not show up it will forfeit my reservation as she stated it becomes very booked or busy. I was disappointed and tried to explain to her that wasn't the information I was given prior and secondly you mean to tell me 1 person short you would ruin someone's plans and reservation.  Ultimately I did book because I liked the venue that much, however based on her demand and strict policy I was overwhelmed and stress about my reservation putting pressure on my guests I wanted to attend.  I even lied to guest that my reservation was earlier than it really was to assure everyone was present and on time, which I would've did in the first place but I was more diligent in my request than normal.  Fast forward to the day of, not only was my whole party not all present at the scheduled time, they did allow us to seat with 2-3 ppl not present at the time, they eventually came shortly after of course but the stress Fany put on me was for NOTHING!!!!! I had a good experience there but I was a little embarrassed about forcing everyone to rush and Informing them of the strict policy when ultimately there was no need to do so.  Not only that but the place was not ""busy"" with out my party being there.  We were the bulk of the clientele and they got a good amount of business from us. However I would never make reservations here again nor will I make recommendations to others.  I strongly suggest you don't stress your customers out or else you will lose business, be sure all staff are on the same page with the policies and you guys should rethink some of the policies for business and reputation."
2/9/2017,2 star rating,"manager was very unprofessional and rude ! I had a birthday event there had reservation at 11:30 .. I arrived at 11 pm and they told me my reservation was cancelled ! How Is that possible ? I also dropped off balloons earlier to be set up and called an hour before I was arriving for them to put it out ... I got there and there were no balloons out ..  when I brung it to the managers attention she replied ""no one told me"" I had to remind them which was annoying ... After we were done with our wings we ordered , the waitress walked past us a couple times and failed to even check on us , we had to flag her down numerous of times for more drinks and just to clear the table of the food we had just finished . A friend I knew who wasn't with our party was there and stopped by my table to say hello , the manager then comes over basically asking isn't he with another party and curious to why he was sitting with us . I asked what's the problem and she states ""oh nothing , I was just asking"" making us feel a bit uncomfortable . Besides that the vibes, music and hookah was cool"
