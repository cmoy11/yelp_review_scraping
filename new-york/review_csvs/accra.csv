I got the jollof rice which has rice and chicken. The curry sauce was extremely flavorful, rich, delicious, and even had a little kick of spice. The lunch serving I got was pretty big so I ended up saving it for lunch the next day. I highly recommend this place and will definitely return when I happen to be in the area!"
9/16/2021,5 star rating,I really enjoyed my meal here. It was a to-go order. I ordered the Wakeyy which was reallllyyyy good! They don't have indoor seating. Per the restaurant name it's Ghanaian food. The Shito hit the spot. They gave me so much food for $15 I had enough for two days.
12/17/2021,1 star rating,"Man, I took my family there tonight to show off Ghanaian food.... Man. Was embarrassed. Ended up with only this, see pic....needless to say, whole family clowned tf out of me. Oh well..... Ghana is still the best"
3/24/2022,1 star rating,Went to this restaurant to get Jollof rice and Suya and I was so disappointed. The jollof rice was cold and the suya was ice cold and hard as a rock. The fact that they served me cold food during the middle of the afternoon was not cool but I should've known better because they were warming up someone Grubhub order in the microwave. Definitely would not come back again.
4/25/2021,4 star rating,"I ordered my meal on the Yelp app on a Thursday afternoon. When I arrived, I didn't have to wait long for everything to be packed. This is my first time trying African food, so I wanted to try a bit of everything! I ordered the okra stew with rice fufu, jollof rice with goat, suya, sweet plantains, egusi with yam fufu, puff puffs, and butter bread. I really enjoyed the jollof rice with goat, it was so flavorful. I thought the goat was a bit dry but it went great with the rice. The suya reminds of a beef jerky, a bit tough and chewy but seasoned nicely. The suya comes with sliced onions and mixed peppers, this pairs very nicely as it gives the suya some freshness. I enjoyed the yam fufu with the egusi, there's a slight sweetness to the fufu which compliments the spices in the egusi. The okra stew was good, spicy for my taste but I think my taste buds are a bit sensitive. I removed one star because the puff puffs I received were so hard and dense. I squeezed the puffs together and could see the oil ooze out. I took one bite and had to throw it out, it was inedible. The butter bread was an entire loaf of Thomas Butter Top bread... It's good but I think a slice or two would have been fine for me, I'm not sure what to do with the rest of the loaf. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would come back for the jollof rice with goat, egusi, sweet plantains and suya."
9/3/2021,5 star rating,A+++ VERY GOOD OKRA SOUP WITH MIXED MEAT AND YAM FUFU! I have to yell it out because it is that good! Will be returning for Suya and Jollof rice.  Very traditional and not watered down.  The spices are just right! My meal lasted for 3 fulfilling servings and I will definitely be returning.  The women behind the counter are very respectful and courteous.  The line moves very quickly and they practice social distancing.
1/21/2022,5 star rating,Love it. The egusi soup is very good. I usually order the fried fish egusi since the mixed meat is very tough. Pretty good price too and I'm glad it comes with pounded yam.
6/5/2021,4 star rating,Food was super good. I got the chicken and Jill of rice. So good! My friend who is Ghanaian got something he calls waakye. I tasted his and it was excellent. I will definitely be back. I'm From the Caribbean and this food has amazing spices and just delicious
5/6/2021,5 star rating,"Wow was this food good. I got jollof rice, chicken with plenty of meat sauce, and a side of Mac. If you're only getting food for yourself a small is plenty, look at these portions! I can't wait to come back"
9/6/2020,5 star rating,"This place is awesome. For the best Ghanaian food, this is the spot. Some of my favorites are, Turkey tail with pepper, Okra Stew, Fried Whiting, and okra & goat stew. It is very over prices, but their food is amazing"
6/3/2020,5 star rating,"I ordered from here for the first and the food was pretty good. Delivery was less than 40 minutes and the portion sizes are large. I love African food and eat it whenever I can afford to. They are sort of pricey with barely any dishes under $10. We ordered Suya with plantain, egusi with goat and pounded yam and fish pepper soup with pounded yam. They had plenty of meat options which I loved because I normally eat my egusi with stock fish so it was great to try it with goat. Suya tasted like plain steak, wasn't my favorite dish from here but this won't discourage me from ordering again. The fish pepper soup was deliiiccciiiooouusss. One of my favorite dishes. I was expecting a whole fish but won't complain because it was so flavorful and filling. And meal came with a free soda. Win. Win. Win."
4/19/2020,4 star rating,"When the preening and posturing and general pretentiousness of the south-of-Central-Park Manhattan restaurant scene just gets to me, I head north to Harlem for some delicious, unfussy West African food. My experience at Accra was no exception. I was dining with 10 friends and had no ability to make a reservation beforehand (because this place is suuuuper cash). When I got to the restaurant, a staff member who was taking a break on the bench outside overheard my concerns (we were waiting for the rest of our party), and told us to hang on, he'd take care of things for us. He was able to convince some solo customers (they were regulars) at the largest table to move over to smaller tables, so we could have that table. Sigh....What hospitality.The food didn't disappoint either. My veggie friends loved mixing the Garri with various dishes such as the fragrant collard greens and the Waakey (rice and beans). I had a blast with my Jollof Rice (always a go-to) mixed with fish stew (forget the name). The portions were enormous, as expected, and everyone took home leftovers. The service wasn't amazing (I had to wait forever to flag down the one server manning the cafeteria line to grab some takeaway bags), but I've dealt with worse (re: any Chinese restaurant ever)."
7/3/2021,5 star rating,This location has the best food....the best value.....and one of the best take out food flavor(s) that I've ever tasted!!  Ty!! I usually try to stop by at least once a week!!
6/4/2020,5 star rating,"The environment of the restaurant is great, and the food is simply magical. I constantly order Jellof Rice, which is a delectable dish made or seasoned rice, with turkey and other delicious toppings. The rest of the menu is great, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in need of a  spicy, seasoned  meal!!"
3/1/2020,5 star rating,"So good. I've never been to Accra, but now I have to!I the Jollof Rice with chicken was fresh, a little spicy, and satisfying for a Sunday afternoon late brunch. They have so many meat and fish options. I will be back."
4/30/2021,5 star rating,"My first time having African food and clearly I've been missing out! This food was amazing! The jollof rice and chicken was so delicious. Perfect amount of spice and flavor, the egusi and fufu was delicious. Im so mad this is my first time having food from Accra, they have now set the bar high! The woman who helped me was very patient and kind. Highly recommend and will def return."
1/16/2019,4 star rating,This place is pretty awesome. The food was very good and the women working there were friendly and efficient. You line up cafeteria-style and choose your food and you can then either dine in or get it to go. The dining space is not fancy but it is a decent size kept clean as I saw them cleaning the tables pretty quickly. We chose to eat a little there and buy to go as well.The star here is surely the food. If you've never tried west African food you are in for a treat. My husband is Nigerian and we devoured the jollof rice and wished we had bought more. This is our second time here and I'm certain we will return.
12/12/2019,3 star rating,"Fast casual buffet style west African food. I came here after missing traditional Ghanaian food from my summer in Ghana and was pleased with the local offerings: jollaf rice, stew, waakye (pronounced wah che), plantains, & Koko! Being vegan can be hard to eat Ghanaian food, but you totally can if you opt for the rice & beans in waakye, sweet plantains, fried yams, black eyes beans. If you go for breakfast get Koko which is a fermented spicy millet porridge. They also make kose which is fried black eyed bean cakes but only during Ramadan season.The pricing is pretty high for what you considering we came to Harlem for tasty cheap food and it's priced like a bychloe ($14 for a bowl of rice and beans + plantains). We also noticed that even though the name says ""Accra"" which is the capital of Ghana the food offered was a variety of west African countries (mac n cheese?). I'd love for them to offer joeh (peanut butter dessert balls) or azigoqui (beans, palm nut oil, gari, & plantains). Overall, you certainly get a good fix for your Ghanaian cravings here and really happy with with they did have. It's just hard trying to meet the standards of what you ate in the local country itself. I'll venture out to the Bronx and East Harlem to try a couple more spots and will be back during Ramadan to try my favorite Kose."
3/30/2021,5 star rating,"The kindness of the people that work here was rivaled only by the food which was FABULOUS. I am half Ghanaian but did not grow up regularly eating Ghanaian food. My friend has always said she wanted to try Ghanaian food so we made the trek to Accra. We had no idea what to order and were so impressed by the warmth with which they welcomed us. The owner let us try a little bit of everything. Having tasted everything on the menu I can tell you that you really cannot go wrong with anything here - absolutely everything was rich, flavorful, and delicious. And the portions are massive. I do not live in Harlem but this is the kind of place worth traveling for and I will definitely be back!"
2/21/2021,4 star rating,"I tried the fish stew with fufu which was tasty but pricey.  Menu states $14 and they charged me $16 at register.would go again for only rice, and stew."
8/10/2021,3 star rating,"This restaurant is one of my favorite when it comes to African dish. However, if you're willing to try out African food, better not go alone but visit with a regular customer because they don't seem to welcome first timers. The workers can be impatient yet slow, easily disrespectful, and you usually have to wait in line for a couple of mins even when it's empty."
4/1/2021,2 star rating,Fried fish was delicious but the soup was to spicy. Wasted my money Bc I couldn't eat it.
3/30/2018,4 star rating,"I love me some jollof rice with stewed meat. Unfortunately for me, I live in New Orleans and do not have ready access to Ghanaian food. So on this last trip to NY, I insisted on having Gh food before leaving. We made it all the way to Harlem from Jersey City just for me to get some jollof. But K wasn't mad once he tried his pepper soup. He doesn't tend to eat spicy food in public because he sweats a lot but he went in with his soup and seemed to really enjoy it. I got the fried stew along with jollof rice, and some shito as well. My only regret is that I didn't eat there earlier in the trip so I could've taken the leftovers with me."
8/24/2017,5 star rating,"Salivating. It's real. Authentic food from Ghana. This place deserves all the stars. Especially the service provided by Davina. Wow. I felt like I went home to see family after 10 years with all the love. It was my first time. She went ahead and got to know my taste buds with a few questions, grabbed 5 forks and spoons of food for tasting. Generous portions too! And boy we're all of them delicious!!!! I wanted a piece of everything. Oh, but I'll be back!!!The lamb is delicious. I mean everything!! But I do have a low tolerance for spicy foods. It did limit me to a large variety but I wasn't disappointed. The jaloff is great! I can't stop raving about this place. I've already told 10 friends and I just had it this evening. Just!! Stop by. You won't be disappointed."
7/10/2021,3 star rating,I had the okcra soup with fufu which was flavorful & soo good I slurped every bite. When I ordered it was late that I didn't get much choice of meats because everything was almost done or just bits of bone. There was only one woman taking cash & preparing food with out changing gloves which peeved me out.
3/4/2020,5 star rating,"I Came in to a wonderful atmosphere with all types of  delicious aromas. Amazing service as soon as I walked in. I had an idea of what I wanted but couldn't remember exactly what. They helped me figure it out and I couldn't wait. As soon as I got to my car I had to start to demolish that plate. I ordered Suya, Jollof Rice, and spinach. Everything was seasoned so well and complimentary of each other. Nothing overpowers the next, just a delicious melting pot of flavors. I 1000% recommend everyone to come and try the food! 10/10"
2/15/2020,3 star rating,"The food itself is very good and flavorful! The portions are huge and can be easily enjoyed by two people. However, It is a bit confusing figuring out where to line up for food orders. There is no clear menu with pricing and items for those whom are not familiar with the cuisine."
12/4/2019,5 star rating,"I just checked this place out due to all of the positive Yelp reviews and I was definitely not disappointed. Serving is a very large with very tasty okra Black Eyed Peas and I have the tilapia fish which came in a nice large piece.The staff is super friendly and the food is fresh and plentiful. It's an authentic restaurant serving the real deal, real healthy homemade food. Check it out!"
9/12/2020,1 star rating,"i went to this place a couple of weeks ago after moving to harlem and was super excited i no longer have to go to bk to get my jollof, food was good, nice portions but the customer service qas horrendous,  i wrote a review and stopped going, went back today 9/12 @ 3:20pm..4 ladies working but the shortest one again was just nasty, she super nice if you speak the language other than that you ask her a simple question and she gets annoyed in her response...its just bad. whoever the owners are need to address this. I dont know her name but you can narrow it down by the day and time she work as posted above. The lady has a nasty attitude towards non ghanaians and i know because im Nigerian but im sure she does not know that. what a shame.."
6/21/2018,4 star rating,"Accra is 100% my go to for African food in New York City. The food is tasty and reliable, and they are open late (I think until 2/3am). I haven't had one single item that I didn't enjoy and I've been going for years. However, the food can be heavy on your stomach and put you to sleep if you're not careful, but sometimes that's exactly what's you need! Accra is my spot and a true gem in NYC. Seating is limited and they normally take only cash."
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"This place is literally the best restaurant in the world... never had food this tasty that makes me crave it every day of the week. The people working there are super nice too. The goat in the goat stew is cooked very well, tender and easily falls off the bone. The jollof rice is also very flavorful and perfectly cooked. I wish they had more locations..."
10/17/2020,2 star rating,I was highly disappointed this time around seeing as I have visited this restaurant twice before. The food was cold and the pap was hard and frozen. She didn't give me part of my order and the food tasted stale. Won't be retuning. Which saddens me now I have to find another African restaurant in Harlem.
2/9/2019,2 star rating,"I've ordered some waakye from this place before and the owner was really nice, and the food was good. So why am I giving a 2 star review? Because that's just about the only thing they have that's good. I ordered ""Beans and Sweet Plantain"" which, according to their UberEats menu, is  ""served with garri and chicken or fried fish"". I thought I was ordering the typical plantain and beans Ghanaian meal (also known as Red Red). Imagine my surprise when my meal arrived and it was boiled black eye beans with no stew or any flavor at all and fried plantain. There wasn't even any gari included. Thinking I had made a mistake, I called the restaurant to verify. Instead, I was told that what I got is my fault because I should have indicated I wanted beans stew  I've never heard of a Ghanaian restaurant serving beans and plantain as plain boiled beans and plantain with no stew. Clearly I won't be doing that again."
8/25/2020,1 star rating,Eek! Me thinks not.   Servers arguing with customer when I walked in.  Then server had a bitchy attitude with me.  I asked what side I can get with the tilapia fish and lady said I can only get plantain.  I said on your website it says Tilapia and SIDE it means I can choose from side dishes.  She SAID NOOO JUST PLANTAIN!  Everything looks very greasy.  The weirdest thing is the Jollof Rice is in a big clear plastic bag.   Then there is no credit card transaction.
6/11/2019,4 star rating,The food is fresh and delicious.  I ordered a to go plate.  I cannot wait to go home and feast on my plate of Okra Soup with White Rice.I would definitely visit and re recommend this place.
3/1/2016,5 star rating,"I came here with Tyler L. ages ago, and we both LOVED it (So my review is definitely going to echo his, haha). We were noticeably the only non-African people here - everyone else was speaking in different languages. The lady behind the counter eased us into Ghanian food painlessly. There is a huge, expansive row of buffet-style trays (all ready-made) behind glass, organized by category (soup, meat, etc). She was super nice about explaining everything and giving us samples because we really had no idea what anything was (well, except for mac & cheese and rice and plantains :p). As Tyler said while we were eating, this is what it must be like for white people to eat Asian food for the first time. :p We were in awe of the new, intense flavors and textures of the foods that we eventually picked out. I've eaten all over NYC and I generally specifically go for ethnically authentic foods, but this was definitely the farthest departure I've ever had - and I loved it. Unfortunately I don't remember what I got there (besides the plantains and jollof rice - I think I might've gotten the peanut butter soup), but I still have Accra bookmarked so that I can bring all my adventurous friends here. Fantastic service and great food in a very hole-in-the-wall, super-casual ambiance for very reasonable prices."
3/5/2019,5 star rating,"I came here with a group on a trip to NYC. The food looked so amazing we decided to get a few things and share. It was one of those situations where we got the food and immediately stopped talking until we were done eating because it was so good.Peanut stew - I love goat so this was a no-brainer. This was the best stew I've ever had. A great amount of meat (not too dry or chewy), good flavor, and some spice.Fried fish - perfectly fried, easy to shareJollof rice - yum! went really well with everythingBBQ chicken - delicious flavor, not overcookedMac n cheese - no complaints!It can take a minute at the counter to get your food, so be ready to wait - it's worth it!"
8/20/2017,5 star rating,"Growing up in a Ghanaian family I grew eating a lot of traditional Ghanaian cuisines but since moving out on my own I found myself missing the taste of home from time to time. A friend recommended this place to me and a few days ago while I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop in for quick bite, and this restaurant exceeded my expectations to say the least.I was quite surprised to find almost all the traditional ghanaian dishes that make up the staple of ghanaian cuisine here. They had jollof rice, chicken stews, beef stews, wakye, banku, deep fried fish, fried pork, fufu, all different kinds of soups, palm nut soup, peanut soup, chicken soup, okra stew and many more. I was overwhelmed yet ecstatic by the choices available and in truth I wanted to try them all. I finally settled on the banku and okra stew, and the friend I was with decided on the jollof rice and chicken stew along with a side of Mac and cheese. The portions were enormous for the price, but that's to be expected if you've ever eaten in a Ghanaian home. But what was better than the value was the taste and flavor. The food was incredible, it brought back so many memories of the years I spent with my family. I felt at home, I felt like I was eating something my mother or my aunt would prepare. It brought me to a place I've longed missed and brought me a little closer to home.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to try amazing ghanaian food or anyone who knows what great ghanaian food should taste like. I will definitely be returning to try the rest of thier menu."
2/12/2019,5 star rating,"This is our go to African restaurant every time my husband and I visit NYC. I live in Colorado and we do not have many Ghanian restaurants and the ones we do have, sure do not taste as good as this one. They are open late (and not too busy during late nights so you can get in and get out fast), affordable, delicious, and gives you your money's worth....all things we lack in Colorado. The portion sizes blow my mind every time. It takes me at least two mealtimes to eat it. The flavors are excellent, they cook the meat very tender, the restuarant is clean. The servers were also polite and offer assistance explaining certain meals I wasn't familiar with. My favorite and most bought meal is the waakye with beef. It is done to perfection...never disappoints. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant! Try the waakye!!"
10/27/2018,5 star rating,"Ever had Ghanaian cuisine? Want to try some of the best you'll ever have? Then look no further than Accra Restaurant in Harlem. A group of us converged there a while ago and thanks to their excellent food and warm hospitality, it was an extraordinary experience; needless to say, we keep going back.If you're unfamiliar with the cuisine, the way the starches (fufu) and soups/stews/sauces (I'm using the words interchangeably) work is to pinch off a hunk of the starch with your fingers, dip it in the soup and enjoy. You can mix and match fufus with soups although some combinations are more traditional than others; you'll find an assortment at Accra including pounded yam, plantain, cassava, and rice. Some of the amazing dishes we've enjoyed:* Rice Ball and Peanut Soup with goat (sometimes the peanut soup is chicken based). The compressed rice ball sometimes known as emotuo goes perfectly with peanut soup. Sounds good, right? Tasted even better!* Plantain Fufu and Palmnut Soup was rich and delicious.* Pounded Yam Fufu and Okra. The okra soup is flavorful although mucilaginous - an acquired taste, or perhaps an acquired texture. Generally my advice to those who are new to okra soup is to try to think past the consistency and just focus on the wonderful flavor!* Eba with Egushi. In contrast to smooth, pounded cassava fufu, firmer eba has tiny flecks of gari (dried grated cassava) in it and is a little tart or sour tasting. Perfect with egushi, the yummy soup made from ground melon seeds.Jollof Rice. With fried whiting on one occasion and chicken on another. This widely celebrated and beloved tomato-based West African triumph and a source of both pride and dispute among African nations as to whose version is best, was terrific at Accra.Waakye. Similar to West Indian rice and peas, it's made with rice and black eyed peas or cowpeas; you can get it with chicken or fried whiting. So good, we got an order to take home!Suya. Grilled, spicy skewered beef, best known as a delicious street food. Accra tops it with peanut powder, traditionally a blend of peanuts and chili powder along with spices like ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon and it's so good.Guinea Fowl (Akonfem). The meat is a little leaner than chicken and the flavor is more pronounced. Accra topped it off with peanut powder as well. Dibi and Acheke with delicious mustard onions. Dibi is roasted meat, in this case lamb, sliced into chunks, and often part of the street food scene; the mustard component is a significant ingredient in the recipe. Acheke (aka attiéké) is grated cassava with a texture similar to couscous.Banku with Baked Tilapia. Banku is fermented corn or corn + cassava dough, a little sticky, and is a typical partner for baked tilapia and other fish dishes. At Accra, the fish was perfectly grilled, moist and not at all dried out. Yam Porridge (aka asaro). Not what one customarily thinks of as porridge, the yams are seasoned and cooked down so there is a little mashed yam ""soup"" and some larger tender chunks. Topped with a sauce made from smoked turkey, onion, and tomato in red palm oil, it was another winner. If this isn't comfort food, I don't know what is!Fried Turkey Tail. Known to some as the pope's nose, I call it the part that goes over the fence last. Smoky, juicy, delicious and often overlooked by those who don't know better, this is a bacon doppelganger: if there's no pork on your fork, this is the way to go. Everybody's favorite!And no, I don't work for Accra! I'm just someone who loves West African food and wants to turn you on to one of my favorite places."
2/26/2017,2 star rating,"Sometimes in life events occur that are so surreal you question everything about the universe. My meal at Accra Restaurant was one such event.The food here is good! We got the lamb curry, spinach, and plantains with jollof rice. Everything was extremely flavorful.However, things went south really fast. Maybe five minutes after we got our food, this woman from the streets appears at our table out of nowhere and begins shoveling food from our plate into her mouth with her hands. She is voracious. We are stunned.Clueless as to what the best approach is in such a situation, we decide to stand up and back away from the table to give the woman space. She doesn't like this. She starts throwing the food at us. A piece of lamb hits the side of my forehead. Curry sauce drips down my cheek. My nice shirt receives a massive, possibly permanent curry stain from this phase of the interaction.Once we have backed away from the table, the woman starts throwing our food at other customers' feet. The restaurant is a mess. The woman appears satisfied with her work and hightails it out of there. All are in shock.We tell our waitress that we will not eat the rest of the food. In a moment of indescribable helpfulness (sarcasm), she shrugs her shoulders at us and tends to the next customer.At this point, we go from stunned to pissed. The waitress couldn't care less about what just happened to us. We decide to leave.As we are calling an uber, the manager of the restaurant runs out and tells us he will give us a new plate of what we ordered. We really appreciated this gesture. We let him know that we would like the food to go. He tells the waitress to replace our food and put it in a to go container.After waiting a few minutes, the waitress hands us a ceramic plate with the lamb curry, plantains, and jollof rice. She tells us that they ran out of spinach. She does not offer to replace with an equally priced item. She also did not put it in a to go container. When we remind the waitress that we want it to go, she hands us a tiny aluminum tray and tells us to put the food in it ourselves. This waitress provided us with the worst service either of us had ever received.I will never return to this restaurant. I have rarely felt so disrespected in my life. The manager is a nice man, but the waitress treated us terribly. Stay away from here if you want a pleasant dining experience."

8/24/2019,3 star rating,Overpriced and mediocre at best. I ordered the tilapia which was dry as well as the red stew which black rice and black eyed peas. The cashier told me the stew was chicken but of course I see all other types of meat in there... I also had to endure a crackhead hovering over me while a dined in. Thumbs down.
6/23/2019,4 star rating,"One of my favourite restaurants in Harlem, with great West African food.  I have visited it a couple of times, and every time, having loaded up on delicious dishes, as I am about to leave, I am planning on when I am going to be back again.Egushi soup is amazing, full of flavour, and I especially like it atop the fish as I do not eat meat. African style spinach is absolutely heavenly, and is great for vegetarians. White fufu is great for pairing with the stews. On all occasions service has been great, and the lady behind the counter was very thorough explaining the dishes to those who did not know them, providing samples to try, so people new to African food will not be left guessing what to order.It is not the fanciest of the restaurants, but quite cozy.  Most recommended."

5/29/2019,1 star rating,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I ordered my food through Ubereats only to be very disappointed by my meal. First, it looked NOTHING like the picture and second, as an African, I have had Suya in many different cities (maryland, DC, Houston) and this certainly was NOT suya; it was not seasoned right, very dry, and certainly not the right type of meat was used. The puff puff was very subpar as well and to make matters worse, I also found a piece of hair in the suya. When I contacted the restaurant in regards to this matter they showed no remorse nor did they offer any apology or try to rectify the situation. They told me so would have to contact ubereats to resolved the matter since they were not involved in the delivery of the food. This was my first experience with Accra and I have no desire to try anything else here. If you decide to take the risk to order from here, do so with caution."

2/12/2019,5 star rating,"This is our go to African restaurant every time my husband and I visit NYC. I live in Colorado and we do not have many Ghanian restaurants and the ones we do have, sure do not taste as good as this one. They are open late (and not too busy during late nights so you can get in and get out fast), affordable, delicious, and gives you your money's worth....all things we lack in Colorado. The portion sizes blow my mind every time. It takes me at least two mealtimes to eat it. The flavors are excellent, they cook the meat very tender, the restuarant is clean. The servers were also polite and offer assistance explaining certain meals I wasn't familiar with. My favorite and most bought meal is the waakye with beef. It is done to perfection...never disappoints. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant! Try the waakye!!"
2/9/2019,2 star rating,"I've ordered some waakye from this place before and the owner was really nice, and the food was good. So why am I giving a 2 star review? Because that's just about the only thing they have that's good. I ordered ""Beans and Sweet Plantain"" which, according to their UberEats menu, is  ""served with garri and chicken or fried fish"". I thought I was ordering the typical plantain and beans Ghanaian meal (also known as Red Red). Imagine my surprise when my meal arrived and it was boiled black eye beans with no stew or any flavor at all and fried plantain. There wasn't even any gari included. Thinking I had made a mistake, I called the restaurant to verify. Instead, I was told that what I got is my fault because I should have indicated I wanted beans stew  I've never heard of a Ghanaian restaurant serving beans and plantain as plain boiled beans and plantain with no stew. Clearly I won't be doing that again."
11/26/2019,5 star rating,"I  Acrra! Whenever I am feeling sick, I order a spicy stew with fufu and knocks the cold right out of me! I can't wait to explore more of their menu cause they have tons of excellent options"
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"I want to give a shout out to Aisha, her customer service is unmatched. I ordered food from Grubhub while I was half asleep and accidentally ordered two large orders. Upon realizing I immediately called Grubhub and they said they couldn't refund me my money because my order was made. I contacted Accra and Aisha answered, I told her what happened and not only did she refund my money upon arrival she also allowed me to keep the second order. I was shocked because I rarely come across exquisite service especially at African Restaurants. Thank you so much Aisha. I will definitely be back soon."
12/28/2017,5 star rating,"I thought I had already written a review for this place after all the years of me enjoying the food. I discovered this restaurant after searching for a Nigerian restaurant, I couldn't find one in the area and decided to settle for the next best thing, Ghanaian food. I made the right choice. I was able to pick out whatever I wanted, the portions were more than enough and the prices didn't kill my pockets. The food here and their other location in the Bronx save me everytime I get homesick and need some home style cooking. My favorites are the Egusi soup  and the Okra soup both with pounded yam! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Sheeeeesssshh!!!!The owner is very pleasant and so is the staff. I wish they were a bit closer to me but it's probably a good thing that they're not. I'd be a million pounds. Lol!All the reviews that complain about the smells and the ""mystery"" meats must have never had real West African food. We incorporate a lot of smoked and dried shellfish, fish, smoked meats and offal. So yes, it may not always look or smell pleasant to a newcomer but don't let that mislead you."
4/8/2018,5 star rating,"At the suggestion of a Ghanaian coworker, I went with my 6 friends to this novel find. The staff is so friendly and immediately came over to suggest food options and explain the menu when they noticed us discreetly googling menu terms. The food options are honestly endless and the taste and price were amazing. Will definitely come back to order the rest of the menu!"
8/24/2019,3 star rating,Overpriced and mediocre at best. I ordered the tilapia which was dry as well as the red stew which black rice and black eyed peas. The cashier told me the stew was chicken but of course I see all other types of meat in there... I also had to endure a crackhead hovering over me while a dined in. Thumbs down.
12/8/2018,5 star rating,I live in Brooklyn but am happy to make a trip to Accra Restaurant for a quick plate of jollof or a full catering job when my family is in town from Ghana. I also do a pop up food series called African Chop House where we feature food from all over the continent and Accra always provides the Ghanaian and Nigerian food. My people are hard to please and don't eat just anyone's food but they always feel at home when they eat food from Accra. I'm thankful to have an authentic experience that reminds me of home. God Bless ACCRA.
6/13/2018,2 star rating,"My friend recommended this place to me. I came here tonight and ordered banku with spinach and chicken stew. 4 pieces of chicken and most of it was overcooked to the point I couldn't chew it. The banku and spinach was good though. I came around 10pm and it took over 5 mins to be noticed!  I read reviews on how the customer service needs to be better and its true! If you are working with a guest,  that's fine but dont notice a new customer and avoid themm I ask if they had moi moi and ginger juice and she said they didnt. Cashier didnt say anything after I said thank you after she gave me my change. The first and last impression should be a welcoming and a thank you enjoy your meal! Will I give it another try? Maybe... If I could give it a 2.5 I would."
1/9/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing food!! Great service! Turkey winds, Mac & cheese all the good stuff every day fresh food that taste like home."
9/10/2015,5 star rating,"This place is bomb!!!!So glad Yelp steered me here during a recent visit to NYC. Mom and I were craving some nigerian food, and were pointed towards Accra which of course serves Ghanaian fare, but all west african food is quite similar so I knew I'd be able to find something that I would like. And boy did I find it! Got my jollof rice, plantain and chicken fix! No lie, I've had jollof rice many a times, and this was the BEST one that I've ever had. It had that nice burnt party rice flavor... which if you know naija/ghanaian food, you know that this is a good thing. The rice was the clear star of my meal though the plantain and chicken was solid. Prices were legit especially for how much food you get. I was able to get two full meals out of my one order, and was quite content. I will surely be back next time I'm in the Harlem area!So glad this place exists and wish there was some sort of equivalent out in the bay."
8/23/2020,4 star rating,"We came across this restaurant with a diverse  selection of food from West Africa.  At first not everything was available, but finally when we placed our order we were able to get the guinea fowl and lamb dishes that we wanted.  Good food, wish they had more side dishes."
7/14/2017,5 star rating,OH MY GAWWWDDDD! The food was so good. I nor my friend had ever eaten here and we agree -- WINNER WINNER GHANAIAN DINNER!!! The set up is served buffet and the portion sizes are HUUGGGEE so bring your appetite for sure.  (Although you can definitely carryout or ask for a container)
6/23/2019,4 star rating,"One of my favourite restaurants in Harlem, with great West African food.  I have visited it a couple of times, and every time, having loaded up on delicious dishes, as I am about to leave, I am planning on when I am going to be back again.Egushi soup is amazing, full of flavour, and I especially like it atop the fish as I do not eat meat. African style spinach is absolutely heavenly, and is great for vegetarians. White fufu is great for pairing with the stews. On all occasions service has been great, and the lady behind the counter was very thorough explaining the dishes to those who did not know them, providing samples to try, so people new to African food will not be left guessing what to order.It is not the fanciest of the restaurants, but quite cozy.  Most recommended."
9/26/2017,5 star rating,This was my first time trying Ghanaian food. I am pleased. The service wasn't quick but the wait was worth it. Thank you Musa and Jeanette for the laughs. Also thank you Jeanette for the patience. I didn't know what I wanted. They had so much to choose from. I had jollof and chicken. I will definitely be back. Much love.
9/6/2017,2 star rating,"Disappointing. We had ground nut stew with fufu and okra stew with fufu. Both dishes were *extremely* greasy and contained lots of bones and mystery meat (Tongue? Stomach? Intestines?). The okra dish's meat stank and was totally inedible - it was all bones, fat, and gristle. The two stars are because, grease notwithstanding, the peanut stew tasted good.The experience wasn't pleasant either. The women behind the counter kept talking to each other and didn't acknowledge our presence even though we were the only people there. They were unfriendly and seemed irritated when we asked questions about the food (there were no labels and the menu didn't correspond to the available dishes nor did it have prices).The A/C was blasting on a cold night. The ambiance is a zero."
12/2/2018,5 star rating,SO TASTY! You can tell the food is made with love. The employees were extremely friendly and welcoming. Definitely coming back ASAP. Thank you!!!
8/22/2018,1 star rating,"Listen. First off. I'm African and I have to say my experience with this restaurant has not been pleasant.  1st time I went there with coworkers. We asked for plantain, they said we have it but it's not fried, it's around 12pm on a weekday how is plantain not ready at an African restaurant? Ok so can you make some while we wait since we are eating here? Response No because it will take too long. For the record. Plantain takes less than 10 minutes to make. And that is a stretch,  we ended up having to eat without it.Day 2 they tried to charge us more for the same meals. Day 3. Uber eats. Worst idea ever. We ordered paid for extra plantain, even made a phone call to confirm and ask for extra sauce. Food gets delivered. No plantain. No sauce. And another item was missing.  We called, they responded "" we are not obligated to tell you when we run out of things""  and they said we have to order something else and then they will give additional food. I was already skeptical about ordering from Accra the 3rd time but after today. I am never eating here again! As far as the food taste. Waakye is average, it does not come with shitto nor was it available. Jollof rice is below average.I like consistency and I'm sure we all do and all 3 times has been a let down. Never again."
2/6/2017,4 star rating,"Finally a Ghanaian restaurant! We drove from Jersey for some Ghanaian food just because we wanted to step out of our kitchen, and believe it was worth it. Easily located in Harlem, NY, with a conscious Accra vibes. Felt so good seeing all the various good good food they had on their menu which represented the various cultures and traditions of Ghana. They had tuo-zaafi! We didn't try it, but haven't heard of it since visiting Ghana a couple years ago. The fish, the chicken, rice and beans, waakye, kokoo, banku, okro soup, bayire, and the list goes on and on. What was also pleasing was the mixed group and crowds there. People and cultures from all walks of life. It was awesome. We took a couple of pictures outside even though people thought we were just a little too excited from the food or being there, but that didn't hinder us from expressing how Accra Restaurant made us feel. This place took us home minus the good weather!"
2/25/2019,5 star rating,"It was my first time having fu-fu and stew soup, it was a bit oily but for my first time it was great.  They were able to seat 25 of us in this small place, it made us feel as if we were home."
5/30/2017,5 star rating,Man listen!!! By far the absolute best okra soup I've tasted. The egusi was angelic...the ogbono soup was divine...i wanna take a trip back to Harlem for this place alone. Open hella late too....thank me later. Sidenote: i should legit have around 10 check-ins but was to focused to grab my phone.
9/10/2017,5 star rating,My favorite Ghanaian restaurant in NYC. I used to go all the way to the Bronx to get good Ghanaian food. The plus here is they have a variety of other foods such as Nigerian and Sierra Leonean dishes. What I like is that everything is buffet style so you can see what you are ordering. The wache is my favorite!
8/21/2017,5 star rating,Amazing delicious dishes. The last time I had great  Okra soup like this good my mom made it for me. Everyone needs to go there. It's a must. Run. Run. Run your ass here for authentic Ghana/ Nigerian food. Forget everywhere else. Good thing I had leftovers. Had some for breakfast today. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmy
8/30/2016,5 star rating,"What a great eating experience! You walk in and you see a bunch of different West African dishes, which can be a bit intimidating for the uninitiated. The lady behind the counter was very helpful though, offering us a little taste from each tray to find out what we liked.We ended up getting palm oil soup, spinach and egusi stew, plantains, yam fufu, and fried fish. It was all flavorful and delicious, especially washed down with some homemade sorrel and ginger beer. It's not lavishly decorated, but there are portraits of all the heads of state of West African countries on the walls. We're definitely ""Ghana"" come back!"
11/25/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food. If you're skeptical because you've never had Ghanaian food don't be. I've tried many dishes and they're all so delicious. The owner is so pleasant she allowed me and my friends to sample almost everything in there! Some of the most juicy fried fish I've ever had, the jollof rice - wow, and the spinach is out of this world. Okra soup, chicken, peanut soup - just go. Get something."
2/2/2019,5 star rating,"What an experience, located in the heart of Harlem. The lead chef was very warm and even showed me and my friends how to properly eat the food. They were kind and patient with us. I had fufu with palm oil sauce. One the weekends it's cash only. So if you are feeling for a hot good meal and a cultural experience Accra Resturant is the place for you. The food is delicious!!!!! Real authentic."
6/9/2017,4 star rating,"Great food, so far as I know (my first West African restaurant). Had the chicken stew on jollof rice, which was spicy and tasty!"
12/28/2018,5 star rating,"The only place where West African food can be brought in America. The food takes me back to my trip to west Africa's Togo, Ghana, Bukina Faso and The Ivory Coast. I travel from east Flatbush Brooklyn just to buy food from there's is the best"
8/1/2018,5 star rating,"This is without doubt the best West African food in Harlem for sure. Great food and excellent service. The women behind the counter know how to make you feel at home. If you are new to West African cuisine, they will let you taste some of the dishes that will catch your eye. My go to is the Egusi, fufu, and fish. There are plenty of items and the food is always consistent. My advice to the owners are to bring a restaurant to LA. West African options are very limited in LA and I'm sure they will do very well."
6/24/2018,5 star rating,This is by far the best Ghanaian food in New York. A blend of traditional African cuisine with soul food options for the Harlem community really makes this restaurant excellent. The staff and management are also delightful! Always a great experience!
3/6/2019,5 star rating,A lovely Ghanaian experience. Delicious food and our group had little experience with Ghanaian food but the staff happily answered our questions and helped us order. And all at a great price! Plantains and the peanut soup and okra were particular highlights .
4/24/2016,1 star rating,"I came here earlier tonight with a friend - she is from Nigeria, and she wanted something similar to her country's food.  It was buffet style.  Everything looked okay, but the restaurant smelled bad.  We almost left because of the smell, but decided to give it a try.  I had plantains, collard greens and mac n cheese.  She had a chicken stew with rice and beans and plantains. It tasted okay, but definitely not good.  Literally 15 minutes after eating this food, both of us were sick.  She almost vomited and I was in and out of the toilet all night long.  I have never been this sick from food in my entire life.  I eat foods from all over the world and will try anything.  My stomach has been able to handle it all, except this! You've been warned!"

10/27/2019,4 star rating,"This was my first time going to a Nigerian restaurant, the food was really flavorful! Some things were surprisingly spicy when they didn't look like they would be, but it was a nice surprise. I got jollof rice with the chicken stew and a side of this spinach dish. The spinach dish also seemed to have fish in it. Everything was flavorful - my least favorite was probably the spinach, but I really enjoyed the rice and chicken. I tried a little bit of okra stew to see if I wanted to get it, but it was way too slimy for me. The flavor was good though. My friend ordered the same but instead of spinach, got a piece of fried fish. She really liked the fish. Be warned that it is *HOT* inside, it was pretty cold and raining outside when we went, but inside the restaurant I was sweating. Overall would recommend!"
1/24/2019,5 star rating,This place is amazing. For 1 one im from out of town and we get charged 25$ for a plate of mediocre food. So the prices gets a thumbs up. Then the amount of food you get for that price is also amazing. Now on to the best part this food is delicious!!! I am a ghanian-american and have been having this particular food my whole life which is wackye and that's basically black eye peas cooked with rice and it comes with two different sauces the spicy shito which is basically peppers and seasonings of sorts and some dried fish or shrimp. The other stew is basically tomato stew cooked with mostly tomatoes and little onions. They make it the best. I also tried a delicacy i never had before choffy which is the turkey butt and its also served with shito it was delicious!. Very inexpensive and you get a bang for your buck. Highly recommended!!!
10/19/2018,1 star rating,Just had a very horrible experience..I have 3rd degree burns because the food server splash hot water on me while drop food in the tray.

11/26/2017,5 star rating,"I went there this morning and I received excellent customer service. I  was even offer a piece of succulent lamb meat cooked to perfection. I had the yam and turkey, banku and fried fish, and two orders of waakye one fish and one with chicken.

5/29/2019,1 star rating,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I ordered my food through Ubereats only to be very disappointed by my meal. First, it looked NOTHING like the picture and second, as an African, I have had Suya in many different cities (maryland, DC, Houston) and this certainly was NOT suya; it was not seasoned right, very dry, and certainly not the right type of meat was used. The puff puff was very subpar as well and to make matters worse, I also found a piece of hair in the suya. When I contacted the restaurant in regards to this matter they showed no remorse nor did they offer any apology or try to rectify the situation. They told me so would have to contact ubereats to resolved the matter since they were not involved in the delivery of the food. This was my first experience with Accra and I have no desire to try anything else here. If you decide to take the risk to order from here, do so with caution."

1/17/2019,4 star rating,"The food at this very informal (cafeteria style) authentic West African restaurant is fantastic! And the staff is very nice. Their food has a unique mildly spicy taste and portion sizes are big. I always get the fresh lightly fried fish, uniquely spiced spinach, and rice mixed with black beans. Have eaten here about 8 times and never have been disappointed. Recently raised their prices so expect to spend $13-$15 for your main course. But, well worth it. Plenty left over to take home! Next time you're up in West Harlem, stop off and enjoy!"

6/10/2018,1 star rating,Please do not waste your time and going here. The dining experience is sub par to say the least. The staff is rude and very unsanitary. I called in advance to inquire about using a credit card I was told as guaranteed they accept credit cards. I took an Uber and sat through 30 minutes of traffic 1 way just to get there and be told their machine is down. I asked to speak with a manager give was met with the rude remark of 'who did you talk to on the phone'. Mind you at this time point she(the server) had already dished out my order and I was getting ready to pay for my meal when the server told me this. After going back and forth regarding why someone would have given me false information about being able to pay for food electronically; the server had the nerve to get upset. She literally poured the banku and okro soup she had dished out for my purchase back into the collective soup she had just dished my order from. I should have called the department of sanitation on the spot. But I was just so infuriated I had to leave the premises ASAP. Imagine that. Bad business model. Bad customer service. Above all unsanitar/ food and restaurant practices. If you eat here and you get the runs/ diarrhea. Please call your attorney ASAP. I wouldn't be surprised they serve leftover food the next day. Please do not waste your time going here. You will not only be wasting your money but placing your health at risk.

This is by far the best service I have personally received from an African-owned establishment and I say this as an African too.It was our first time at this particular place and we were not sure about what to eat but the lady was so patient and helpful. The prices are amazing too! Extremely reasonable for the size/portion of food you get! Woo Hoo!!!I only give a 4 star because I am Nigerian and I did not find the Jollof Rice to be Authentic. The taste was good, the color was a little off but it just didn't taste like authentic Nigerian Jollof Rice. If you know jollof, you'll understand what i'm saying.Otherwise, everything else was great! Try the Ghanaian Wache- It's amazing!"

1/12/2019,5 star rating,Amazing food and amazing service. The people here are rightfully proud of the food they're serving. They are very kind and informative about the Ghanaian cuisine and culture. We traveled through 2 boroughs to make sure we had Accra for lunch. More than worth it.
2/23/2017,2 star rating,"Food is good but the service leaves much to be desired, unfortunately. Once I ordered yam and chicken stew and received stew with no chicken in it. Their explanation was that I said chicken stew but did not specify that I wanted any chicken IN my stew -__-. Another time I was told it was cash only despite  them indicating on the door  that they take cards, not to mention the fact that I've paid with a card numerous times in the past. When I inquired further I was told their credit card machine isn't working. Ended up walking out without my order because I didn't have cash. All of a sudden they called me back saying they'd accept my card, and lo and behold, the machine in fact did work. Trying to avoid card processing fees is my guess. Whatever their reason, like I said, the food is good but the service is poor  it's a shame."
9/23/2017,5 star rating,Last week was my first time trying food from Ghana and I love it. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They let me sample a bunch of items and the jollof rice is so good.

1/5/2017,3 star rating,"The place is rather small and difficult to find a table to dine and had to ask another patron if it was OK to sit at his table. I am a fiend for pepper soup or light soup, which I thought was passable here. I had better pepper/light soup at Nigerian restaurants while living in California. Accra is my first West African restaurant since my return to New York. Until I find a better one, I will be back for more pepper/light soup."

7/26/2016,4 star rating,It's a little cafeteria style since don't expect any stunning decor or lavish  service options. The servers are lovable aunty like African women figures spooning your meal into your plate with no portion control in mind! But what heaping servings of yummy Ghanaian food that whisk me to the African markets of fresh food breaming with wonderful flavours. Not a date night location but they do offer seating and a huge selection of food with a sad looking American Southern options which I feel they should scratch. Stick to all the African options and you won't be disappointment !
8/19/2015,5 star rating,So good! My friend and I went in knowing nothing about Ghanaian food and the lady was extremely nice in explaining everything and letting us try some of the dishes. Anything with okra is wonderful and the goat curry was to die for. Also you must get the jollof rice and plantains. The rice is really flavorful and delicious and the plantains are so juicy. The prices are extremely reasonable too. Wonderful service and food. I'll be coming back!

3/13/2018,1 star rating,"Worst customer service ever!!!! I ordered fish Pepe soup on Uber eats, A lady from the restaurant called me and told me she did not understand my order on Uber eats I was a little bit perplexed as this is their menu how could she not understand what I ordered, I explained that I wanted fish Pepe soup and she told me that they don't have any more but they did have mixed meat Pepe soup. Not really what I wanted but I agreed to it I asked her how much it was she She quoted me a price that was cheaper than what I had already paid on Uber Eats I explained how can they make up the difference and maybe add something else to my order she told me to hold onto spoke to somebody in the background and they told her they could make my soup bigger to make up the price difference and if that was OK before I could respond lady hang up the phone on me. The delivery arrived and it was not what I ordered instead of having fit mixed meat pepper soup which is supposed to be a spicy beef broth type of soup instead they gave me a mixed meat stew. Clearly upset we called back the restaurant and explained the mixup and told them they delivered the wrong type of food and how can they make it up to us it's either we can get a refund or if they could send some food for rice anything for us to eat the stoop as we only had one hour lunch break before we had to go back to work the woman that picked up the phone was very rude very unaccommodating telling us we had no choice but to keep the food that we had as she can I do anything about it and argued with us that the food that they delivered was the right food and she hanged up the phone. Needless to say I spent $23 on this food that went in the garbage went back to work without eating anything I am not going to order from this restaurant ever again I am African myself and I am a big believer in supporting my own people but if they did not know the meaning of customer service and hanging up phones on customers is there idea of work ethic I'm no longer supporting them."

We ended up with two full plates of only $10 each. We left happy and full.  It was a great experience!"
5/16/2016,3 star rating,"The reviews for this place is actually higher than expected. Honestly, it was pretty good, however, it can be confusing if you are unsure of what you want.. Or aren't familiar with Ghanaian food. I wouldn't give it five stars, three is good for average."
8/5/2017,1 star rating,"I really wanted to love this restaurant, but because of poor customer service and lack of communication, I won't be returning nor will I recommend this place. It's a Ghanaian restaurant, but Ivorian women work there. I asked for meatless items: egusi, jollof rice and plantain. The jollof rice had meat in it. I explained to my server I didn't want it because I don't eat meat. She recommended the white rice. I asked for egusi, and it was piled in my plate. I asked if I could pay by debit or cash. She said cash only. I paid using my cash but really wanted to use my debit card because I didn't have much money on me. My bank is in midtown and out of state. After two bites, I discovered fish bones in my meal. I'm a vegan. The last I checked, fish is meat. I stopped eating and just observed my surroundings. I loved the African presidents theme, but overall, the interior isn't much to be desired, shabby and dull. Dirty plates were left on the table. An African woman walked in and ordered food. My server helped her. The woman pulled a card from her bag to pay. The server directed her to the back of the room to swipe her card. Hmmmm! I spoke with an African American gentleman that worked there and discussed my meal. He said fish was included for flavor. I said there are many people that don't eat meat; therefore, an option should be available. He suggested rice, sweet potatoes, salad with cheese and potato salad loaded with mayo. I had to explain what is vegan and what isn't. I'm not a fan of eating starches for dinner. He didn't get it. I was given a card. I was told to ask for Ishia. She may prepare my meal prior to coming. This is really a bit much. I'm totally turned off from this experience. Plus, an hour later I developed gas and acid reflux. I don't eat meat or dairy!!! I'll be sticking to Senegalese restaurants when I come home to NYC. They are much nicer, and they care about their customers."
11/8/2015,5 star rating,My absolute favorite Ghanian restaurant and also the only one I've found in the city. Went to Buka (Nigerian food) and it pales in comparison. Customer service here is quick and easy! Huge portions and delicious food. How can one beat that?
9/7/2018,5 star rating,We were in town for. A show at the Apollo theater and hungry during intermission and walked to Accra for food the staff was very helpful the place smelled amazing and the food was delicious got the stew and rice and gizzards and cow feet and sampled a bunch of stuff 10/10 would recommend and eat here again.
4/28/2018,1 star rating,"The Food is is ok but that's about as much positive feedback I have for them. The presentation of the food is horrible, it feels like your in a soup Kitchen. The Managers and Staff are VERY nasty and unprofessional. The food prices and service aren't even worth your wait. I started to order my food from them through Uber eats and that was an even bigger mistake, the order always gets canceled because they either ran out of what you ordered or they're unclear of what exactly you what even though you ordered it right of their menu. I got into a screaming match with the Manager because I was so frustrated that My order kept getting canceled and she had the nerve to be nasty and disrespectful to me then hung up the phone on me. I called back she started yelling once again and hung up the phone on me. Between my husband and I we literally spent A LOT of money at this place and I can't see us making that mistake again. This entire establishment needs a customer service Etiquette class."

3/13/2018,1 star rating,"A friend an I ordered from this restaurant off of uber eats. We ordered ""African pepper soup"" not red soup to be eaten with fufu. We called the restaurant to explain the situation and she insisted that we did not know what we were talking about. She was also rude as she Hung up on my friend the first time we called. She continued on saying that there was nothing she could do at this moment to accommodate us. Overall bad experience."
5/17/2016,5 star rating,"I went here for the first time a few months ago when I found myself in Harlem for lunch.The staff was incredibly friendly and let me sample many different foods for free. A worker even showed me how to properly eat the food.As for the food, it was incredible. I highly recommend it. The ginger beer is also the best I've ever had."
10/30/2017,5 star rating,"Flavorful food in huge portions (I got two meals out of one order), great service, reasonable prices, and laid back atmosphere. Eat with your hands if you want, and beware the bones in the meat! Make sure to try the dry-rubbed lamb, spinach, and different kinds of rice!"
1/9/2016,5 star rating,"I enjoyed a sumptuous and supremely satisfying lunch at Accra. Visiting with family, we were welcomed and offered many samples to try, as we were unfamiliar with the cuisine. The food was tender and tasty, and the staff patient and pleased to help us.The atmosphere was warm yet bustling, and piping hot foods continuously poured out of the kitchen to replenish the offering and and filling the restaurant with enticing aromas. For a mountain of food for three, along with drinks, we paid $40 -- a bargain given quantity and quality. I can't wait to go back!"
2/17/2015,5 star rating,Chicken stew and spinach are delicious! Would be helpful if prices were displayed on the menu
11/2/2014,5 star rating,"The food from Accra is very delicious. Having been to Ghana and eaten Ghanian food often, I can honestly say it has satisfied my taste and cravings for authentic flavors and cooking styles of west Africa. The food is always fresh and constantly being prepared hot from the kitchen. The spices are ripe and bold, the meats prepared and cooked exactly how they are in Ghana. The portions are large, my girlfriend and I have, on occasion, shared one take out platter and a few sides, and that is enough to satisfy us both. Plus, its all heats well as leftovers!Yes, the atmosphere is not the most ideal, but are you really going to the Accra restaurant to look at the art on the walls or chandeliers hanging from the ceiling? I went for the delicious food and I'm glad I gave it a chance.I've gotten food from Accra four times, will definitely be going back soon."
1/16/2016,5 star rating,"Love this place. Authentic Ghanian food made by a family that truly understand African cuisine. So much variety.. Even some soul food. If you've ever had Nigerian Jollof rice, forget you ever eat that and it prepare ur palette for something more flavorful. Service is exceptional and it's opened 24hr."
2/12/2017,5 star rating,"The egusi!!! My friend and I were craving egusi late one night and ended up walking almost an hour to this spot. When we got there, there was no egusi! Our hearts were broken. The lady behind the counter saw the despair and disappointment in our hearts and eyes and gave us $15 to take a cab to another location they have at 2041 Davidson Ave up in the Bronx. The cab ride was supposed to be 15 mins... it took an hour, but we still had egusi on our mind! After almost 3 hours, we were finally able to enjoy some egusi! The egusi man. I love it! Accra can take all my money and just give me unlimited egusi! It's so worth it. I will be going back until the day there's no more pumpkin seed to make egusi stew. Thanks Accra and thanks to that lovely lady who gave us the cab fare."
8/23/2016,3 star rating,"As someone who has lived in downtown Manhattan for years and used to take the long journey to the Bronx to get my occasional fix of Ghanaian home cooked food, I was beyond excited to find out Accra had opened in Harlem. Not only would this cut down my journey to the Bronx but I could finally bring my Manhattanites friends to come try my home food. Visited this past Sunday, they had the usual Ghanian cuisine, everything looked decent besides the jollof, which looked like white rice with yellow power on it, definitely not a good representation of Ghanian jollof. I was about to order it until she told me that was the jollof, I've seen better Nigerian jollof and we know they are not known for it. Overall I wasn't impressed but will give it one last chance before I go back to hiking to the Bronx for my fix of home food."
12/21/2015,5 star rating,"Jeannette was so nice in navigating us through the Ghanaian food, letting us taste samples and making suggestions. She also helped me figure out how to eat the fufu with soup, which I love but never quite mastered. The food was delicious, so many depths of flavor, and very spicy! (Be careful of the ginger beer, which has hot pepper in it.) We will definitely be back."
6/12/2016,5 star rating,"If you don't get the jollof rice, you're messing up. It's the best thing on the menu. Coming from a true Ghanaian. It's very authentic. The spinach is also good, but definitely get jollof rice. A small is definitely large enough, by the way! They fill you up nicely!!"
6/4/2014,1 star rating,"Some of the nastiest West African food I have ever eaten. Purports to be a Ghanaian eatery but was staffed by Senegalese. Food from steam table was cold. The simple meal of Kenke, Chinam, Shitoh, Pepe and onions was completely botched. Please send the Health Department. Caveat Emptor."
9/6/2013,1 star rating,"They tried... that's all i can say. I thought the food served in the other GH restaurants in the bronx were just okay... but in comparison... This one is awful... it's prepared by Hausa's so you're better off ordering traditional hausa food.. Everything else is a joke. unfortunately, they have no competition besides the ones in the bronx. Every meal is extra spicy and salty. Trust me I have tried everything on the menu.Pros--- food is cheap, friendly service, they deliver in HarlemWon't even recommend it as a drunk food. Go to the Bronx or NJ if you want close to authentic well prepared GH food."
12/9/2014,4 star rating,"A friend of mine told me about this spot so I decided to satisfy my craving for West African food by getting takeaway. From the moment I walked in, the fragrances of authentic African food begun to tantalize my nostrils and make me salivate. Brace yourself because there is a HUGE selection of food. I decided to go with pounded yam, egusi soup and suya. As a Nigerian, I can survive on suya alone. I've have some really lackluster suya in the Americas so I usually wait til I go to the Motherland to feed my suya addiction. The lovely lady serving us allowed me to try a piece and man oh man, I was impressed. Delicious flavour with the very authentic suya pepper. Its not as good as Motherland suya but its definitely up there. The meal was so good, I actually tried (keyword: tried) to eat half so I could save the other half for later...that was a fail. 20 minutes later, all that was left of this great experience was a food baby and the anticipation of a food coma. All in all: amazing food and very appropriate servings for a phenomenal price. Accra, I'll be back soon for my next fix."
11/15/2015,3 star rating,"I wanted authentic Nigerian jollof rice, and this wasn't it. I'll keep searching. The place is ok, the people that work there are ok. Nothing special. But it was my fault after I saw the color of the rice I should have know this wasn't Nigerian jollof rice, it taste completely different, I mean no taste or flavor, the color was almost white so I will not be returning back."
11/28/2014,4 star rating,"Decent Guinean food. This place has it's own local clientele, which is always a good sign. We had fufu with palm nut soup, which was very good, yummy plantains and beans in a delicious spicy sauce. We will come back."
1/7/2015,5 star rating,I love this place I been looking for a good African restaurant for over 4 years now and I have found it. ive been here multiple time and all their fish dishes are to die for. I came in one time and they lady let me try some of the stewed fish so I went home with both stewed and fried fish for me and my mother to share and we loved it the prices are good and the food is great tonight I had fried fish rice and mac n cheese I don't eat meat but my mom does and she loves the food as well Its amazing
12/23/2013,2 star rating,@Bella A. There is Mataheko on Jamaica avenue that is made to order food very much like homemade very delicious and generous portions that is in Queens just an FYI. This Harlem African restaurant is okay I prefer Mataheko but the variety is more in Harlem.
