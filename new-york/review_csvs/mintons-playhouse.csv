3/6/2007,5 star rating,"The original Minton's Playhouse was probably one of the most famous of all venues in Harlem during the Jazz boom. It has taken over 30 years to re-open this venue and let me tell you that it is well worth it! All of the greatest jazz musicians to ever play in NYC played here...Monk, Dizz, Bird, Sonny Stitt, Satch, Miles, Max Roach, Mingus,  EVERYONE! The stories about the late-night parties at the Cecil Hotel upstairs are also legendary!Just about a year ago, Minton's was completed and has been helping the revitalization of lower Harlem. It is a comfortable venue with no real bells and whistles which is exactly what you would expect from a place like this. Just a stage in the back of the place and enough room for a 4-5 piece band to play comfortably. There is a cash-only bar and a welcoming and friendly staff. This place can rock all night too! I've been there well into the night with there being no signs of anyone giving up their ""groove"". The only thing that drags me out of here is too much drinking or seeing the sun come up. But with no worries as I own an apartment right across the street...yes, I'm a lucky man!If you want to hear great jazz and jazz singers there's one place to stop in NYC and that's Minton's Playhouse! Bring jazz back to Harlem and to the world 2 ears at a time!"

3/9/2012,4 star rating,"First stop on my tour of historical jazz venues during the Harlem Jazz Festival - and what a pleasant surprise! First off the great thing about Minton's is that the room is more like a square than a narrow rectangle (right, Blue Note or Showman's?) so that you can actually see the band from any point in the room. Than I really liked the chill vibe and decor of the place, and the music of course was great. Now the bad news: this place is closed or opens only for special events."
