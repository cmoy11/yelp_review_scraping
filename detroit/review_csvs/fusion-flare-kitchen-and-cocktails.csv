Nice older crowd good music playing in the background.  Nice date spot also.  Drinks and food definitely on point. I have done a brunch and dinner.  Wing are nice and crunchy,  the green and Mac and cheese was okay,  but they had more options.  You just want to kick and enjoy good company good spot to visit."
9/30/2021,3 star rating,Catfish was good. The chicken needed flavor as well as the macaroni and cheese and yams
12/4/2021,5 star rating,I was visiting from Maryland and went to a birthday party at this restaurant. The food was outstanding!  It was delivered hot and seasoned very well. I didn't need any salt and pepper and felt like I was eating a dinner made by my mother!  The bartenders were attentive and I will definitely visit this place when I come back to Detroit!!
12/12/2020,4 star rating,Was more than happy to support a local business that is able to operate during COVID. My cousins and I ordered carry out from them. I had the Cajun Salmon with Mac & Cheese and Yams. My cousins had Chicken Stirfry and Grilled Ribeye with Loaded Mash and Mac & Cheese. We were very pleased with our meals. Everything was flavorful and well prepared. The only downside was not being able to have the complete experience in the bar itself.
2/5/2019,4 star rating,"I love it when a pro chef (OCC Culinary grad) has the confidence and budget to open a restaurant in a deserving and underserved neighborhood.I visited for lunch.  Not very busy, but I was hardly alone.  I took a seat at the lengthy bar with two others.  Tez was working bar and greeted me promptly with a welcome, water and menu. The lunch menu is typical bar food with a few surprises -  the catfish sandwich is a welcome surprise.  Plenty of salads. The half-pound burger is Angus ... and it is what I ordered.It is a pleasure whenever I order a ""medium"" burger and the kitchen delivers a properly cooked and seasoned burger on a grilled bun with fresh, crisp lettuce an damn fine slice of (winter) tomato.  I would have preferred a bit more sear on the patty and a second slice of cheddar. The fries were expertly prepared and served hot, crisp ... and not over-salted. The dinner menu looks much more interesting and includes lamb.  I will return.The venue has been professionally renovated. The furnishings are new, the restroom was clean, the parking is fenced and the WiFi is both free and fast.The neighborhood? Not the best; so the front door is secured by an electronic lock.  Tez buzzed me in about three seconds after I rang the bell."
8/14/2021,5 star rating,I love this place food is delicious and always made to order! The drinks are strong and it's black owned! The only downfall is that the food takes a minute to arrive! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff!

12/9/2019,3 star rating,Fusion Flare I s an ok spot. It's local and looks nice on the inside. A bit pricey for the portions but hey I won't complain. Check it out you just might like it.
1/27/2020,5 star rating,"OMG! discovered this little hidden gem after church  on Sunday. It's tucked away on the west side of Detroit. They have full bar service and amazing food. The staff were friendly and efficient. I had the shrimp grits w/ scrambled eggs. We ordered the basket of wings, fried catfish and French toast. DE-LICIOUS!!!! Good, homemade cooking delicious. You'll see by my clean plate pic. Do yourself a favor and check them out."

10/16/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant is definitely a GEM  They brought a sit down restaurant to an area that did not have one for over 20 years. Thank you for building up Detroit!I came with my mother and we both had the Lamb Chop Dinner with 2 sides. The Lamb Chomps were cooked to perfection, we ordered them Medium. Staff was very professional and polite and the Bartender Lexi made amazing cocktails  The owner greeted us and made sure our food was to our liking. I rated this restaurant with a 5 star rating for Food, service, cleanliness, and an overall amazing experience. I will definitely return and tell others."
6/25/2020,5 star rating,"Picked up lunch from here today and it wasDelicious. First of all, the food was hot and fresh. My wife asked me to make I tell the world that her onion rings were ""the best onion rings I have ever had!""  The fries were also super tasty. My wife got catfish and grits which she loved. I had a fried chicken sandwich which was excellent. Highly recommend."
7/27/2019,5 star rating,"Detroit Neighborhood spot. It's a small hole in the wall but is filled with personality! I went for a birthday dinner after work. The walls are adorned with mirrors so it makes the space appear bigger than what it is. There is a ""Cheers, where everybody knows your name"" vibe. The server and bartender were very engaging and pleasant. The customer service was great and the waiter made sure we were all satisfied. I ordered their equivalent of a Long Island and it was NICE. Restrooms were small but clean. There is a TV that customers can view. My dinner was delicious. The greens were amazing and the chicken was seasoned perfectly. The mac and cheese was good as well. I would recommend this place to grab a bite to eat with your friends after work or for a early dinner. There was a Chicken Alfredo dish I wanted on their IG page but it wasn't on the menu, that was the only bummer. I had to be buzzed in to gain entry to the establishment and the parking lot on the side of the building is a little small but it won't deter me from going back. I'm glad I found this spot in Detroit and I will be supporting again.*I can't give feedback on the Bananas Foster because I didn't eat any. Some people in my party liked it and some didn't."
8/28/2021,4 star rating,"I love stopping by this quaint, local spot. The staff is very friendly, food is delicious (especially the wings) & the drinks are perfect."
9/18/2020,5 star rating,I've been going over to Fusion Flare for a year and I love the food. The owners and staff are nice and friendly.Would highly recommend yes
2/7/2019,4 star rating,"I apologize up front for not taking pictures of my wings...I was hungry, and they're *just that good*, so they went the way of all good things in a hurry.This is a very, very nice place to visit in this neighborhood.  Mashelle Sykes is an OCC culinary school graduate who is making it *work* in a location that might be eschewed by some...but don't let it keep you away, as the food and service are just fine, thank you.  Absolutely top-notch chicken wings, fried from fresh, not frozen.  The difference is palpable, and wonderful.I mean that.  The freshness of all of the food that I had was readily apparent.  I had the chicken wings lunch, which included three (3) chicken wings, and my choice of side item, of which I chose the side salad, as I wanted something fresh to go with my wings.Solid choice, indeed.  Everything included on the plate was beautifully fresh, and tasted great.  The lettuce, the sliced grape tomatoes, the onions, the croutons, even the dressing was terrific (I asked them to withhold the included cheese, as I didn't want it).  A little bit of extra dressing, happily provided by my server Tez (forgive me if I'm spelling that wrong), was just the thing to make the salad great.But oh, those wings.  Those wings are *wonderful*.  They are nicely dusted with a cajun spice, and yes, they'll provide a bottle of hot sauce if you really require it, but trust me:  you don't need and/or want it, because you want to enjoy these babies just as they come.  Perfectly fried, with lovely skin, served to you absolutely piping hot, ready to challenge you to see if you're willing to wait, or if you just want to burn the inside of your mouth for the pleasure of having them when they're JUST THAT HOT.  I have *zero* regrets.Not only that, but they were so good, I bought another appetizer portion (four wings) on the spot for another $5.  You need these things in your life, and the next four were just as tasty as the first three.  Really, really good stuff, Maynard.They have their own fenced-in parking lot on the side of the building, and while it isn't massive, it does help to make you feel a bit more secure about your vehicle.  They do have Wi-Fi there, and will share the password with you if you ask.  I found my standard phone's data was having a hard time accessing, so having access to the Wi-Fi was good, and necessary.It's a pretty cool place, especially the bar itself.  It's an old-school thing, and it's still being used for its rightful purpose.  The kitchen may be small, but the food they're putting out is worth the asking price for certain.  They're not doing things the quick-and-dirty way, here...they're getting it *right*.Visit them.  Often.  When I'm in the area, as I was today, I will be.  Recommended."
2/8/2019,4 star rating,"I see this spot being a favorite for many!! Finally made my way in to check out the change over of an old neighborhood bar and grill to a new local restaurant with cocktails. Happy we came on an evening when it wasn't that crowded so that I could really see everything and give a full review. So I decided to bring my husband here for our regular date night outing and I'm happy that I chose here because it was a pretty good outing. One important thing to know about visiting here is that there is a small parking lot but basically it's only street parking. The good thing is that they have security cameras all around the building that you can view from inside of the restaurant. Well upon entering(there is an outer door you enter then you can enter only by buzzer through a second door or the door being opened from the inside) we were greeted by a nice young gentleman who sat us but we only wanted to sit at that bar but we wanted to order food which was fine to do. Once seated we were immediately greeted by the ladies behind the bar..who all were very pleasant and who you can tell really enjoy working there. It was a pretty chill and laid back evening with a little R & B and jazz playing in the background, after talking with Bianca our barmaid/waitress said it had been more busy on the days with better weather. We were happy with the more intimate crowd. Anywho, I ordered the lemon drop and my husband ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Both drinks were made perfect...to the point we had at least three drinks a piece! They have a full food menu that would have you wanting to order one of everything! We went decided on the catfish entree with greens and mac n' cheese side, me being the shrimp lover that I am...I also ordered the fried shrimp appetizer as an add on to my meal. You get nice food portions and the everything was very tasteful. Overall, this is a great spot with great potential but I would recommend adding brighter lights on the outside especially around the front door. Yes it's not in the best area but I get what the owner wants to do by bringing good food to a much needed area! I will be back and I hope the service is still as good as it was on this visit."
12/21/2019,5 star rating,"Hot damn. My new trainer at work found out I was a lamb chop eating, soul food loving type and pointed me directly to here. Boy am I glad she did.The lamb chops here are amazing. Perfectly seasoned, cooked to ideal juiciness. That ginger glaze is perfection. My greens were off the chain good. My loaded potato was good but I think I should have gotten double greens.My husband got the shrimp, scampi style, with mac and cheese and greens. He loved it all. Especially the mac and cheese. He also was quite fond of our fried shrimp app, apparently quite a bit more than fond as he ate almost all of it solo. Not a bit greasy but crispy and happy The drinks here were nice and strong. They also have terrific kool aid yay! The waitstaff was really on the ball. Overall we just had a fantastic evening. Thanks Amber!"
10/17/2021,1 star rating,"I was just at Fusion Flare, meeting with some old co-workers.  We were notified that they were short staffed, they have been saying that every time, lately.  It took over 20 minutes just to get a glass of water.  Finally, the food came, that took about an hour to arrive.  We were served with NO silverware, NO napkins.  Our food sat on the table for at least 10 minutes before the silverware arrived.  They got some orders right, and some wrong.  Now we need our checks, I asked four times for our check, with NO response.  Bottom line, if you're short staffed, I get it, but DO NOT open your doors.  I've been to this establishment many times, always bad service, but good food.  Advice to the owner, DO NOT open your doors if you're ALWAYS short staffed.  You're going to get more bad reviews like this one, if you do.   I would wait to visit this restaurant until they get their staff in order.  There are so many good restaurants in Detroit, this is one to avoid."
8/2/2019,5 star rating,"Had absolutely NO idea this place would be exceptional!!  The atmosphere on a Friday evening was laid back and easy.  It wasn't busy so we had our choice of seats.  The server, Tez, was the best we've ever had.  He began by addressing us by name and making drink recommendations.  We were very pleased with his suggestions (Bloody Mary -with bacon & the Strawberry Lemon Drop) and actually ordered a second round [that exceptional for us!].  The entrees were delicious.  I had the fried catfish filets and my husband had the pork chops.  Both were cooked to perfections. The catfish was flaky and the cornmeal coating was not too salty.  The pork chops were fried hard, but were tender and moist.  While the neighborhood may cause pause, it is not necessary.  Just use common sense and enjoy the dining experience!  We WILL definitely go back!!"
2/22/2019,2 star rating,"Well I'd thought I try this place for a couple of reasons. One for the food and two to support black business in the city. I must say I was very dissatisfied and disappointed . Long wait...weak drinks...bad service and below par food. Half the items on the menu weren't available . I'm all for supporting Detroit especially black businesses in our city but I have to say I'm very dissatisfied, as so was my fiance... ""WE HAVE TO DO BETTER PEOPLE""!!"
6/22/2020,5 star rating,First time at this restaurant and was very impressed.  1) they were open during the pandemic 2) customer service was great and my order was ready when I arrived like they said it would be. 3) the food was very good.  Only downfall was that there was a sliver of bone in the greens (when they cut the meat they must have gotten some of the bone too.  Other then that minor item we really enjoyed it and will definitely return.
10/30/2018,5 star rating,"I was encouraged by my God Mom to try this place. I did not dine in, Called in my order. Gentlemen on the phone was nice & professional. Once I arrived my order wasn't ready but I got there in 5mins so I wasn't upset.  I was told 15mins. Clean, dim lighting, jazz music 12 in the afternoon. During my wait I was offered a free beverage. Total wait time from when I called was 20 mins, not bad. The Food! Hot, fresh, well seasoned I throughly enjoyed! Try it!"
10/12/2019,5 star rating,"I love the atmosphere, the food, and wait staff!! I would definitely recommend.. It was a pleasant surprise!!"
4/2/2019,5 star rating,"I have been dying to come to this place for a few months. It did not disappoint! Everything was great from the moment we walked in the door. The staff was very accommodating, friendly and attentive. The food exceeded my expectations. We really enjoyed the fish, pork chops with greens and macaroni a real staple like grandma's kitchen."
6/16/2019,3 star rating,"I have been here on 4 different visits and every time, they have been out of something. When bringing it to the waiters attention, he informed me that I need to get in early. I responded "" that's your answer to the problem "".  I ordered there banana pudding the first time it was good. Like old fashion, made from scratch, stirring the pot, making custard banana pudding. Now, it's a $5 container of vanilla wafers and pudding sauce poured over the wafers with a few bananas slices in it. I bought 3 to go this last visit, and they all where the same. So I would say that's how they make it now. Don't fall off on your servers or the quality of your food. This is what keep your customers coming back. IJS"
1/23/2019,5 star rating,Awesome music! The Grilled chicken salad and bacon wedge are awesome! Tez the bartender for lunch is a total pro! Get a Grey Goose Lemon Drop made by him  it's heaven! Nice chill lunch within the neighborhood...absolutely living for this!
8/21/2019,5 star rating,I always like to look for a great place to eat when I travel on business. I found this place on Yelp and it's a gem. I had the lamb chops with Mac and cheese and collard greens. Everything was great. The lamb chops might have been the best I've ever had. The service was excellent and their cocktails were really good too. It's not the greatest location but you will be missing out if you let that scare you away.
4/20/2019,5 star rating,"Great service,great food, great drinks, great atmosphere and great music. The owner Michelle was awesome and so was my waitress Tiffany. what I think what I liked the most was the fact that everybody in the kitchen had on gloves and I love a clean restaurant. I will be returning"
7/18/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time visiting Fusion Flare Kitchen and Cocktails. I truly enjoyed the food! I was impressed with the service....polite, attentive (I didn't have to ask for anything). I will definitely return and make sure to tell others!"
3/16/2019,5 star rating,"I saw this restaurant featured on tasty Tuesday, and wanted to come check it out! Our server was very pleasant, and helpful with menu selections. Our party ordered (greedy lol) Mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, the catfish dinner, chicken dinner, bacon cheeseburger, and we shared a piece of strawberry cheese cake (fresh strawberries not the syrup stuff) for dessert! The food was AWESOME!! The portions were very generous, and all cooked fresh to order!!  It's a safe friendly atmosphere. Staff and patrons were pleasant. We will definitely be back soon, and refer friends! Also Family Freindly"
3/25/2019,4 star rating,"I had a overall Good experience here on March 9th at 1:pm. My group had reservations for a Birthday celebration for 10. We had about 15 guests. The host, a young man about age 17-20, attended to us with a smile. Our waitress was on point. We ordered a variety of food. It was a ""Brunch"" menu  before 3pm. No Complaints on the food or cocktails. Presentation of the offers was smart & acceptable. They supplied plates & forks for our cake we brought in. We will be returning to try the dinner menu. Parking is very limited so I give  Fusion Flare4/12********'s"
2/18/2019,5 star rating,"Awesome time!! I ordered the Salmon, broccoli, and greens (they were out of Mac & Cheese). Every bite was love . He ordered lamb chops asparagus and load potatoe. I did taste the lamb chop and it was mouth watering good!!! They do have a full bar and a friendly family loving staff. Can't wait to go back!!"
10/3/2019,5 star rating,Quiet out of the way place with really really really good food and with a very friendly staff and did I mention that the food is really good.
2/9/2019,5 star rating,"My birthday club dined at Fusion Flare today for their brunch. The food was well seasoned, light, priced just right & the servers were attentive & patient. We even met the chefs to tell them how much we enjoyed our meals. We will definitely be back"
