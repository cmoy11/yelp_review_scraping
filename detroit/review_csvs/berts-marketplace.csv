6/13/2022,5 star rating,"Incredible historic Motown experience. I would recommend that this place with all the Motown art be declared an historic protected location. Miller is the man! The bbq was next level Detroit orginal. I would highly recommend checking out Bert's Marketplace and all the shops that make up the block. The Piano bar with high end seafood steak house, the comedy club, the after hours bar, and catering takeout bbq joint, as well as the outdoor live events that are performed in front of the marketplace during weekends over the summer are worth the visit. That is before you taste the food which is the most amazing I've eaten in Detroit!"
6/1/2022,2 star rating,"I have conflicting feelings about Bert's. Part of the experience is 5 stars and part is unfortunately 1 star. The karaoke on Saturday's is unparalleled. I've been singing karaoke since 1997 and no place I've been to can rival the talent that walks through these doors. Many wonderful voices at Bert's. As for the food and service, it leaves quite a bit to be desired. First of all everything is expensive which isn't the issue but just brace yourself for high prices. Second the service is almost nonexistent. I came here for two weeks in a row. Karaoke starts roughly at noon and goes until 7 PM. So it's a long show. Got here both times when it started so our group could get a table. First week the service was decent and our waitress had our drinks out pretty fast considering how busy it was. I ordered the chili cheese fries and got a massive amount on my plate. It was $12 but I had more than half left to take home with me. My friend ordered the half slab of ribs with greens and Mac n cheese as sides. The following Saturday it took 20 min for a server to even take our drink orders then another 30 min to get the drinks even though the bar is close to all the tables. The food was dumped no front of us in to go containers. When I asked why it was in Styrofoam since we were dining in our waiter said we only do Styrofoam we don't do dine in. Funny because last week everyone was served on plates. It gets worse. The burger which is supposed to be a half pound and is $15 was no bigger than a McDonald's hamburger patty and well done (I ordered it medium). Like hockey puck well done although a hockey puck is much thicker so that would've been more welcomed. After waiting two hours to get our food we were just happy to have something in front of us. It was like one week to the next was night and day different. When it was time to pay it took our server 50 min to cash us out and run my debit card. Some one at another table we were chatting with could see how long this was taking and got up to find our waiter and get me back my debit card so we could finally leave. Totally unacceptable service. I think the answer, fellow Yelpers, is go to Bert's for the entertainment. The karaoke show alone is worth seeing. Skip the food and maybe sit at the bar for faster service or be prepared to wait a while to get drinks."
6/4/2022,1 star rating,The customer service for online orders is garbage. How can a business operate for sooooo many years and not know how to develop a process so that the customer does not have to wait an additional twenty to thirty minutes for their food? When the customer reaches the restaurant.....the food should be ready.......And they never greet you.....
4/30/2022,5 star rating,"I enJOYed the service, the food and the music. It's always wonderful to run into sorority sisters while I'm out and about. Fun times!!! Thank you Chan for your service"
5/28/2022,1 star rating,"Ok idk why the line is always long. It was a rip off and food was gross! I can make better bbq than that! Sauce tastes like vinegar and water. Pork was limp, fatty, and soggy. Everything was cold. Meat just sits out unrefrigerated. Sides all lukewarm and bland. Canned beans and green beans."
6/4/2022,2 star rating,"Let me preference this review by saying I love BERT's, and I also understand that all restaurants may be experiencing a shortage in staffing.  However, when you pay for something, you expect to receive it.  This the second time my order was not as expected.  But moreover, than the mediocratic food the serving of cake that I ordered was shameful.   Two pieces, mind you.  Don't lose your faithful customers by serving lousy food, striped down servings and a wait time that is more than an inconvenience.  I am going to give one more shot at patronizing this establishment, if things don't get any better, I will either keep my ducket's  or spend them somewhere else."
5/7/2022,1 star rating,"Food was cod when it came out, they took over an hour to come to our table and ask what we wanted just to try to claw the kitchen on us, very Poor customer service"
5/23/2021,5 star rating,My daughter got the Rib Tips with macaroni and cheese for me. This was a carryout dinner from there. I could not wait for her to bring it home to me. Everything was delicious. I got all kinds of positive comments from the picture on social media.
2/21/2019,5 star rating,A great place for jazz and the blues. Very good ribs. My eastern market favorite place to go.
7/26/2020,2 star rating,"So disappointing!1st this place is not kid friendly or family oriented. They don't have a kids menu, I had to order my toddler chicken fingers with fries which was $13 The fries were limp and SOAKED in grease. I can't believe the manger would allow food to leave the kitchen like that. I exchanged them for mashed potatoes which were chunky in consistency and topped with a very basic gravy.The quality of the food was not worth the price. It's seems like they're just churning out food to keep up with the high demand but the quality, taste, presentation just went completely out the window.I ordered chicken wings with a side of Mac n cheese and red beans & rice. It was a totally flavorless meals. The Mac was cheese was just pasta with cheese on top, no creaminess whatever so ever. The red beads and rice were dry and had no flavor at all. The chicken had a basic salt flavor.My companion didn't enjoy their food either. One star for getting through the long line of customers needing to order in a timely manner.Another star for churning out the carry out orders in a timely manner.However, the food was terrible, and they had no air conditioner so minus 3 stars."
7/24/2021,4 star rating,Really fun on a summer Saturday at Eastern Market! You can smell the chicken and ribs in the air and the clouds of beautiful BBQ smoke in the air lol ! The footling kielbasa and chicken are amaaazing! Sweet Willie one band band singing the blues was such a fun vibe!
9/4/2021,2 star rating,An hour wait for chicken wings? Out of BBQ chicken. Ribs under cooked and tough. BBQ sauce is watery. Slaw was to long in the heat and sour. Not the best Saturday for the Bert BBQ team....
9/2/2021,1 star rating,"Really thought this would be a decent place. Shame to say it sucked more than Pete Davidson on SNL. Went here with a small group and was treated almost as if we didn't exist. Food was bland as fuck. Mac and cheese was dry, mashed potatoes were almost like dough. The chicken wings are the most pathetic excuse for wings I've seen."
6/23/2021,1 star rating,"Asked the staff what was good and they smirked and said everything,  so I bought a few things per suggestion. Found hair imbedded in the ribs. Both ribs and pulled pork had same bbq sauce and it wasn't good. Had others try and they weren't impressed either. Greens and Mac and cheese were bland, corn on the cob must've been frozen and cooked because it was mushy. A bit over priced and underwhelming for the amount they had hyped up the food. Maybe I went there on a bad day?"
10/31/2020,5 star rating,"I honestly wanna know WHICH ONE OF THE COOKS IS TOUCHED BY JESUS- because this food is GOOD!! The portions are huge too! It is a great value, great experience there, great vibe- like everything was great. Meatloaf like somebody gramma made it, potatoes from scratch with lumps and Mac and cheese and it taste like they gave me a corner piece. It was enough food for at least 3 more meals for me!!!!"
11/28/2021,1 star rating,"I found mold in my cornbread, thank God I saw it before I ate it, if they have mold on cornbread it's no telling how many other corners they're cutting"
6/20/2021,2 star rating,"Believe the reports about how slow the service is.  We arrived shortly after they opened, were one of the first to place our order, and we have been waiting over an hour for our food.  Likely we will simply have to leave."
5/4/2021,4 star rating,Excellent BBQ!  The smell from the grill outside drew is in.  Bert's did not disappoint.
5/24/2018,2 star rating,"I dined at this restaurant with my friend.  She had been there before, and had raved about their ribs.  To the point that I wanted to try the ribs, and I'm not a big rib eater.Well, we were seated, and there wasn't many people in the establishment.  However, we weren't promptly waited on.  And our waitress was rushing us when she finally came over.  My friend and I ordered the ribs, Macaroni and cheese, and potato salad.  My food was ok; but nothing at all what I expected.  When the plate came out, the food looked really good.  But the Macaroni tasted old, and was dry.  The potato salad was ok.  And the ribs was ok.  I wasn't impressed at all, and my friend that had just went to the restaurant a week before, complained that her food was no where near as good as it was before.  I'm not sure if this was an off day.  But I don't feel that I would try this place again.  There are so many other soul food places that I know is way better than this place."
9/11/2021,1 star rating,Worst ribs I've ever attempted to eat. Like a gross hard piece of leather i couldn't cut or chew.  Absolutely disgusting.
7/11/2021,2 star rating,"Several years ago I posted a5 star review for Bert's.  It was my happy place and there was no better place to spend a Saturday afternoon. Best karaoke singers and a friendly vibrant atmosphere. Met many new friends here and always brought out of towners to experience it. However, this year the karaoke is set in the alley right next to the garbage. And the bathrooms are horrible. Toilets missing tanks, no toilet paper, not clean. Such a shame for what used to be a great experience."
4/2/2014,5 star rating,This is my favorite way to spend a Saturday afternoon. The karaoke is so good it is like watching a professional show. Love the macaroni and cheese.
6/12/2021,1 star rating,"The lady handing the food is rude as hell with hr terrible slick back ponytail. Customer service is usually the main reason I don't return to an establishment. For a place with mediocre food at best, they should be nicer to customers. All I asked was one hot and one mild and I received a smart response - so unnecessary"
7/15/2019,4 star rating,"Great atmosphere. The food took a while to be presented, but the time flew as I watched a dance class in progress. The food was juicy and full of flavor. It was not over pricey. I would definitely recommend this place. PROS: Lively atmosphereGreat selections of food and deserts Located in the Art district CONS:Food delivery to table is slow"
4/14/2019,3 star rating,"Seems like the place to be on a Saturday afternoon in Eastern market. Love that they have outdoor seating and music. If you drive by, rest assured, you'll be compelled to stop when you smell the smokers. For me, the 3 stars comes down to the outdoor service (where you go up to buy) not being terribly friendly and the ribs being tough. I like 'em when they fall off the bone. Again, personal preference. Mac and cheese is good!"
6/20/2021,2 star rating,"Long wait after ordering, sewer backing up next to us, not told menu item wasn't available so one of our party waited for something that didn't come.  Wanted to like it, won't be back."
3/6/2020,5 star rating,"Stumbled along this place while visiting The Eastern Market. The smell of the ribs and sausages smoking on the grill drew me in. I knew we landed in the right spot when I saw people pulling up just to buy ribs. We tried the rib tips and boy are they delicious! Tender and full of flavor, they did not disappoint. I also tried the Red Hot sausage. It was delicious and not overly spicy. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the musicians and people-watching. You can buy lemonade and alcoholic drinks right outside of Bert's as well. I had a wonderful time at Bert's and I will always visit whenever I am in Detroit!"

12/6/2020,1 star rating,"So i just order half a chicken, greens, rice and gravy, a pepsi and a grape crush.  Got it delivered and the chicken is cold and dry,  the beverages are not correct (as in delivered the wrong drinks) the gravy for the rice is clumped together like jello and cold like jello.  Take a guesss....yep the the greens are cold too!  This order and delivery experience was terrible will not be ordering from here again."
8/5/2018,2 star rating,"Ah man what a disappointment. I've seen Bert's showcased on TV and was very excited to try it the next time I was in the area. Well I was at Eastern Market so I convinced the group of people I was with that this was the place we had to try. We ordered Ribs, Chicken, Mac and cheese, collard greens, mash potatoes, string beans, and it was not good. Ribs where chewy, chicken was all dried out and both drowning in sauce. So many great BBQ places in Michigan and I found the worse. Please people don't let this be your opinion of Michigan BBQ. So bummed out. Don't recommend this at all. Smells and looks great but leave it at that."
9/2/2020,5 star rating,"There every Saturday with my wife, the place is fanatic, the atmosphere, the service, the food are 10/10!! Mr Wanda and all of the service staff is beyond wonderful. Jay met me once and now smiles and says Hi to my table every-time. Place is family owned, operated, and definitely treat you like family. Drinks are a bit pricey but you forget the price after then 2-3rd one lol"
9/29/2019,5 star rating,We came back to Berts at night and the jazz band that was playing was phenomenal!!!! Definitely a good spot to hear some talented folks singin all kinds of tunes!
5/18/2019,5 star rating,"Bert's is the PLACE TO BE in Eastern Market. For one, really strong and cheap drinks and a huge selection. For two, the smell you encounter just being on the same block as Berts-- let alone the taste... the BBQ is to die for!!! The beef tips were charred and falling apart in my mouth!  Such a huge selection of BBQ, I am itching to get back and try more. The salads were delicious as were the burgers. The perfect soul food location and all the sides you could dream of (corn bread, greens, cheesy grits to name only a few). Now let me get to my favorite part. The karaoke show that is put on by the band of regulars at Berts is better than paying to go to a concert.  In the heart of Motown you'd never expect any less, right?  Don't wait, get down there for Flower Day this weekend!"
6/8/2019,5 star rating,"Nearly identical as my review from last summer. Be patient- grab a few chairs on the patio- order a few beverages, sit back enjoy the music. Plenty of great people watching. 1 man band playing a variety of music. Have had food here in the past and all has been above decent."
7/7/2018,5 star rating,"A picture perfect day! Found a great table for people watching. Enjoyed an ice cold red stripe beer, brought to me by a very attentive waitress. A 1 man band provided some really decent music. All the food that passed by looked good."
5/10/2014,4 star rating,"Finally , a great weather day. Yea. Road trip to eastern market.soo crowded, love it. Just had to stop at Bert's, to see some karaoke. They moved it to rear of building. Do not be afraid to wander down the muddy alley to get there. Seems like drinks only out back, but GREAT people watching. Wish they would grill back there also, as the street food from grill is so awsome. The market is so good now, reminds me of seatle."
4/20/2021,1 star rating,"I got a Super Bowl dinner for my family which had ribs, Mac, and greens. Everything was horrible. The ribs were very tough and had an offensive smell like cumin. The Mac was made with cheese wiz and it was awful. Greens lack flavor. All the food tasted old. I am very familiar with how this restaurant food was supposed to taste and they failed me and my family. I'll never go there again and I was a frequent customer."
8/3/2019,5 star rating,"Visiting Detroit on a Saturday afternoon and went to the Eastern market. Made my way down the street and saw a storefront smoking up some ribs, chicken and red hots. I got the rib tips and was not disappointed!"
4/30/2019,1 star rating,"Went here today for their buy a rib get 1/2 off the second one. I just ordered a slab, meat only. The ribs we $26.50. The rude cashier/waitress gave me my food, but the carton was too light for a whole slab. I opened it and the meat looked old, dried up and pieced together or someone had eaten off of it and dipped it in sauce. I told the lady it was no way this was a whole slab. Then some lady comes out the back and was like oh, I'll give you some more. WHAT? The picture posted for buy 1 get 1 half off was nothing like what I received.  Give me more? Where's my slab??? On top of that they acted like they didn't want to give me my money back. It was my first time here, and definitely last!"
3/23/2019,1 star rating,"Please get a real Chef in this place and do your food right. This place has no order at all, long wait time for food and very inconsistent with its recipes. Staff all over the place with no direction. This place is truly lacking leadership. We ordered the rib tip dinner, Got in the car to start eating, since the smoke from the grill smelled so good but sure enough after one bite we knew something was wrong rib tips were tasteless but had a bit of an odor we spit it into our napkins. I've been here before and had problems with service and tough ribs but I just thought, ok maybe it's better after two years. I'm at home and can't stay out of the bathroom, my sister can't stay out of the bathroom and my mother, my head is pounding. Ok we're sick. I called asked for a manager and was told ""I don't know were he's at ,, he's out""and got hung up on. I didn't have a chance to say anything about the food,, yet the guy that answered just didn't want to be bothered. Well ok lesson learned. This place has so much great potential to be so much better. Great location, but I guess as long as people are misled by all the smoke from the grill and the beer the rest just doesn't matter. In my conclusion I must say that I wanna love Bert's Place so bad but nope I tried and I can't, I can't."
6/22/2019,4 star rating,"Bert's is such a great place to enjoy the huge patio & live music. The food is great!! The atmosphere is such a good one. It feels like your at a friend's BBQ. This is the perfect spot to take a break from shopping at the Eastern Market & grab a good lunch & enjoy one of their amazing Bloody Mary's.. or maybe a cold beer. Today we stopped in for a Bloody Mary while walking through the Eastern Market. My husband tried the peach cobbler today & it was good, kinda too runny for my preference, but still had really good flavor & was the perfect amount of sweetness. Also, the peach cobbler is served room temperature, not hot at all. But, on a hot day like today, I prefer it not being hot. Bert's is known for their amazing ribs & 1/2 chicken. I've also ordered the hot sausage before & loved it! The amount of spice was perfect. It was hot, yet enjoyable with a cold beer. The ribs have a great smoky taste & are nice & tender. The BBQ sauce is really good & is slathered on the ribs & chicken (I prefer my sauce on the side for less mess). The chicken is a 1/2 chicken, (so plenty to share!) and was super moist & flavorful. The sides are the perfect compliment to the BBQ. The Mac & Cheese was good! It was cheesy and creamy & the noodles weren't over cooked or mushy (which can happen with Mac & cheese). The cole slaw was a perfect cold side, creamy & flavorful. Overall, the food is perfect for the summer patio seating & so delicious. They do have a more extensive menu available on the inside as well. Which is still quick & convenient to step inside & place your order. *CASH ONLY FOR OUTSIDE food purchases. Drinks can be put on a debit card though. And in case you only have debit, you can make your food purchase inside.Today though, was the first time where they were running low on bottled beer on the patio (just because it's busy & beer is great to wash down the ribs with!). No big deal... BUT when I did get a bottle of beer (after I ordered the Bloody Mary & I heard them say that they were low on beer- but figured 15 min later that they'd be re-supplied) it was very warm! It was disappointing because it was hard to even drink & I was thirsty after the Bloody Mary! So, just a suggestion, maybe double check to make sure it's cold before buying. Bert's also has a store next door. They sell cute clothes, mostly made from locals. I purchased a beautiful tye-dye shirt there last weekend made by a local artist, for only $20! They also sell craft beers & sell Vegan food options (for those who can't enjoy the ribs). Overall, this place is fantastic! Truly, a great way to spend a few hours, in the summer especially! The live entertainment alone is worth being there for! Add the amazing food & drinks- you got a great spot to come hang out!"
7/4/2019,5 star rating,"Attended Bert's for a birthday dinner and I was impressed. Initially, it does not the offer the best in presentation. It could definitely use some renovations and updates; however, this was some of the best soul food I've tasted in a long time! It was delicious and the live music and ambience was stellar. Note: Please park in a well lite area, if staying out late. Auto theft is common. My friend's car was broken into while we explored the area on foot."
3/30/2019,2 star rating,"Horrible I gave it two starts one because it's pretty on the inside looks like the old PV lounge , and the other because the bar tender was friendly and amusing awful food and drinks with great service. So if your in the mood for pricey horrible food and drinks this is definitely the place for you to visit as for me I will never return again"
6/24/2017,1 star rating,"This was the driest mac & cheese EVER! Not creamy or cheesy!I saw this guy yesterday afternoon outside of Bert's Marketplace barbecuing. Ooh it smelled so good. So I stopped and went inside and was met with this strange odor. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it wasn't food cooking. I was going to turn around and leave, but I stayed. Wished I hadn't. My BBQ ribs were so over cooked I couldn't eat them. The waitress exchanged them for some more. They were alright just doused in too much BBQ sauce. My mother ordered the greens and candied yams. The taste was bland. She said it was like eating broad leaves. The yams came straight from a can; cooked without butter or vanilla flavoring only sugar. Nothing was fresh. The cornbread was dry as a powder keg. The worse food EVER! We didn't eat our sides. However I did enjoy watching the senior citizens learn how to ballroom dance. That was about it. Oh yeah...one more thing I forgot to mention the water tasted rusty like It came straight from the tap without a filter. Yuck!"
6/24/2019,1 star rating,This is the second time ordering from here. I tried to give it a chance. The chicken is always overcooked and super dry. Jerk chicken has no taste. Requested bbq sauce on the side and didnt get it. Also received the wrong drink.
5/26/2019,1 star rating,"Time to play rough particularly when you spend $82 for 3 people for 3 dinner , 2 appetizers and two beers. Let's start with very slow service , yes it's Sunday but hire more help if you need to God knows your making money. The front door allowed all the smoke to pour into the patrons. That would be us. Smoke was so thick I could of cut it with a dull knife. We left smelling of smoke. Not happy. My wife ordered the catfish dinner. Fish was very good, coleslaw SOUP was too watery. The macaroni and cheese was very good. The appetizer of mushrooms was tasteless , filled with grease and everything you would expect out of 14 mushrooms balls for $8 bucks. WHEN TOU BIT INTO ONE a lot of grease splashed out and got on wife's blouse. On the other hand the cheese sticks were good for $8 bucks. My son and I ordered the pulled pork or perhaps grease  ball on a bun that had excellent bbq sauce but saturated in grease that was so soggy you could not even pick up the bun it was splattered on. Ditto greasy French fries. Yuck. Both our dinners were not smoked . Perhaps they ran out out and tried to substitute the meat from the new White Castle BBQ beef sandwich but wait that taste better. They were out of our first two choose of beer. Really ? I think Party stores carry blue moon ? On the way home I stopped at a auto store to make a purchase and they asked me if I had been on fire do to the smoke odor. That sums it up! Good news is we had food boxed and gave it to a homeless person who we knew could not Yelp. WISH I HAD READ YELP BEFORE WE WALKED IN THERE!!"
7/3/2020,4 star rating,"I was not disappointed with the food but, the delivery service was poor. When the food was delivered the young man stated the person who was to deliver the food did not. Grub-hub has agreed to compensate me."
2/18/2019,4 star rating,"So I've been past this place a ton when visiting eastern market.  I've had ribs & chicken, and sat outside in the summer. My buddy suggested we go for Sunday brunch.   Sunday's are a big deal for our crew.   At first, I wasn't digging the idea.   I looked at the web site and just saw the soul food stuff l, which I wasn't in the brunch mood for.  Begrudgingly we went down.  7 of us walked in, and we were the only people there.  They were still opening. Our server was super nice and there was a Sunday Jazz Brunch menu (although no music). The full menu was also open, and we started with a few Bloody Mary's.  We ordered a TON of stuff.  Breakfast, shrimp & grits, pancakes, French toast, the 'world famous' fries chicken, slab of ribs, catfish, and a vegetarian pizza.   I gotta say it was all VERY good!    We ultimately were the only ones there, which was fine.  I guess at noon, another room opens up that's technically the 'fancy' brunch with things like lobster tails, but ours was great, and my initial perception from only thinking it was a summer bbq spot was wrong."
1/14/2019,4 star rating,Came here for Bday party and had such a good time. The area we were in was beautiful. Looked like something out of a fairytale. I definitely would love to have a bday party here one day or some type of celebration event. The service from the bartenders was good. And listen the dance floor looked magical.

5/24/2020,1 star rating,"All of yall crazy, worst food and worst service. I will never dine there again. I ordered a swiss burger and when it came she told me they were out of swiss so they used cheddar, now dont you think that something you should say before you make the burger, after all its called a swiss burger, unbelievable and to top it off it was on a bun from the dollar store. all the bakeries around there and you put my burger on a supermarket hamburger bun that was to small. Never again!"
8/5/2018,1 star rating,"Walked by and saw a mountain of delicious looking meat and ribs on the grill.  My mind was telling me no, but my body was telling yes.  So we decided to go in for lunch.  It was a slow Sunday everything f was going well as we got seated. 10 mins later we were greeted by an already grumpy waitress. We proceeded to order a beer and some food.  Didn't hear back from her for an hour.  Beer were all evaporated into the air, and we couldn't wait any longer.  We ask to just pay for the beers and we went across the street for an amazing kielbasa. Cost $5 and got it in 3 mins.  I hope the food is better than the service at Bart's.  If Yelp allows for 1/2 Star, this place gets the prize."
3/20/2018,2 star rating,"I really really wanted to like this place... Hell, I wanted to love it... and when I walked in at 11 am and they were singing Karaoke, I was pretty sure I was going to leave madly in love.The service was friendly and quick, but the ribs were tough and WAY under-cooked... and the Mac n Cheese lacked any semblance of flavor or real texture.It was weird, because the place seemed to be full of a lot of locals that loved the place... but it almost seemed like they purposely served us food that was lackluster so we wouldn't come back.  Which was weird, because I felt totally welcomed and everyone was super friendly... but the food was just not good at all, it was bad BBQ and it makes me sad to say so.It only gets 2 stars because they were so incredibly nice to us."
4/10/2021,1 star rating,"Stopped by on 04/10/21 horrible customer service! Small child taking the orders.  Middle age young adult calling your name for the completion of the order. Six staff members working outside and my Oder wasn't""t correct. Wait time was a extra 10 mins. Staff member with dreads prepared my food (without gloves or hairnet). Never again. I ordered the rib tips $11.99 they were parboiled and dropped in water down bland sauce! Cold meat.... The 5.99 for the keibalsa sausage was cold meat . If I could rate this business lower than a negative one, I would rate them a negative ten times two!!!  The young adult was extremely rude, my order was incorrect, she had the nerves to ask me what are you still waiting on ? The cook hands me my sausage, while she was holding on too the (Cold rib tips). $19.06 what a bad experience... I live in Detroit for fifty four yrs and would never return, if they were giving the food away I would simply decline the experience"
1/25/2020,1 star rating,"It was pretty bad. Service was bad. Rib tips were tough and my out of town guest had hair in her mac n cheese. My daughter got her cheeseburger cold with the wrong sides, but they gave her cold fries. When she sent the burger back it came back brown on the outside but raw through and through. The owner was sighing and rolling his eyes whenever we had a complaint. My other out of town guest was nauseous after we left. Bert's has declined. Never again... and fix your womens bathroom. There is only one stall!!!"

Plenty of great people watching. 1 man band playing a variety of music. Have had food here in the past and all has been above decent."
7/7/2018,5 star rating,"A picture perfect day! Found a great table for people watching. Enjoyed an ice cold red stripe beer, brought to me by a very attentive waitress. A 1 man band provided some really decent music. All the food that passed by looked good."
5/10/2014,4 star rating,"Finally , a great weather day. Yea. Road trip to eastern market.soo crowded, love it. Just had to stop at Bert's, to see some karaoke. They moved it to rear of building. Do not be afraid to wander down the muddy alley to get there. Seems like drinks only out back, but GREAT people watching. Wish they would grill back there also, as the street food from grill is so awsome. The market is so good now, reminds me of seatle."
6/5/2019,4 star rating,"There is no way to write a short post about Detroit and the culinary gifts it gives to the world.Mind you this is my second long post because my first one Facebook deleted My 3.672 days spent in Detroit was an experience of nonstop culinary joy and cultural learning. Saturday began right away with breakfast at Eastern Market. This puts the Des Moines farmers market to shame even though I'm proud of our market. Eastern Market is the most ethnically diverse outdoor market I think I have ever been to in the US. There are 5 main sheds that make up the majority of the market, though the outer parameters also have individual shops that are considered to be a part of the market. Beginning by shed 5, we started off our morning with beignets from Beignets, and a brisket burrito and a pork belly taco from Elguapogrill.Com. I found the pork belly to be on the bland side, but the brisket burrito had a wonderful array of flavors. Now onto Shed's 4-1. Each shed has its own unique dynamic and appeal, literally hundreds of vendors scattered all over these city blocks. We ventured through the sheds fairly quickly and across the highway to Gratiot Central Market, an indoor meat market of every possible cut of animal you could imagine. We purchased 1 pound of gizzards, deep-fried in salty/peppery batter right on the spot. Words cannot describe how fabulous these gizzards were, something I don't get to eat very often. As we tracked our way slowly through the meat market and then back through eastern market, we snacked on gizzards all the way until we reached Eastern Market Seafood Co, just off the beaten path from Shed's 1-5. Inside we found ourselves ordering an Old World Sandwich, filled with 3 kinds of sausages, shredded lettuce, sliced onions, tomatoes and yellow mustard all inside a flat pita . Everything was delicious except for the pita, which was more like thin sliced cardboard. No harm, no foul, we simply picked out the meat inside for a spicy delight.Then, onto DeVries & Company 1887 market. Three floors of unique vending experiences, everything from Ghana woven baskets to dish towels with awesome, funny little quotes such as ""according to this box of mac & cheese, I am a family of 4."" As in line with my World War II obsession, I purchased a World War II and Detroit influence book and another cup of coffee, but not without tasting samples of 15-year-old aged balsamic, white vinegar and cucumbers, pasta sauce that deserves restaurant level praise, and an array of crackers. I want to vomit I'm so full but I keep on powering through. At the opposite end of the market, other side of the road, is another row of vendors, restaurants and shops. We found ourselves inside Mike's Coney Island getting a gyro, and outside Bert's Entertainment Complex-Detroit at a half block wide outdoor grill getting barbecue. The gyro was made to order, the ribs were grilled right in front of us, and both were excellent! Can not possibly fit more food in but we're Buddha belly happy. As we tearfully leave Eastern Market, we get a great tour of downtown Detroit. Aaaand why not stop for another bite to eat? Pegasus Taverna in Greektown is where we landed for sakagaki (OPA!), a Cheese lit on fire and served with bread. And a chilled beer to wash down meal 87 of the day. It's not even 2pm yet ‍ and we've eaten more than enough. This was the perfect cap for a food-coma nap"
5/26/2019,1 star rating,"Time to play rough particularly when you spend $82 for 3 people for 3 dinner , 2 appetizers and two beers. Let's start with very slow service , yes it's Sunday but hire more help if you need to God knows your making money. The front door allowed all the smoke to pour into the patrons. That would be us. Smoke was so thick I could of cut it with a dull knife. We left smelling of smoke. Not happy. My wife ordered the catfish dinner. Fish was very good, coleslaw SOUP was too watery. The macaroni and cheese was very good. The appetizer of mushrooms was tasteless , filled with grease and everything you would expect out of 14 mushrooms balls for $8 bucks. WHEN TOU BIT INTO ONE a lot of grease splashed out and got on wife's blouse. On the other hand the cheese sticks were good for $8 bucks. My son and I ordered the pulled pork or perhaps grease  ball on a bun that had excellent bbq sauce but saturated in grease that was so soggy you could not even pick up the bun it was splattered on. Ditto greasy French fries. Yuck. Both our dinners were not smoked . Perhaps they ran out out and tried to substitute the meat from the new White Castle BBQ beef sandwich but wait that taste better. They were out of our first two choose of beer. Really ? I think Party stores carry blue moon ? On the way home I stopped at a auto store to make a purchase and they asked me if I had been on fire do to the smoke odor. That sums it up! Good news is we had food boxed and gave it to a homeless person who we knew could not Yelp. WISH I HAD READ YELP BEFORE WE WALKED IN THERE!!"
4/30/2019,1 star rating,"Went here today for their buy a rib get 1/2 off the second one. I just ordered a slab, meat only. The ribs we $26.50. The rude cashier/waitress gave me my food, but the carton was too light for a whole slab. I opened it and the meat looked old, dried up and pieced together or someone had eaten off of it and dipped it in sauce. I told the lady it was no way this was a whole slab. Then some lady comes out the back and was like oh, I'll give you some more. WHAT? The picture posted for buy 1 get 1 half off was nothing like what I received.  Give me more? Where's my slab??? On top of that they acted like they didn't want to give me my money back. It was my first time here, and definitely last!"
4/28/2019,1 star rating,I went to that location yesterday I was so disappointed the floors with nasty my shoes was sticking to the floors. First off I went there for 80th birthday party the lady who was waiting on us was so unprofessional 45 minutes for water then she brought the food out drop the food on the ground and still try to serve the other food without washing her hands I told the owner he said he was going to send his son out we never seen him I would never go to that place again the music was very nice to place is dark and dirty. In another bad part about this place the owner never came out I was there for a birthday party the lady was 80 years old talk about disrespect
4/14/2019,3 star rating,"Seems like the place to be on a Saturday afternoon in Eastern market. Love that they have outdoor seating and music. If you drive by, rest assured, you'll be compelled to stop when you smell the smokers. For me, the 3 stars comes down to the outdoor service (where you go up to buy) not being terribly friendly and the ribs being tough. I like 'em when they fall off the bone. Again, personal preference. Mac and cheese is good!"
4/1/2019,3 star rating,"Outside exterior, had a rustic, nostalgic appearance. The restaurant located directly across the street from the Eastern Market. We easily located  a parking space directly in front of restaurant. However, if i feel finding space would not have been as easily located if there was an event going on at The Eastern Market. Bert's is sectioned off  into three separate buildings each building having a separate entrance. We were attending the bar for drinks , but decided to order a dinner, catfish meal. The meal came with two sides, and cornbread. We substituted the sides for fries. We also ordered drinks, I ordered a class of wine , which came in a plastic clear cup, the kind they give out at festivals, lol. My fiancé ordered the Long Island ice tea. Advice, cheap wine and Long Island left a lot to be desired.  Stick with simple mixed drinks, wine, or a Long Island. My fiancé loves the long islands, he likes the heavy alcohol, lol. We ordered catfish dinner, wow, we were pleasantly surprised. The fish was fried perfectly, crust was a Golden yellow and crunchy without being  too hard.  The meat was flaky , moist.  The fish was delicious.Fries were good, not too greasy or  too hard and everything was hot. The meal definitely made up for the drinks. I also noticed other meals coming out and they really look delicious. Definitely would like to come back to try the barbecue. I think I'll try the the Motown entrance. Which I understand is Bert's high end restaurant where meals are professionally served (the third entrance). Unfortunately, service was not great. It wasn't bad, just adequate. Staff not very friendly nor inviting. No welcoming smiles  or greetings. Upon leaving we left thru the market entrance(2nd entrance) , we decided to order some dessert because the cakes looked delicious. We ordered the carrot cake and yellow cake, delicious, I ate it so fast, it was so good. The portion size was large but so was the price. Seven dollars for a slice of cake."

3/30/2019,2 star rating,"Horrible I gave it two starts one because it's pretty on the inside looks like the old PV lounge , and the other because the bar tender was friendly and amusing awful food and drinks with great service. So if your in the mood for pricey horrible food and drinks this is definitely the place for you to visit as for me I will never return again"
3/23/2019,1 star rating,"Please get a real Chef in this place and do your food right. This place has no order at all, long wait time for food and very inconsistent with its recipes. Staff all over the place with no direction. This place is truly lacking leadership. We ordered the rib tip dinner, Got in the car to start eating, since the smoke from the grill smelled so good but sure enough after one bite we knew something was wrong rib tips were tasteless but had a bit of an odor we spit it into our napkins. I've been here before and had problems with service and tough ribs but I just thought, ok maybe it's better after two years. I'm at home and can't stay out of the bathroom, my sister can't stay out of the bathroom and my mother, my head is pounding. Ok we're sick. I called asked for a manager and was told ""I don't know were he's at ,, he's out""and got hung up on. I didn't have a chance to say anything about the food,, yet the guy that answered just didn't want to be bothered. Well ok lesson learned. This place has so much great potential to be so much better. Great location, but I guess as long as people are misled by all the smoke from the grill and the beer the rest just doesn't matter. In my conclusion I must say that I wanna love Bert's Place so bad but nope I tried and I can't, I can't."
2/16/2017,2 star rating,"I really hate I have to give Bert's a 2 star rating. After waiting months to try the BBQ here, I wish I had left coming to Bert's a distant dream. We ordered takeout about 7pm on a Tuesday night.  The workers were friendly and one of the guys said we definitely had to try the ribs. We ordered a rib tip dinner and a dinner with a half slab of ribs. Each dinner comes with two sides and a cornbread muffin. The rib tips were mostly hard ends and fat. The mac and cheese was bland, and the greens were too vinegary. The candied yams were also bland. Really. How is this possible at a place known for soul food?  Just throw some more sugar on them. That's what we had to do for these. Seriously, who is seasoning the food here? The black eyed peas were okay though, and I liked the cornbread. Also, we had to reheat both dinners. And yes it was takeout, but our destination was a few minutes away from the restaurant. The half slab of ribs were ok. They were meaty and plentiful, but the BBQ sauce they use is like a watered down mesquite flavored sauce. I hate this didn't work out. I won't return."
8/21/2019,4 star rating,"This place was ok.. I went here with my mom during ""Black restaurant week"" Bert's participated in this week along with other restaurants in celebration of being a black owned establishment. There was a special menu catered to this week. I got the half chicken & ribs with two sides which were Mac & cheese & yams. I would give the food a 5/10. I was not a fan of the barbecue sauce & the Mac n cheese was super bland! I had to drown it with salt & pepper smh. For my drink I had Crown Royal Apple with Lemonade. Our bartender was nice...however...she was drunk. It didn't bother us that she was intoxicated because she still managed to be attentive but it was very noticeable in her speech & mannerisms. Not to mention we saw her sipping on her drink. Overall it was ok. I can't say I'd go back though. They also do ballroom lessons on certain days & a live band on certain days as well which I have heard is a nice experience. I gave it 4 stars only because I've heard good things, but my experience wasn't all that. I'm thinking maybe I just went on a bad day, so I'm leaving it at that."
7/21/2019,1 star rating,This was an extremely bad experience.  Poor service served $10 lemonade!  Waited 20 minutes to find out that they did not have the menu item I wanted.  Food was just okay and high priced.  The only good thing was the entertainment!Do not bother going here
3/19/2019,1 star rating,"All hype, no game. Sure grab a rib outside if your passing by in eastern market...but don't dine in. Terrible service. Dirty restaurant."
12/20/2016,3 star rating,"The food is good, and the music ranges from OK to great. The waitresses are pretty awful in the aggregate, and that really just crushes your dining experience here.If it's not crowded, your food and drinks will show up at your table with glacier-like speed. If it's crowded, then all bets are off - you could be there for hours. And, it's not just the alacrity (or lack of alacrity - see what I did there?) with which your food  makes it to your table, it's the relative incompetence of the wait staff. Almost all of them seem completely overmatched to the demands of a waitressing job.In this instance, the old axiom is true - you have to suffer for the blues."

12/31/2018,1 star rating,"Service was awful. Had to ask for everything (napkins, silverware, drinks). We ordered an appetizer but it came after the meal arrived. The ribs we ordered were so tough we could barely cut through them. I ordered greens but they told me they didn't have them once my meal arrived. They substituted green beans but they tasted like they came right out of the can and weren't seasoned at all. The Mac and cheese and coleslaw were good. The yams were dried out and had no taste/glaze on them at all. The also tasted like they came out of a can. We ended up leaving most of the meal there. We didn't want to give to the homeless because that would be cruel. If I could give negative stars I would. This was a waste of $50. Wish I had read the reviews before going here because I wouldn't have gone."
6/3/2017,3 star rating,"This place was on my bookmark list, so I stopped by and ordered the rib tips on my trip to the eastern market. The flavor was nice, but the meat was tough- hard to bite and chew. Which was confusing because the meat somewhat moist. This pig had to be a prize fighting pig because those rib tips were muscular. The young man that served me was curt, unfriendly and a little sloppy. Here's a tip every customer counts. Not impressed enough to come back."
9/22/2016,1 star rating,"Poorly managed dump. Terrible service. Avoid at all costs. We popped in to grab a bite before hitting Eastern Market After Dark, because the food truck lines were so long and we'd rather wait ten minutes sitting down in AC. My boyfriend was waiting to place our order at the register when the older female waitress passed by to let me know there was table service. I asked which was faster. She said definitely table service. I texted him to come back and placed our order with her.We then waited twenty minutes. For water. In a half empty restaurant. I hadn't eaten in hours and asked her to please bring bread. She said they didn't have any. After watching cornbread and sandwich bread pass on every plate, I got up and asked her to bring me some of that. It was on the counter a foot away from me. I gladly would have brought it to the dining room, but she said she'd bring it right out. I waited ten minutes for two slices of sandwich bread.After forty minutes and our waitress assuring us we were next, we got up to check on our food. Clearly, she had forgotten to put in our ticket and did not tell the line cook to expedite. There were over ten orders ahead of us, and there's no way all of those customers were waiting forty minutes for a salad and onion rings.The line cook refused to complete our ticket next, and the waitress just rolled over and said, ""Forgive me."" We could have been enjoying our night and you wasted an hour of our time. You repeatedly lied, mismanaged our expectations, and never told us you forgot to place our order. Sorry, but you are not forgiven. May you BBQ in restaurant hell. Low and slow. I would never come back to this place even when you get fired, as you deserve."
9/24/2018,2 star rating,"5 stars for atmosphere, 3 stars for food and 1 star for service. A group of us visited recently. Gorgeous day. Connected with a waitress, who suggested a spot outside. It took a long time to get her to come back. She didn't know what drinks were available, mixed up drink and food orders and overcharged two of three parties by more than $60 each. When we called to dispute charges, we were told we needed to come in (huh?), then that a manager wasn't there (huh?). No one could help, so we had to call our credit card company. The bbq was above average, the fried fish was below average, the salad was inedible. But it was a beautiful night with beautiful people all around, so we still had fun. But we don't plan to return."
7/16/2017,5 star rating,"Saw this place my first trip to the Eastern market. Seemed to be a lot of interest in the barbecue. Made a mental note to take a closer look the next time. Went to Eastern market on Saturday and couldn't help but go by. The smell was amazing, the line for the barbecue was long but reasonable. One Red-Hot and ribs later we were super happy. This is a really unique place not to pass up. Great music and BBQ. We'll be regulars."
9/15/2017,4 star rating,"Seriously raggedy service. Wings on point, but daaaang....service is the worst. (Except for the 2 woman behind the bar tonight - Juanita and Noelle)) a waitress wanted to put in her order and brought her arm in front of my face saying, ""nah, he gotta wait"" as I was giving the bartender my food order. Even the guy taking the cover was rude. Smdh. John Douglas and his band saved the night.Addendum: owner addressed issue, so I changed 1 star to 4.

10/17/2017,5 star rating,"Eat here.  This place rocks.  It rocks to an extent that my wife and I had it cater our wedding reception!The first thing about Bert's that most visitors will notice is the meat it cooks on open grills in front of the restaurant on Saturday afternoons, which are Eastern Market's main day.  This meat is delicious, but it is only the beginning.  Other entrees are really good too, such as the fried chicken and smothered pork chop (covered in a flavorful gravy, which is one of my favorites on their menu).  Side dishes are incredible- especially the mac and cheese, candied yams, greens, and green beans. In addition to a regular meal, I highly recommend Bert's for catering.  We hired them to cater our wedding of about 170 people at the Guardian Building in downtown Detroit.  In contrast to a lot of catering companies and venues, the food that they delivered to our wedding tasted every bit as good as what we eat in their restaurants.  Our buffet consisted of smothered pork, fried chicken, mac and cheese, candied yams, coleslaw, and corn bread.  The logistical delivery of our wedding buffet was flawless, and the manager, Jay Lee, was a pleasure to deal with.  He took the time to clearly answer our questions, was enthusiastic about offering any nuance or special request that we had.  The execution on our wedding day went incredibly smooth, where plenty of food was provided without delay or hiccup.  On top of it, the price that Bert's gave us was very competitive relative to the many other caterers we considered.Swing by Bert's.  Enjoy the food and music.  Have them cater your event.  Just make sure that you're hungry before!"
1/25/2020,1 star rating,Worse Ever!!!! Save your money and time! First service was horrible! Second food was not good and  when food came out I it was cold! Niece ordered a burger came out cold then they made her another one and it came out raw! Then it went from bad to worse there was hair in my food. We were sitting by the kitchen and noticed cooks back there not wearing hair nets. Finally spoke to owner and he said he can't stay in business if he covers the bill for our terrible food. Was so dissatisfied and disappointed! Your food was horrible maybe you should just stick to your karaoke and cocktails and please fix your restrooms ridiculous! Oh forgot to mention my mother in law ended up throwing up!

1/25/2020,1 star rating,DO NOT COME HERE! The food was cold. Burgers were raw when asked for well done. Hair was in a plate because the cook staff is not wearing hair nets. Sides were also cold. We asked the owner compensate and he was not willing to comply. First and last time coming.
8/21/2016,5 star rating,"Bert's is the greatest place ever. For the ambiance and comraderie alone it is an amazing melting pot that defies all of the negative rhetoric about Detroit. The crowd is so diverse on Saturday karaoke afternoons.  It is heartening to see everyone having a blast and getting along and dancing together and supporting one another. And cheering on even the most egregious karaoke-er (ahem, a friend who shall not be named). Some of the musicians and regulars are amazing. So fun to watch. This place needs to be saved. It's like the United Nations of Detroit. Oh and the bbq is good too!"

9/1/2019,2 star rating,"I guess I should have examined my bill before paying but I was with a group and we had to leave, but at $66, plus tip, for two people, they are way over priced. First apparently you get charged for using a credit card, didn't know that until I got the credit card receipt. Shame on the waitress for not warning us. Also not sure if they added an automatic gratuity for our group, but she double dipped in tips if they did. Our 3 drinks came to $28, and two entrees, with I'm guessing the added two sides even though we asked if we could get the sides instead of fries and she said yes, was a whopping $36. So word of caution, if you decide to venture in here, don't pay with credit card unless you want the extra charge they won't tell you about, and keep an eye on your bill since I'm sure there is something fishy going on there too. Food was decent but nothing to rave about. I won't be back."

Our waitress was very nice to us.Everything takes so long... holy crap, almost an hour for 2 rib dinners.  And that had nothing to do with the power, that's just how long ""good BBQ takes"".  My ribs were ok, kinda tough. I know fall off the bone is ""overcooked"" in the BBQing community, but I dont want to have to gnaw at them either.Some of the best mac and cheese i've ever had! I may go back, but honestly, the place needs some help. It's getting real run down and just was kinda depressing to me. Even with the awesome mac and cheese, I can make that at home.  Things may be different in the summer.. i'll try one more time. /Mac&cheese!"
4/23/2018,1 star rating,"Bert's food @ Eastern Market is only good on Saturday's when the grill is smoking outside & the music is wondrous. I tried it on a Sunday & boy was I disappointed. The ribs were so tough, sauce tasted like chili hotdog omitting the beans! Even worse...my daughter had the fried pork chops. We were taking the food to the park to eat on a beautiful day. Well when she went to bite into the pork chop we noticed a line on the meat; we pulled the end of the line & it was a thick thread the same color of the pork chop. We were instantly disgusted!!!! It was 1/2 the length of my forearm, at 1st I thought it was a long strand of hair, but it was to thick to be a strand of hair. I don't know what it was. I completely lost my appetite after that. I had to leave the park to go return that nasty food & get my money back. The only time I can do Bert's is on Saturday outside during flower season with a COCKTAIL!!! This is geeked up & get high food (intoxication) if you know what I mean.Anyone who knows REAL SOUL-FOOD would not like Bert's any other day or time of the week.  Sry I use to like this place, but it has lost quality!!"

The music outside was good, but the place was practically empty. Maybe they've fallen off? The service was not good. Our waitress was nice, but inattentive and slow. The food was terrible. I couldn't even eat my vegan bbq sandwich and my husband said his pulled pork tasted like it came out of a plastic tub. The chicken tenders were dry. The fries were good, but that was all I ate."

She passed us by several times and helped other customers before acknowledging us, even though we politely tried to gain her attention. She gave other tables who arrived after us menus and took their order before giving us menus. It took her an hour to give us waters. It took almost 2 hours to get our food from first arriving. My friend spoke to the manager twice and he told us that he couldn't comp our meals for the poor service. The food was good, but not worth the poor service. The server was just cranky and didn't care that when we got our food."

7/14/2019,1 star rating,"Very slow service. Any meat we ordered was very over cooked. Couldn't even bite into the chicken or pork chops. The ribs were also served warm, almost cold. Cheese sticks were over cooked and served to us with all cheese on outside. Only good thing was Mac and cheese & baked beans. Very disappointed."
9/3/2012,4 star rating,"I've gotta agree with other yelppers in stating this is as much about the experience as it is the food.  Having never been to the market, the only advice I was given was look out for the soul food.  Having some understanding of the size of the market, I didn't think it would be easy to find. When approaching the market, I was summoned by a combination of a Prince look alike bellowing the lyrics to Kiss and a cloud of smoke which would rival anything short of a three alarm fire.  Smells of BBQ chicken and smoked ribs filled the air as I was told that ""you don't have to be rich to be my girl""...which is cool because I'm not rich...but  I'm not a girl.Bert's on a  Saturday is basically this...a sandwich board menu consisting of everything from polish sausage to a full rack of ribs,  a cash register , an outdoor bar and a smoke and BBQ pit filled with a cast of characters worth watching for a bit. Once you figure out the system (mentioned in other yelps), you receive your order with disposable everything and you're on your way.  Oh..one other thing....get the BBQ sauce.  When they ask you if you want the BBQ sauce it's a statement, not a question. My son, who I don't think knew this, opted for no sauce and  received a friendly look of ""what the hell are you talking about?"" from the cook.   I got the $8 rib snack and he got the half chicken for the same price.  My daughter got the lemonade. The ribs were meaty with a deep smoky taste and the sauce was abundant and tangy.  The chicken was cooked right and had a nice char on the skin.  The lemonade got my daughter's stamp of approval.I have no idea what the inside of this place looks like but any return to the market on a Saturday will mean a return to Bert's BBQ extravaganza wearing a shirt I won't be afraid to spill sauce on."
8/15/2017,3 star rating,"I have been to Bert's several times over the years and love the atmosphere, the music and the drinks!  I'm sure I will go again soon, but I have to admit the food has been very disappointing every time I go. My fried catfish sandwich was white! (See picture ) it did not look like it had been cooked. It tasted OK and was seasoned well but it certainly did not look appetizing. My cousin said her rice was undercooked and the macaroni and cheese tasted old. I believe her because the last time I had macaroni and cheese there it tasted old. I had a taste of my cousin's rib tips they were absolutely delicious. And my other cousin said her turkey burger was cooked to perfection, but all in all that doesn't make up for the disappointing meals I've had there. The only reason that I will continue to go to Bert's Marketplace it's because I really do enjoy the atmosphere the music and drinks are always worth coming back for but I do think we'll start dining somewhere else first."

7/11/2012,4 star rating,"This is straight up BBQ. You start walking through Eastern Market and you first get this smell of, ""oh, someone is BBQ'ing"".  Continue walking and ask yourself, what's that crowd up ahead?  Next you can see the grill with slab after slab of ribs. You know you found a serious BBQ going on.The only unorganized part of the whole experience is, where is the line, do I stand here or there, and getting your food, well, you'll just about ask the same questions. You may have an additional question of, why did they get their food before I did, the you'll ask it again when the next person gets their food and you still haven't.  Then you'll have to ask, what's going on with my order, oh, it's coming right up.  So, stay on top of this.Now you finally received your food. It's good...very good. Wonderfully tender, dunked in a tangy BBQ sauce, falling off the bone fairly easily.  They offer smaller sandwich orders as well so you're not stuck eating a full or half rack.Bert's is a staple of Eastern Market and I would love to stop and pick up a few ribs every time I'm there."

8/20/2016,3 star rating,"We ate lunch here last weekend while visiting Eastern Market. We first smelled the smells and saw the smoke while wandering around and eventually found our way over. Honestly, it was like a moth drawn to the bbq flame for my husband, since leaving Texas we have only had barbecue once. Once in four months. That's sacrilegious for Texans. We ordered from their outdoor stand. I tried to order a hot dog - not ready yet. Tried to order two other things - not ready. These three things were on the menu, lol. I eventually took a stab at pulled pork - BINGO! That they had! Which, honestly, worked out wonderfully because that pulled pork was the best I'd ever had...again, Texan...which means barbecue is a staple. The sauce was perfection, and it soaked into the meat and bun. It made a big ol' mess on my face and hands. Y'all, when you end up licking your fingers and wiping sauce from your face you know the food is GOOD. My husband got ribs and said that they were the best ribs he's ever had. Why three stars? First, why present options that you don't have ready? Second, that shit was EXPENSIVE. For a sandwich, half a rack of ribs, a bottle of water, and a canned Diet Coke we paid nearly $40. No sides. We've NEVER paid that much for so little.  When we have paid that much it has been the meat plus at least a side, and a roll or biscuit. Now, this was delicious...but for nothing else? Come on..."

After a while the drinks arrive, and they're gin and tonic. WTF? Eventually the burger and salad arrived, about an hour and 20 after we sat down, and they're both horrible. Burger was cooked to a dried out hunk with charcoal at the edges, it and the fries were cold and the bun soggy. Salad tasted like it came right out of a bag that was very near the pull date.

My boyfriend went up to the waitress to ask for water and to place our food order since at least three waitresses appeared to be totally overlooking us. We waited for at least 45 minutes with no food in sight after placing our order. We were really hungry and decided to leave and go to Mexican Village. The worse service I have ever experienced. We won't go back there again."

Arrived around 12:30 and the late night band was going full-steam. They were as legit as it gets - I mean these were serious players. Band leader saw I brought my horn with me and told me I could sit in for a tune. Blistering session! Glad they let me hang for the rest of the night.Can't speak to the food. I didn't order anything except a couple beers, and the beer cost a little too much to drink too much of it. Would have been a 2 or 3 star night if the band wasn't as fantastic as it was."

12/19/2013,4 star rating,"Great music, food, and prices!Went to the Wednesday night Jazz show because it was listed on detroitbluessociety.org/….  Great show!  Nice place too.  Some veteran musicians playing smooth jazz classics all night.  The show started promptly at 8 which is great for the dinner crowd (me).  Food was good too and was bargain priced.  I had the tilapia-special; grilled.  It was very nice fish, cooked and seasoned just right, and was a generous portion.  Great sides too.  Bert's website bertsentertainment.com is in Chinese, so don't bother with that.  The entrance is also somewhat hard to find.  I never did find a sign saying Bert's (in the dark), but from all the cars parked outside, I figured something good must be in there.  Definitely going back again."

8/24/2013,4 star rating,"If you're looking for a dive bar that won't get you into trouble, come to Bert's.  The old-school cats can be seen sitting and posing quietly, while you can spot hipsters who nod in appreciation to legendary classics being performed.  I love jazz night most of all...however, the blues band that plays on Saturdays (I think they're called Champagne), has gotten a little stale.  Please, expand your repertoire.The atmosphere is ""it is what it is""--not gimmicky, not swank.  In fact, they need to serve drinks in mason jars to enhance that juke joint feel.  You'll walk onto a black and white checkered floor and practically sit on the stage.  It can get cramped (but isn't that half the fun?) and, the last time I was there, there was one of those machines that have a claw you use to grab a 'prize'.  The only thing is that Bert's prizes are of the (cough) adult kind.  If you know what I mean.  This clue is on me: don't spend more than $5 on that machine.As far as the food goes...good, decent soul food.  Service?  Slower than me solving an algebra problem, so you may want to double up on your drinks because who the hell knows when you'll see your waitress again.Still, Bert's is a nice place to ""lay in the cut"" every once and a while.  It's not a pickup joint, unless you just happen to catch an old geezer's eye, so you can enjoy the music alone, without feeling like you're at a meat market."

10/20/2012,4 star rating,"Slow's would have you believe that St. Louis-style ribs are awful.  Do NOT believe them and come to Bert's!  I was just ambling through Eastern Market, minding my own business, and I just could not ignore the smoke and smell coming from next to Shed 1 of the market.  I did my due diligence on Yelp and then strolled in.  I noticed that the white folks from the market were sitting at the table and black folks were drinking at the bar.  I do not know what that mean about the food.  I sat at the bar because I was by myself.  At 1 in the afternoon, they already had a dude on the stage playing blues - I approve.  The bartender recommended the ribs, so ribs it was.  Holy hell were they good!  Lovely flavor and melt in your mouth tender.  I am not going to tell you that this was healthy, but it had a lot less fat than the delicious taste would indicate.After polishing off the ribs, I decided to check out the karaoke room at back.  That is when $ hit got real.  People take this super seriously and the rest of us are better of because of it.  This is an excellent place to kick off some day-drinking, and there is no better way then hearing some excellent takes on Motown classics.  The folks here come to play and some come dressed to the 9s.  This place is a gem and I am glad the hipsters do not like it."

7/13/2014,1 star rating,"Bert's is very old school. It reminds me of Chuck's Millionaires Club. Very limited selected of modern drinks and don't expect to get suggestions on mixed beverages. The bartender was not attentive and it was just slow, very slow and hot. I was there for an event and the only air was that blowing from the open door. It is now hot in Detroit and being in an establishment without air and the temperature over 80 degrees is bad business. It's just another bar and the warehouse portion is connected to it. The warehouse was dimly lit and lacked AC/ventilation. I can't see how an established business like Bert's could have patrons suffer in this heat. I was sweating bullets. I won't be back for any other event at Bert's. I hope event planners be ware of this problem."
9/7/2015,5 star rating,"Went in yesterday after looking around at the eastern market right across the street.I've been eyeballing this place for quite some time now but it always seemed so busy whenever I'm around which always seemed a bit intimidating. Yesterday it was a little slower so I jumped in & I have to say that I understand why they are always so busy. First thing is first, they always have a bluesy jazzy kind of fellow outside playing live music and it's always so good it kind of lures you in. Also, on the side of the building they have a gentleman manning a HUGE grill outside that lets off the most amazing smells. Not to mention he looks like he means business when he's standing over this massive grill cooking food, that in of itself makes you want to go in.So I go in and the beer is cheap (bottled 4$) the server was incredibly kind and not pushy about us ordering. We've never been there so it took us a while to figure it out. She suggested a Bloody Mary which was hands down one of the best bloody Mary's I've ever had. We settled on grilled chicken and Mac and cheese with collard greens. OH MY... Words can't describe how delicious ALL of it was. It was all so delicious. Seriously folks. You have to go there if you have a chance. Try it. Seriously. I Will be back guaranteed."

6/7/2012,5 star rating,"Wow this place is one of the least gimmicky and most authentic places in Detroit. Whether you are a meat lover or not, walking down the Eastern Market strip and hearing their karaokee from afar, you'll be intrigued. How much more detroit can you get when a guy is singing ""my girl"" while the biggest barbeque party is going on on a saturday afternoon?I dare you to refuse their food once you come across their giant grill full of awesome meats. I couldn't. I got the BBQ ribs and bought their sauce afterwards. It was the best BBQ i have ever had. yes it's better than slow's."
2/23/2009,4 star rating,"This is a true Detroit jazz joint. Sticky menus, small wobbly tables, excellent jazz. Soul food is offered here and I have never had anything I was disappointed with. Macaroni and cheese has real cheese (not velveeta style) and the catfish is crispy on the outside, tender in the middle. However Berts is known for their ribs..expect a flintstone like plate brought to you piping hot with separate dishes for the sides. Ask for extra napkins and dig in..so good. On the weekends its usually a full house...the jazz trios are usually playing their hearts out on stage--this can't be missed."

You just never know.But it's always a good time"

5/21/2011,4 star rating,"Getting the bump up. Delicious food. Superior service. Excellent atmosphere.My last review was judging primarily their outdoor BBQ assembly line, and I suppose I should have forgiven the fact that meat produced in such enormous quantities at once is going to be a LITTLE off-perfect, but the point is really to just get people eating and partying outdoors during the summer. I don't know why I had to be such an ass about it. Yes the meat can get a little dry, but it's really a giant block party in Eastern Market, more or less. Who can't appreciate that?Now that's I've tried the food INSIDE, I'm a fan and I've lost all doubt about their ability to nail some exquisite BBQ. Had the ribs and chicken, with mac and cheese and collard greens. All of it was enough to kill a man with flavor and savoriness. Added a beer on the side, it was really the perfect meal on a rainy day. Not only that, but I showed up a little late in the day and they still went out of their way to accommodate our desperately hungry selves with friendly rapport. Can't wait to go back. WISH the prices were just a few bucks lower, but sometimes you got to shell out for the GOOD STUFF :)"
8/28/2010,3 star rating,"tasty but not good bbq, excellent lemonade, tons o karaoke fun on a Saturday afternoon.The best smelling BBQ in detroit (or at least Eastern Market). They make a great sauce, which is tasty as hell, and adequately covers over the ribs which are not really that great on their own. They tend to be really dry and tough. Good smoke flavor though. They make an excellent lemonade, second only to Kim's Produce on Woodward.  The prices are also jacked up for the portions you get (and quality), making the tasty but sub-par ribs hurt a bit going down. The best value on the menu might be the half-chicken dinner at $8. The best part about Bert's during Eastern Market hours is the outdoor karaoke. The host of the program introduced a singer who was visiting Detroit with his family all the way from Taiwan. The host gave them a pretty warm welcome, and then mentioned how much she loves Thai food and would they come over to her house later... whoops! XD The singer did nail some BeeGees however. The outdoor karaoke patio is as entertaining as it gets. Don't know anything about the reputed jazz and good times that go down after hours, which sounds like a blast. I do know that during the day, your best bet is to just grab a lemonade and listen to the amateur hour for free. Though I'll probably go back to try their gigantic polish sausage on a bun, I'd actually say skip the bbq for other goodies being sold in and around Eastern Market."
8/11/2012,4 star rating,"Love it.  This place is Detroit at its finest.  I only wish I tried this place sooner!It's not the BBQ, it's the experience.  Saturday morning, Eastern Market, with people lined up in the streets listening to outdoor Karaoke -- it's perfect.  Food-wise, it's very decent BBQ.  I would say it's better than Slows.  Ribs are for sure better, with a great fall-off-the-bone bite to them.  Brisket is not better, as they do their brisket like a pulled pork, all ripped apart.  Chicken is comparable.  Also note that they use a wet rub and (not very spicy) sauce rather than a dry rub, so if that's your thing, you'll be plenty happy.  It's very casual, so bring casual people.  You'll be eating with your hands, struggling with plastic flatware, and using paper towel the entire time.  And you'll love every minute of it."

8/19/2010,5 star rating,"After an afternoon of getting local produce and Michigan honey at the Eastern Markets, I had to find some nearby food before heading to the DIA and with so many options, I'm very lucky to have found Bert's.  Part of the allure had to be the wealth of patrons that filled up the outside tables listening to music and having fun on a Saturday afternoon.  A continuous number of people made their way to the singing stage were jazz and old school songs were performed.  Enjoying a wonderful sunny summer day at Bert's allowed me to really kick back and enjoy my BBQ chicken and fresh squeezed lemonade.  I wasn't quite in the mood for ribs even though they looked delicious as well; I went with the chicken because it was not as messy in my opinion.  The chicken was superb and not spicy at all.  The girl at Bert's squeezed the lemonade right in front of  you and dumped in a large scoop of sugar for good measure.  How refreshing and what a great outdoor Detroit experience!!!"
9/28/2014,5 star rating,"You will be drawn to Bert's because of its drool-inducing BBQ smell and live music. It is a great place for resting your feet after hours spent at the Eastern Market farmers market. No need to wait long to eat when ordering at the smoker outside. Or get seated inside and order from the full menu. Sit on the patio listening to Caribbean, Zydeco, blues, jazz music. Bert's like many long-standing small Detroit food venues has a speak-easy feel. And I hope it doesn't change as the city transitions."

Normally, i stop into Bert's for the people and the music. Known around town as one of the ultimate jazz clubs, Bert's definitely has gotten a reputation over the decades as one of Detroit's finest jazz joints around. If you're looking for a true Detroit experience, Bert's is a great place to start.This legendary joint is always filled with the coolest jazz cats and locals around. Even when I've stopped in for drinks with some of my indie rock Irish pals, the folks at Bert's welcomed us into their home.As far as the jazz goes, it's a lot of classic old time jazz with a lot of kick. Often times, there's a great vocalist singing along. The atmosphere is nothing surprising, smokey, dimly light joint.

After a while the drinks arrive, and they're gin and tonic. WTF? Eventually the burger and salad arrived, about an hour and 20 after we sat down, and they're both horrible. Burger was cooked to a dried out hunk with charcoal at the edges, it and the fries were cold and the bun soggy. Salad tasted like it came right out of a bag that was very near the pull date. A totally wasted Saturday evening; on my way out I noticed a t-shirt that said ""Save Bert's"", and my immediate thought was ""why?"""
1/18/2010,5 star rating,"I love coming here for jazz.  My favorite time though is actually on Wednesdays and Thursdays for the jam sessions.  They usually have the same trio on piano, drums, and bass, all awesome musicians, and customers join in with guitars, vibrophones, sax, trumpet, flute, and any other suitable jazz instrument.  My wife is a jazz vocalist and it's always a good time seeing her sing with some of detroit's local musicians.I haven't had much of the food, but what i've had was decent.   I think i had a pork chop once, and maybe some fried chicken.  I've never been here on the summer nights when they grill or bbq on the sidewalk.  I'm going to make a point of trying that out this summer."
5/18/2014,4 star rating,"Love. So much love. In the food, in the music, in the service - in my heart for this place at 2 a.m. All the sides feel like cooked hugs, and the cakes are enough to keep you in deep sleep for days. One of my favorite spots in Detroit - period."
8/23/2014,4 star rating,"Bert's is incredible, with some of the best live Jazz music in the city, hands down. Thursday open mic night is always a blast, not only for the fun and engaging environment but also, once again, the level of quality found in the performers. Not to mention the ribs! Rivaling if not exceeding the flavor and quality you'll get at Slows any day.. There are two main reasons why I gave Bert's a 4.  The first is due to the service staff being rather inattentive on nearly every occasion I've been in (referring to bar area only, not bistro).. Also, the beer selection is terrible and I'll be honest, pretty overpriced. $6 for a Killians bottle..which is about as close as you'll come to a microbrew there. Compliment sandwich here though! The place is honestly fantastic.. It literally feels like you've stepped back in time, to a better place where people come and enjoy great music, food and experiences, together. Only appreciation and respect are given from the lively and interactive crowd. There is a reason why I come back again and again. A Detroit must-see."
7/27/2012,4 star rating,"Serious BBQ on a Saturday during the Eastern Market!By serious, I mean that not only do you get to enjoy ribs, you get to experience outdoor Motown KARAOKE. We tried walking past the place but the smoke and the smells were too distracting. We were a little confused about the line -- first you have to pay and use the receipt as the ticket, then hand it to the people at the grill. The bf got an $8 rib snack, which is actually 4 ribs (wet ribs). I tasted them and they were pre-tty good! But even better was the karaoke. People are just having a good time, dancing out in the open air, some sitting in the shade. There was a guy who was an amazing whistler.We came about 3pm, and then we were back in the area at 7pm... and they were still at it even when everyone else had closed up shop! Amazing."
3/10/2014,1 star rating,Food wasnt good sloppy packaged another place that lacks smoke flavor.  Maybe it was because i order the turkey and chicken. The sides were horrible i wouldn't recommend this place for bbq.
11/3/2013,4 star rating,"We love Bert's. The food is delicious and the music is great. We have been numerous times to the open jam on Thurs. You never know who's gonna show up to play and the house band is phenomenal. The staff is really sweet too. Yep, one of our favorite places to chill."
7/2/2014,4 star rating,We knew of this place for years but never tried it but yesterday (Tuesday) we did.  The smell is awesome and it is a landmark in the Eastern Market area.  I tried the sausage and my partner tried the chicken.  Both very good but not the best we have ever had.  It is the people and the place itself that bumped it up to a full 4 stars.  Great staff!  I will try the ribs next time.
10/27/2013,1 star rating,"My review my be a little biased because I've only been here once, and it was for a Halloween party last night.  They clearly didn't sell enough tickets/promote the event well enough.  It was less than 1/3 full (I'd say closer to 1/10th full, actually).  Cool setup, nice decorations, but... It's almost a good thing it wasn't busier.  Even at 10% capacity the slow staff still had trouble turning out drinks.  There were plenty of complaints about the food (cold, undercooked chicken, over cooked burgers), and what I saw of it, it just looked like mediocre bar food.  I wasn't impressed to say that least.  I'll give it another shot when I'm down there for yard supplies in the Spring."
8/22/2012,4 star rating,"This place is a really easy going good time. We came here for the first time tonight, about 10:30 on a Friday. It was about half full in here. We ordered ""dinners"" no menus. I had a carryout container with ribs, greens and macaroni n cheese.  My fiancé had fried chicken, green beans, and Mac n cheese. Well the food was great, homemade. Couldn't do better at a family reunion.  The live jazz was surprisingly good with real musicians doing real improvs. Very talented and exciting to watch.  By 11:15 it was packed so obviously a lot of people come here for the music. Held back a star because they could do a touch more with the atmosphere. Still a really nice vibe here tho.  Check it out!"
1/8/2010,4 star rating,"Haven't been in a couple years but this is what a jazz spot should be like. Food is good - but don't expect anything fancy here. You're here for the music, and the players are out of this world.I liked the dark vibe of the place and how it was across the street from an empty marketplace lot. Parking lot was like something you expect at a FedEx shipping dock.As a venue space, Bert's has definitely grown and added different sections over the years - a good sign for this place! Still, if you want to check out the local jazz scene in Detroit, Bert's is where you need to be."
3/1/2014,5 star rating,"Wowser, the BEST greens in a decade...I have been all over the country in search of good-great greens and some good soul/southern cooking....Finally in all places, Detroit...I should have known there is no place like home! BBQ pulled pork was fantastic and the collard greens are out of this world, the only thing I would suggest is to clean/freshen up the place, it felt dirty. And man the prices at first seemed steep but then I saw the portion size."
10/26/2008,4 star rating,"Great jazz staple in Eastern Market.  As mentioned, Thursdays are the night for jazz.A good extensive soul food menu, heavy on the meat.  They can usually be seen grilling right out front in the mid-afternoon while the weather is nice.Saturday evenings they also do karaoke of which I am a fan, and that is a guaranteed good time."
7/26/2015,1 star rating,"There were four of us who tried Bert's on Saturday afternoon. The waitress greeted us with complaints about how busy she was; took our drink orders; and came back 15 minutes later for our food order--without our drinks.  She returned a half hour later to take our food order, and we asked if she could bring our drinks, which arrived 15 minutes later. Our food arrived 30 minutes after we ordered, but she forgot utensils, napkins, and condiments. Food was getting cold so hubby went in search of needed items. He observed her moving around as though very busy but actually doing nothing. One in our party asked twice for tartar sauce and was nearly finished with his meal before it finally arrived. Food was not bad, but the place was very dirty and wait staff obviously were clueless and lazy. We won't be back."
11/18/2013,4 star rating,"Simply, we had an exceptionally fun time.  It was apparent that we were ""out of towners"" and we were treated like royalty.  Great music and just a great place.  Food is basic, but hits the spot.  Catfish on Wonder bread...well....it was good.  Bartending capabilities were limited, but the atmosphere was so fun, who cares."
6/20/2013,5 star rating,"I have only experienced Bert's in the late evening early morning hours. Came with friends after our party ended at nearby (unnamed) frat house. First time I went was several years ago now when I was drinking the then popular Green Apple Martinis so my mood might have been good anywhere. But, that said, I came back for the fried Catfish and Whitefish dinners or sandwiches. Yum. Was welcomed by all despite my lack of pigmentation. Ahem. I love the people who work there, who go there, lots of fun had by all."
9/6/2015,1 star rating,Really bad food! The ribs were so tough and cold!  We couldn't eat them and we waited 45 minutes for this sub par food. Honestly do not bother eating here!!
7/13/2015,2 star rating,I attended karoke on Saturday and the lady bartender outside had the worst attitude that I have ever experienced. She was so nasty. She must be related to the owner.They need to check her.
2/2/2013,4 star rating,After walking around the Eastern Market we were a bit hungry and wanted a drink as well.  This place was fun.  The wife had her first taste of soul food and we laughed and enjoyed the karaoke!  We will definetly take friends when they visit us.
12/1/2012,1 star rating,"Steer clear of this place!  I don't know how there are so many positive reviews (clearly Bert must be writing them himself).  I don't usually write reviews but I had to inform the public on this one. We stopped in here before a Lions game.  It was the most horrible dining experience ever.  The waitress was chomping on gum the whole time, was extremely slow through the whole process even though there was barely any customers.  We were told we couldn't order a slice of pizza (even though it was on the menu). I ordered a chicken caesar sandwich and what I got was burnt chicken scraps in a white bread hotdog bun with melted cheese on it. No dressing or anything. My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and received ribs (on the bone) on a piece of untoasted Texas toast.  My third friend was told much later they were out of the chicken for his order (he ate fries). When the bill eventually came it had three orders on it. She corrected it by deducting $2 off the bill. (Apparently the fries cost more when you get them alone than with a sandwich- which they couldn't make from being out of the ingredients). The place is filthy, and the mens bathroom is a sink, urinal, and toilet... No dividers. It was uncomfortable washing my hands with a guy pissing right next to the sink. This stop took over an hour and we almost missed kickoff... In retrospect we should have ate at the game. The only thing that I did enjoy was the live blues but I would never come back, even for just a beer. Never again."
5/18/2013,1 star rating,Terrible food. Terrible service. Took 2 hrs for food. Music was bad. Ribs were dry and overcooked.
5/9/2015,1 star rating,I smelled the BBQ on the grill out front and i couldnt reaist stopping in for lunc.  The reviews about the place being disorganized are spot on.  The food was average at best.  The ribs were tough and I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce either.  The collard greens were so bad that I only ate 1 fork full.   The mac and cheese wasn't great but it was ok and said my lunch.  Not planning to return.
12/11/2011,5 star rating,"my first love in detroit is bert dearing and his staff and patrons at bert's marketplace.  arrived in late february and have been a ""regular fixture"" there --- sans a few months working...was just there again this weekend and reminded of why i love bert, his staff and his patrons.  bert was and is my first friend in detroit and i am thankful for his ambience and his life he breeds into detroit.  i hope to emulate his enthusiasm and love and attention for this city. each time i am there, i am more happy than the last.  each time i leave, i cannot wait to get back. also, the music, entertainment, other locals, regulars, eastern market type PRICELESS! visitors to bert's equally as amusing and interesting.  thank you bert and staff!loving being a part of the family!cheers, xiang cclc"
2/24/2011,1 star rating,"STAY AWAY!My car was stolen from Bert's guarded parking lot.  Yes, Bert is kind enough to hire security staff to give customers a false sense of security.  While the night out was fun, the drama of dealing with a stolen vehicle, being stranded in Detroit after midnight, etc. was NOT WORTH THE PRICE."
3/10/2014,1 star rating,"If you are a white person looking to experience flat out racism (actual denial of service, people elbowing each other at the bar to point you out to their companions), this is a great place to come on a Monday night."
8/30/2008,4 star rating,"Come out here on a Saturday afternoon before or after you leave the Eastern Market. They are usually grilling in the front of the place, enticing people to stop by with the barbecue aromas. If you are a meat-lover, than you will definitely enjoy the great taste of their ribs, chicken and hamburgers. Add that to a mix of jazz, and it will definitely cause you to take an early nap when you leave."
8/7/2010,4 star rating,"I had my first experience at Bert's today while shopping at Eastern Market.   I was lured in by the intoxicating smell of the grills since they cook out on the sidewalk on Saturdays.  I had the ribs, which were very good (the sauce, which is optional, is thin but really tasty), although I was really tempted by the chicken.  According to the woman behind me in line, the chicken is great, and the woman at my table (also a first-timer) marveled at ""the best hot dog she'd ever eaten.""  $14 for a half-rack isn't super cheap and I think they could give a full ear of corn with it for that much, but I don't know if I would have had room for side dishes since I was really into eating the delicious ribs.  The lemonade is refreshing.  It's made to order right in front of you.  They don't make it in a big batch, but rather make your glass by squeezing lemons and shaking with water and sugar.  Simple, but tasty and it definitely hit the spot and is way better than stuff you'd get at a chain restaurant.Don't expect anything fancy.  The atmosphere outside is like being in someone's backyard, but it was a relaxing way to spend part of my Saturday afternoon.  There's karaoke going on at that time and people were having a genuinely good time.  I'll definitely be back."
5/25/2015,2 star rating,i had my first visit to Bert's Place this weekend for an event a family member was hosting.  While waiting for him to arrive I decided to order the Rib Dinner since I have heard some amazing things about this place over the years.  I was so disappointed.  The rib tips were burnt and tough.  I don;t know what happened but the ribs on the grill looked wonderful but what I got was not good at all.  Very disappointed.  I had expected so much better because of the reputation that has been with Bert's Place for so many years.  I waited for at least a half hour for this.  The only thing that was worth the money I paid for was the Peach Cobbler.
9/29/2011,5 star rating,"Best BBQ in the midwest!  Chicken is moist and juicy, ribs tender and flavorful.  I ordered the fried catfish for the kids and that was very good too, just the right amount of spices and not too much batter like other places.  The chef (tall and fat w/ big belly, i think his name was Bert) preparing the BBQ under the tent is very professional and has all his employees on a tight grip as everyone was very friendly.  Atmosphere is great, lots of people having a good time, and overall safe.  Most importantly, food is what drives me to go there every time and it is always worth the trip!"
6/24/2014,5 star rating,da ribs.......great and the blues live to go with it cant be beat str8 up Detroit here
7/15/2010,5 star rating,"Here at Berts tonight, Thursday, July 15; great live jazz jam sessions by Detroit's local musicians and Thursday's house trio, SBH.  Cover is very minimal and the jazz is extremely good!  Live music until 1:30am and I'm often surprised by outstanding non-local musicians participating in the jam sessions.Berts also has live jazz on Friday's until 3am.
