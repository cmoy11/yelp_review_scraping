I honestly had no clue what it was and just assumed it was a clothing brand since she kept saying she wanted to buy a shirt. I came in with the intent of window shopping but ended up spending every second I was in there immersed in all of the unique items made by black entrepreneurs in beautiful eye catching displays. I loved how each display explained the history of the brand and its creators. You could find everything from beard kits, to furniture, to tea, greeting cards and clothing items... it really just depends on what is on display at the time you visit!When in the area, I highly recommend stopping by this store! You may end up finding something you didn't know you needed and ""buy black"" while doing it!"

Despite all the hype and noise, the store was simply not supported by the local community.  The first comment shoppers made was ""Their prices are so high!""Most Detroiters are TJ Max shoppers; they don't appreciate,  nor can they afford the prices here.Too bad; unfortunately it was doomed from the start, and despite the rent concessions the landlord made, it never had a chance."

It's a little pricey, but definitely worth supporting this creative business! The gentleman who was helping me was incredibly friendly and charismatic! I'll be back in the future."

The quality of the clothing is amazing, it's so soft and you can tell they really care , even the feel of the journal he bought caught me by surprise!"

I passed by it on a walk along Woodward one day and, though I was in a rush, made an internal note to return the following day.The gentleman on the floor was lovely and helpful, and I tried on several of their hallmark pieces (the ones that are self-titled). The materials they use feel like butter (I didn't even know a cotton blend could be that soft), and I ended up purchasing a sweatshirt because, hey, we're heading into fall and I don't want style to be lost on me, even as the temperature dips.They also carry a signature line of makeup products, which I only came across on my way out of the store. I tried several of their lip glosses, which go on well, and ended up with purchase #2.Another reviewer had mentioned that the line feels ""pretentious"" and like a ""cheap capitalization of the city's renaissance"", but I respectfully disagree. I think Detroit is a city with many faces, some of which are changing and evolving over time, and 'Détroit Is the New Black' is reflective of this."

First I think the name is insulting to the city and a cheap capitalization of the city's renaissance.  Second, Detroit does not use an 'accent' mark over our 'E'.  Adding one is pretentious and shows how far removed you are as a retailer from what the city wants.The clothes are overpriced and of poor quality.  The store reminds me of a Linda Dresner, but in Detroit as opposed to Birmingham.  Get real."
