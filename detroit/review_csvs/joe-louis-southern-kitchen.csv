The ladies applying her eyelashes at the front desk while people are waiting. Still never got my food had to be refunded and did not receive my tip back or any further compensation for my time wasted or the money I used to park for an hour. ABSOLUTE TRASH!!"
6/2/2022,3 star rating,First time visiting since they relocated from around the corner. At the previous location the fried chicken wings were crispy and delicious. That has not changed. The wings are tasty and excellent. I also had the gumbo with the buttered rice on the side. The rice was delicious. I cannot recommend the gumbo. I'd avoid it. Also had the buttermilk biscuit. Avoid that also. It was hard and tough. My guest had scrambled eggs which were fluffy and the spicy sausage which were thoroughly enjoyed.
5/24/2022,5 star rating,We loved the food I had some   and they were . I also went again and had the shrimp & salmon  Omelet. Which was also good. I added American cheese. That was a no no.But it was still delicious!We support Black Owned businesses!Keep up the the good food and great staff!
5/17/2022,3 star rating,I recently have been ordering from this place quite often and have recommended it to friends and strangers because I really like it...but my past couple of orders have been missing items and the customer service I received on one order was terrible. I know as humans we are bound to error but please don't make this a normal.
5/8/2022,5 star rating,"The food was delicious!  I had chicken and a waffle, and the waffle was fluffy, and tasty.  The chicken wings were seasoned well and very good.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The place is always packed with people waiting in line, in the vestibule, or outside the door, and now I know why.  This was me and my husband's first time eating here as we were in from out of town for the weekend.  We tried to go back on Sunday but the wait was so long that they weren't even taking more names."
5/7/2022,2 star rating,"So my husband and I went for are Foodie trip to Detroit to try something new and stopped at Joe Louis Southern Kitchen.  We looked at the menu prior to going and was impressed by what we saw.  We had a 45 minute wait which wasn't bad for early Saturday afternoon.  The decor was very unique and enjoyable. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with what we selected. I ordered the Catfish and Gumbo. The catfish had decent flavor but had thick and very hard crust.  The gumbo was the worst. It looked like chicken and rice soup swimming in greasy butter.  I tried stirring it to get to the goodness but didn't work.  I only was able to eat half because my stomach began feeling upset from the grease.  The 2 stars are for the decor and the service.  The wait staff was very friendly.  Maybe it was a bad day and just what we ordered but I will not be returning."
5/6/2022,5 star rating,"This place is super cute AND it is black owned. It gives a classic, old school vibe which I absolutely loved. The restrooms are also very cutesie. I tend to never get juice/soda at restaurants but the option of strawberry orange juice peaked my interest and it was yum!Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu, prompt, and offered honest feedback and recommendations, which we truly appreciated. My main dish was the unique Southern Cobbler French Toast . I have never seen this on any brunch/breakfast restaurant menu that I have been to. It was definitely a pleasant, tasty first experience. WITHOUT syrup, these French toast were BOMB... now just take a moment to imagine it WITH syrup. Lol. I also had the seafood omelette (side note: it is definitely not called that on the menu). I think this was also my first time having a seafood styled omelette. My taste buds had to get acclimated to the blends, however, with each bite it got more scrumptious and more scrumptious. The potatoes were also a hit too. If ever in the city and area, I would definitely recommend you stop by and try them out."
5/6/2022,2 star rating,"The ambiance and decor is nice with a homey comfortable feeling but the food is not all that great. We arrived here in a party of two people around 10:00a or so and yes there is a awaiting list and line. We waited around 45 mins to be seated. Yes, there is parking on the street where we did run out of time and received a ticket, so get more than ample time on the meter. We were finally seated our waitress was efficient but not really welcoming. I ordered the shrimp and grits, something about the after taste on the sausages didn't set well with me. The grits were kinda thick and stiff and the dish didn't have a good taste overall. Orange juice was orange juice. I was looking forward to this being a great meal. The person I was with ordered the fish and grits and they said it wasn't great either. Both of us left food on the table. Maybe if I go back again I'll have a better experience."
5/1/2022,5 star rating,Amazing ambiance. Service was prompt and the food... wooooooThe banana fosters french toast is a winner!!!
4/26/2022,3 star rating,"Went on a Sunday was advised it was a 1-1:30 hour wait for 2 ppl which was fine gave the host my number for the list. 5 mins later I notice I never received a text indicating I was put on the list so I went and asked the host was I suppose to get a text she said no, you'll only get a text when the table is ready. After 45 mins went and checked she said it was still a wait after a hour and 30 mins past I asked her again. She had never put my name on the list but immediately sat us after I said something. Food was good however the process of actually being sat was not such a good experience"
4/19/2022,4 star rating,"The ambiance is really nice & the food is reasonably priced. My complaint is only with the service. As good as the food was, it came luke warm like it had been sitting & not delivered to us once it was ready. There were many other instances where there were issues with the service we received & the frequent delays from our waitress which further explains why our food came warm."

1/27/2022,5 star rating,Went here today everything was really good. The atmosphere was cute. Loved seeing Joe Louis was nice he was so handsome. It was a bit cold in there glad i had on a sweater.
4/19/2022,1 star rating,Nightmare on Woodward1 hour wait + 45 more for foodNo soap or paper towels in the bathroom. I wonder how employees wash their hands...My food was cold my sister had a hair cooked into her waffleMe: Can I get chicken and waffles but sub waffles for pancakes?Waitress: sure!She failed to mention there would be a $9 up charge!
1/9/2022,3 star rating,"I have wanted to try Joe Louis Southern Kitchen since Summer 2021. I was excited to try out the restaurant last week Wednesday finally. I arrived a little after 9:30 am. I parked in a parking lot around the corner for $5, which isn't bad at all for Downtown. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I was greeted immediately and was able to sit down right away. I was a little surprised to see that the restaurant was not crowded, and I am not sure if this is the norm on weekdays or if this was a combination of Covid/Weather. After sitting down, a server came over to the table to take my drink order and show me the digital menu. I mentioned to her that I was waiting on another person to join. As soon as the other person in my party arrived, we placed our order. I had my heart set on the red velvet waffles and chicken. I was pleased that I could substitute the chicken wings out for chicken tenders. The other person in my party ordered a plain waffle and chicken tenders. The food did not take long to come out, but upon inspection and before trying out a chicken tender. I noticed that it appeared to be super dry. It was confirmed about 2 minutes later that the chicken tenders were very dry, tough, and not hot. The waffle was the saving grace, honestly. It was pretty good, but it didn't seem super hot. When I go out to eat, I love getting my hot food served hot if dining in. The other person in my party brought it to the Server's attention that our chicken tenders were not hot and were kind of dry/tough. She brought out more tenders, but this batch was pretty much the same. My theory is that the tenders need to be tenderized with a meat tenderizer or cut into a smaller size. There is a science to cooking white meat, and unfortunately, many places overcook chicken breast and tenders, causing the meat to be tough and dry. I'm not sure if our Server noticed that we did not like the second batch, but we were not asked if we did and were given our checks immediately. The restaurant was not crowded, maybe 2-3 groups. This was a turn-off because it was clear that we didn't enjoy our meal's main portion (chicken tenders). We paid and left the restaurant shortly after. If I am being transparent, I was a little disappointed. I had such high hopes and was let down. However, I will come back to dine in again, it will have to be on a weekday early in the morning, and I definitely will not order the chicken tenders again lol!"
1/8/2022,5 star rating,"I had been wanting to get in to try the food here for a while. While perusing DoorDash to support local business, I found them listed and decided to place an order. I received the Original Chicken and Waffle. The waffle was a Belgian waffle, buttery and golden brown. The chicken wings what accompanied were fried to perfection, juicy yet crisp. The waffle came with a heap of butter and a sliced strawberry. I added banana to mine. It was truly a treat. I can't wait to get in to experience the location firsthand and try more of their offerings."
7/1/2021,5 star rating,My food - correction...my entire group's me was amazing!  I had the Knockout Catfish Acadian. Best lunch ever!TY Memory for your A1 service!  #Iwillbeback #damnthatwasgood
6/18/2021,4 star rating,Clean and cordial service. The pancakes are EXCELLENT!!! Fluffy and not over cooked. I wasn't a fan of the Hollandaise sauce so I didn't enjoy the omelette as I would have liked but I'll definitely be coming back again. The decor is well done and inviting.
4/14/2022,5 star rating,The cinnamon roll pancakes are criminally great. I just found a new breakfast spot in the D
12/19/2021,5 star rating,I'm loving everything about this place. The menu was eclectic and had many options. Service was good and the food met my expectations. Recommend getting on the waitlist online. This place is going to be taking off. No refills on the lemonade which they made clear on the menu. Portions were good! Street parking so you may have to walk a little.
4/7/2022,3 star rating,"I had a carry-out order, which was ready right as I arrived. For future visits, I will eat in store as you do have to pay for parking. The hostess that greeted me was extremely kind and helpful, so that is even more reason to stay and eat next time! Now the food, was good. I order the original turkey leg as well has the catfish sandwich with fries. It was good and reasonably priced for the portions you receive. Overall, a good black owned eatery near campus."
2/25/2022,3 star rating,"Few things to note: 1. this meal is divine! Seasoning is on point and a fulfilling serving size. 2. No reservations 3. Kitchen was delayed 4. Staff was nice and polite 5. Parking meters or paid parking lots in surrounding area.  Three stars because I requested to be added to waitlist and shortly received a text stating I was removed w/o reason and to call restaurant.  Well, I received no responses.  Needless to say, trying to confirm waitlist was a complete mess.  After confirming- we were #8 to be seated for over 183 mins!!.   I suggest arriving when the doors open and not hungry lol.  To each it's own with this one."
3/26/2022,1 star rating,"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time and finally did yesterday.The staff were very polite.  What I ordered was not that great, my food was Luke warm as if it had been sitting on a shelf before being served.  I ordered turkey sausage patties, however the waitress informed me that she didn't think they had any.  I did not want  links, but I received them anyway and they were HORRIBLE.My friend ordered chicken and waffles.  Waffle was delicious, the chicken had NO seasoning and tasted as if it were fried in the same oil that they fried fish in.  I Pray that this establishment stays in business, but they need to pay more attention to the preparation of their food.  NOT a fan."
3/5/2022,2 star rating,"It was a regular Saturday, so wouldn't say too busy but we walked in and out our name on the list. The lady told us 49 minutes or less. The 40 minutes turned almost a 2 hour wait. Got to the table and waited 15 minutes to even be brought water.This was a TERRIBLE experience for it to be my FIRST TIME here. I get places are short staffed but effective communication and kindness would go a long way. The waitress didn't even say ""I'm sorry for the wait"", ""how y'all doing today"" all we got was a ""what can I get for you"""

8/7/2021,4 star rating,Good food with nice size portions. Venue feels like sitting on someone's back porch. Food was good. Several patrons complained about their grits not being cooked long enough. Overall a good experience!
5/15/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent! They've done a great job with the interior and the food and service was just as good. It looks a lot different on the inside than you would expect. Kudos to the designer.We had the shrimp and grits and the cinnamon swirl flapjacks. Both were amazing. I'm still thinking about the shrimp & grits. They're done in a Cajun style and absolutely delicious. The portions were huge as well.We were there on the day after opening but you wouldn't know it. The service was excellent, and our server Ke'airia (sp?) couldn't have been any better. Thank you!Once word gets out, this place will be packed every weekend."
1/2/2022,5 star rating,Food was creative and delicious! The restaurant interior is very charming. Service was amazing.
2/26/2022,1 star rating,Let me start by saying I'm an avid supporter of black owned business. I will never eat at this establishment again. I'm not even upset about the hour and 20 minute wait to be seated. I'm not even going to complain about how unorganized the hostesses are. My main gripe is the HOUR we waited to get our food after we ordered. What was more frustrating is the couple that sat down right before us and right after us received their food and finished eating before we received our food. The waitress kept disappearing for long stretches so I ended up going to the hostess about our food. She told me the kitchen was slammed. I asked her to explain her people after us received their food and were finished. I got the deer in the headlights look. We finally got our food which was wrong but who wants to wait another hour. The good was average. The manager came out and gave us a lame excuse about tickets getting mixed. Why wasn't our waitress checking on our food like she said???? The $10 discount did not make up for the horrible experience. I will NEVER eat there again. Learn how to conduct business!!!!
4/16/2022,1 star rating,"We were a family party of six and was told our party could not be seated together.  Our party was divided in two parties of three people and we couldn't have tables next to each other.  We waited 45 minutes to be seated and then waited another 30 minutes to receive our food.  Our server had two tables ( it was not busy).  My table ordered gumbo, fried catfish sandwich and shrimp/ grits.  When our food arrived it was cold.   Cold food served with a smile from our server Kimisha.  We asked that the food be reheated, but it returned lukewarm.  I was very disappointed because it was our first time at this restaurant.  My sisters and brother food was warm and delicious when I inquired.  The hostess was kind and welcoming.  She listened to me as I stated my concerns.  I will not be returning."

10/6/2021,3 star rating,"Popular Detroit restaurant ""new center eatery"" has reopened as the Joe Louis Southern Kitchen. The interior of the restaurant replicates a house with exquisite details honoring Joe Louis. Food was good, chicken tenders were a little dry. Service needs improvement"
9/19/2021,4 star rating,"I absolutely love this concept and can't believe the great Joe Louis hasn't been honored in this way before. I took my mother who is in her 80's and remembers how beloved Joe Louis was and her parents used to visit his farm in Shelby Township. The decor is reminiscent of the farm. The food was really good! We all loved the waffles and the loaded potatoes were amazing! I had chicken and waffles. Chicken was okay but next time I would get the skillet. Service was a bit slow as they are experiencing the same issues as all restaurants with finding help. Wasn't slow enough to deter me from coming back though. Although we ate light, we loved it and are definitely coming back with more family and friends."
11/21/2021,2 star rating,"Very disappointed! At first, was not going to write a review but after 24 hours I'm still frustrated about my experience with the hostesses and the manager, they were not very empathetic or helpful to me about missing an important part of my food order. I was really hoping for a great experience. I am a foodie and always looking for great food options and a great dining experience. I'm not sure this restaurant will be open too long after novelty wears off, unless they step it up. As for me, its not worth returning. Even to pick up my missing food item: The food was just OKRude HostessesMissing items in carry-out order-Frustrating!Incompetent manager"
8/15/2021,1 star rating,"I really wanted this to be a nice experience. I am a big supporter of Small Businesses & Particularly Black Owned. My 1st experience was really good I went back again & the service was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Young inexperienced Management., Immature waitresses. The restaurant don't seat parties larger than 4 people. ( including if the 5th guest is a child) Our party was for 5 & Our expectations was to dine 2gether in one setting. We were told we would be seated at 2 separate tables..I asked if we could be seated in close proximity of each other.The food the 2nd time around decent..Would I go back? Absolutely NOT..The setting is very small & Its seems as if you expressed any form of dissatisfaction to the staff regarding the service its passed on to the entire staff & every1 seems to give you Foul looks & whispers. As mentioned my party was separated one table received our meal in Really good timing..The second table never received their food.. I asked for the manager & I asked why the delay & I expressed my dissatisfaction after waiting almost 45 mins after being seated. The manager went to the kitchen & brought out the meal & Was intentional with Never connecting back advising what the issue was, he wasn't apologetic about the Situation. I expressed my disappointment with the entire ordeal & I Will never return.. I hope they will use my experience as an example & treat other guest . More accordingly moving forward."
3/13/2022,1 star rating,Have tried to order from this business but can never get it in.  They close at 4:PM which is to early for dinner and say what time they stop taking orders and no phone orders.  Needs to update the listing so it is current to what is available.
1/27/2022,4 star rating,"cinnamon role pancakes are out of this world. it can get very busy so definitely recommend adding your name to the waitlist online in advance. service can be a little slow and prices are moderate but food is definitely flavorful and worth a trip! street parking can usually be found pretty easily on one of the side streets. overall definitely solid brunch option in the city! as a note, they do not serve alcohol."
7/30/2021,1 star rating,THE OWNER OMFG THE MOST ARROGANT PERSON EVER. ILL NEVER RETURN HERE. EVER ! It's apparent people are used to Mediocre Food filled with LIES. This restaurant SERVES SWAI and calls it CATFISH. I ordered Apple caramel waffles that says they're INFUSED with Fresh apples. Wasn't a got damn Apple infused in it. So they brung me the wrong waffle at first. Which was a plain Jane waffle with strawberries. I sent it back and informed them that it wasn't what I ordered. The audacity of these mfa's to bring back the exact same waffles and just added 4 slices of apples on it. ARE U SERIOUS. So you're just gonna play in my face and bring me the same thing. Then they brung me the exact same thing again. My other friend that's a chef ordered peach cobbler pancakes. There was no peach cobbler just canned peaches on top. The shrimp and grits ....comical. The grits were pure white. NO SEASONINGS WHAT SO EVER. I mean wtf so y'all don't season the grits. I ordered my eggs scrambled soft. They were hard as hell. My mom who's also a successful traveling chef had the CATFISH WELL SWAI SANDWICH. The fish was undercooked. My other friends fake as SWAI catfish was undercooked. I mean how tf are you tryna pass off SWAI as catfish. Man I can keep going I can't believe it. I swear I can't. And we were still gonna pay the fucking bill. But the manager was a total jackass. We even explained to him we were still gonna pay we just wanted you to know about our experience.. THE JERK HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK US IF WE WERE STILL GONNA PAY THEN WHY WAS HE THERE. MY EXPERIENCE HERE WAS HORRIBLE. TOTAL BULLSHIT. TOTAL BULLSHIT. This place....I was so got damn excited to try this place. I'm so hot I can't even type everything. I'm so upset omg.
9/15/2021,1 star rating,Eat before you arrive cause you willstarve before your food arrives.  I heard they were slow before trying this place but I had faith.  I'm here now arrived at 11 and now it's 12:40 still waiting.  They say they lost the ticket when I finally asked.  I have an appointment starting soon and now I'm gonna HANGRY :(
8/9/2021,4 star rating,The design and atmosphere of Joe Louis Southern kitchen is totally amazing. I just wish my chicken was cooked a little bit more and it was a tad pink in the inside my cinnamon roll pancake was amazing just wish my chicken was cooked a tad bit more.
8/8/2021,2 star rating,"Unfortunately, not great. Wait was way too long (Sunday afternoon). Waffle was okay, cream cheese icing was lacking, chicken strips are fairly bland and fried so hard that I'm having a hard time swallowing them :-/ Not sure if I'll give them another try, as I'm pretty underwhelmed."
2/13/2022,1 star rating,"I have yet to have a to go successfully fulfilled. They miss the cheese, the egg, or a whole chicken breast. They don't season the eggs at all. The texture and flavor of their Turkey sausage is nasty. Only order whole meals for its no substitution otherwise you'll be disappointed. Order from here several times to support and only once was my order actually tasty. The second time they gave me a biscuit with egg and cheese, no meat. That was good the only time time the biscuit was actually good, the next time they served a stringy old chicken breast and the best thing was the biscuit. This place has terrible service. Horrible bad and the food could be good, all the potential but they're lazy and lackluster"
4/9/2022,1 star rating,"This place is nasty I feel like everybody hype this place up for no reason let's talk about it first off the waitress had a attitude from the jump me and my cousin placed our order I asked for the JLSK rise and shine with sausage links grits and hash browns, my cousin got salmon and catfish with a skillet, another got chicken and waffles,and the other got banana foster French toast my plate had some links they was mushy in the middle brunt on the out the hash browns was grey oily and had peppers in it now I don't like peppers so that pissed me off then my grits had cheese in it when I asked for it they didn't say it came with cheese nor did she say the hash browns came with peppers so I asked if I can just get them sausage and hash browns and grits took off the waitress Rita with the straight backs was mad that I asked I asked for catfish and over easy eggs so she leaves mad but my cousin food she said she can taste the grease in her chicken then my cousin said her salmon tasted weird and her skillet taste oily and my brothers food his French toast was doughy they didn't cook it long enough so we tell the waitress Rita and she has the biggest attitude as if she was the cook prior to her come back she threw my plate down with a piece of catfish and two over easy eggs when I tell you the oil jumped off the plate and splashed on me that's how much oil was on my eggs I took a napkin to wipe off all the oil the it was completely oiled we all paid for our food $100 worth we ain't give no issues but she called her managers so they all where standing staring at us talking about us and I just feel like they are too young to be in this establishment because they don't care about they customers at all we left all our food but paid our bill but we will never return this place is very fuckin OVERRATED"

6/18/2021,4 star rating,"Ok.. so.. I ordered an omelette, hot cakes and cat fish (which I really had a taste for) but they called after I placed my order to let me know they were out .. bummer, may be best to call in advance to see if they are out of that, especially if that's REALLY what you want. Anyway, portion sizes are great here and the veggies in my omelette were very fresh, really enjoyed the broccoli, the omelette was prepared perfectly. Hot cakes were fluffy and warm, my daughter enjoyed them. I'll be back.. for the cat fish of course."
5/21/2021,3 star rating,"My honest review. Well, It's new. They have lots of kinks to get under control. As with any new restaurant that has a history attached to it. Hence Joe Louis. The food was delicious what had which was the shrimp and grits. My daughter made her own omelette. Now what I will berate is THE SERVICE. Geez. Again,I will go here again. I giving benefit of the doubt is because they are new. I cannot tell you this place was a ""knockout "" lol but it's doable. And I believe will get better with time and training of employees. I really don't want to give stars at this point yet. Give it time."
10/7/2021,5 star rating,"First time trying Joe Louis Southern Kitchen and I was not disappointed !!!  The service was top notch with friendly and accommodating staff.  Then there is the food which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I had the Shrimp Alfredo Cajun turkey leg , which was very tender and fall off the bone turkey.  My friend had the Creole shrimp and Grits and she enjoyed it as well.Can't wait to go back  !!!!"

9/30/2021,5 star rating,"We tried this breakfast/brunch place for the first time.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you walk through the door you are transported to Americana 60 years ago.  The decor is front porch with a white picket fence.  Two thumbs up for design, comfort & cleanliness.  And the food did not disappoint.  I had chicken & waffles and my waffle was among the best I've ever had.   The chicken wings (real wings) were really just Ok, pretty small.  My husband had the seafood skillet and he very much enjoyed it.  The menu is mouth watering and We are planning on what to order on our next visit.  BTW the wait staff was top notch.  Very courteous and pleasant.  Overall, well done."

Let's start with walking in and not knowing you have to scan your phone in order to see the menu; that's something that should be told as you are being seated. The service was pleasant but subpar. The wait was absolutely ridiculous,and when we did receive our food, It was cold,my auntie eggs were greasy, the turkey sausage was sent back twice,and the pancakes were mushy,but are saving grace was THE GURL WITH THE NAILS!!!!, Don't know your name, but you know who you are, we ABSOLUTELY LOVED HER!!!! she was extremely understanding and amazing. Thank you so much! O and btw I had a skillet with the spicy beef sausage, and it was bland.  But to the hostess with the absolute mostes thank you for trying to make me and my auntie day just a tad bit better,because the food was lack luster. Would we return probably not."

6/20/2021,2 star rating,The wait was an hour.  The food is good but the service ruined my experience. My waitress was very nice but my order was mixed up after waiting for a whole hour to get my food. The staff was overwhelmed and they had no social distancing at all. My table was on the floor next to a platform with railings and they sat people right above us. They were so close that their conversation was clearer that my table's. I could feel their every movement!  They could use a lot of help with these things.

They seated us in the elevated ""porch"" area AND seated EVERYONE  else who came in after us in the same space --maybe it was because there was only one server initially. No attempt to spread folks out made for a less than comfortable dining experience, plus the food was only OK."

She was very pleasant, attentive and thorough!  The manager, was accommodating in seating our party together.  I live in Atlanta and I will definitely be back!"
7/24/2021,2 star rating,"I heard  this restaurant was the old New Center Eatery so I wanted to give it a try. Place looks great and the decor is really cute. Music was a bit loud for my liking. Now for the reasons why I will NEVER return to this establishment. Once we were seated, we waited 30 minutes for the waitress to even address us. Other tables that were seated after us, had their food before a waitress even took our order. While waiting, the table next to us was served their food and finished eating while we were still waiting on our food. Our waitresses excuse was they make the easiest items first. A lame excuse for TERRIBLE service. Once I spoke with a manager, he informed me they were understaffed this morning but it still does not negate the fact that our service was piss poor. No one acknowledged us for 30 whole minutes. Once our food came, we instantly packed it upand was given a measly 25% discount. Should have walked out with the food on the table.  Food was absolutely amazing though. 1 star for service, 4 stars for food."
