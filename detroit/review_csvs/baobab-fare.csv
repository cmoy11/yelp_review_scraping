5/22/2022,5 star rating,"We have been fans of Baobob Fare since we first tried their food at a Frame popup back in 2018. Last night we dined at the restaurant for the first time and it was a great experience!We ate a fairly early dinner (5pm) since it didn't appear reservations are taken. We had our choice of tables, but by time we left the place was full. The decor inside is light, bright and cheery. The casual restaurant is exceptionally clean and uncluttered. My husband started with an African spiced coffee, which he enjoyed and I chose the flavorful, iced hibiscus tea. For dinner we shared two dishes.The Samaki (fish) was perfectly cooked and the spices were so flavorful. The meal came with a generous portion of fried plantains, stewed yellow beans, spiced pilau and corn salad. Every bite was outstanding! We also loved the Intore Stew (eggplant) with coconut rice, peanut-stewed spinach and fried plantains. Both meals were delicious!From the service to the food to the atmosphere, we really enjoyed our meal at Baobob Fare and are so happy to see how this vision we first heard about years ago has become a successful and fantastic dining destination!"
5/21/2022,4 star rating,"The D still has it's challenges with spots rising and others falling but the gentrification seems to be creeping up Woodward. The former commercial center of Grand River and Woodward is trying to join the fray. Baobab Fare is a relative newcomer that's clicking with the hipster/office and food tourist crowd. Bright open space with a slick decor welcomes you. A long dining room was filled on a nice spring day. The African fare was delicious. I had fish, as the goat stew had to stew a bit more. It was like Mexican food prepared by an Indian restaurant. Very interesting. Now the only fault and the missing star comes from the cost. No lunch menu or pricing and you felt it. Lunch for two with no alcohol ( they don't serve it) was $50! A splurge to say no the least. All in my a very good experience just bring your wallet.Baobab Fare... Fair enough...Go!"
3/7/2022,5 star rating,"This place was sooooo delicious! I was in Detroit from out of town and was recommended this place by the dance studio I was visiting. We placed a carry out order and it was prepared accurately which as many of us know...doesn't happen all the time.I ordered the Nyumbani which as stated on their menu means ""home"" and it certainly felt like that. The meat was so tender, the flavors of the sauce were marinated to perfection and the combination of coconut rice and sweet plantains balanced my desire for savory and sweet flavors.I highly recommend this place."
4/2/2022,5 star rating,Amazing!!! First time trying east African food and I loved it. Our table tried almost one of each on their menu. Everything was so flavorful and cooked really well. My favorite dishes were the Kumuhana and Mbuzi. For rice get a mix of the coconut and spiced pilau. Would definitely come back!
10/30/2021,5 star rating,"One of, if not the best,  fish dishes in the Detroit metro area! (Called Samaki on the menu). $20 and enough for two- the fish is perfectly cooked and comes with your choice of rice (I prefer the coconut rice), plantains and white beans.  No idea what the flavors are in here but it's amazing!!! Like, A-Ma-Zing!And of course the other DO NOT MISS a menu item is the tamil.  It's base is avocado but that's all I've got for you other than you'll not find this anywhere else in Michigan and it's to die for- thank goodness was they give you one serving ($7) because I could eat it by the bucketful! The entire place is beautifully decorated and has such a wonderful atmosphere- try to dine in if you can.  And order the passionfruit juice as well- very special."
9/15/2021,5 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing! The East African cuisine is so flavorful and delightful. Our dining experience was quite fun. The ambiance is fresh - a gray scale palate with pops of yellow. The windows are plenty when lots of light shining into the restaurant. The food came out piping hot (plus) and the servings were plentiful! My mom and I left with ample leftovers. The Hibiscus tea is made fresh in house with all natural ingredients ( I could have drank two glasses is was so tasty). The food was beyond what we could have asked for - my lamb shank/Mbuzi was paired with rice, plantain, corn and yellow beans. My mom kept raving about how huge the lamb shank is that she couldn't keep her eyes off my plate! You must try this dish!  My mom ordered the Wednesday special, Mhogo, which was a yuca and chicken dish paired with cream spinach. You can't go wrong with either of theses entrees. I am looking forward to returning the Baobab Fare soon!!!"
5/7/2022,5 star rating,"Fresh, light urban decor and DELICIOUS food. We tried the fish, chicken, and eggplant dishes. All three were outstanding."
11/4/2021,5 star rating,"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Detroit! It's located in such a great area, right on the corner of two iconic streets in Detroit - Woodward and Grand Boulevard - and serves as the gateway to the New Center district! The interior space at Baobab is so modern and open. It's such a fun vibe for everything casual, but also feels cozy and special for those times when you're looking for something a bit more upscale too.You cannot go wrong with anything you order on this menu, but I dream about the Samaki dish day in and day out. That's their flash-fried fish dish and they truly cook it to perfection. Pair that with their spiced rice pilau, the corn salad, the beans, the fried plantains - it is utterly DELECTABLE! It's the perfect meal (combine with the tart passion fruit juice YUM) and it is so much food that I definitely eat half and save the other half for another meal, which I love.But truly, there's something for everyone here. They have weekday specials as well, various different kind of meat-based dishes, but also are very vegan friendly as well! Everything here is delicious and it just makes perfect sense that they were rated the top restaurant in Detroit by Yelp! Congrats Baobab! Love you ALWAYS!"
2/3/2022,5 star rating,"I have wanted to check out Baobab Fare since I heard about an East African restaurant opening in Detroit. Due to COVID, it took me awhile to make it in, during that time the accolades grew, and for good reason. Large floor to ceiling windows let light into the simply decorated and comfortable interior. The bright yellow and red accents pair well with the otherwise monochromatic space. My friend and I went on a cold afternoon for lunch, their hot drinks were particularly appreciated. As others have mentioned, they do not serve alcohol. I had tea, and my friend had the spiced coffee. While my tea was good it was a bit too sweet for me, my friends coffee was outstanding. She said it was some of the best she had, the spices perfectly blended. At lunch, they do not offer all menu items. It is listed on their site when certain dishes are offered. My familiarity is with Kenyan cuisine, so I noticed some differences and similarities (my only disappointment was no chapati). The food is fantastic (so good they can get away with not serving alcohol). My friend and I debated and decided to order the Samaki (fish) and the Nyumbani (beef) to share, with recommendations from our server. The beef is cooked in a tomato sauce and is hearty and flavorful. And while it was great, the fish was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. Lightly fried, topped with a light and flavorful sauce, and paired with fresh corn salad, fried plantains, stewed yellow beans and (we picked) coconut rice. The dish is both light, but incredibly full of flavor, and still filling. I like plantains, my friend was not a fan. I think they were well paired with the dish, adding texture. My only minor complaint would be some of the slices were a bit dry. Overall, this is a dish to dream about. We finished with the Tamu, smooth, sweet, and creamy pudding made from avocado and passion fruit, with a pleasant pop from the small seeds. My friend was apprehensive, but after having tried, it she wished she'd ordered her own. While Baobab offered me some nostalgia, it was a new experience for my friend she equally enjoyed. While I can not recommend Baobab enough, they do not take reservations, and once it's known just how amazing they are, it may be harder to get in."
9/12/2021,5 star rating,"Holy moly!!! Is this place even real? Everything was absolutely flawless. We ordered:Samaki, fish with corn salad, plantains, coconut rice and yellow beansNyumbani, tomato stewed beef with peanut spinach and coconut riceAvocado pudding with passion fruit and chiaAnd a delicious spiced coffee with warming spices and ginger.We were literally speechless tasting these beautifully vibrant flavors, everything was perfectly seasoned and presented. We LOVED the comforting beef and the avocado pudding was just out of this world - so bright and fresh. I can't wait to come back, thank you for such an amazing experience!"
1/22/2022,5 star rating,"Can't rate Baobab Fare high enough.  Eastern African cuisine?  What is that?  It's amazing!  My favorite is the Samaki. Pan fried fish with amazing seasoning. I haven't had something this different yet this tasty in a long time. It's like discovering your palate all over again.  The menu is very inviting and vegetarian friendly with the spinach Mboga and the eggplant Intore next on my list. My wife loves the beef Nyumbani. Great atmosphere, cool setting, fabulous staff and a decent location helping to raise Detroit up on Woodward and Grand Blvd. Go see Mamba at Baobab Fare and enjoy his excellent cuisine, meet some fine and friendly people and learn something about African culture while you're there. Don't forget the coffee and tea. It's pretty much all natural and healthy. You won't regret it. Thx Mamba and Baobab Fare. See you soon."
8/24/2021,5 star rating,There is a reason this place has 5 stars with 63 reviews. The food is amazing. It's flavorful and fresh. We all had the Mbuzi which is Goat Shank. I had it with coconut rice which complimented the dish perfectly. The corn and the plantains made the dish exploded with different flavors. A very hearty meal. The service by Sarah was great. She was extremely kind and helpful when trying to decide what to choose. She makes you feel like you are gust at her home. A very rare find in today's day with so few excited about service. Thank you for the fantastic food and treating us like family. Also try their avacado dessert. It will not disappoint!
12/23/2021,5 star rating,"I hate to be a me-too-er, and I've only been the one time, but I do have to chime in with everyone else and say just how impressive this place was to me.  I really enjoyed everything about my lunch experience here (just wish that the full menu was available at lunchtime...I guess that means I have to go back to have the goat!), and the way they've made such an industrial building into a homey, inviting place was truly impressive.For me, though, it's all about the food, and that's plenty good.  I had beef, and it was tender, tasty, and had great texture.  The sauce it was served in?  I needed me some more of that, because I LIKED IT A LOT.  I'm not saying that they didn't give me enough of that...I'm simply saying that I wanted *more*.  Very tasty dish all around.Nice little touches abound, like the fresh flowers at the tables, the owner being present and talk-to-able even though she's in and out of the kitchen, making sure the quality standard is held high.  Guess what?  It is.  No need to worry about that.I definitely will be back."
9/23/2021,4 star rating,"I came here recently while visiting my mom. She so highly recommended Baobab Fare that we took a special trip downtown to eat here.Our server was very nice and quick to welcome us and get us set up with drinks. I ordered the chicken kuku which is a braised chicken in a mustard sauce. It was good, but I found myself wishing for more sauce - especially when served over the good sized scoop of rice it comes with. The plantains on the side were great. The real showstopper is the tamu- an avocado passion fruit pudding that was mind blowing good. I will come here over and over again for this dessert. You should too"
8/11/2021,5 star rating,This foood is sooo good! Tried it the first night I moved into my apartment nearby! Fresh! Flavorful! Delicious They have something for everyone from vegan to carnivore! I highly recommend
4/3/2022,5 star rating,"Baobab Fare is probably my favorite food spot in Detroit. It serves East African cuisine and has a ton of unique flavor profiles and options. I'm pretty sure I've tried every single entrée on the menu, which isn't characteristic of me, but that's how much I trust this restaurant. The food always tastes like it's a home cooked meal and the flavors are absolutely delectable. I especially love the nyumbani and the kuku. Even the sides they give are incredible, such as the spinach, lentils, and plantains. I actually didn't even like plantains until I had them here. The restaurants is also halal, which I love to see. This is the spot I take anyone new to Detroit, so I highly HIGHLY recommend stopping by. In terms of the actual venue, they have a good amount of seating, but it definitely gets busier around dinner time so I would recommend calling ahead to check. I've always been seated immediately when I've gone for lunch, but have had some ~20 minute waits going for dinner when I didn't call ahead."
5/21/2022,5 star rating,It's worth the hype. Get the nyumbani and savor every bite. Quick service and great portion sizes.
5/23/2021,4 star rating,"Was looking forward to try this place. Very easy ordering via website for pickup.I like that they offer vegan options so we ordered few different items to try: Intore (eggplant dish), Nyumbani (beef), Petit Pois to share and side of Kuku.We also got Tamu, avocado dessert which was very good. Overall everything was very tasty and the portion size was good but it's a little pricey. I tried the other African place across the street and the food there was more flavorful than here hence only 4*"
11/1/2021,5 star rating,"Came here for a yelp event, and boy I was glad I was invited! This place is beautiful inside! The staff is tremendously kind and very helpful. We got to try the passionfruit juice in the bottle and it was amazing I wish they sold by the case! We also ordered NYUMBANI with coconut rice and it was heaven! You can really taste the freshness and the seasoning was spot on! I'll definitely be coming back to try more, I just remember they're closed on Mondays!"
5/21/2021,4 star rating,"Walking in the door, the smell of far off spices, you are transported to Burundi. I came there to pick up my complimentary tamu pudding. I ended up purchasing 2 of these beauties. We will be back for the food very soon... and probably often.First time having tamu and it did not disappoint. It's kind of like if they made flan out of avocado. Which are two of my favorite things to eat. Smooth, sweet and tangy. The perfect treat for a hot summer day. I cannot wait to try their East African dishes as well as their coffee!"
6/14/2021,5 star rating,"Whether you are a vegetarian or not, this restaurant is full of flavorful food that your tastebuds will love! There is street parking around the business so no worries about where to park. When you enter the business you instantly feel welcomed and inspired. The employees are super chill, the vibe is cool and the food is amazing! I ordered a coffee a full meal and a dessert all of which were amazing! Baobab Fare is especially unique in their mission and Journey. Many of their employees are former residents of FreedomHouse. You can learn more about this on website. To support the community in this way is a business ethic that is truly admirable and is just one more reason to support this company. Check them out!"
4/18/2021,5 star rating,"I finally got takeout from Baobab Fare today! I've been following their progress for a while and was so excited to try food from Burundi. We got Nyumbani with Coconut Rice, Petit Pois, and Kuku withSpice Rice Pilau. Everything was delicious but my favorite was absolutely the kuku and rice pilau. The chicken was incredibly tender, the sauce was flavorful, and the yellow beans had a comforting texture that pulled everything together. I got takeout because of COVID so I can't speak to the table service. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and I definitely want to dine-in once the pandemic is under control. The sun streaming through the windows makes a gorgeous They don't have curbside pickup - when I got there people were waiting right outside the door and I initially wasn't sure if I should go inside - I couldn't find their exact COVID policies on their website- but I popped in and the staff member at the counter was able to quickly grab my order for me. Hopefully they'll be able to fine tune and publicize their COVID policies as they find their groove."
4/23/2022,5 star rating,Everything I've had here is phenomenal. Portion sizes are great and the service is friendly. I highly recommend the fish dish here (forgot the name). The rice pilaf was so aromatic and the plantains were caramelized delicately. Go do yourself a favor and come enjoy some amazing food here
10/10/2021,5 star rating,"I'd rate it a 4.5 but I'll be nice and round up to 5.The food was really flavorful. I got the kuku and my dad got (i forgot the name) beef. The ambiance inside was great too. I love how they decorated and designed the place (e.g. leaving the tin ceiling in place, the tiles on the ground were gorgeous too).One major complaint is that we were seated but our order wasn't taken for quite a while. And no one said like ""hang on be right with you"". We just kept getting walked past.Some minor complaints:- The tea is pretty expensive for the little amount you get. I got the lemongrass tea and my dad got the hibiscus tea. - This is honestly a silly minor complaint, but ceramic plates would be cool instead of the plastic ones they use. I just don't like eating from plastic.- Also, the portion of meat was pretty tiny especially relative to prices. I'm someone who doesn't even eat that much meat, but the amount of chicken with the kuku felt like you could eat it with two or three bites.- The plantains were really dry but maybe that's just how they're cooked in this cuisine."
3/7/2021,5 star rating,"Can I get a WHOOP here it is!!!!  Finally, Baobab is serving food indoors. We have both been eagerly awaiting Baobab Fare.  What an adorable restaurant located in the Milwaukee Junction area of the city. This entire area is being revitalized.  Baobab is a family owned and operated business.  We enjoyed trying some authentic African entrees.  The flavor explosion....WOW!!!  We can't wait to come back and try some of the other items on the menu, especially the ""donuts""!  That's right donuts!!!!  They were all out of them, but this just gives another reason to come back. hahaaaa If you are in the area, this is a must stop on your foodie adventure."
3/19/2022,5 star rating,Top 3 new restaurants in the city. Hands down. The place is small and bright with a staff that is attentive and makes great menu recommendations. The menu is small but don't let this fool or intimidate you. They know what they are doing. Highly recommend the goat dish
11/10/2021,5 star rating,"This was my first time trying African cuisine and it was absolutely amazing. I had the Samaki which is a crispy flash-fried fish topped with tangy onion sauté. It came with spiced rice pilau, beans, corn salad, and fried plantains. The fish was filled with flavor, juicy and well cooked. The onion topping was probably my favorite part of the dish. The combination of the spiced rice and sweet corn made a nice contrast. I'm not a huge fan of plantains but it was a nice addition. As you can see from the picture, the portion was very big. I was able to take food home as well. Service was professional and quick! Would 100% recommend! I will be going here again very soon!"
5/5/2021,5 star rating,Got takeout and it was so flavorful and delicious! It was my first time trying East African food and I'm very grateful for the chance! We got the KuKu and the Samaki and both was amazing! The Samaki in particular (fish) blew me away. We did get takeout on one of their first weeks of being open so it was a bit disorganized and slow trying to get our takeout but hopefully that will improve as they settle in. Looking forward to dining in at the restaurant as well soon as it was such a chic space. Overall a must try gem in the Detroit area!
10/30/2021,4 star rating,"This review is based on the feel and staff: great spot, beautiful colors and atmosphere. Smelled amazing and the staff made you feel welcome. We did not have time to eat, but popped in for the Yelp event and didn't leave disappointed. We will be back to try the food and take in the full experience."
4/3/2022,5 star rating,"First things first: everything on the menu is gluten free except the kuku! I got the intore and mbongo (two vegetarian dishes) and they were both yummy. They had less flavor that I was expecting, tbh - I had to salt them, which is unusual for me - but it was obvious a lot of care went into preparation. My takeout order was ready exactly on time, which is rare for restaurants these days. Overall a great experience and I look forward to eating inside the restaurant next time, it looked really nice."
3/22/2021,5 star rating,"There's a  new (center) kid on the block and it is popping for the culture. I was introduced to this place a couple of weeks before their grand opening via a month long food event called Taste the Diaspora Detroit. They offered a phenomenal dish called Petit Pois which was  tomato purée stewed potatoes, peas, and carrots and it was a very strong start for that month! I wondered who or what was baobab fare and what else was on their menu: they weren't even open yet...Fast forward, I'm heading north on Woodward going to Ferndale for food and noticed the place on the corner at the stop light. I canceled my first mind and made a right to park.The service was fantastic! I was able to talk with the owner (who stopped by and asked for feedback) and shared with him that his Petit Pois is what kept my mind fresh about this place. Sure enough, it was one of the regular menu items! I figured I've had their vegan options so I'll try their meat and went for the choice I always go for when I go to an African cuisine restaurant: lamb or goat. In this case, they offered goat shank.Listen, the presentation alone of the Mbuzi was beautiful. I even ate the flower! The customer service was also quick to resolve any issues like when they forgot to give me plantains with my dish they returned promptly with piping hot plantains.Atmosphere wise, the place gives me bar vibes but frankly, what they have going on without cocktails is solid enough!I'm willing to bet every dish is a banger. That's why I'll be going back and bringing friends!"
9/15/2021,4 star rating,"Walked in just after noon and the place was empty. 2 parties of 3 walked in behind me.The hibiscus tea was unexpectedly creamy AND tart!I ordered for my friend & myself. The food arrived and I began to eat. The waiter returned & asked if my friend's plate should be placed in the warmer, which was very considerate since I wasn't certain of my friend's arrival time!"
1/30/2022,5 star rating,"If you looking for unique ethnic cuisine  this is the place for you.Whether your just wanting a drink, I highly recommend the hibiscus tea warming beautiful purple haze with a slightly sweet tart taste. If looking for something cold try the Passion fruit. They bottle this product themselves and it was pleasantly sweet and refreshing.For entree highly recommend the ""Samaki"" fish dish. Fish has a blackened seasoning topped with tangy grilled onions which was absolutely amazing. Also tried and recommend the ""Intore"" which is stewed eggplant with amazing flavor paired perfectly with a bean side dish"
3/4/2022,5 star rating,"Visited for the first time today for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered. EVERYTHING was delicious--the fish, eggplant , plantains, beans, spinach, coconut rice, pilau, coffee, avocado passion fruit dessert, all so yummy. I especially loved the spinach peanut dish, it reminded me of a Filipino dish called kare kare. And the restaurant ambience is so cheerful and bright, something so needed during challenging times like now. We will be back and can't wait to try more deliciousness."
4/20/2022,5 star rating,"Best meal I've ever had! Refreshing flavors, perfect amount of spice, very tender meat. This is a MUST TRY for anyone interested in trying out African cuisine or looking for a fun date night spot. My favorite dish is the Samaki personally."
1/24/2022,5 star rating,Every bite was delicious! I had the fish entree and hibiscus tea. Will definitely be back!!!
5/21/2021,4 star rating,"I got Yelp invitation for desert here so I was excited to get African desert but unfortunately sold out! I am ok with it because restaurants is full So understand very popular and everyone get desert .but ok because I am excited to get dinner here because review is so good! So ... I checked menu I ordered mbuzi (goat shank) and samaki( grilled fish) with spicy rice and coconut rice. Waited for 15-20 minutes ( take out) it was so worth it.  Goat shank is big !! Little sad was corn is not corn salad just a corn... but don't care first of all I do not like rice ( I know I'm Asian ) usually just a bite or 2 I eat rice for take out but today is different day! coconut rice is very good balance of coconut milk and s&p and broth. Spicy rice is same! Very good balance of spice ! I really love that!! Goat is very moist & tender , fish is good balance of spice and crispy out side moist inside ! Only ok is plantain I like more crispy out side but it is my opinion. I am so thankful to Yelp ( Annette specially) you discovered here to me!!I'm not live around but if going to downtown area I will come vback to try some new things! Any way do not have air conditioning so light cloth possible for now...."
5/22/2021,4 star rating,"This will be a fairly limited review, but I at least wanted to get something out there. All I have tried so far from this place has been the tamu (one of their cultural desserts), but the based on the aroma of when I stepped into the restaurant, I am definitely intending to return to try out some of their food. I love trying different cultural dishes, and it seems like they have a good variety of authentic ones of their own. The place was clean and the staff seemed friendly. As for the tamu itself, my only recommendation would be that if you got takeout, especially if you have a long drive home, wait until you are home and put it in the fridge before you eat it. It's definitely much better when chilled as opposed to having been out for a little bit. Otherwise it was a unique and great taste, just wish they gave more of it since you end up eating through it very quickly!"
6/23/2021,5 star rating,"Excellent, excellent, excellent food.This place is a gem.I saw it for a while before I decided to go and man I regret taking so long. Great food, great people, I have tried every dish.The Goat shank is succulent.The fish is perfectly flash fried not heavily breaded.The beef is flavorful.The eggplant is amazing.The hot sauce is always sold out!"
5/17/2021,5 star rating,You can't go wrong with baobab fare. The food is always delicious and the owners are kind and community oriented. My favorite dish so far is the lamb shank--it just fell off the bone and was super flavorful. Also it was a pretty good deal considering all the sides it came with. The dogs enjoyed the leftover shank bone as well :-) Highly recommend trying this place out! You won't be disappointed.
3/1/2022,4 star rating,"Delicious flavors. Plantains could be sweeter. I had the goat shank which was fatty in a good way, spinach peanut stew and tried my husband's eggplant dish (intore). I will definitely be back to try the beef dishes."
10/30/2021,5 star rating,Love this Place food is Amazing and super flavorful I have tried many items on their menu and were all equally  delicious
5/15/2021,4 star rating,"Baobab Fare was on my list to try So I Came here for a Yelp Event which offered complimentary dessert, I did order the Stewed Beef (Nyumbani) which was amazing and super flavorful!! It came with a African spiced blend rice and peanut stewed spinach I also got my dessert (Tamu) which was a dessert avocado and passion fruit pudding very silky and decadent  full of the passion fruit flavors. Overall my food was really good but portion was way to small for the $$$ I might be back to try other items on the menu just hope the adjust portion size to match price"
6/9/2021,4 star rating,"Came in to try the Tamu, I truthfully had no idea what to expect and I was blown away!! The Tamu was a perfect sweet, creamy, tangy combo with a awesome crunch texture from the chia seeds! Will definitely have to come back and broaden my horizon more!"
3/22/2021,5 star rating,"Wow. The food here is just incredible. Ordering was a breeze - we chose all.of our options and checked out through the website. By the time we arrived at the restaurant, our carry out was ready and waiting.We ordered the samaki, and I'm not sure I could have imagined a more perfect dish. The fish was beautifully cooked and bursting with flavor, and the rice and plantains were an excellent complement. The passionfruit drink is also a treat!"
12/18/2021,5 star rating,"I am so glad my girlfriend and I decided to go somewhere new. It's a cozy space on the corner of Grand Blvd. and Woodward. We didn't have reservations (neither of us saw anything on their website about making reservations) but luckily we were able to sit at the bar. Our server was hustling as I think she was the only one but I believe the owner/manager was around and helping. Spiced African tea to drink, little spicy but a good black tea with milk. We ordered the Nyumbani, Kumuhana, and Mboga. They all came with rice and fried platinains; we tried the spicy rice and coconut rice. I mean, you couldn't go wrong with these dishes. The flavors were present but subtle and if you had added more, you would've lost the integrity of the dishes. The chicken was grilled and char was just enough to add another level. Definitely will be going back to try more."
5/29/2021,4 star rating,Amazing tasting food! We went to Baobab for lunch and ordered the chicken and beef. The meat was incredibly tender and super flavorful. Pretty much all the dishes come with choice of rice either coconut rice or spiced pilaf as well as a side of plantains. The spiced pilaf is phenomenal! The restaurant itself has a cute cafe vibe with a coffee bar and some great decor and plants. The portion sizes are fairly large however the pricing is a bit steep. We spent $17 and $18 for our food and the price did not really match the vibe of the restaurant considering it was more of a cafe vibe. Still worth a taste for the great food!
5/27/2021,5 star rating,"This was some insanely good food.  We got beef and fish and both were perfect, but the fish is what I'll be dreaming of tonight. It had this oniony mustardy sauce and I loved it! The peas and spinach were also so so good.  We got tamu (avocado and passionfruit pudding) for dessert and that was probably the best part.  Someone wrote a review of it on the baobab fare website that was emphatic, highly descriptive, and maybe somewhat blasphemous in its support of this particular dish lol and I fuuully understand exactly how they feel.  It is a perfect food.  The flavors and textures just come together in perfect harmony... as much as I love avocados I was a little skeptical and semi-expecting a avocado baby food kind of vibe, but no. Its just perfect and citrusy and tropical and I wish I was eating some right now."

5/23/2021,5 star rating,"Stopped in here for a free dessert for a Yelp event - I won't let that color my review here. Definitely unique, though it wasn't entirely up my alley. I also ordered a main and a few sides to bring home with me and was really impressed. I grabbed the Nyumbani, which is a delicious tender beef in a tomato-based sauce - really incredible. The rice pilau was so good, and then the peanut-stewed spinach was delish as well. Not a huge fan of the plantains - they were huge and tasted a bit bland and starchy, but maybe smaller pieces would help this. My only real complaint was that I ordered a few sides - coconut rice, stewed yellow beans, corn salad, and some more peanut spinach. Unfortunately the coconut rice didn't make it into the bag, though after an email they quickly refunded the cost. All of the other sides were great though, and I'll surely be back. Really nice spot, great ambiance/design inside, and my dish was incredible. Excited to try some more of the menu!"

3/6/2021,5 star rating,"I've been waiting for Baobab Fare to open every since I tried it in the Detroit Distillery location. I forgot what I had then a few months ago but I was completely blown away this time. I had the Samaki cause I needed something light and filling and had a taste for fish. I think the fish was white fish or cod something but it was cooked to perfection with flavor even without the onion sauce. Anything that has crispy ends I'm game for. The plantains were great not overly cooked or without lots of sauce or anything. I appreciate not going to crazy with plantains when you already have so much flavor going on. Then there's the corn salad, mentioning this last you might think it was a low point...but not at all. I'm not big on non leafy salads but it wasn't too vinegary or salty. Perfect. Oh and presentation, just a bit of julienned carrots and an edible flower. That's all you need.I can't believe this place is 5 mins from me. I found my new go to restaurant"
3/10/2022,5 star rating,"My Mom and I both ordered vegan dishes and they were SO good. The warmth of the setting, the food, the owners and the waitress were a welcome change. We all need the love and care you put into the food and this place. Thank You!"
3/31/2021,5 star rating,"Baobab Fare!! What an experience! I know this review is about my dish, but I'd be remiss if I were to not let everyone know how delightful to the eyes Baobab Fare is, once you enter inside! The yellow interior accents awaken your senses and appropriately prepare you for the festival your taste buds are set to encounter! Now as for the dish, the Kuku was exactly what I hoped for it to be. If you're unfamiliar with what to expect from such cuisine, don't let the words ""tangy and mustard"" confuse you with ""French's Mustard"". The dish is adequately flavored, the sauce is velvety smooth, and perfectly compliments the tenderness of the chicken. Plantains were evidently fresh, not overly seasoned, sweetened, or cooked, allowing it to naturally balance the firework flavors from the chicken, and the yellow beans. Certainly looking forward to trying the entire menu! #DetroitNinyumbani"

3/10/2021,5 star rating,This place is fantastic! Enjoyed a four course meal during the soft opening. Food was so fresh. They took their time to prepare good quality! Good food takes time I can't wait to return.
12/19/2021,5 star rating,"Amazing food, fast service, beautiful ambience and decor! First time trying East African food and it certainly will not be the last. The chicken was so tender and flavorful but the sides were also delicious! Loved that there are vegetarian options for my partner. The menu has certain items available on certain days so check the menu before you plan your visit. Our server was kind and helpful with his recommendations. Would 100% recommend"
2/17/2021,5 star rating,"I wasn't sure what to expect because I am a picky eater and I was pleasantly surprised that I liked everything they offered! Each dish was beautiful and tasty. From the plantains to the grilled chicken with tastes of wildfire bbq goodness to the avocado pudding desert, even I couldn't believe how amazing this meal was and that I tried it all...and liked it! Their passion fruit drink was refreshing - I felt like I was on vacation. Bonus: They have a small grocery area where you can buy coffee, the passion fruit drink, basmati rice, tea, and hot sauce. The coffee is packaged and roasted right here in Detroit!I cannot wait to come back!The proprietors, Mamba and Nadia, were so attentive. He explained the dishes and checked in on us. Our server, Esmerelda, was also amazing. What a delight!"
10/30/2021,5 star rating,"I ate the Samaki. Fish was full of flavor. Plantains were sweet and tender. Tasted well with the seasoned rice, beans, and corn. Everything was great. Little pricey but was very much worth it because it tasted excellent and the size of the dish was big."
10/30/2021,5 star rating,A great stop in the D right off of Woodward @ Grand Blvd. East African fare with vegan options too. Flavors like no other.
3/5/2021,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! The restaurant is super cute and clean too w a black, white and yellow color palette. Food is super fresh and flavorful--I think the corn salad was the star of this dish, but all of the elements were tasty individually as well as all together. Can't wait to go back to try some of the vegetarian options! Coffee kcups to go are great too."
2/25/2021,5 star rating,"I've been waiting for this restaurant to open for ages, I'm so excited the day has finally arrived! Grabbed two takeout dishes to share with my mom; the fish (samaki) and beef (nyumbani). Both were delicious! I'm not the biggest fish person but I would eat this fish for every meal, especially with the onions on top! The beef was flavorful and tender and came with some great spinach. Seriously, I've never liked spinach before, so that's saying a lot!I'm excited to come back and try some more dishes!"
8/26/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food. Awesome staff and the owner Mamba is a genuine and down to earth person. Definitely recommend eating here.
4/20/2022,5 star rating,"Our first visit and not our last. Our waitress, Irene, was very helpful and had no problem with our request to have 1/2 and1/2 of the two types of rice. Food was unique and delicious. My husband had a goat dinner and couldn't finish it but took it home of course. I had the eggplant with spinach side and finished the whole thing. Recommend for a special dining experience."
5/16/2021,5 star rating,"Baobob Fare is the best! We ate in, and enjoyed every single thing we had. My daughter chose the Kumuhana (grilled chicken) and I had the Mboga (sauteed spinach). Both dishes came with plantains and rice pilau, which were delicious. We also had the tamu and the African donuts, the tamu was out of this world - a creamy pudding of avocado and passion fruit. And the donuts were good too, with a raspberry dipping sauce. The interior is so warm and friendly, it immediately makes you feel at home. And the service is personalized and knowledgeable. I will definitely be back again and will be recommending this place to all my friends and family. That includes you, so go."
5/21/2021,5 star rating,Wow! Kuku was great dish for a first timer. Will definitely be back! This dish was so flavorful and service is great! Have not had plantains this food since living in Florida/Miami!
6/25/2021,5 star rating,This restaurant is SO delicious! You can tell the food is cooked with Love. Everything  about this place is so fab; we will definitely stop at Baobab Fare every time we're in Detroit! The spinach and beans with plantain... Yum.....
4/19/2021,5 star rating,"This is such a special place. The backstory on why this restaurant was started in the first place is just so sweet. As someone with immigrant parents, this touches me.There is no place that you can find great food for such an affordable price. The vibe is great. There are a variety of seating arrangements for different sizes of groups. The color palette is energizing and calming at the same time. Great place to hang out or take someone on a date. Great ventilation, which is important with COVID.Getting into the dishes:The Samaki is just... MMM MM MMM! Balanced in all the flavors. It's hard to find dishes like this. There was the perfect amount of salt, acid, fat, and heat. The yellow beans, the coconut rice, the fresh corn salsa, the plantains, and squeeze of fresh lemon all suited the fish. No bite of the dish ever got boring. I was afraid that the fish would not fill me but the whole meal was well portioned. I was so satiated. I did try the Mbuzi (goat). It was HUGE, which surprised me for the price. The sides were the same as the Samaki, which were great. I think I really liked the fish much more than the goat--flavor profile wise.Of course I did not leave without the tamu pudding. Just amazing.Coming back for sure."

3/15/2021,5 star rating,"I love nothing more in life than trying food from a country or region of the world I'm not familiar with. The anticipation of eating new and unique flavor combinations is such a driving force for me and it bridges gaps between all cultures. Being that my family is from West Africa, I am familiar with food from that corner of the globe. But I have never been as exposed to the opposite end of the continent, outside from a couple of Ethiopian dishes I've tasted in the past. Here we have Baobab Cafe, a restaurant owned by a native of Burundi. I bet there aren't many people in the Metro Detroit area who can say they ate Burundian cuisine? Well when you come here, you can most certainly put on that badge proudly, because this food is AMAZING. I refrain from getting expectations too high when I try any new place, but I inhaled my meal and left nothing on the plate. It was so good I had to take an order home for my wife. The rice, the beans, the spinach and plantains were all cooked so thoughtfully and only enhanced the dishes that took center stage (goat, beef and eggplant in our case). The inside of the restaurant is also very colorful and modern looking but different enough that you feel you are someplace special. I even had the pleasure of meeting the business owner during my lunch and I couldn't praise him enough for this wonderful contribution to our city's diverse food scene. A+"
3/13/2022,3 star rating,"Waited 20 minutes for my takeout order on the first visit, but food was good, so decided to give it another shot. Waited 30+ minutes the second time. Considering that this restaurant a) is not cheap, b) is very highly regarded, and c) has online ordering where you specify what time you're coming to pickup, I feel like the long wait time is not okay. Both times, the staff didn't bother to address/explain the delay. We ordered two signature dishes and made the order WAY in advance, so it's not like we were being difficult customers. I will say that the food has a comforting home-cooked feel and a special wholesome quality. I also appreciated that they honored my request to replace the rice with beans. However, we just don't have the time (or honestly, the patience) to wait half an hour for a takeout order these days. There are so many other exciting new restaurants in Detroit now, and we probably won't be returning to this one, unfortunately."

8/1/2021,5 star rating,"I love it here. Authentic east African food, excellent design aesthetic, close to home. The goat shank is a generous portion but thank goodness because it falls off the bone and is very savory and juicy. My 3 year old daughter requested a carrot of all things, and to her delight and my surprise the owner Mamba Hamisi returned with an actual nicely cleaned carrot. The husband and wife team are good friends of ours and we love what they have added to our midtown landscape. The Hibiscus tea is invigorating on ice and a touch medicinal with warming spices like cloves."

3/26/2021,5 star rating,A MUST VISIT PLACE!! My husband took me here for a dinner. It was a spontaneous plan to eat out. The restaurant was close to a not so good neighborhood so I had my doubts but knowing my foodie husband he never really goes wrong with food. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it. We were seated and served really fast. I ordered Samaki it was delicious and my husband got numyambi and enjoyed it a lot. The food was fresh and aroma didn't take us long to dig in. The food was full of flavor. There was nothing on our plates that was bland or flavorless. Please go and support this cute little west African restaurant. Like many other small good restaurants I would hate for this to go away.

Very easy ordering via website for pickup.I like that they offer vegan options so we ordered few different items to try: Intore (eggplant dish), Nyumbani (beef), Petit Pois to share and side of Kuku.We also got Tamu, avocado dessert which was very good. Overall everything was very tasty and the portion size was good but it's a little pricey.

5/22/2021,4 star rating,"This will be a fairly limited review, but I at least wanted to get something out there. All I have tried so far from this place has been the tamu (one of their cultural desserts), but the based on the aroma of when I stepped into the restaurant, I am definitely intending to return to try out some of their food. I love trying different cultural dishes, and it seems like they have a good variety of authentic ones of their own. The place was clean and the staff seemed friendly. As for the tamu itself, my only recommendation would be that if you got takeout, especially if you have a long drive home, wait until you are home and put it in the fridge before you eat it. It's definitely much better when chilled as opposed to having been out for a little bit. Otherwise it was a unique and great taste, just wish they gave more of it since you end up eating through it very quickly!"

I am ok with it because restaurants is full So understand very popular and everyone get desert .but ok because I am excited to get dinner here because review is so good! So ... I checked menu I ordered mbuzi (goat shank) and samaki( grilled fish) with spicy rice and coconut rice. Waited for 15-20 minutes ( take out) it was so worth it.  Goat shank is big !! Little sad was corn is not corn salad just a corn... but don't care first of all I do not like rice ( I know I'm Asian ) usually just a bite or 2 I eat rice for take out but today is different day! coconut rice is very good balance of coconut milk and s&p and broth. Spicy rice is same! Very good balance of spice ! I really love that!! Goat is very moist & tender , fish is good balance of spice and crispy out side moist inside ! Only ok is plantain I like more crispy out side but it is my opinion. I am so thankful to Yelp ( Annette specially) you discovered here to me!!I'm not live around but if going to downtown area I will come vback to try some new things! Any way do not have air conditioning so light cloth possible for now...."

I ended up purchasing 2 of these beauties. We will be back for the food very soon... and probably often.First time having tamu and it did not disappoint. It's kind of like if they made flan out of avocado. Which are two of my favorite things to eat. Smooth, sweet and tangy. The perfect treat for a hot summer day. I cannot wait to try their East African dishes as well as their coffee!"

My favorite dish so far is the lamb shank--it just fell off the bone and was super flavorful. Also it was a pretty good deal considering all the sides it came with. The dogs enjoyed the leftover shank bone as well :-) Highly recommend trying this place out! You won't be disappointed.

8/6/2021,4 star rating,"Five of us dined here two Fridays ago and were impressed with both quality and service. Not familiar with African cuisine, but always willing to try something new. My eggplant dish was a chopped and sautéed with a variety of spices. Plantain and some type of tender bean were quite tasty. The only disappointing item was the coconut rice which had no real coconut taste to it. Mango smoothie was one of the best I ever have had. Others were also pleased with their dishes and portions were just the right size."
3/14/2021,4 star rating,"The nearly four-year wait is over and Baobab Fare is finally open.  They've done a nice job on the interior and that carries over to the branded merchandise, menus, etc.We ordered their home-made passion fruit juice which is delicious. Then we had the Kuku (Chicken) and the Nyumbani (beef) and both were excellent. The pilau and coconut rice were both great as well.Everything is very flavorful, and they make their own hot sauce called Pili which was also a great accompaniment.  This was our first time having food from eastern Africa and it was quite a bit different than the Nigerian or Senegalese food you can find around Detroit. This was much better actually.The portions were of good size and the prices are reasonable. Our only (small) complaints were the service and the bathroom cleanliness. The owners came to our table and they are very nice, but the server should probably find a different profession. She forgot our order, came and asked us what we ordered 20 minutes later, never checked on us, never asked if we wanted anything else and so forth.The restaurant just opened two weeks ago and I'm guessing the bathroom hadn't been cleaned since. Yikes. Please go to the dollar store and spend a couple of bucks to buy some cleaner and use it every night.We can't wait to go back and try a few other dishes. This is an excellent addition to Detroit's dining scene."
7/9/2021,5 star rating,"I'm so happy I finally got to go to Baobab Fare today!  I had been waiting for them to open for a few years now!  I had already had their food at the African Workd Fest a couple of years ago and my 8 year old daughter and I both loved the food! Today I got the Intore  (sautéed eggplant dish) with the rice pilau, a side of beans, and the Tamu (avocado and passion fruit) dessert.  Everything was delicious!  The food was very flavorful and I loved the decor!  The ceiling designs and floor tiling look original, possibly 100 years old!  Next time I'd like to try the Petits Pois dish (sautéed mixed veggie dish).  I'm a vegetarian and they offer three vegetarian entrees.  The food kind of reminded me of Indian food, which is my favorite! I'm so happy for the owners and I will definitely be back!"

Anyway...we had the Samaki fish, with mustardy sautéed onions on it. Fish was perfectly cooked and moist. The spicy rice was like biryani but with lots of flavors in it. Came with plaintains and some really yummy yellow beans. My husband had the nyumbani stewed beef. Fantastic. Great bright flavor. It came with a really unique side of peanut spinach - like spinach satay, is the closest I could describe it. We also had to try the kuku chicken which was also very good. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu, specifically the goat. We sat at the bar and I think we got a condensed menu there, make sure you ask for the complete menu. They do a booming carryout business. Steady walk ins on a Wednesday!"
10/7/2021,5 star rating,"Ate here last night... tried the beef nyumbani, the samaki fish, and a side of Kuku chicken with mustard and onions, each with the spicy rice. All were wonderful!! Great flavors. If I had to describe it I'd say we were going to eat Indian food and turned right at the Caribbean! That fish was fan.tas.tic!!! Interesting spinach puréed with peanuts. Very unique. Yellow beans also nice and of course enjoyed the plantains. Can't wait to bring friends back so we can try the rest of the menu, they are envious that we went without them! Doing a great business, on a Wednesday, and steady Carryouts as well. I hope they stay here for a long time, such a great addition to our city offerings!!"

2/26/2021,5 star rating,"I have been anticipating the opening Baobab Fare for years, and my first experience not only met, but exceeded expectations! We ordered takeout, which was ready in less than 15 minutes. When we picked up, staff was warm and friendly and efficient in getting us our meal. The food itself was amazing. Every dish was thoughtfully put together and made with care. Great flavors all around. Cannot wait to eat here again."
2/26/2021,5 star rating,I decided to get carry out from here after seeing that a friend ate here.  The owner was very friendly and helpful.  We have never eaten this type of food and it was wonderful!  So flavorful and filling.  The dishes held up very well for the trip home (live 45 min away).  They were fabulous even after the car ride so I can't wait to try them in person sometime.  We ate every bite (and the portion sizes were generous)!

We were enthusiastically greeted by the owner when we walked in and the good vibes just kept coming!  The decor is a mix of cool vintage Detroit and contemporary with some gorgeous Burundi details. The food is ultimate comfort food with great spices, slow-cooked meats and vegetarian/vegan dishes and the avocado/passion fruit pudding was spectacular, I encourage anyone and everyone to try it!"
