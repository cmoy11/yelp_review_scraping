5/10/2022,5 star rating,"This is an experience! An explosion of flavors in every dish. Go with an empty stomach and get ready to enjoy a delightful meal. The brussel sprouts, corn on the cob, chicken wings, fries  and cauliflower were all amazing."
5/3/2022,3 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. This entire place is a great spot for sure. The vibe and music is very fun, chill, and comfortable. The variety of cultural food spots is awesome. And there's a bar which is also a plus! The inside is kept clean with industrial decor. Parking is a challenge though.That dirt and rock parking lot on the side of the building that's free, is EXTREMELY small. So be prepared to park somewhere on the street. From COOP, we ordered the fries, mac&cheese, Brussel sprouts, corn, curry shrimp, and wings to share. The best part of the meal in my opinion was the curry shrimp. Reason being is, I felt like some of my food was burnt (the wings, Brussel sprouts, and corn). Like it stayed on the grill a little too long for my liking. The flavor was good,  but I feel like I prefer the flavor of other nearby Caribbean restaurants."
4/30/2022,4 star rating,"Coop's Jerk Wings are excellent.  There was only one problem with the wings...I didn't order them.  I ordered ribs, but got wings.  The place was too busy and chaotic for me to bother returning to have it fixed.  This is the most popular spot in DSC and your wait will be longer than the other food stalls."
8/1/2021,3 star rating,"We got the jerk ribs and wings.  They are served with the same bbq sauce on top and I expected the chicken and ribs to be on the spicy side.  Nope, it wasn't spicy at all.  The wings were perfect, meat came off the bones with little effort.  The bbq sauce went very well with it.  The ribs were good as well, but the end pieces required bit more work.Next time I go, will have to try their spicy chicken sandwich, coconut curry shrimp and some of their sides."
12/6/2021,4 star rating,"Oh man, Coop has some amazing flavors! You're going to love anything you order from here, from fries to chicken. There is an option when ordering to pick up your food curbside but we've always eaten inside Detroit Shipping Co. Coop is my husband's favorite as he loves a certain level of spice in his food. I will say when ordering from Coop they have taken longer than initially planned. We've waited over an hour for our food before to find it sitting on the counter downstairs. It's certainly worth the wait, though, just plan accordingly."
9/30/2021,5 star rating,Came here after the Growler Gallup 10 mile run. Was about 7:30 on a Sunday. Decided to get the Chicken Fritters and Caribbean Fries. Both were delicious. Loved the aioli on the fries. The girl that took my order was really nice and pleasant and delivered our orders to the table. She also offered us complimentary crispy Brussels when they were shutting down. 5 stars for the service and good food. Will be back to try more menu items.
12/26/2021,2 star rating,"I hate giving bad reviews but this is definitely the majority American version of Caribbean food. I was really disappointed with everything except the plantains. I Brought the curry shrimp home to put it over rice. Unfortunately, the sauce is in the bag due to the cheap container. As much as this little dish cost ($16), they should be able to supply containers more suitable for saucy dishes. LOVE Jamaican food but this didn't fit the bill. Very disappointed."
10/9/2020,4 star rating,"I ate here a while back. They have an infusion of Caribbean like I have never had here in the D. I have tried their jerk wings and their Caribbean corn, both were quite flavorful and so tasty. I wanted more and more, that's how tasty they are. Give it a try. You won't regret it."
10/11/2020,3 star rating,"A friend and wanted to check out the Detroit Shipping Company, just Bc we had heard such good reviews about the options of multiple restaurants, and we knew there was outside dining to enjoy our food during the nice weather.  So we both decided to try COOP Carribean Fusion. I was really excited Bc I have tried the River Bistro a year or so ago, and the food was delicious!  So I was eager to try the food here.I ordered the Chicken Fritters and the Spicy and Crispy Cauliflower.  My friend ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and the Caribbean Fries.! Once we received our food, upon first look, everything looked kind of sloppy to me, and overwhelming.  Once I tried the Chicken Fritters and Cauliflower, I just felt like it was so drenched with toppings that it make both dishes soggy.  Also, reviewing the menu, it says that the Fritters comes with plantain chips, but I didn't receive that.  However, I'm not sure if I looked at an older version of the menu.  But overall, I thought both dishes were ok, and I would like to go back to try other menu options, but my friend felt the same way about the Chicken Sandwich, very sloppy and not too impressed with the overall taste.  Overall, I would like to try COOP again and try other options!"
9/27/2020,5 star rating,"Coop Caribbean Chicken was SO GOOD! I would highly recommend getting any of the chicken there. The person who took my order was so friendly & helpful & I could tell she was really invested in making sure that she was giving people the most accurate knowledge she could. When I asked her how spicy the chicken sandwich I was planning to get was, she said it wasn't too spicy, but if I was nervous then they could remove the hot sauce that went on the sandwich. As I left, I heard her turn to the chef to ask if she could try the chicken to make sure she was gauging the spice level correctly. I really love & appreciate that! The food was delivered to our table so fast & my goodness, such quality chicken! My friend got the jerk wings & they were petite wings that had such juicy, fall-of-the-bone chicken & MY GOODNESS THE FLAVOR! It was so good.We both got the Caribbean corn, which was also packed with flavor & delicious. There are a ton of coconut shavings on top though, and I'm personally not a huge fan of coconut, but hadn't read the menu carefully to realize that's what came on top, so ultimately I still prefer Mexican street corn (elote) to this, but this was still tasty! For my main dish, I got the Motor City spicy chicken sandwich (without the spice) & holy moly, it was to die for! I'm actually really upset that I didn't get a picture of it! I really can't imagine it with the spiciness of the hot sauce, because it was already what felt like the perfect symphony of flavors without it! I feel like any spicy would have masked some of these delicious flavors, which would have been a shame. The sandwich was perfectly fried chicken meat, delicious coleslaw for some creaminess, bacon jam for some sweetness, all on a brioche bun to tie it together. I love it so much. It was definitely quite messy, so I ate it with a fork & a knife, but it worked out so well! I'm still thinking about this sandwich to be quite honest! This might be a little TMI, but after eating the sandwich I went to this event that required me to wear a face mask for several more hours & I could smell the flavors of this sandwich on my breath in my mask & it just reminded me of how good this sandwich was & how I wished I was still eating it LOL.Anyways...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! :D"
9/27/2020,1 star rating,"I was pretty hyped up to try this, but my experience was not that great. The wait was too long, the food was sloppy, and I did not receive my complete order.I ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich, the Caribbean Fries, the Spicy & Crispy Cauliflower, and a water. It was between a 35-40 minute wait to receive my order; pizza does not even take that long! With that long of a wait, my order should be on par and hot. But it was not hot/fresh. The Spicy & Crispy Cauliflower was not received either. The cashier was notified that it was not received, and I was told that it would up in five minutes. another 30 minutes passed, nothing. I was ready to leave and at that point, I just wanted my money back for the Spicy & Crispy Cauliflower since it was not received.The food was really sloppy. I was not pleased at all with the fact that the hot sauce was all over. It felt like I was eating a ""Sloppier Joe"". To top it off, they provide only one of the smallest and thinnest napkins that cannot properly wipe my hands even after one bite. The fries could have been better if they were not so flimsy like they were old.The only enjoyable thing about this restaurant was the flavor. If the restaurant served a cleaner sandwich that is not toppled over when received, and fresher, my one-star rating would be at least a three-star. Moreover, if the customer service was better, than I would be much happier and rate this restaurant five stars."
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"First the Caribbean fries. I never had fries like that. I love their garlic aioli sauce. It was so delicious, I'd take that over cheese fries any day. The chicken fritters were juicy and tender. Their guava mango bbq sauce is insane! I usually hate coleslaws but there's were lit. We'll be definitely order them again along with some other items."
12/1/2020,4 star rating,"Try the ribs. They were excellent. Huge, well-cooked, with a delicious sauce that had just the right amount of kick. I'll go back just for these, and I'll definitely try the wings. Online ordering worked well, and my pick up was easy and no contact. The order was complete and well-packed."
6/19/2020,5 star rating,LOVE LOVE THEIR JERK CHICKEN. Got some today on the infamous JUNETEENTH. Never had them before but was very impressed. Will def. Fo back for more at a later date when the world opens back up regularly.
2/18/2022,4 star rating,"Good ass food, a little over priced for food portion sizes but good as fuck!! Recommend to all my friends"
1/24/2019,3 star rating,"This is one of the food stalls inside the Detroit Shipping Company. I ordered the Caribbean fries and Mac n cheese for my 5 yo. The fries were kind of crispy, but could have been cooked longer for a better texture. I wasn't a fan of the queso fresco on top so would ask for plain next time. The Mac had an enormous mound of crumb topping that dried out the cheese sauce. The crumb topping wasn't toasted so it didn't do much for the dish other than give it a gritty texture.  I wish this place had pics or better descriptions of their food. It would have encouraged me to try some more dishes. My kid saw the Caribbean corn (elote) after we had finished eating so we will have to come back to try that."
1/24/2020,4 star rating,"I had a great experience at COOP Carribean Fusion, I must say Carribean food is ascending on my list of favorite foods. Although they didn't have much in terms of options for pescatarians what I did have was very good. I had the Carribean Fries and Carribean Corn and they were both amazing. Both full of flavor and great tasting, especially the fries."
2/12/2020,4 star rating,"The set up is really cool! It's located inside the shipping company, where there are multiple places to eat. I ordered jerk wings and Brussels sprouts. The wings were delicious, would have loved a little more sauce to go with them. They were light handed with that. The Brussels were good but to sweet and to much sauce. The sauce made them really wet. I prefer a light coating of sauce and a less sweet sauce on Brussels. Overall though, tasty and I will return to try something else. The corn on cob looked really good."
9/5/2019,4 star rating,"My rating is probably more a 3.75, but they had good service so it gets a bump up (server had come out to bring us our food since the beepers don't have reception at the outdoor seating).We had the Chef Max Famous Brussels, the Caribbean Corn, and the scoop Wings.When our server brought us our food--MMM I was so stoked to eat it. The aroma from the brussel sprouts and chicken had me salivating. The chicken was char-grilled (a bit on the heavier side that there was plain ash I had to peel off--but that's just me trying to avoid gastric cancer lol) and was doused in bbq sauce. I think their sauce was homemade-- it wasn't too thick or sweet. The tangerines and lime they topped the wings with went perfectly with it. Definitely do not eat this without squeezing the limes and nibbling on the tangerines as you go. It provides a well-rounded taste that way.The brussel sprouts smelled better than flavor. It was 3 out of 5 stars for me. I was expecting more crisp and more flavor. It was a bit watery. I would still eat it as a snack, but it's just not the best brussel sprouts I've had.The corn needed some work. It's yummy if you have a huge sweet tooth, but overall there was a lot of flavors going on. It didn't quite unify for me. We think there is mayo in the sauce bc the sauce was thick and had some unexpected flare to it. Since this is Caribbean food, I expected spice on this corn (like elote Mexican corn), but there was no spice. I think that could've helped cut through the sweetness."
8/29/2019,4 star rating,"Felt like I had to chime in here since their reviews are so bad.I've been to Detroit Shipping Company twice now and the first time we ordered a few things from COOP. I believe we got the jerk chicken wings and they were great. The only complaint I have is that it took a little bit of time to get the wings, but that seems to be the standard at DSC for most of the eateries because they're usually so busy. We also got an order of the Brussels sprouts and those were fantastic as well.COOP had a lot of other dishes that I wanted to try as well, so I'm sure I will in the future."
1/18/2019,4 star rating,"Very tasty. We ordered the jerk chicken wings from here and also the Brussels sprouts. I consider myself somewhat of a Brussels sprouts connoisseur at this point, and these were among the best I've had - they had maple syrup, queso fresco, bacon, and cilantro on them, and were a great complement to the chicken pad thai roll that we picked up at Bangkok 96 next door. The chicken wings were $9 and the Brussels sprouts were $6 - a little pricey, but the taste made it worth it.The only reason this place gets 4 stars from me rather than 5 is that service could have been friendlier. They do give you a buzzer which was useful, but the person working the counter looked like she would rather be doing something else with her time. Next time I want to try the elote here (corn) as well as some of the sandwiches - the steak sandwich looked tasty."
3/13/2021,3 star rating,"Had the Caribbean fries, garlic aioli, fresco cheese and Cajun seasoning. Loved the concept and again had high hopes, but unfortunately not good at all, they were too sweet, didn't expect sweetness at all. Next time I'll stick with my first mind for sure, drinks only at Detroit Shipping Company."
8/12/2018,4 star rating,"The Detroit Shipping Company is a great place for hanging out for a drink or grabbing some food. I went to Coop Farm to Table and got their jerk chicken, steak empanadas, and carribean corn.The chicken was pretty good as it was juicy, however, it was a little burnt in some parts. The spice rub was the winner. The empanadas were tasty and the pairing of the sauce and cilantro was a nice touch. The corn was flavorful with the chili lime and cheese! I would definitely come back again!"
1/15/2019,2 star rating,"Well, I'd *love* to be able to give this place a better rating, but based on our first experience, I just can't, and a two-star ""Meh.  I've experienced better."" statement is absolutely correct.Let me be clear:  I tried food from three of the purveyors at DSC tonight, and of the three, Coop's fare was *far* in the rear.  I ordered the jerk chicken wings, as the half chicken, for some odd reason that defies explanation, wasn't available.  On a Tuesday night.  Before a Red Wings game.Let me emphasize this:  it was *never* available today.  They did not ""run out""...they just never had it available in the first place, on GAME NIGHT.  I'm thinking poor planning to start with.Those jerk chicken wings, though?  Really a poor offering.  Don't misunderstand:  the sauce, mandarin oranges, the lime wedge...they were all fine, and should be applauded.  I'm sure with some decent, meaty, juicy chicken, this would be a *darned* good dish.  Expensive, but worth it, especially as a treat before the Wings game.  I mean, you might as well spend your money here before the big old price hike at LCA, right?Well, maybe not.  These things were *sorry* excuses for wings.  Dry, tough, bereft of meat, really difficult to eat.  I wanted to take them back, and probably should have (so I'm willing to accept at least 20% of the blame, here), but quite frankly, there just didn't seem to be enough time to do so, and I didn't want to go to the trouble.There was nothing wrong with the service level, except that, surely:  these wings shouldn't have been served to anyone.  They were visibly *tiny*, and there's no person with partially-legal eyesight that would look at these and say, ""Yeah, sure, I'd gladly pay for those.""  They looked poor, and tasted/ate worse.I'm not condemning them to live in death or anything...it could have just been an off night, or a *really* poor batch of wings, and again:  I didn't take them back and say anything when I should have (which was after eating/trying to eat *one* wing).  However, this was a dish which was greatly touted beforehand, and couldn't have been much more disappointing.  Not worth the time, much less the money, and they were *not* inexpensive.I'll try them again, but I'll say something ahead of time, I think."

12/19/2020,4 star rating,"Tried the jerk ribs. The spice giant got immediately at first but kind of gradually built as I was eating them. They were delicious but aside from the dogs I'm not 100% sure what would put them apart from regular ribs, I really like ribs though so I can't complain."
1/12/2020,1 star rating,"Absolutely horrendous customer service for sub-par food. First and last time ordering or recommending this place. I ordered a meal for delivery and not only did 1/2 my meal NOT make it to me. They kept changing the time of delivery causing it to be 1 hour over the proposed time. The driver was sorry when he arrived and I looked at the bag realizing how light it was, he said ""This is what they gave me and the TOLD ME to tell you they didn't have anymore"". What type of customer service is that?How hard is it to call a customer and say ""Hello, I know you just ordered an entree but we have run out of this. Would you like me to pick something else (instead of WAIT on that item) or would you like to cancel?"" How hard is that to do? Apparently, it is hard for them to handle and honestly I wish them the best. Please use this review as a learning opportunity. Do better."

10/22/2020,3 star rating,"Their spicy chicken sandwich has tons of stuff on it looks huge and amazing, but tastes OKAY!"
7/27/2018,4 star rating,Loved the concept of this restaurant and location. It's like a mash up of Food truck meets cafe. The menu boasts a great variety of Caribbean inspired selections. We tried the Chicken Sausage (on top of a pineapple slice) and the Steak Sandwich paired with Mac n' Cheese for both. Both dishes were filled with flavor and absolutely delicious. One of the perks of the location (Detroit Shipping Co.) is the variety of restaurants offered within the space. Next door to Coop to Table are Asian and Mexican restaurants. There are still a few unopened stations that may soon be filled with other food options. *Fingers crosses for an Indian spot * All restaurants posted affordable prices for the dishes and serve your meals on cafeteria style trays. Indoor and outdoor seating are available. There is also a bar located in the middle of the location offering both alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. Along the upper outer perimeter is a podcast station and t-shirt printing shop. I'd say the only downfall is the parking. There is shared non-paved parking with the Peterboro next door and some street parking offered also. There are security guards watching the lot which makes you feel more comfortable but the bumpiness makes for a not so pleasant parking experience.
3/12/2020,2 star rating,"I placed a Grub Hub order on 3/118 piece wingsBrussels sproutsFriesThe chicken I assume was smoked but it was bleeding and pink not a Smokey pink. So, I was very disappointed when Grub Hub said they contacted you and you would not grant a refund.The Brussels sprouts and fries slapped HARD! By far the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had! Unfortunately the only fowl I eat med-rare is duck breast.If those Brussels sprouts weren't so good I'd hit you with the I'm not returning, but since the execution on the other food was so good...I'm hitting you with my utter disappointment and 2 stars!"
8/10/2019,1 star rating,"I'm here on a not so busy Saturday afternoon and my wings and corn have taken 25 minutes.  Twenty-five minutes in a place that's essentially carry out. I also asked for no bacon on my corn which cake out with bacon. After taking it back, I was assured It was not bacon but bread crumbs so I trim a bite... it was bacon.  So disappointed, I had Coop at a Metro Times event and thought it was good.... not my experience today. The chicken wings were already cooked and dry bu they add Sweet Baby Rays sauce right from the jar.... not good!"
7/25/2019,2 star rating,Brussel sprouts were good. Not enough bacon but good portion size.  Wings sucked.  Jerk is not burnt.  Portion and wing size small for cost. Food was not hot. Disappointed. The space they are in is nice.

10/25/2018,3 star rating,"We came to Detroit shipping company to check it out before a show and it's such a cool concept. Restaurants and hang out spot made by shipping containers! It has a cafeteria concept so there's a few places to order from which share the dining area. We decided to get a bite at Coop. We ordered the chicken sandwich and jerk chicken wings. While presentation was beautiful, the taste was just mediocre. The chicken wings were a little too charred for my liking. The sauce was pretty good though. The sandwhich had good coleslaw but it was just an ordinary chicken sandwich to me - nothing to write home about. Overall, seems like a cool place to hang out but very cliche hipster food."
8/28/2018,3 star rating,"The food and the customer service are great at Coop. I had the Midtown Crispy Chicken-Fork sandwich. It has to be one of the best tasting chicken sandwiches in town. It's dressed with bacon jam, pimento cheese, and pickles. The crispy Brussels sprouts are also amazing. The sauce or drippings or whatever is in that bowl is sooo good. We wanted to try the Coop wings and the Mac and cheese but they were sold out. The Jamaica punch is also good. The drawback is the pricing for the amount of food that you receive. The portions are rather small. Seriously small. The chicken sandwich is open faced, and it's a ""regular"" piece of bread. The price was approximately $20 for what you see in my photos. Coop is big on taste, but small on portions."

The jerk chicken was cooked perfectly ( tender and cooked throughout but not pink), and the sprouts were excellent ( for those non pork eaters or vegetarians I'm sure they can prepare them without the bacon). Serving size was significant enough that I brought home some leftovers! The two young ladies were pleasant especially when I asked for their recommendation on what I should order. I love the setting here at the Detroit Shipping Company--there are large communal tables inside and outside as well as a bar to order drinks if you like. This location, I suspect will be a fun place to hang out once people discover it, as they told me that there will be nightly music coming soon."
