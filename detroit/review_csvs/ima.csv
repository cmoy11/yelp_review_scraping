6/3/2022,5 star rating,The BBQ tofu sandwich is amazing!! I do wish it was vegan though. They do have a good amount of vegan options.  The dine in is all tented and you order at the front and get a number and sit at your table.
11/18/2021,5 star rating,The food is great. I love all the vegan options on the menu. The tofu sandwich's are amazing! Midtown and Corktown both have different ones both equally amazing. The kitchen is quick so you get your food fast.
5/21/2022,5 star rating,My son recommended several items. I do not have the menu items memorized - I know one was a Pho dish with chicken - and it was excellent. The other was a dish with thicker noodles and pork which I loved!  I was able to get takeaway twice and I will go back. Highly recommend. Friendly good service as well!
4/24/2022,2 star rating,I've wanted to go here since they opened. We finally made it for lunch today. I was underwhelmed. I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen with chicken and found it quite tasteless and was quite out off by the lunch meat. My partner had the Seafood Kimchi Ramen and he liked it very much. I tried his and found it quite tasty.
4/3/2022,4 star rating,"Super friendly staff, cool vibe and delicious comfort food for a chilly night... stopped in for dinner with some colleagues while in town on business... the food was great... very flavorful and priced right! We loved sitting in the enclosed outdoor space, complete with disco ball. I was so in the mood for a big bowl of ramen and this did not disappoint... I could barely make a dent in it! I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town! Stop in and go hungry!"

3/11/2022,3 star rating,"I don't feel like this is a very fair review as this place and the food just wasn't for me (or my friend). We were headed to the Fisher Theatre on Super Bowl Sunday to see a show. Little did we know, the place we intended to eat at was closed for a staff party. So was another restaurant we tried to visit. We begin to get desperate for food as we were hungry and didn't have much time before the show. Ima is a small place with tent type dining only. There were heaters running that evening but I was still chilly. I think the atmosphere would be a lot more fun on a warm day. Parking is street metered parking only but it was free on Sunday. I had no clue what to order because this was my first experience with Japanese food. I ordered what I thought was safest - Chicken Pho. But it was not my cup of tea. I ate as much as I could, but after a while I just couldn't stomach it anymore. This could be some of the best Japanese around but you'll have to count me out!"
3/10/2022,5 star rating,"Wow! We finally got to try ima & I am so happy with the experience! The patio is the ""dine-in"" area, so be prepared to dress for the weather. Patio dining in March at ima didn't even phase me! The delicious warm beef pho kept me warm the entire time! The portions were large, I even had a nice bowl of leftovers to savor later that evening. We started with a sparking blood orange San Pellegrino & a bowl of nicely seasoned edamame. Delicious! My daughter ordered the tofu pho- it looked amazing & the tofu was presented beautifully rested atop the perfectly cooked bowl of goodness. The curry udon looked amazing! I must get that dish the next time I come to ima noodles! I'm already looking forward to the next visit."

2/13/2022,3 star rating,"Star- for seating and ambianceStar- friendly serviceStar- pricing and portion sizeDishes are hit or miss depending on your orderI have been to ima before at another location and enjoyed the experience. I would say if you're into the udon noodle scene and try a broth base you would likely enjoy it more than ordering just the buttered noodle. The yaki udon noodles is what I had this go around and did not enjoy it, it had a bit of a fishy smell, likely because of the seaweed. All their udon noodle dishes have some form of seaweed base which the chef informed us about later on.If you want to be adventurous I would recommend this , its a hit or miss depending on the dish you order but the ambiance is amazing especially with the disco ball. We went around 8pm in mid February and were seated quickly in this outdoor heated tent which had a very cool vibe!"
2/12/2022,5 star rating,Tonight was my first time at ima. It's 10 pm on a Saturday and they're playing all the hits from the 80's! Lionel Ritchie and Michael Jackson. Great vibe. I got the yaki udon and would rank it as one best noodle dishes I've ever had. The pork belly will melt in your mouth.
2/10/2022,5 star rating,"The food here is great! I always order from doordash because of the pandemic, but the food always arrives tasty and hot. Probably some of the best ramen I've had in a long time, and they're great at seasoning the meat. The noodles are just the right consistency and the pot stickers are just as good as they look on the menu."
2/9/2022,4 star rating,Great take on Asian fusion food. Good food for a good price. Kudos to the chefs !!!!!
1/20/2022,4 star rating,"The noodles here are pretty good. I like the clams for an appetizer. The service is hit or miss though. I have been at times and gotten attentive staff then other times I've gotten a server that was very off. However, the quality of the food has been consistent. The bao burgers are also a favorite of mine. The noodles depend on what you are in the mood for. Personally I like the seafood soup with kimchi. You don't get that much of a variety in the seafood but the quality is good."
1/14/2022,5 star rating,"This place is a MUST try! I loved the esthetic of the place and the workers were so friendly. We got the steamed edamame which were so flavorful and the shrimp & scallion dumplings were perfect with the chili-black vinegar sauce. The beef pho was to dieeee for, I was craving some good pho and this did it for me. Tasted so fresh and was served right away piping hot. I will definitely be back again!"
1/9/2022,5 star rating,"This place had the absolute best Pho I have ever had from New Jersey, to Maryland, to Michigan! The broth was one of a kind and delicious, along with a unique and tasty edamame and kimshi! 5 Stars!!!!!"
1/9/2022,5 star rating,This restaurant was great! The food was delicious and the drinks were good! I got the Boombap with roasted tofu. For my drink I got the Nigori Sake and plum wine. Mixed together it's really good! I was very satisfied with everything. My partner got the Yaki Udon with  sesame chicken. For his drink he got the patio punch. He loved everything which is rare. I might've liked his food more than mine.! It was soooo good. The service was good and they have heaters. I would like to come back here and highly recommend it.
1/6/2022,5 star rating,I went with the seafood kimchi udon. It was quite appetizing on a cold winter day. The portion size was reasonable and I enjoyed the dish. I would return if I'm in the area. My guest had the forest udon and really enjoyed it as well.
12/18/2021,2 star rating,"Went into ima with very high expectations, hearing rave reviews and looking to enjoy a delicious bowl of ramen. Unfortunately I was not entirely impressed. At the time we went (late dinner on a Friday night), service was very busy as expected. There were a few free seats along the window that we asked if we could sit at, but were told that they were going to be in use. With the long wait time indicated for seating, we decided to get take out instead. The entire time we waited for our food these tables were not put into use. When our food was ready, we eagerly took it and headed home to enjoy. Although the experience is likely better in person, as when you order take out you have to add items to your own bowl, but I imagine it comes ready to eat in house. The two dishes we tried were mediocre. And sadly a hair was found floating in one of the broths. My high expectations were not met and unfortunately because of this I would not try it out again."
12/14/2021,5 star rating,"Great find for the outskirts of Detroit. We tried the tacos, which we didn't realize had a radish shell but the flavors were great! The clam appetizer is a must and the chicken sandwich was good too. We had the seafood udon which was good but we were so full from the other dishes it was hard to compare them all. Definitely get the clams and try some of the other non-noodle dishes though! I think they are the highlight of this place even though it's a noodle place. Would highly recommend as a a lunch place. Service was great and the atmosphere is very cute, picnic area-esque."
12/8/2021,5 star rating,It's always a treat to go to Ima. The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is always kind and helpful. I love the outside area they have set up and it really allows you to be safe during COVID. The ramen is to die for and there is a lot of selection if someone in your party is vegetarian or vegan. They also have a pretty decent drinks selection. I very much suggest it.
3/15/2021,5 star rating,"This place deserves the expansions it has been experiencing. I have been going to this place for years and consistently I get only the Forest Udon and be satisfied. My last visit, I decided to do something different and go for the Golden Curry and...I cheated myself by adding extra tofu and ginger beef. It was a full step up from my first time curry experience the day before.Customer service wise, everyone is always friendly, thoroughly explain the ordering system and precautionary rules due to Covid, and occasionally check in.I recommend this place often and typically the Michigan location because...well it's the original spot!"
7/22/2021,1 star rating,"COVID/ SEATING- looks like outdoor only. There is plenty of covered outdoor. However, not all the seats will have wall covering so if it rains and you are on the outer most seat, you will get wet. FOOD- this is my third time here and I regret it every time. I only came here as my third time because my friend wanted to. He got the kimchi seafood udon which I had a little mini bowl sample serving of from him and vegan pho. They forgot the kimchi topping in the udon so we had to ask for the separately. The kimchi is soured kimchi which I like but it had a soap/ fragrance flavour in the end. The udon itself tasted really weird. I've never had anything like it before- in a bad way. It was taking too many things and combing the flavours. Weird. This is my third vegan pho from three different places and this one comes last place. My biggest complaints: 1) didn't have much flavour, 2) it was too sweet. Why does it need to be sweet?! Lastly, 3) it didn't come hot. It came lukewarm. I have never had pho come to the table lukewarm. SERVICE- little slow."

7/6/2021,4 star rating,Had a great time out with friends! I ordered the boombap (ima's take on bibimbap) and friends ordered assorted noodles. I ended up wishing that I'd gotten noodles too - their dishes looked and smelled absolutely delicious. The boombap was fine - I thought it looked better than it tasted as the proportions of the different elements didn't really make sense for a flavor balance - it was very heavy on ginger and pickles. Each element was great by itself and the egg on top was prepared well. I would definitely visit ima again to explore other menu items.
5/11/2021,4 star rating,"Good food, eh prices.  I walked in and was amazed by the aromas hitting me.  I was so excited to try this place, but walked out paying almost $50 to feed 2 people!  May or may not come back for 2nd's."
6/27/2021,5 star rating,"Such a wonderful place! It used to have indoor dining but now it's all outside in two tents.Make sure to get the patio punch it's very refreshing and they also have a variety of other specialty cocktails, sake and beer.I've had the lobster udon twice it's my favorite thing on the menu but I also really enjoy the spicy pork udon. The lobster is perfectly cooked and you can get all kinds of different toppings.  I had avocado on it which was lovely.They used to have a great salad where you can get a variety of toppings on it but since the pandemic unfortunately that's been off the menu hope they bring it back someday.My parents love Johnny noodle king but I've never wanted to go there because I love this place so much!"
4/17/2021,3 star rating,I ordered shrimp pho and an order of kids udon. My pho was great up until I went for the shrimp. Doesn't appear that they clean out the shrimp properly. Killed my entire appetite. I'll try this place again any maybe just order udon since my kids meal was actually really good. See attached photo of unclean shrimp.
10/26/2021,4 star rating,"I love Ima! We just had the udon tonight. That broth is made with love. Im giving it four stars because this was the second time the chicken bites came burnt, however after speaking with Julie she was able to resolve the issue. The broth is good, the sauce.Also tried the ""yams"" it was surprisingly tasty.We love the fact that you can always have leftovers!"
9/4/2021,5 star rating,"The atmosphere was great, all the seating was outside and the area was surrounded with string lights and cute decorations. I ordered the Spicy Tuna Don +avocado; the tuna and the avocado were fresh and tasted great Lots of vegetarian, vegan, and pescatarian options to choose from and everything was clearly labeled. I will be coming back again soon!"
10/9/2020,3 star rating,"I decided to start with the house pickle plate, the lobster udon, subbed with rice noodles and added trumpet mushrooms and had my egg fried fully. We also ordered the Boombap, fully cooked eggs, added chicken, Trumpet mushroom and avocado. We were told after cashing out, which table to sit at out on their porch.That's some aged kimchi on our house pickle plate. It tastes quite tart, too much fermentation for me. The white kimchi isn't for me either. Both would be good in a stew. As a Korean, this kimchi isn't what I am used to and makes me cringe when I bite into it. The heat sauce added a nice kick to my bland lobster udon soup. The lobster meat is tender. The soup overall isn't bad. Not special and didn't leave me wanting for more. The broth is better with the heat sauce. It was creamy before the heat, but on the bland side. The bowls are mostly filled with either the rice or noodles. A lot of one or the other as filler. It appears the bowls are filled 2/3 with the rice and noodles and the top is done to make it look really full of other stuff when it's topped. The Boombap comes with their heat sauce. It would be so much better with a gochujang, of course. The disco ball is starting to reflect its luminescence all around the porch as it gets a bit darker out. It's getting more clubby by the hour. The service was quick and fast and good. The food was average."

12/6/2021,5 star rating,This place was highly suggested by a co-worker. A group of us and hubby went land enjoyed it. The ambience was nice and cozy. We were seated in an outdoor tent. Nice and warm and well lit. I ordered the spicy pork udon and hubby ordered the spicy chicken udon. We ordered the hot sauce on the side and ordered the Blue Whale Sake. The noodles were freakin amazinggggg. The broth was perfectly seasoned and while the hot sauce added a kick it was not needed. The sake was so smooth that we ended up ordering another bottle. No hang over next day but gave us a nice buzz. Our waiter was pleasant and recommended certain dishes and the sake. This is a great place to go to for nice soup and a cozy vibe. Will be back.

5/12/2021,5 star rating,"Really enjoyed this place! They're taking Covid precautions super seriously with by limiting customers inside the store at once, providing outside seating, as well as contact tracing. I had a hard time deciding between the Spicy Pork Udon and the Seafood Kimchi Udon but I ended up going with the kimchi one. The soup was very flavorful and it was packed with seafood. They definitely did not skimp!!! It was my first meal in Detroit and I was super pleasantly surprised. If I'm ever back here I know where I'm going first!!!"
3/28/2021,5 star rating,"This Spot is cute and very laid back. As you enter the entrance the first thing you see is a Window ordering plus the kitchen. At first, I was confused as we never been here and I didn't know if we were supposed to wait to be seated. You do have to order in the window order. They do have multiple menus aside available to look at. Then someone guides you to the side of the building where they have a taint enclosure and it's heated. The staff was very prompt, they all wear a face mask. Our food and drink were so good. The serving bowl is huge, we couldn't finish and had to take some home. We will definitely come back again. There is a lot of parking spot to park around the corner if you can't get the spot in the front."
7/18/2021,3 star rating,"This review is solely for our last visit. We normally go to the Madison Heights location but had guests in town and were closeer to this one.Normally I like this location just fine but the sandwich I got the other day was borderline offensive. $13 for a cold hard slab of tofu, sloppily doused in bbq sauce and slapped onto an untoasted bun? Ya'll forreal? I could've stayed home for that travesty. The rest of our order was decent but my sandwich legit pissed me off. They were swamped and our waitress was trying her hardest to keep everyone happy so I didn't make a fuss but I hope management reads this because it was totally unacceptable."
4/26/2018,5 star rating,"When I'm homesick for good ramen, Ima is where I'm at. Although the noodles are all udon, the flavor is authentic and the food is fresh and of good quality. I'm personally not a big fan of the communal seating, or bar seating style, but I get it since the space is limited. My two favorite dishes are the mushroom udon, which is a lighter soup, and then the spicy pork, which is heavier/heartier and great when it's cold out. Haven't tried any of the rice bowls as of yet, but I'm sure they're great too. Waitstaff is chill, haven't experienced anything but goodness all around."

5/19/2021,5 star rating,This spot had some of the best noodles ever. I love a good udon noodle but it's so hard to find sometimes. I got the Tori udon and it was perfect. A great ratio of noodles broth and veggies with some chicken and a soft egg. I also got a side of kimchi which was yummy just as is as well as swirled into the broth. Next time I'm in Detroit I will be stopping here!
5/31/2021,5 star rating,"This place has good food and fast service. My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday early evening. There was a wait but once we ordered and sat down the food came out quickly but the timing between appetizers and dinner was perfect. The only thing I could say negatively would be the texture of the noodles. The udon I am familiar with are much small in diameter. The udon Ima serves were very thick. I would go back again but will substitute rice noodles, a much thinner noodle. I was in the mood for Roman, probably why I was disappointed, not Ima's fault."
9/15/2020,5 star rating,"I remember being so hyped when I got to try Ima for the first time. I was like man, an actually delicious noodle place in Detroit! A lot has changed since Feb. 2017, my first time here, but I can still remember how delicious the forest udon was and still is. It's been a mainstay on the menu and it holds strong as one of the best items on the menu!The staff is incredibly friendly, and while I remember being squished into the small dining room when they first opened, they're new outdoor patio has been incredibly clutch. Can't wait for my next visit!"
1/27/2020,4 star rating,"Really cute Asian-style restaurant in Detroit! We had the dumplings as an appetizer, the spicy pork udon, and the unagi-don. The dumplings were really good and came with a chili sauce and the kimchi. The kimchi was really unique and a little sour, but I liked the acidity! The spicy pork udon was a little spicy, but still a pretty good broth. The noodles were really done, but I wasn't a fan of the pork. It wasn't fatty like pork belly, and honestly kind of tasted like ham to me. Everything else in the soup was really good though, albeit a little bit spicy. I really enjoyed the unagi-don though. It was very cool, and the unagi (eel) was absolutely delicious.We came on a Sunday night, and the place is small but we had no problem getting a seat. The ambiance is really cute, and our waitress was really friendly about giving recommendations. Would love to come back!"
9/6/2019,5 star rating,"I came here to meet up with a friend. They recommended this spot as one of their favorites. There was parking on the street and parking in various lots that were ok for after hours but would be questionable for regular business hours as they were business related parking. The place is small and quaint. They seem to specialize in Noodle related items with an Asian twist. The waitress was very attentive and sat us pretty quickly. The Taco appetizer was recommended so I opted for the shrimp. This was very flavorful. You also have to be very careful on handling the item as the tacos are not huge. The mixture of lettuce, shrimp and sauce with an Asian flair was pretty good. I then ordered the Spicy Yukon on recommendation. It came with noodles, pork slices, greens and a boiled egg floating in a broth. The taste had a nice spicy kick to it. I like spicy so bring it on. This place was a unique and welcome spot in the Detroit area. It also had friendly and attentive service. I enjoyed the food and drinks and will definitely visit again."
11/16/2019,4 star rating,"A very solid restaurant located on Michigan Avenue. This place is decorated with art, murals and has a very chill ambiance set with lofi music. It was a busy day so the waitstaff was here and there but we did get our food on time what more could you ask for. Asked for chilli oil never got. Ordered edamame, salmon potato salad with roe and udon noodles. Salmon potatoe was really good, roe was a good addition. Edamame was spiced with zattar spice which was a great addition. Udon noodles were solid, our freind had the one pictured was a level up from our noodles aha If your looking for a chill spot with upscale food and traditional sake this is a good choice 85/100"
11/1/2021,1 star rating,"Have been hearing about this place for a while and decided to try it when needing to make a reservation for seven people for my mothers birthday. They don't do reservations but when I called YESTERDAY (Sunday), I was told that I should be able to get a table no problem as mondays are slow. I was nervous about taking the chance but decided to go for it. So what happens today, (one day after I called)? They change their hours and are no longer open on mondays. I don't normally write bad reviews, even when service or food isn't great but to take seven people to a new restaurant without a reservation when they assured me it would be fine, and then to be left standing there looking like an idiot and ruining dinner plans AT SEVEN PM on the night of someone's birthday is really infuriating. How do you switch your hours from one day to the next and not make sure your employees know that the restaurant will be closed part of the week? How can you tell people to show up with large groups of people for a birthday and not even have the courtesy of letting them know that they may end up showing up to an empty restaurant? I guess I now get to find somewhere else to eat with a party of seven for a birthday. Cool! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone after being burned like this. I've never been so upset about interactions with restaurant staff in my life because guess who gets to take the blame for this? I promise you it's not the person who misled me on the phone. It's me."

10/24/2021,2 star rating,"SOOOOOOO bad, even for Detroit. They tried but it's just below average Asian fusion.  Tuna tartare had actually no tuna in it and was all spicy Mayo, my fault I should have known better. Can get same quality of udon out of the packet from the grocery...Outdoor ambiance is nice.FYI I gave them a two star instead of one because I feel bad and it's Detroit so theyre persisting against all odds lmfao but really if you're Asian don't come here."
11/20/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first time going to a restaurant that serves both pho and udon noodles.  I was very pleased with the menu as they had a vegan and vegetarian options.The jicama tacos although they did not stay together, were very flavourful and I enjoyed them. For my meal I tried udon noodles, I had the curry noodles. They are very well spiced.  I did not need to add any hot sauce because I do enjoy things that are spicy. I am not a huge fan of the runny eggs, but I like the fact that the egg could ""cook"" in the broth that was provided with Udon.  It was delicious. I can't say much for the other meal that a picture is positive because it had meat, but smelling it Smelled that it was very flavourful as well. I know it was enjoyed by the person that accompany me for the meal at the restaurant. I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu."

10/22/2019,5 star rating,"I'd like to start off this review by saying wowsers! I was not familiar with this restaurant at all, but very cool atmosphere. You can enjoy the sun and sit outside, or sit indoors. The staff here is pretty friendly as well. The spicy pork udon was phenomenal! I would highly recommend getting extra noodles if you like to eat like myself. The flavor of the broth was spicy yet not overwhelming, and overall so so flavorful. The half boiled egg was to die for, and the pork was cooked very nicely. I liked it so much I got it to go a second time. Defi Italy not as good, so I'd recommend eating it right as it's made. Overall, I was very pleased with the meal and will definitely be going again to try other items on the menu!"
8/16/2021,4 star rating,"Ima is good but severely overpriced. We ordered the tofu sandwich, spicy pork udon, kimchi udon, and unagi bowl. Food came out very quickly, and luckily the weather was nice outdoors because there's only outdoors seating. The tofu sandwich had potential but the execution fell short. Tofu was overpowered by the slaw, and it was drenched in sauce that quickly soaked bread. Broths in both noodle soups were tasty and had enough seasoning. Some of the seafood in the kimchi udon was overcooked (crawfish was dry as a bone) and the veggies were raw. The pork was too lean in the pork udon. Unagi bowl was standard. Basically we liked the flavors for the most part but don't see any reason to go here when mom and pop Asian restaurants do it better for cheaper."
6/16/2019,4 star rating,"Super yummy food that is worth the drive/wait/uncomfortable chairs.We went here to celebrate my (half) birthday, and appreciated the well labeled menu. Not a ton of things that were both vegetarian and GF, but the things that were happen to be super tasty. My partner and I split the avocado jicama tacos; these were sublime! He had the udon (he said solid but not amazing) while I had the vegan pho (super tasty) with the smoked trumpets mushrooms (not worth the extra $$). We finished with the strawberries and tofu custard without the malt cookie and that was the best item of the night!Our server was nice but Infrequently visited us early on, and the chairs were SO uncomfortable, and definitely not good for either disabled people or fat folks, and I happen to be both. I would come back again but ice my body before hand to counteract the painful seats."
8/28/2019,5 star rating,I love IMA! Have been multiple times and have never had a bad experience. My favorites dishes are the Lobster Udon Noodle and the BBQ eel.The atmosphere is cool and I'd recommend going when there is nice weather and enjoy the outdoor covered patio. The shrimp tacos and dumplings are also worth a try! I understand why it was named restaurant of year!
6/12/2018,4 star rating,"Excellent Spot. Had the homemade house dumplings , excellent. The lobster udon was BOMB so flavorful. Got a curry rice dish with Shrimp also just delicious.  The house punch was a refreshing drink. Prices were good and I will def be going back."
7/17/2020,4 star rating,"I've been here probably at least a dozen times between all of their locations and tried most of the menu at this point. I don't dislike coming here, but don't really go out of my way to visit either since my bill always ends up pretty high whenever I eat in. Customer service is always excellent and the restaurant is well maintained and clean.I have ordered the curry udon, tori udon, and spicy pork udon. I find them to be pretty decent, but not the best that I've had. The broths are pretty good and I think the curry udon is a great comfort dish.What I usually order is the Unagi-don. There are definitely not many options for Unagi in downtown Detroit and they do a great job here. I love the fresh avocado, sprouts, and slaw that come with the Unagi-don. The unagi is cooked really well and has just enough of that charred flavour.The dumplings are pretty good, but nothing special and expensive at $2 per dumpling.Beer selection is always pretty interesting and pleasant. I wish they had more Japanese beers, since it doesn't seem too hard to get Hitachino in Michigan."
1/31/2019,5 star rating,"Great for in house eating OR takeout, ima is also open later which makes it my go to place when I'm in Detroit for an event and need some eats after (fun fact, event planners rarely eat at their own events. We're usually too busy. And ima is INFINITELY better than my go to when I'm not in Detroit--Taco Bell). Takeout also lasts amazingly well from Detroit to Ann Arbor, FYI. It was still hot last time I brought it home AND it was the dead of winter! My go-tos are the forest udon and the tori udon (I always add an egg and chicken to the former) and for starters the edamame and dumplings are aces. The strawberries and cream dessert is also a lovely way to end the meal if you like a bit of sweet. Service is outstanding. Prices are great and the portions are plentiful. Love this spot and I'm already craving a return for their warm, comforting broth. Especially during this crazy polar vortex!"
4/5/2020,5 star rating,"This restaurant was so kind and caring during a time of uncertainty for all.  In spite of the challenges of operating an independent business during the state mandated ""shelter in place"" orders, they prepared and hand delivered the most delicious and satisfying curry bowls to my emergency department. Not only that, but they actually refused payment, donating the food to our staff!  These wonderful examples of generosity truly improve staff morale.The flavor of the curry was robust and amazing!  The tofu was cooked perfectly.  And somehow, the rice in the bowl was still sticky after transportation!  Yum!I cannot wait to bring my family here when we are able to return to more normal business and living :-)"

3/5/2020,4 star rating,"Killer non-authentic / Asian fusion place with lots of vegan options. I stopped in for dinner one night and ordered the vegan pho ($13++). Absolutely delicious broth that is a bit sweeter and richer than your typical pho veggie broth. Comes with a nice amount of high-quality tofu, bok choy, and noodles. Delicious stuff. Very much recommended."
2/15/2020,2 star rating,"Food ordered:- Tori Udon $13- Spicy Pork Udon $13This restaurant was recommended to me as Japanese, after eating here I would describe it more as Japanese + New American fusion.-Broth - not flavorful, missing any amount of aromatics, resulting in a very bland broth. I guess it's trying to be more healthy?  Missing the heavy amounts of fat that should be in this type of soup.-Udon noodles themselves are probably cooked from frozen - not freshly made-The meat in the pork udon is pork loin, pretty lean. I was expecting pork belly to balance out the relatively lean broth. I looked up this restaurant and the chef explains this as: ""I don't want to add something to the menu if it can't be replicable and enjoyed the same way every time,"" he says, explaining why he eschews the more common chashu-style pork belly, which can have varying fat levels.IMO being able to handle the variations in the ingredients you receive is a good hallmark of good cooking.This was the first time I've had a dish and been bored of eating it halfway through. Each entree is quite filling and nicely portioned and presented.This restaurant has many vegan and vegetarian options, on the plus side."
6/6/2019,5 star rating,"This place made me fall in love with Detroit. Seriously. Lol. I only had an hour or so before I needed to drive to the airport, and it was only 4 PM so I didn't want to eat a super-early dinner. I ordered the takeout spicy tuna rice bowl, my friends ordered the brothless udon, and we took a walk around the neighborhood (very trendy, with lots of interesting looking restaurants, cafes, etc). When we came back 10 min later, the food was ready.We went to the covered patio (which has the cutest floral wall painting). My friends split the udon and let me steal a few bites. So, so, SO good. I was so impressed.Later in the evening, ate my spicy tuna rice bowl. Loved it - quite spicy. The flavors and textures of the different veggies were different yet complimentary - included radishes, cucumber, seaweed, furikake, ginger.   Rice portion was generous, as was the tuna portion! So delicious and I savored EVERY bite."
12/4/2018,5 star rating,"Okay so I'm originally from Hawaii and live in California. I am very picky about Japanese food. My expectations for good noodles in Detroit were very low when I began my search, but ima has raised the bar.After being in Italy for 2 weeks and Detroit for another, I was IN NEED of some Asian noodles since I'm a noodletarian. (JK that's not a thing, but it should be.) I bookmarked all the places I thought looked pretty promising and decided to try ima first. Ima has a small indoor space, but a large outdoor patio. There are heat lamps which make being outside extremely pleasant. You can take your jacket off ""outside"" and hang it on the hooks they have along the sides. I ordered the shrimp dumplings to start, the yaki udon, and a lobster broth on the side ($3). My coworker ordered the curry udon. The shrimp dumplings come in an order of 5 pieces with a nice dipping sauce with a kick and a small side of kimchi. YUM! We shared the dumplings, but you can easily get your own.The yaki udon, which was brothless, had a very rich an flavorful sauce, as thick as a gravy. Like I had to drink some water to cut the richness, but I'm not complaining! It was def better than I expected. It comes with baby bok choi, green onion, sprinkles of nori, something crunchy, and a lemon. I probably shouldve tried to some lemon on top - who knows? Maybe it would cut the richness. But it was very good. The lobster broth standalone wasnt that great, but I can see how this would be good with some other toppings, lobster pieces, and udon.My coworker said his curry was really great and he forreals ate it all. Nothing left.And for dessert, we ordered the only thing listed on the menu - berries and cream. BUT ALAS! It was much more different than we thought. It was more like a pudding more than anything and was the sweetest way to finish our dinner.If you're looking for some solid Japanese udon that's a little bit dressed up, look no further than ima. The word 'ima' in Japanese translates to 'now'. So just like that name suggests, you should definitely try this place out IMA-diately.... or now!"
10/19/2018,5 star rating,"I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about ima. This was my first visit and everything was delicious. I decided on the spicy pork udon and the pork scallion dumplings. The broth had a lot of flavor and depth, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The veggies, poached egg and meat rounded out the meal.The dumplings were delicious, and the dipping sauce was really tasty. The menu has quite a few items to try and everything sounds delicious! The space is light and airy, and the place fills up fast. I was the first customer of the day and about 30 minutes later it was full. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. I really enjoyed ima. Out of all the noodles in Detroit I've eaten, this is my absolute favorite place!!!"
12/4/2018,5 star rating,"It's always such a delight to eat at ima! It's a small, cozy restaurant with shared seating and plenty of window seating as well. Despite being small it is very inviting. I will usually bring visitors from out of town here and they leave raving about it!Despite it being primarily an udon place, I absolutely love the golden curry and get that almost every time. It's so beautiful and, more importantly, delicious!  It just tastes like absolute comfort. So many flavors and they mix so well together! It also includes a nice portion of veggies. The spicy pork udon is also very delicious!Prices are reasonable and the service is fast and friendly!"
11/21/2019,4 star rating,"Fun little spot in an area of Detroit that seems to be hip to the fact...that people like Detroit's new style of smaller, personalized service. Set up like a big city boutique restaurant, Ima is a lively and tasty joint. Service is spot on and well informed. I had the golden curry. As pictured, it came in a bowl of curry sauce with individual ingredients piled high. This was visually appealing but hard to mix together to get the all encompassing curry experience."
11/26/2018,5 star rating,"Mmm. You can tell the food here is made with fresh ingredients and from scratch. I think I read an interview from the owner and they said that the broth is made for like 12 hours. You can really tell! And when I refrigerated the leftovers, the broth gelled up. :) I tried the tori udon and the curry udon. I loved the tori udon. The broth was so flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the curry udon, but that's just because I don't really like curry. I also tried one of the desserts which was tasty and refreshing.As far as the ambiance, it's designed pretty cute. Typical hipster type restaurant design, but the food is actually worth it! It's little and you will be sitting next to strangers at shared seating, but I personally don't mind."
11/13/2018,5 star rating,"This was my first visit and it was amazing! The servers and bussers were so friendly. My brother and I were in and out do the restaurant in less than 45 minutes. We sat in the patio, which was heated and warmer than the inside of the restaurant. I enjoyed that. Both dishes I ordered were delicious - edamame and spicy pork udon. The edamame was different than any other I've had before. It had a sort of dry rub, which had a slight kick to it.  It was good and I ended up eating the entire bowl. The udon dish... just wonderful! It was bursting with so much flavor! It sort of reminded me of the Thai Tom Kha soup, but with more toppings. I substituted the pork for chicken. The noodles in the dish were so thick and long. The soup was so big, I have enough for lunch tomorrow! Im already wanting to go back and try new noodle dishes!"
9/10/2018,5 star rating,"This place is FANTASTIC! Came by on a Saturday around noon and we were the second group to come in, so they had a lot of seatings. They do also have outdoor seating option. The saying ""good things come in small packages"", describes this place 100%! We both had the spicy pork udon, but I substituted my pork for chicken...It was DELICIOUS!!!! The ingredients were fresh and the vegetables were cooked perfectly! Sometimes they can get mushy from being in hot broth, but no there was still a little crunch which I LOVED! The flavors were just to die for! Wow!!! Tried their patio punch too, and that was really good. I will definitely be back! Great place, great atmosphere...and a cool photo op place on their ""patio"" area. :)"
11/8/2020,4 star rating,I've been here a couple of times and had an enjoyable time both visits. Food was good and staff was friendly. So cute on the inside as well!
8/21/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing! To start, the vibe is very inviting and the seating is community with a small patio. Shrimp Dumplings, Edamame, and Clams are all good starters for a small group. I'd recommended orders of Shrimp Dumplings because they are incredible. Yaki Udon or Spicy Pork Udon are my two favorites here. Ima has the BEST noodles and the broth is heavenly. I'd eat here multiple times a week if I lived in Detroit. Great prices and perfect portions!"
12/5/2021,1 star rating,I've been here a few times. It has always been one of my favorite spots. I always recommend this place. Got carryout today and honestly it was one of the worst meals I've ever had. Maybe it was a off night not sure but this was bad. Not sure if I'll go back. Hope it gets back to being an amazing place.
5/9/2021,5 star rating,"TL;DR: Best affordable/classy/excellent Japanese food in downtown, Ima puts on a humble show.Ordered: Takeout lunch of Unagi bowl with radish shell tacos, dumplings and spiced Edamame. Enough for 2 for $43.Service: organized, friendly, and fast, all covid compliant. Not much seating, just a bar for a quick lunch. Food: clean, well thought out, high quality and well-portioned. Lots of authentic flavors that work well together and were just complex enough. Japanese food in Detroit is better than most cities and Ima should be a must eat if you are nearby. Worth the 30 min drive for me."
7/1/2018,5 star rating,"I will admit that I was super skeptical of ima. I thought to myself - ""ramen flavors but with UDON?!?!"" I've been to places in Los Angeles like Marugame Monzo that hand pulls udon and has some unique flavors but still pretty traditional. Ima was floating out on its own where I had no reference. That's the beauty of fusion though, isn't it? & like I've mention in a lot of my reviews, I'm not a fan of fusion. Fusion is hard to get right, but ima gets it right. I was going to go big or go home, so I went for the Lobster Udon (butter poached lobster tail, soft egg, menma, wakame, scallion, gai lan, yuzu lobster broth, chili oil - $24). It was such an enjoyable, decadent lunch that I felt a little guilty, ha. The lobster was 5-star surf & turf steakhouse status - beautifully and perfectly poached.  I wanted a little bit of heat, so I asked for hot sauce. I was given two hot sauces to try (usually +$1, but thanks for hooking it up!). On their own, the sauces were very fermented soy bean heavy but once I mixed some into the yuzu lobster broth, culinary magic ensued. It was the perfect amount of heat - I was right at the edge with watery eyes and a slight sniffle. Speaking of the broth, it delivers - fantastic depth but not too oily. The udon was also perfectly cooked; I hate when udon is overcooked and squishy but you won't find any of that at ima! It was all so damn good, the only left was the bowl (and I would've eaten it if it were yuzu lobster broth-flavored). I also ordered a pickle plate, which I enjoyed. A lot of it was VERY tangy but I liked that intensity.180/365"
10/31/2021,2 star rating,"Such a disappointment!  Out of dumplings! Ordered tacos instead as our appetizer.  Specifically  asked for them to brought out prior to our main course.  But, no!  All brought out together.  Staffing issues!  Sick and tired of hearing this as an excuse for everything!  But that bring said, our soups (Udon and Pho) both served lukewarm if that. We sent both back, and they returned lukewarm once again! Sorry, but I prefer my soup hot, not Lukewarm!  And, they weren't that busy."
8/12/2020,5 star rating,"I hade the Vegan Pho and my Lord (Husband) had the Yaki Udon, he added beef and chicken. Both were delicious. Although I eat more plant based l don't mind tasting his food sometimes and both were tender. Like melt in your mouth tender  I couldn't believe it . The Vegan Pho was a bit spicy even with me taking the peppers out before pouring in the broth (we did take out of course because of COVID 19)."

10/28/2019,5 star rating,"Almost threw up after leaving because I couldn't stop eating. I started with the pickles appetizer (yum). I love pickled anything but the cucumbers were so so good. I would definitely start with this. I also had the shrimp and scallion dumplings. They were good - I am not a huge scallion fan so didn't love but I imagine If you are, you'd love these. Ok now onto the lobster udon. First of all - WHAT. HOW. OK. I wasn't ready for that to be an option. Once I found out it was an option, I had to move forward with the choice, right. It did not disappoint. I was so full - I tried to finish but couldn't. The staff was incredibly kind and offered me recommendations since it was my first time. You order at the counter then sit down and they bring you your food. On my next trip to Detroit, I would definitely go back."
6/12/2019,5 star rating,"I enjoyed a big bowl of Veggie Pho. It was vegetable broth, tofu, rice noodles, bean sprouts, leeks, baby bok choy and other fine ingredients. I also had a pot of green tea with ginger. Lunch or early dinner is the best time to dine at IMA. I do not recommend it for parties of more than four. Cork Town continues to get better with fabulous establishments like IMA. Street parking is no longer free but what big city has free parking? The service is always professional and courteous. I've never had a bad experience at this place."
1/7/2018,4 star rating,"IMA is a fabulous blend of Japanese*Korean fusion. This place has an order at the counter feel but it is a full service establishment. The menu is ingenious and it exceeds expectations. It is simple without being basic (if that makes sense?). My husband and I started with the INCREDIBLE shrimp & scallion dumplings served with a small side of house kimchi and chili-black vinegar sauce. I looooove homemade dumplings and would go so far as to say that I am a dumpling connoisseur. Hands down these are the BEST I have ever had. My next visit will be just for those yummy dumplings!I had the boombap w/fried egg * shiitake * slaw * cucumber * pepito chili sauce and ginger beef. It was delicious. The dish also had homemade kimchi, pickles and ginger wrapped around the bowl with the beef in the center. My husband enjoyed the tori udon savory bone broth with garlic chicken * soft egg  * celery leaf. We paired our food with a couple of Asahi rice beers.Now for the rub...IMA is TINY. It would be helpful of IMA to install purse hooks under the table along the windows. Ladies do not have anywhere to put their purses. Parties of five or more should make a reservation even though IMA's website states that they do not take them. I recommend you dine here during the week at the start of dinner hours 5pm or after the dinner rush at 8pm. I can't imagine what it must be like on the weekends or during the summer months. The staff did a great job of seating customers in order to maximize the limited number of seats. The service was quick and attentive. The staff worked as a team serving the food and clearing empty dishware. No surprise this place was rated #1 restaurant in Detroit 2017 by editors choice at Eater Detroit. My Yelp rating is  5-stars for the food and service and 4-stars for the small building and limited street parking."
8/26/2018,1 star rating,"For lunch, spent $30 for two hungry Asians :-)  Was looking forward to eating rice noodles with soup.  But we end up ordering the Yaki Udon which had a bowl of buttered noodle - no broth.  Paid extra $1 for changing the udon to rice noodle.  Another $3 for the broth.  The yaki bowl is already $10.  Total of $14 worth of mistake.  The texture of the long and thin yellow noodle reminds me of ramen.  It was soft and salty.  Never in my life have I seen the chicken cut into tiny cubes and served as a meal.Next disaster was the golden curry.  A cup of rice served in a silver bowl full of curry.  Again, the meat was cut into small cubes.  Paid extra $3 for the smoked pork loin.  No idea why it was described as smoked.  The meat looked pale and bland.  The curry sauce was too much.  Needs to be diluted or less Curry powder could have been used.  Saw a few pieces of celery and 2 small stalks of blanch green veggie.It's a Sunday but we still have to find a good spot to park.  Free parking on Sundays till 6am Monday morning.  Parking close to the restaurant can be challenging on weekdays, but there are parking lots closer with a fee.While walking towards IMA, be conscious of who's passing by.  Be extra careful.  Avoid this special people at all cost if they post as a treat or do something you wished you never saw them doing.  Harmless but awkward moment.No Sunday reservations needed.  Seat wherever you like.  We chose by the window.  Nice view (besides the fly roaming the Resto).  Preferred to stay inside the ac room.  It was kind of hot to eat out by the patio.Service was ok.  I looked closely of the glass with water before drinking.  Unfortunately, I saw lipstick stain in the glass.  It wasn't my lip color.  Wow!  Lost my appetite in a sec.  Although the plating/presentation was worth a thousand words, I can only say good things about the extra broth.  The rest of the reviews were over rated."
5/2/2018,4 star rating,"Summary: great prices, comfortable hip layout, and decent relatively quick service with some definite wins on the menu.Cons: some of the dishes I tried fell short, but the menu is solid with lots of options.I thought the value for this place was great, but was disappointed with my order of the Forest (vegan) Udon. The porcini flavor was very mild and I found myself having to add soy sauce, sesame seeds, etc to try to liven it up a bit. The mushrooms were the tastiest part of the dish, but overall flavor seemed lacking.My wife's spicy pork Udon was really good though and I definitely had a large amount of dish envy. Tldr; I wish I ordered the spicy pork.We also shared the boombap, which was a healthy mix of brown rice ($1 upcharge), slaw, shiitake, cucumber and fried egg with a pepito chili sauce. Impressed with the freshness and presentation of this dish which was served with a peanuty / soy-ish dressing on the side.The pickle plate appetizer is enjoyable for those who love the pickled goods. Radishes/kimchi/cucumber were all on point and a nice little light appetizer to get the taste buds going.The strawberries and cream dessert was delightful. Nice little crunch and mint leaves --- a light and smooth end to the meal.All in all, I thought this place was decent but perhaps came with too high expectations regarding the Forest Udon dish. Our bill was $50 (before tip) which was pretty reasonable for 3 entrees and an appetizer."
4/17/2018,5 star rating,"Ima tell you about the best damn bowl of ramen I've ever had....and I've been to Japan. Woah, big statement, right? I don't throw these blanket statements out loosely, dear reader.Here's what you should know:1.) The staff is incredible. Super friendly and knowledgable. 2.) The space is on the cozy side and I love that they've created a warm outdoor space with natural light flooding in overhead.3.) save room for dessert - the strawberries and cream dessert with vanilla and tofu custard and mint garnish is super refreshing and flavorful4.) Per the recommendations of the fella at the front counter, I ordered the vegan/veggie friendly Forest Udon ($12) with porcini broth, roasted tofu, rosemary and garlic oil. This udon-filled bowl was packed with flavor and just the right amount of rosemary (refreshing flavor combo!). I seriously was brainstorming ways I could order more of this soup to fly home with to Indy. It's that good.5.) I'm not the only one who things it's delicious. Ima made Yelp's Top 50 Places to Eat in Detroit list for 2018. Heyo, the masses say its true.6.) The location in Corktown makes Ima a stone's throw from several other fun businesses. Great for filling the time between bowl #1 (lunch) and bowl #2 (dinner) ;)"

I've left this place a 4.5 review in the past: but all great things must come to an end. The food has slowly slipped down hill and the service... oh man. Talk about a total dive bomb. The forest udon is still great though"
5/8/2019,2 star rating,"Being half Japanese I was so excited to find an Udon Noodle place in the Detroit area with such phenomenal reviews.  I grew up on the stuff so I know udon very well.  Unfortunately this gemba turned out to be a let-down, the plethora of 5-star ""awesome"" reviews attracted me to Ima and I think we were duped.  In the end I felt it was over-hyped, under-delivered, and the products we got were definitely not worthy of the exorbitant price.  I mean - $44 (inc. tip) for 2 bowls of Udon with a few add-ins?  Come on, people.  Wake up.  It's Udon Highway Robbery. I'll just get to the point and accurately break down our experience: - Service was very good.  Waitstaff were patient in walking us through the menu and options and made the suggestions.- We got the Forest Ramen and Yaki Udon and had 2 kimchi add-ons because they raved about the kimchi - and we love kimchi.  We also got the heat sauce for $1 - Food came out promptly and it looked appetizing, but that's where this experience peaks out. - The Veggie Udon was good, liked the mushrooms, but in the end it's just a simple bowl of udon noodles + soup + a few add-ins.  Definitely did not meet the $12 price point - especially since you can buy a good Udon Noodle Soup package for $1.99 to $2.49 at the store and make the same meal for $4-5!!  So we have an exorbitant mark up here that's severely lacking value. - The egg was disappointing.  It's just an egg with no extra taste or seasoning - kinda bland.  Our favorite ramen place in Austin makes a similar egg (Ajitama marinated soft boiled egg) but they cure it in sweet soy sauce and it's really flavorful and good.  Their food is much better quality and yet it's the same price as Ima - lol!  And that's what I mean in getting the customer value - the extra effort is something special and worth paying for. - After a few bites of mushrooms and bok choy (3 pieces each btw) I was left with a handful of noodles and soup - I saw my $12 + change dissipate fairly quickly.  I definitely did not eat $8 of veggies.  What a rip. - The Yaki Udon was good but didn't get enough of the garlic flavor - and again - it was just a simple Udon noodle dish that was likely should have cost about $7-8.  Not worth $12 by any means. - The Kimchi - oh what a disappointment.  It was way too salty.  We couldn't eat it by itself - had to dump it in the soup.  I love kimchi and eat it regularly but this was the saltiest I've ever had - should have ask for our $4 back. - We loved the heat sauce - now this is the value and experience we are looking for - something unique and flavorful and only they can deliver.  It was worth it. - Overall if the bill was $20 then that would be a very fair deal here, but not everyone plays fair, and $44 for 2 bowls of udon with $5 of add-ons?  Oh hell no.  Such a disparity equates to a 2-star experience (Meh - I've experienced better)  which is accurate.  These places are popping up all over the Detroit area.  Premium prices similar to NYC and LA but lacking in value-add and under-delivering.  What's also a letdown is all the eye-popping stellar reviews - it's like these people never had udon noodles or they are biased.  What these places don't get is it has to do with immediate gratification vs long term stability.  They will price gouge you now - but soon people will catch on, and that's linked to this thing called ""Customer Equity"".  If the experience and product and value aren't exceptional or don't measure up then many won't be back to repeat.  And that's where we're at - One and Done.  They don't have special bone broth here with bone marrow that's simmered overnight, they don't have homemade local knife cut noodles that you can't get anywhere else, nothing is imported from Japan, and the veggies are just veggies anyone can buy.  My favorite ramen place in Austin has all of that and then some with exceptional quality and value-add and yet their prices are $2-3 less than Uma - lol!  Unbelievable.  Bottom line is Uma does not offer anything special and unique or out of this world that justifies the exorbitant price tag.  It's just a single serving of store bought noodles + broth + veggies.  Even the serving size was underwhelming.  We were robbed and duped the first and only time here, and it happens to the best of us.  Going forward we'll choose to make a comparable quality Udon noodle dish on our own at a fraction of what they are charging here."
9/21/2018,3 star rating,That patio punch is Fan-effing-tastic! I wrote down the ingredients so I could recreate it next summer on my own patio. I was in Detroit for a girl's weekend and this was our first dinner. I had the spicy tuna which could also be considered a deconstructed sushi roll. Everything was good except the flying insects. I had to ask for another side of dressing because one landed in it before I had a chance to use any. It was warm and they had the door to the outdoor seating area open. I assume this is where the flies or gnats were coming from. It really ruined the meal and I took off a star for that.The inside is very nice looking with natural lighting and blonde wood.The location is conveniently located to bars within walking distance if you want to grab another drink after your meal.
8/27/2018,4 star rating,"PL forgot what ima was...On the other hand,Ima is a nice modern place for Asian​/American​ food. It is like a hidden Asian​ gem in Detroit. The owner is always there and makes sure the place is accommodated​ for everyone. Service: The service is really good and they make sure everything is running smoothly... From my experience,​ someone spilled their food on me... but the employees came with tissues and towels. It was sad...but he paid for 1/2 the food and the nice old couple was really sorry about it...sads :) Food/price: the food is really good and they are known for the udons! If you are with someone (and they are willing to share)... get the spicy and non spicy food.Audience: smaller groups more for dates or a one-on-one.Recommend/tips: Go when it is not busy :) (avoid lunch and dinner times)"
8/4/2019,5 star rating,"I arrived in Detroit exhausted from a long series of travels, slightly sick, and craving a good bowl of vegan pho. Like, a REALLY good bowl. Vegan pho can be hit or miss, with broth ranging from overly salty yet flavorless mystery broth to AMAZING broth that tastes the way vegan pho broth should, cooked down with cinnamon, anise, ginger, etc. This was by far the best vegan pho broth I've had in a long time -- possibly ever (outside of my own kitchen, or course! )Rich, flavorful, and lacking the overly saltiness that makes you leave feeling gross. I would have liked more broth and less noodles, but that's just me. The salad was great -- the only thing I would have liked to see different would have been to have had more of a variety of dark leafy greens. The miso goddess dressing was divine. The wait for a table was 35-45 min on a Sunday night, but I was solo so snagged a seat of the bar. Regardless, I'd say it's definitely worth the wait!"
3/6/2018,5 star rating,"Ima is next level! They do things right. I love the ambience and the energetic vibe. It's bright, inviting and comfortable. I like that they have packaged chopsticks, napkins, chili pepper, sesame seeds all on the table and serve-yourself water.  They have some nice additional seating off to the side and a very clean bathroom. Onto the great stuff: the udon is fantastic! Deep, rich and super tasty broths. They have veggie options and all sorts of add-on's, so you can customize your udon and make it however you want it.  I added some ""heat"" and chili sauce to mine and it was pleasantly spicy. The noodles hold up well to the broth and they have a nice bite! The sides: so far, I have tried the edamame. It is so gosh darn tasty. They cover it with seasonings that are fabulous. The shrimp and scallion dumplings were delicate, yet so satisfying. The chicken tacos are a small meal within themselves, fresh and unique. The house-made pickle plate is one of my favorite items!! Kim-chee, daikon, Pickles, and marinated shiitake mushrooms. This makes the meal complete! The entire experience is wonderful and I highly recommend. The service is also outstanding, friendly, warm and welcoming.  The only thing I would wish for? Maybe, add ramen to the menu. They do udon so well, they would do a great ramen too."
3/2/2021,5 star rating,"I'm a ramen lover - it's somewhat of a comfort food to me and I appreciate that I won't feel like I gained 5 pounds after eating it. As far as downtown Detroit is concerned, this is my go to spot for ramen. I've been ordering takeout from Ima for 6 months now and for all those neigh-Sayers who don't think ramen keeps well for takeout, keep reading.While I can't opine to the dine in experience here given I've only ordered takeout, I plan to visit in person when that becomes more feasible. This review as such is on the food only and more specifically the ramenFirst of all, if you ever order ramen for takeout, you make sure that it is never delivered completely mixed. The broth should always be separate from the contents. Ima nails this - you don't even need to clarify! The next step is to heat the broth up - I'm lazy so heat it up for 2 30-second intervals in the microwave. If you're feeling it, transfer the broth to a pot and heat it over the stove. Once warm , mix in contents. Given I'm microwaving, I pour the broth into the bowl gradually mixing the contents. Sure it's not the same as eating it fresh but I find this does the trick. Imas ramen is hearty - they don't skimp on the protein and the broths are delicious. If you're a ramen lover, this place is worth a try. I recommend the spicy tori ramen - that's my go to. I opt for chicken in mine but pork is really the way to go. I like the chicken and opt for it since I try to limit red meat intake and I've found that it's pretty decent.Definitely check this place out!"
1/28/2018,4 star rating,"I came here on a Sunday and was fortunate enough to find street parking right out front. I had never had udon before and I trust my Yelp friends that had given this place good reviews. Thanks Aileen and Rodrigo! When we walked in you could see trendy people sitting in the window. I walked in and the place was packed. I spotted two open spaces at one of the wooden tables and asked if we could sit there. Lea our server cleaned off the table and we sat down next to our guests for the meal. The family next to us consisted of a mom, dad and two daughters. I had read in Aileen's review that this is a place to say hi to your neighbors so I did just that. They recommended the spicy pork udon but gave me a great piece of advice to get the spice on the side. It looked and sounded good so I top them up on their suggestion. They were awesome, upbeat and cool people that I enjoyed meeting. We exchanged stories and I have them a tip to try out For the love of sugar since they were looking for a dessert place. The spicy pork udon is -chicken and turkey bone broth, smoked pork loin, soft egg, garlic oil, gai lan, scallion and nori. Coming in at $12 bucks The noodles are thick, really thick and the portion is large   I was really impressed with the flavor and felt like I was in foodie noodle heaven. I added a bit of the heat sauce and chili oil into the mix to see if I would like it and I sure enough it really kicked up the flavor. I'm glad I was able to heat to my taste. I deducted one star because there was a problem with the shrimp and scallion dumplings and I had to send it back. This was a bummer because I was really looking forward to trying them."
6/24/2019,3 star rating,"My friend was visiting from out of state and wanted to try the place. It was pretty empty since we came for a late lunch around 2pm.We ordered some appetizers- edamame and the dumplings. The edamame had a unique taste that consists of some type of chili flakes and sesame oil. The dumplings were good but the kimchi that came out with it was too sour. Nothing very special there.For my main dish, I tried the spicy pork udon after asking our waiter for recommendations. It was good for the most part except for the pork loin that came with it. It tasted like a mix of ham and turkey that doesn't belong in the dish. The broth tasted like mildly spicy ramen broth. The udon would be much better with a change in meat.The restaurant seemed to offer a variety of fusion dishes that offer alot of potential, but the overall dishes were not the best."
11/4/2017,5 star rating,"This spot is pure magic. It's cozy, with a mix of tables and bar seating that make it feel like a real noodle shop. Asian fusion has been done a million times over, and while I enjoy the combination of Column A and Column B to make bastardized plate of something really delicious, many times I feel like these places cater to a more American palate. Ima, in my opinion, does not. The fusion is there but so are the traditional flavors. The fare is fresh and savory and energizing and oh my god that fucking edamame - I could live, breathe, soak and die happily in that chili oil. Service was great (hey Jamie!), our waitress had a lot of good suggestions and was very accommodating. Our main courses (lobster udon special and house smoked salmon) were quite honestly perfect. Utilize the add on menu for full customization (aka add soft eggs to errrrrything). Come here. Eat many courses. Drink the booze. Indulge in dessert. The super happy milk drink WILL make you super happy."
3/24/2019,5 star rating,"I'm a noodle soup junkie and I was very impressed with Ima recently on my first visit. Nestled along Corktown's burgeoning food scene along Michigan Ave, the quaint, cozy little joint has a cool, comfortable vibe about it. The menu is not vast, which I prefer, but it is packed with quality ingredients and inventive combinations. We got the spicy pork udon and the vegan pho. Both were absolutely excellent. The pork broth was so rich and perfectly balanced, nice heat but a deep, savory flavor complimented by a gooey soft boiled egg. The pho was fantastic, deep and savory with a beautiful fragrance and big hunks of firm tofu. Definitely excellent. Can't wait to go back!"
3/6/2019,2 star rating,"I came to this udon shop with some high expectations since the reviews looked really good. At first, the waitress told me and my friends that the wait would just be 30 minutes, however, it took closer to an hour and a half to even get seated. With such a long wait, I was thinking that this place must have amazing udon. It was instead very mediocre. I got the spicy udon and also a potato salad. The potato salad was a bit expensive and not worth it. The udon felt more like a spicy tonkotsu ramen broth but instead of ramen they put udon noodles, which is pretty different. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place especially if the wait is an hour long."
5/8/2019,3 star rating,"I should preface this by saying I think I am just not a huge ramen fan in general. Also, this is a very communal (read cramped) dining space. I noticed a little dining rail next to the wall was the next to open, and I suggested we should wait for a table but gf was starting so we sat, uncomfortably. Gf and I got the dumplings to start, and they were quite tasty, not the most delicate wrapper but still very good. I got the spicy pork ramen, and I added ginger beef and sliced mushrooms. The pork was very nice and tender and the noodles cooked very nicely. The mushrooms were pretty raw and crisp, but maybe they're supposed to be that way? Gf got the rice bowl (forget name) and added spicy tuna. She loved it!With two beers each bill came to around $80 plus tip. This is where my 3* review comes in. Too cramped and too expensive. It doesn't help we were visiting from Canada so the total bill was around $120 Canadian. I just can't justify the price as there are many other tastier and more satiating restaurants to visit. Gf loved it so maybe ima return with her."
2/24/2020,2 star rating,"I really really wanted to love this place, and I was sorely disappointed. Do not order the Yaki Udon. It tastes like some weird hybrid Asian version of chicken Alfredo (seriously!) and the sesame chicken was basically just cut up pieces of bland chicken (as you can see from my picture). The whole dish lacked flavor and depth, except for an overwhelming butter taste that was completely wrong for it. My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork udon, which was probably a much better choice and actually tasted the way I thought it would..."
12/2/2019,5 star rating,"Food ordered:- Lobster Ramen $24 (9/10)This place caught my eye because I saw a small restaurant bustling with people. I looked on google and yelp and found out that this place is actually also very highly rated so I decided to give it a shot and I was feeling some warm noodles in the cold December weather in Detroit. I ordered the Lobster udon which was recommended by one of the other customers and although I'm a pretty frugal guy, I said ""sure why not, when's the next time I'll have such a thing?"" Had just finished an all day interview and felt like I deserved to treat myself for the hard work I put in. "" lobster broth + butter-poached lobster + soft egg + beech mushrooms + menma + chili oil"" sounds good to me!Ordered it and honest it was pretty darn good.  It was honestly a very pretty and tasty dish, noodles were the perfect texture, not too soft, not too hard, broth also delicately balanced, not too flavorful or bland, and the rest of the ingredients (bok choy, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green onions, seaweed and eggs) added color and personality to this glorified bowl. One thing was I did wish it had more lobster, maybe I am being a little greedy but for $24, they definitely could've added more of it but at the same time, it's expensive I get it. Would I order it again? Um, if I wanted to treat myself again, for sure!"
4/13/2017,5 star rating,"Don't like trying new things because you don't know what it taste like??GOOD! I don't want you sitting right next to me yapping about your anxiety levels going through the roof. There's a Coney island a few blocks down. I'm sure they'll serve you a plate of Chicken Fingers and fried potato sticks. #UnlimitedRanch baby!Sure there is udon noodles in the menu of your garden variety ""Americanized"" Japanese restaurants. But IMA seems to be doing some really fashionable designer udon stuff. Even their starters are some of the best things I've put in my mouth. Do order the Ima Tacos. It's effing amazing. My favorite thing to order? Curry Udon, just because the broth does that delicate dance of spicy and savory with just destroys your taste buds. Tori Udon would be my other choice. Plus one thing to focus on is the egg with the runny yolk. That is a proper egg ladies and gentlemen. Thank you IMA for the proper execution of your accompaniments.Oh before I sign off. If the server asks if you want desert? Do it!! Because that tofu custard is just pure destruction.Anyways, thanks for reading my review. I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!"
3/19/2017,4 star rating,"Delightful noodle bar in historic Corktown.I was so excited to try Ima only because of all the rave reviews I had heard of the place. It's relatively new and located in Corktown across from Sugar House Bar and Slows. It's a very small space so I could see it get pretty packed on busier nights. We chanced it around 6:30/7pm on a Saturday and lucked out without having to wait. They are known for their noodle bowls/ramen, but you can get other things like appetizers, rice bowls, etc. And you can add almost anything to your dish from veggies to extra protein for a little extra moola - nothing over-the-top expensive though!The super great thing? They have a great selection of vegetarian/vegan options as well!! Hooray! I ordered their Forest Udon which is usually vegan (porcini broth, wood ear mushrooms and another mushroom I forgot, baby bok choy, rosemary, sesame marinated tofu and because i can't resist a good egg, I added a soft egg to mine. It was SO delicious. Although when you get a bite of rosemary it's a little strong, the addition of it is something totally unique and needed int he bowl. On top of great food, we had incredible service, yummy hot tea and the prices were great. I will definitely be back."

Absolutely the best ramen/udon noodle value in Detroit. - Japanese curry is the best I've had.- Forest Udon is the deepest non-meat broth I've ever had.- Favorite is the spicy pork udon.- If they had actual ramen noodles, it would be the best in town....

11/24/2018,5 star rating,"I have been to this restaurant twice and I loved it. I have been here when I first moved to Detroit in the middle of summer and then second time as fall started. The restaurant is small with window sitting available. During winter you can also sit outside in the patio area. First time I came for lunch, ordered at the counter and sat outside. The food was prepared relatively fast and brought out to us. I had their gyoza and ramen. Food is really good. Second time I had come for dinner and the restaurant was busy. This time we did not order at the counter. Rather our orders were taken after we sat down. So I'm not sure if the difference is just because of different timing of meal. Regardless, I love the food here. It's not traditional ramen. They put a little fusion twist on the meal. I also tried their udon. Again it's not traditional but the noodles were think and bouncy and perfect. I love the service here and they're always polite. I would love to go back and have their warm ramen as winter is picking up its pace."
2/4/2020,5 star rating,"Delicious! Came here for a quick meal after a busy day. I ordered hot green tea and yaki udon. My server was kind and more than helpful when I had questions and made requests. My food was delicious but definitely not what I expect when I order ""yaki udon."""

Food: vegetarian friendlyEdamame: good! Interesting flavor $3Jicama Tacos with tofu: holy cow. This was phenomenonal.

Lots of oil. $11Ginger tea: helped with the cold weather outside! $5Techno music playing overheadGood place for date night or good place to take an out of town friend who is a big Udon fan."
11/13/2019,4 star rating,"I was originally skeptical about ordering ramen as a pick up order... but it was snowing and I wanted nothing more than to get out of the snow and eat comfortably in my own home. So, I decided to give it a try... I ordered the Forest Udon to-go and it was packaged so nicely. The vegetables were neatly stacked in the large bowl and the broth was packed in a separate spill proof container. When I was ready to eat, all I had to do was reheat the broth and pour it right over. Everything fit perfectly in the larger container and tasted fresh! No soggy ingredients here. I enjoyed this menu item more than the curry ramen that I've ordered in the past because I found the Forest Udon broth more dynamic in flavor. Would recommend this place to anyone for dine in or for pick up."
9/27/2019,4 star rating,"Finally tried out Ima in Corktown and so glad I did. I recently had dinner here before seeing a free shadowcast of Rocky Horror Picture Show at Beacon Park. We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night which was smart because we definitely beat the dinner rush. It's a smaller space and when we arrived, it was fairly empty and there were only a few other diners but as we were leaving around 7 the whole restaurant was very full and crowded. They are located right next to Motor City Wine and we easily found free street parking. There is seating indoors and they also have a cute enclosed covered roofed outdoor patio which is where we sat. Service was good and we were quickly waited on and brought a carafe of water. Ima offers several rice and noodle dishes. They used to carry ramen noodle dishes but now currently only offer udon noodle dishes and ramen is only offered at their Madison Heights location. I ordered the spicy pork udon, with toasted chile bone broth, smoked pork loin, soft boiled egg, and garlic aioli. The broth was so amazing, spicy, and flavorful! My measure of a good noodle dish is a good flavorful broth and this broth was delicious! The pork belly was ridiculously tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My only caveat with this dish is that I wish there had been more noodles. While the flavors were amazing, the noodles were a bit sparse. My friend ordered the spicy tuna don, which is a rice bowl with ahi tuna, masago, cucumber, slaw, and yuzu ponzu sauce. It looked amazing and she said it was really good. She's eaten here a few times and her favorite is the unagi don, a bbq eel rice bowl. We also split the edamame which is some of the best edamame I've ever had because it's so well seasoned and the seasoning is delicious. Prices are mid-range and most dishes are $12-$16. There are also lots of extras you can choose to add on to each bowl for $1-$2 like and extra fried or soft boiled egg, and shrimp, eel, and other proteins. Ima also offers a full beer, cocktail, and sake selection. Sake serves one to two people and ranges in price from $5-$24. They also offer several unique Japanese wines and beers. Overall really enjoyed the food here. I definitely can't wait to come back to further explore the menu and try some of their other dishes."
12/28/2019,4 star rating,"A very cute place for noodles near downtown Detroit. My Gen-X husband thought it was a bit too hipster-y for him, but I work in Brooklyn, so I didn't even notice. We came in on a late Saturday night in search of a quick dinner and this place popped up on my Yelp app while we were driving around the city. We are spoiled by the udon places in New York City, and having been to Japan several times, you'll need to take our review with a grain of salt. The bone broth here was milky in colour and quite good, especially for Detroit. We enjoyed the toasted chili garlic sauce that came on the side for my spicy udon, and the eggs in the soup came out perfectly done. Loved all the veggies as well. My husband did not like the chicken or pork in the soup, but I thought it was okay. It beats the pork and chicken ramen lunch that gets served in the cafeteria at work, but certainly nowhere near what you would get in Japan. I mean, everything is relative. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ We both agreed that the vegan strawberry tofu custard dessert was delicious, and I definitely would have licked the bowl if no one was looking. Oh, plenty of parking nearby!"
11/30/2019,5 star rating,"Came in on a Saturday night a little before 7 hoping to beat the dinner crowd, but it was already packed. As a party of 2 we only ended up having a 15 minute wait so it wasn't too bad. I had been here once before but it was my husband's first time. It was a lot better than I remembered and he absolutely loved it. We ordered the steamed edamame for an appetizer and the genmaicha and ginger tea to start. The edamame was well seasoned and had a great flavor. I normally do not enjoy genmaicha green tea as it has a very wheat-y taste but the ginger in it gives it a nice taste. For mains we got the curry udon and the seafood kimchi udon. I really enjoyed the curry udon: it had a really nice flavor and a hint of spice without being overly spicy. My husband really enjoyed the seafood kimchi udon. He's a big seafood fan and loved everything in it, and said the spicy flavor was excellent. Staff was friendly; no complaints about the service. Perfect comforting dinner for these cold Detroit winter nights."
10/14/2017,4 star rating,"This is a new Japanese fusion restaurant /modern Japanese udon place that caters mainly to culture-starved America senpais.Initial impressions :* small and packed, as is the case with most new restaurants in Detroit.*offers udon and rice dishes with liquor and asian beer.*has outside seating for summer and warm nights.The good :+offers noodles and rice for all Asian needs.+broth is a ramen style broth with udon style noodles. It's interesting, but not for everyone. Like another review said, udon is usually light while ramen is more heavy. + eel rice really good. +service excellent The bad:-broths in different soups offer little taste difference.-kimchi too sour for me. And it's cut up into small pieces and has more onions than cabbage.-pork thin and not too much fat on, which is the most flavorful part. Usually with heavier broths the pork is thicker and seared. It seems this was just boiled.-the egg was cold but soft on the inside. Means it was pre-made which is sad. Would it be hard to throw an egg in and boil it to order?Overall I would give this place 3/5, but my friends all seemed to enjoy their food so I'll bump it up one for a good night out."
5/29/2021,2 star rating,Mediocre Asian fusion. Ordered the spicy pork ramen and was not impressed. Pork is like ham and not the pork chia-su u get from ramen shops. The broth is not flavorful and quality is a tad better than pre-packaged ramen you get from Asian supermarket. Udon noodle is normal. Not recommended if you want a ramen/udon experience.

The protein portion is kind of small (well, it looked smaller than I would get at other restaurants, but it's probably an average size), but it's definitely enough. The edamame is sooo good too! Took me about 2 pods to decide if I liked them but then they were addicting. Water is serve yourself with pitchers on the tables that the staff was good at refilling when needed. Very friendly and helpful staff. 5/5 would recommend"
1/12/2019,4 star rating,So let me just say off rip! They have to go alcohol beverages! Lol That immediately won me over! They also have sparkling grapefruit sake which is so so soooooo Amazingly good! My udon was awesome as well. My sisters yaki was also very good. Staff is amazing the food is great. If you haven't tried it and are looking for a good place stop by.
1/2/2019,4 star rating,"Was in the area and came here on a Friday night. It was very packed! It seemed like there were people from all walks of life eating - and despite different backgrounds all were harmoniously enjoying the same food. Anyways, I started out with some sake and got the Joto ""one cup"" Futu-shu based on my waitress's recommendation. I was really not expecting the sake to literally come in a disposable cup that you peeled the cover film off of, almost like the lid off of a frozen lemonade at a baseball game if you will. But the sake seemed pretty legit (it was made in Japan at least) and it tasted great too.I got the spicy pork udon and it was pretty good. The egg wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked it to be and the greens that came on top of it were kind of bland, but the broth was very savory and wonderfully spicy. The pork was also seasoned pretty well but made me miss some good old chashu pork in ramen. You see, I'm not a fan of udon noodles overall, so I really wish that they had some options that used some more regular ramen-type noodles. But since they didn't really have that option, I'd say at least the udon was pretty good, as far as udon goes.Overall this was a pretty good place and I'd recommend stopping by, especially if you like udon! Don't come here expecting to get some ramen noodles though, they don't really have that here."
7/23/2018,5 star rating,"I had a delicious lunch at Ima with 2 friends on a Sunday. We arrived a little after 12 and got to sit on their outdoor covered patio (a great spot for a rainy day!). The waitresses were very friendly and helpful with ordering, especially since I'm the most indecisive person on the planet. I finally decided on the curry udon with tofu and my 2 friends got the Yaki udon (no broth) and the pork udon. All 3 of us loved our dishes! The broth for the curry udon had strong curry flavors but wasn't spicy (I love spice personally but this makes it good for everyone else). The noodle dishes were flavorful and good sized portions for the price. Having broth with udon noodles is very unique and it was executed well. We all ate until we felt sick because we couldn't stop ourselves - the dishes were just that good (no regrets). I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Detroit!Food - 5 starsPrice - 4 starsService - 4 starsAtmosphere - 4.5 stars"

5/31/2018,5 star rating,"Come eat here, Udon know what you are missing! Only about a five minute distance from my dental school is Ima. A trendy Japanese udon restaurant. I've tried their pork broth, but I found them broth to be a little lacking in richness for my taste.  However, their vegan option, Forest udon is absolutely fantastic. It's refreshing, packed with flavor, and achieves this depth beyond even its pork counterpart.  Well seasoned porcini broth with addition of garlic sesame oil and rosemary brings a flavor that I did not expect to find in a vegan dish.  It's refreshing, aromatic, nutty, and flavorful yet light. It's what I love about Japanese food.  I add pepper seasoning and sesame seed on their table for the extra nuttiness and heat. It really enhances the flavor and refreshingness of the broth.  The smoked trumpet mushrooms and Chinese mustard leaves add a nice crunch texture and the fried tofu is a fun and tasty topping options. Since I'm not vegan, I always add their ginger beef and a half boiled egg.  Although I would like it more if the egg is marinated, the egg is cooked perfectly for my liking. The ginger beef, In my opinion, is a much tasty meat option compared to their pork loin slices(no chatsu here). Although you don't really taste much ginger, it's quite tender and flavorful.  I did notice that their udon noodle texture varies slightly.  This time, the noodle had an excellent texture, but last time I came here the noodles were slightly musher.  Perhaps they changed the noodles, or the cook got better at cooking the noodles.  Either way, they've improved much since my last visit and I hope they continue to grow.  One downside is that cost for toppings are on a more expensive side, and with my addition of extra broth(served in an extra bowl- pic shows their normal bowl), gingered beef, and egg adding $8 to $12 udon, bringing it up to $20 for a bowl of udon.  For non vegans, I would add gingered beef at the very least as it elevates the dish to another level.4.5 for the price, but rounded up to a 5."
10/22/2019,3 star rating,"This one missed the mark for me! Maybe my hopes were a little too high after the Restaurant of the Year rating, but I felt that this was a little under average. Nothing bad about it, just underwhelming and not super flavorful. The shrimp are small. The lobster still had the tomalley (which some people like but I'm not one of those people). Eh. The service is always fast, and it's a casual, easy dinner options for meetups. I would go again, but it's not at the top of the list. Avoid the Yaki Udon - it's almost like an alfredo and felt out of place on the menu."
5/2/2021,1 star rating,Noodles very plain and too buttery as they are thick. Service is nonexistent after putting in the order at the front. The broth of the noodles was the only filling I got from this place with a Mexican Coke. I don't recommend this place at all. Johnny Noodle King is a much better option. Noodles from Prince Valley is a more viable option than this place. Don't let the outside dining area fool you with the scenery; you'll be disappointed soon after.
8/2/2018,5 star rating,"Decided to try this place after seeing the ratings on Yelp and Google. The food did not disappoint! We had the Shrimp and Scallion dumpling for starter and I had the Spicy Pork Broth Udon for entree. The broth was flavorful and nothing was overpowering. My friends had the House Smoked Salmon bowl and they thought it was good. The price for the noodles was  reasonable but the starter was a tad expensive for the amount of food. We (three people) walked out of the place at about $75 (noodles, rice, starter, and drinks.The servers were fast, polite, and patient. As two of us are Asian, we get asked a lot if we would recommend certain Asian restaurants. I can comfortably say ""yes, give it a try""."
11/13/2019,5 star rating,"I have to say that hands down, ima is one of my favorite restaurants. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool and the community seating gives it a really relaxed feel. The staff is incredibly helpful especially with new customers or even if you're trying to find something new on the menu.      I ordered the Yaki udon with a side of spicy broth and added the roasted tofu to the udon. The spicy broth wasn't too crazy spicy but extremely flavorful. The noodles inside the udon practically melt in your mouth as you chew them and the tofu being roasted gives them this thick outer crust making them absolutely delicious.        I also ordered the shrimp and scallion dumplings. I highly recommend ordering them. They are pan fried so it gives the dumplings a crusty bottom and doughy top and the chili-black vinegar sauce adds the perfect amount of flavor to the dumplings.     Overall, ima is unique place and the food is very flavorful and comforting. I was really amazed by this restaurant and it is definitely a gem to the Corktown area."
1/22/2018,5 star rating,"I've been here three times now and each time was a 5 star experience. Does that mean ima gets a 15 star rating from me? :p The potstickers here are delicious but a bit pricey for me to order each time I go there. Definitely should be tried at least once! The mini side of kimchi that comes with it was also super delicious! And this is coming from a Korean! While the appetizer was a nice starter, the noodles and broth are what's really keeping me coming back. I always go with the tori udon and it's the perfect winter meal. The broth, veggies, noodle, meat, and everything in the bowl compliment each other so well!! Definitely would recommend it to anyone who prefers a nonspicy dish. A pro tip that I would recommend is to order extra noodles ($2) for an extra meal! I always have broth leftover enough to make my one meal into two!"
10/5/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing Udon! Spicy pork udon was exactly as expected! Delicious hearty broth, perfectly cooked homemade udon noodles, great amount of toppings, & perfect amount of heat."
12/28/2019,5 star rating,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! The entire space is cute and very welcoming. The refreshing hibiscus + vodka drink was to die for. I ordered the seafood kimchi udon spicy and DELICIOUS! A must try if you love seafood must try.
5/6/2019,5 star rating,"Best ramen in Detroit! I have never been a huge fan of reman but my boyfriend is so he drags me all the best spots including Ivan Ramen in NYC. Ima was hands down the best place I have eaten ramen. I absolutely loved the large section of vegetarian friendly dishes which is hard to get at other places. The sake was phenomenal, the service was fast and friendly, and the vibe was down to earth. The portions are large, I even brought some home with me and enjoyed it later that night. I got the lobster dish and was very impressed by the amount of lobster I actually got. My boyfriend also enjoyed his dish very much, there wasn't a drop left. We walked in on a Saturday and got sat right away on the inclosed patio and were nice and toasty under the heaters. I highly recommenced checking this place out for a fast and casual place to dine."
8/26/2018,3 star rating,"We opted to sit on the patio to join the warm weather. It's picnic table style with 6 to a table. The picnic style seating calls for casual dining and a chance to talk with your neighbors. There's an area with AstroTurf for additional seating. The roof over the patio is covered which is great for the outdoor feel in the winter. The wall is decked out in custom painted flowers to bring the floral beauty of Asian culture to life. 5 min after being seated we were greeted by our server. By the time she came, we were ready to place our orders. There wasn't an explanation of the menu so we went with what we thought would satisfy our pallets for the evening. After placing our order, we saw that the menu had a selection of daily specials but we weren't briefed on those either. For an appetizer we started with the ima tacos and added avocado. It comes with shaved jicama shell,wakame slaw, shisho, and green chili hot sauce. The texture of the shell reminded us of rice noodles, turns out it is a Mexican yam. The slaw was refreshing with just the right amount of kick but the avocado was lost amongst all of the powerful flavors and spices. Would definitely order again, but for the first time ever, we would say knix the avocado. The Patio Punch is a hibiscus ginger infused vodka with yuzu. It was light and refreshing with a soft sweet after flavor. Will definitely get this again. For entrees we had the yaki udon vegetarian style and the spicy pork udon. While the spicy pork udon had a lot of flavors in the broth, it was lacking in the spicy department for me. The meat wasn't as tender as expected so it was a little difficult to tear with my chopsticks. The noodles were a little soft and took some time getting used to. The yaki udon was ok. The butter taste was overpowering and any flavor was masked by it. I added the hot chili powder multiple times to add a kick but the noodle sauce was too much. I wouldn't get this dish again, may opt for the forest udon on another visit.Overall we'd return again but we'd both choose different dishes. They have happy hour with a special menu we'd be interested to try. While good, ima needs to improve on their service by greeting us when seated, not being in a rush to take and deliver orders, and not forgetting the water cups. Overall 3 stars but hopefully when we return we can provide an update and improve our rating."
3/26/2018,4 star rating,Delish! Started out wirh some tasty tacos! Great combo of flavors. My noodle bowl was surprisingly filling and full of yummy ingredients. Hubby had rice bowl and was super happy with his! The vegan strawberry dessert was the cherry in top of a great meal.  My only complaint is the seating.  We sat on the heated porch and our only seat option was a picnic table. I need a better seat!Being a vegan I was pleased with the selections!
4/13/2019,5 star rating,"Okay, I have been very skeptical of trying Japanese cuisine for my bad experience a couple of times in California. I had to come here because on a Saturday night, most of the places closely were full! A friend suggested this restaurant, and while i cringed the reviews gave me some hope! I ordered the Avocado ima tacos, and let me say I was so pleasantly surprised! Such a different and refreshing take on tacos, the radish-like shell was extremely light and did feel very healthy. The sauce was spicy and well balanced the flavor. Not sure what provided the crunch, was it sesame seeds or something else... but I loved them! Highly recommend this place for the tacos!!"

1/10/2018,4 star rating,"The wonderful Corktown! Always a pleasure to visit this side of Detroit. ima is a beautiful restaurant on the inside and out. Being so close to the kitchen provides a great vibe. Now for the food..The ima shrimp tacos weren't what I expected and that's a great thing. The vegetable shell and flavors that were inside packed a powerful punch! Great appetizer. The Boombap....breathtaking! From the shiitake mushrooms to the kimchi to the chill shrimp and ginger pickle, this is a dish you must have! I highly recommend this restaurant"
6/12/2018,2 star rating,"I will be the voice of dissent from all of the glorious reviews. Our service was slow, the food disappointing. Hubrock ordered golden curry with tofu and I ordered the Yaki udon with chili shrimp. His was okay, not great but photographed beautifully! Both dishes were visual treats, but you cannot eat a photo. The yaki was Bland and cold, the noodles were mush. Our waitress took so long to return that I didn't even want anything else. She suggested adding broth and packed some to go along with the rest of my dish. I didn't think adding broth to soft noodles would improve on taste so I discarded everything when I got home. We spent too much money on dishes that we have to doctor up.  I just want what they were having (all the awesome reviews)On the flip side, the punch and the shrimp dumplings are worth returning for and I believe in second chances."
12/6/2017,5 star rating,"First, the cons. The place is small, you may have to sit next to a stranger. And there was too much chili oil on my soup. Now the pros. Everything else. We got:ima tacos - jicama shell * wakame slaw * green chili hot sauce * toasted corn * shiso smoked pork loin - these were amazing and amazingly different. So many tastes and textures, phenomenal flavors. Probably my favorite thing there. Shrimp & Scallion Dumplings house kimchi * chili-black vinegar sauce - Delicious dumplings, tasted fresh. Sake steamed clams - delicious but the name says it all. They were tiny clams too, but easy to eat. tori udon - savory bone broth * garlic chicken * soft egg * celery leaf - Amazing flavorIse-ebi Udon Soup butter poached lobster, yuzu-tori broth**, udon noodles, soft egg, gai lan, beech mushroom - Without a doubt, one of the best things I've ever tasted. The broth was slightly sweet, very citrus-y and all the items inside were perfect. The lobster was soft and sweet, the mushrooms and egg were soft. The only issue, not listed on the menu description is chili oil. It was a slick of chili oil on top. I felt a little would have been fine, but it was a lot of it. I powered through anyway, because it was that good. unagi-don bbq glazed eel * pickled cucumber * avocado * slaw * micro shiso - if you like Eel and pickled vegetables, and who doesn't, this dish is for you."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,"This place was delicious. I had a conference in Detroit, and decided to try Detroit's Asian food. I'm from California so you can imagine the amount of asian food exist. I found this place according to yelp, wanting to try Korean food. Except this place is more of udon-Asian infusion food. I ordered the spicy pork udon noodles. I'm not a big fan of udon noodles, but I just wanted to give it a try. The broth was delicious & very spicy. The pork was tender, as it should. The only con to this item was the huge cuts of Chinese broccoli it had. It was hard to eat and it just did not fit quite please in the mouth. I also ordered the chicken tacos. The shell was made of jicama which doesn't have any taste. The taco itself had a fresh but slight fishy flavor. Overall, ok tacos, not my type of flavor, but it may be yours.The customer service was superb. Nice people.The place is small, but when I went, I went with a group of 6 people and we got seated within 15 minutes."
1/14/2018,3 star rating,"After a delightful evening at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, we decided to partake in some delicious noodles. Our group of six decided to enjoy ima and take in its ambiance.We called ahead, not to reserve a table (because you can't), but to ask how long we would wait for a table of six (three hungry couples). The polite lady on the phone told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table of our size. Perfect!We arrived five minutes later and a smidge of skepticism was born. They were busy. Really busy. I'll admit that I went from hungry to impatient to angry during the 45+ minute wait. Don't tell people they will wait 15 minutes and then have them wait close to an hour. It's unprofessional.I guess they're mostly forgiven once I got a seat, because we ordered a bottle of warm sake to be shared amongst the group. It was tasty. Then we shared some shrimp and scallion dumplings, which were a great guilty pleasure shareable appetizer dipped in a super salty soy sauce dish.Most importantly, the noodles were fantastic. I broke the mold with our group, five of whom ordered the spicy pork belly, and I tried the tori udon. As delicious as everyone else's meal was, I couldn't have been happier with mine.The service was mediocre. They were really busy. But we all had spicy food, and didn't get water nor beer refills when we wanted them. That combined with the unexpected wait put a slight damper on an otherwise great meal."
3/31/2019,3 star rating,The rice bowl that I got wasn't my favorite. I got shrimp added to it (which cost $4 extra) and I got salad shrimp. That's a huge pet peeve of mine like comon man I coughed up the cash now you gotta cough up the quality food. The bowl tastes like a poke bowl and I wasn't too impressed. What I did like was my sisters udon soup! She got the same lame limp shrimp that I did but the soup was very flavorful and filling. I kept asking her for another spoon cause my bowl was sad. My other sister got the salmon rice bowl and she had the same thoughts. It was just a poke bowl. It was kinda pricey! We got three bowls and small can of iced coffee and the dumplings and it was $70! Like I've said before I don't have a problem paying for better food but I just think it was stupid money spent especially since we paid $8 for shrimp that were the size of my pink toe. I would only come here for the soup!

6/19/2018,5 star rating,"Sister and I wanted to try ima, since its been on our radar.  And wow we are glad we did!  I think its much more flavorful and fresh than Johnny Noodle King.  And I didn't walk out craving water from too much salt, like I do at JNK, either.  To start, we ordered the steamed clams and the shrimp dumplings.  Both were awesome!  Tons of flavor.  Sister ordered the lobster udon - price point was pretty high at 24.00 but absolutely worth it.  Do yourself a favor and order it, wow, lobster noodles and veggies in just a buttery creamy delicious lobster broth...mmm.... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I ordered the spicy pork bowl and it was also very flavorful!  Will keep coming back!"
2/27/2019,4 star rating,"Came in on a weekend and it was pretty busy. I started off with the patio punch. If you want a drink for the alcohol, order a beer or sake. You're practically buying a $7 juice. The edamame was pretty good. They were boiled just enough where they weren't too hard or soft, but right in-between. If I could change one thing about it, I would take it easy on the sesame oil and seasoning. I had to pour off the excess because they were drowning in it.The ginger beef tacos were really flavorful, but a little on the salty side. They come with 2 per order. The presentation was really nice (not the fast-food tray they come in, but the actual tacos). I would love to try the sesame chicken next time. The spicy pork udon was legit! The texture of the udon was perfect. Firm, but not hard. A little chewy. The broth was really delicious and savory. Was a bit thrown off with the addition of some kind of citrus taste, but not in a bad way. The pork they use is very lean, but flavorful and soft. This was a nice change from most other places that use very fatty slices. Finally, the egg. I really liked how the yolk was just cooked just enough to hold it's shape and still be kinda runny, but not leak out into the broth. Finally, the unagi-don. The eel was really delicious, but the skin was soggy/chewy. It should have been cooked at a higher temperature to give it a nice crisp. There definitely was not enough of it in proportion to the large quantity of rice and everything else that comes in the bowl.In the future, I would definitely make it a point to ask them to bring everyone's food out at the same time. I feel like this isn't something that I need to go out of my way to do, but I got my udon before my friend got their food. The server said it would be right out, but it was close to 10 minutes before the rest of the food came out. This created an awkward situation where my friend kept telling me to eat first and not wait for them. I'm not a pig, so of course I waited while my friend felt terrible for my food getting cold. By the time their food came out, my udon was still warm, but less enjoyable than if it were hot. I really should have sent it back, but did not want to complicate things and have my friend's food get cold waiting for me this time."

11/19/2017,4 star rating,"It's easy to miss this gem driving in Detroit. Definitely stop by! The space is not large by any means. It has 2 rectangular tables along with seating on the edge of the restaurant. The people here are nice, and the crowd that's here speaks volumes to the quality of the food.The spicy pork broth is to die for. It is not overwhelmingly spicy, and is not overly salty. It is a perfect mix of spice, and the after taste is a savory pork broth taste.The texture of the noodle is a good chewiness. It's not soggy, but it somehow soaks up the flavor of the broth.The pork was a little disappointing. The texture was similar to that of turkey breast lunch meat, and the flavor just wasn't there. Perhaps it is because the broth and noodles are just on another level, and the pork comes off as subpar. Definitely stop by if you are craving a good bowl of noodle soup, especially in the tundra that Michigan becomes in the winter months!"
6/26/2018,5 star rating,I wanted to try this place during my visit Detroit and glad I did. The guy (I'm guessing is the manager/owner) at the cash register was super helpful and explained to us every item in the menu and suggested some must trys. I got the Forest Udon with Porcini broth and rosemary that had a refreshing flavor to it. In the end I did not feel like I drank way to much broth or ate a lot of noodles the proportions were perfect.
1/17/2019,5 star rating,"Love love love love this place! I have been here many times and tried their udon soup to their rice bowls. I am never disappointed when I come here.This time around I did their curry udon and I added some pork to it. Who does not like some pork to their soup? Unless u are a vegetarian lol At the time we went around 1pm when the lunch rush was probably done. So getting a table was easy. Other times we have gone when it is dinner time and everyone is out. At that time the place is packed and hard to move. However, we did notice that they had added an extra room so maybe it is not as hard to get a table during the busy times. The service was good with someone checking up on you and making sure you are happy with your food. This place is all about communal eating. So do not expect to have a table to yourself but expect sitting next to someone you might not know. But that is what the experience is all about. The food is amazing and who does not like some hot, good tasting food on a cold winter day."
10/9/2017,5 star rating,"Came here on Sunday afternoon with 2 other people. The restaurant was pretty empty and was able to pick a seat inside or outside. We chose to sit inside (afterwards regretted not sitting outside in the patio... anyways). Been hearing great things about ima and I was definitely not disappointed. Started with the shrimp and scallion dumplings and the edamame. The vinegar sauce was so good! The flavoring on the edamame was amazing... I think there were chilies, lemon, olive oil and sea salt. Ordered the Tori Udon, which has a smokey both broth, garlic chicken, soft egg and celery leaf. That had a rich flavor and it was quite mild. We got two Spicy Pork Udon, it have a toasted chili broth, smoked pork loin, soft egg, garlic oil, and gai lan (Chinese broccoli). This udon was unbelievable. The broth had an amazing richness and the flavor was great. The udon noodles were cooked just right. The best part was probably the pork loin, it was made perfectly. The service was good and did not take too long to order or get out food. Will definitely come back and try other items on the menu!"
4/27/2019,4 star rating,This place has fantastic udon noodles. Be sure to go for the ones with broth. That's where the good stuffs at. It's pretty crowded and a small place but the line moves fast. The food comes in large quantities and is priced very fairly.
5/18/2018,3 star rating,"Ima tell you about my dinner tonight! Super excited a friend took me to try this place out. It's small and unique little spot I didn't know existed in Corktown. We sat outside in the covered porch area. To drink I got the porch punch which was delicious!! Delicious and dangerous because I did not taste a sip of alcohol. Fruity and refreshing, wish they sold it by the bottle lol I got the Yaki Udon dish.  Pan fried veggies mixed with chicken on top of noodles in a garlic sesame sauce, yum! If you don't like seaweed, order without. It was a touchy fishy. Great little noodle spot in the middle of Corktown!"
11/13/2017,5 star rating,"I have nothing negative to say about my first visit to Ima. The noise level was low and we grabbed a seat at the counter in the window. Parking was a snap with spots out front and on the side street. Not to sound like a dick but the last time I had Udon was in Takamatsu Japan. It's basically where the noodle was invented. Yeah, I went there...So when I saw the special lobster udon I went all in, and it did not disappoint. At 26 bucks it's a hit to the wallet but I made two meals out of it. The shrimp and green onion dumplings were also very good, crispy on the outside and really flavorful. With so many hipster, Asian fusion joints around town Ima was a breath of fresh air. This is udon elevated in the best possible way."

8/20/2017,4 star rating,"I love this place and yesterday finally got something other than my usual, so am inspired to write a review. I adore soup noodle and want it almost always. My usual is the spicy pork and I add smoked trumpet mushrooms to it. It's good! Salty and rich, not too salty though. The brother is creamy and more of a ramen broth. The mushrooms add some texture and I love the stuff they put in it - chinese broc (most recently, though I think I've had some other green in there before), a perfectly soft boiled egg, and some seaweed. The pork itself is okay. I like the smoky flavor of it, but it's too lean. The soup would really benefit from a fattier meat.I tried the curry udon yesterday and it was disappointing. Too salty and the flavor was very thin, though I think that's just because it's not a bone broth. I also added ginger beef, which was very finely chopped so it all sank to the bottom and was hard to find haha. I don't recommend this one.Apps are decent - dumplings are the very thin-skinned kind and pan-friend. Shrimp inside is very minced and comes with a tasty dipping sauce and some kimchi. The ""tacos"" are very refreshing, and I love jicama, but overall I don't think they are a very satisfying snack.The space is really small (as in, you'll probably need to experience the community table seating) and the service is good. Excited for them to get their liquor license soon!"
8/3/2019,4 star rating,I really liked the food and the atmosphere. We had the boombap and it was tasty. Only thing that could have been better was the speed of the service. I would definitely recommend.

8/14/2017,4 star rating,"Small storefront with an even smaller side patio in Corktown, limited street parking.No beer or wine, soda in the can. I had the tacos, Tori soup, and BBQ eel. It was all really good. A bowl of soup and a side are too much for one person to eat, two sides and a bowl would be great for a couple."
11/8/2017,5 star rating,"The spicy pork noodle is by far my favorite ramen in the metro detroit area! It had the perfect broth and ingredients, as well as great texture for the noodles. I'm so frequently disappointed by noodles not fulfilling my expectations. I don't like it when it is either too hard that it doesn't take on the flavor of the broth or when the broth is not very tasty."
10/15/2018,5 star rating,"This was great! Walking into a relatively small shop with an addition to their building under a plastic-like tent, I didn't know what to expect.IMA doesn't pretend to be anyone else! From the first bite of food you can tell that it is their main focus - wanting to serve an exquisite meal. And they do! The interior is cozy, but I don't know if it's somewhere you'd want to sit and socialize for hours on end, as you could find other places.We ordered the spicy pork udon noodle bowl and golden curry rice dish and they were to die for! I will say, I added sesame chicken to the golden curry and it wasn't necessarily needed. The chicken consisted of tiny dices of meat, with not a lot of flavor.I'm sure some of the starters (edamame) are good but in my opinion, I wouldn't want to waste my appetite on veggies if I knew what was going to be served up for dinner!"
12/11/2018,4 star rating,"Today I tried the Forest Udon - Skeptical though I was due to the vegetarian nature of the dish. Heck, it might have even been vegan! I do like my meat, but I LOVED this bowl of noodles. The porcini broth is so rich and flavorful that it could have been the poster child for umami. I didn't even hate the roasted tofu, though texture of the blistered surface took some getting used to. The baby bokchoy were perfectly tender crisp, and the mushrooms were plentiful. I'd order this again in a heartbeat!"
11/8/2018,4 star rating,"It's a good sign that I really like a restaurant when I revisit it so soon after my first visit. I was really curious about trying more items on ima's menu, so I went back after less than a week. This time I got carry-out, so I could share the experience with the hubby.This time, I tried the ima tacos. It is not something I would order again. I tried the spicy shrimp as a protein, and thought the tacos tasted pretty good. However, I found the wrap to be very strange, with an almost tacky-to-the-touch texture. Not appetizing.I got the spicy pork udon once again, and it was still wonderful. We also got the yaki udon, paired with ginger beed, and I liked it even more than the pork dish. Its sesame butter sauce gave the udon such a rich taste. The beef was both tender and flavorful. I would order this again!"
10/31/2018,4 star rating,"I am really new to noodle cuisine, so I tried the first dish that caught my eye - Spicy Pork Udon. I lucked out. This dish is amazing! The amount of spice was perfect for me. The toasted chili bone broth was so perfectly rich, I'm sure enhanced by the garlic oil. It was not overly garlicky though. The smoked pork loin retained its texture and yummy smoky flavor. The only issue I had was the gai lan (Chinese broccoli). It was still tender-crisp, and came in long, folded over stalks. I found it difficult to eat with chopsticks because it was difficult to bite through. This may have been a newbie mistake on my part. I'm still mastering the art of eating the noodles themselves with chopsticks. Slippery little devils! I would definately order this dish again."
7/9/2017,5 star rating,"Please don't compare this restaurant to ""authentic"" Japanese and Korean cuisine. It's not trying to be that so complaining about its ""lack of authenticity"" is a moot point.Went there on a Friday night. It wasn't super crowded, but it was busy and buzzing. We grabbed two seats at the high table facing the window. Our waitress was friendly and super helpful when she discovered it was our first time there. We started with the dumplings, which had a very fresh ginger flavor and came with a side of kim chee. Then I had the boom bap with beef added and my boyfriend got the spicy pork udon. Everything tasted so fresh! I don't typically order bim bim bap (because I always get soft tofu soup instead), but I liked this one! The beef was flavorful and a little bit crispy.The spicy pork udon was terrific! I would have ordered that except that I didn't want to risk getting myself dirty since we were going over to Motor City Wine afterwards for some Friday night jazz. I loved the broth--it was balanced, and the spice was not overwhelming!The strawberries and cream dessert was the most amazing dish of the night! My boyfriend and I agreed that we wouldn't change a thing about it. It was light and refreshing. The ""cream"" is non-dairy and made from a combination of tofu, coconut, and vanilla bean paste. We shared a dish, but I could have had one all to myself!I guess the waitress told the head chef and owner that it was our first time there and that we were really enjoying the food. He came over, introduced himself, and we chatted with him for a bit about the concept of the restaurant and how Detroit needs more locally-owned places like this. If I weren't moving to the West Coast in a few weeks, I'd be down here more often. I hope this place does well!"

3/15/2019,4 star rating,The food was very good. Everything was fresh and clean. Music was a bit loud and outside table a bit wobbly.
3/8/2019,5 star rating,"This is my favorite place to come for curry, since they have the best tasting curry, close to what I had in Japan. (I always add the ginger beef to it!) The summertime is best to come when you can sit outside, but the inside is equally as nice. The other dishes are also great, but the curry is always my go to. It's a little bit on the pricier side for me, but it's well worth it."
8/21/2017,4 star rating,"I came here for the first time with my sister after looking at reviews on yelp. My sister was visiting from Chicago, and had pretty high expectations when it comes to ramen. We ordered their shrimp tacos, their dumplings, their Forrest udon (plus beef), and spicy pork udon. Their taco skin was different from anything we've ever had and worth trying. The dumplings came in freshly fried and had kimchi on the side, it was very good. Both udon were delicious. I recommend the spicy pork udon if you can handle some spice. The service was great and even though it was a smaller restaurant, it was very well lit and clean inside. I will definitely be coming back to try some other items on the menu!"
11/6/2017,4 star rating,"Ima is a small Udon shop located in Downtown Detroit where you can find other hidden gems. As soon as the words Udon slipped out my mouth, my boyfriend immediately wanted to go. He has had quite the obsession since visiting Maragume Monzo in California. Though, this place is no comparison. I mean, what other udon shop in Michigan can you relate this place to, right?Anyways, back to the important topic -- food and service! We came here on a Sunday after a few hours spent at Youmacon. We were in the area and wanted to try this place since we first found out about it! When we arrived, it was already quite packed and busy. Good, the food must be good then! I saw on the chalkboard that their special was Lobster Udon, which I just absolutely had to try. My boyfriend tried the simple pork udon, which you can't go wrong with, no matter where you go. We started off with Sashimi tacos (extra $5 from their regular Ima tacos) and it was DELICIOUS. The sashimi used in their taco was EXCELLENT! Though, some would argue that their taco is too vegetable-y for them (the taco shell is like a radish type thing), I still found it light and a refreshing starter. Definitely would recommend. The Lobster Udon was visually appealing! Looked delicious as soon as it arrived in front of me. Once I started digging in, I realized that the broth is something that reminds me of the Korean spicy noodles... Eh. Didn't kill my appetite, but I just wanted to try something new. Don't get me wrong though, it was still good. My boyfriend ordered the Pork Udon and the broth was out of this world good and cooked to almost perfection. Ughhhh, and the pork meat!? TO DIE FOR! Literally melted like butter as soon as you took a bite.The service was pretty slow, but decent. I felt like I needed to make sure I asked for everything the first time before our waitress would disappear and cater to someone else! But, I'm glad to see this shop being busy and creating a good atmosphere for their employees.I would LOVE to see this place incorporate handmade noodles. It's worth it for the chefs to learn and great for advertising. I would definitely come here again!"
5/12/2019,4 star rating,"Great food! The soups and noodle dishes were all great (I went with a big group and each person tried a different item on the menu.) I had the house salad and dumplings... both were tasty and filling. There is a unique but small beer selection, definitely get a drink while you are dining here too. Parking is a little tricky to find so prepare to spend extra time for that. Definitely recommend!"
2/5/2018,5 star rating,"I love they're curry based soup and I add the garlic chicken!! I've also enjoyed the lobster specialty, which I'll definitely have again when I'm in a seafood mood. Ima is for sure one of my new favorite restaurants, it will never get old!"
4/19/2019,5 star rating,This place is fantastic!!! We went on a Thursday night around 8 and got sat right away but it got packed shortly after. Great atmosphere- very cozy and perfect for eating alone or with a few friends. The food was incredible. So tasty and flavorful!! I had the edamame and the yaki udon with roasted tofu. Wow- I've never had tofu that delicious before! Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!
3/30/2017,4 star rating,"We tried a lot of things on the menu - my top favorites were the edamame - seasoning is just so delish and lemon flavor just brings it all together perfectly. We tried all three jicama tacos - tofu was the favorite among the group. They're very fresh and light with good flavor. For our entrees we tried two rice dishes - boombap and the golden curry, and a noodle dish- spicy pork udon. They were all good (although the curry one was off on a spice level slightly - maybe too much cumin or coriander, couldn't tell) but my favorite was the spicy pork udon. Flavoring is just right. Definitely a place you can come and eat solo. Mostly communal tables and bars along the wall and window. Staff is so friendly and knowledgeable about the food. It was a delightful experience. Thank you."
1/28/2019,5 star rating,"This is a little rustic restaraunt with korean-styled food, mainly with noodle soups and rice entrees. Location: This is placed in a low-key place without the big buildings of Detroit, but can be a bit questionable late at night. However, this does not deter from the experience, just be careful and don't park too far if the lot is full, like the rest of Detroit. Setting: The restaraunt had a small waiting area that can only fit 3 to 5people right in front of the door. Otherwise, you will be waiting outside, and the weather I went in, it was 14 degrees out. Nevertheless, the kitchen is inward with the service station and whatnot is right out in the open. There are 2 rooms, one of which is an exterior structure without walls and has a canopy. In the winter weather, you felt the warmth of the gas heating contraptions above you as the cold flaunts occasionally, creating a nice balance. The interior is nice and warm in color with exposed wood and sheetmetal for a modern style. Service: I cannot say that it was anything but perfect. The waitress I was constantly on her toes while having any questions we had. When we went, both rooms were full, and she kept everyone under check. The small things such as the tone in her voice, her smile, and persistence in satisfying the customers were nothing short of formidable. Also, every dish that was brought out was not brought out by a waiter or waitress, but by the sous chef himself, and may briefly describe the dish along with its preparation.Food: I had the spicy pork udon. Minor altercations with ingredients may be ordered via request (of which is listed on the menu). I would suggest adding mushrooms and an additional egg if one preferred. The broth was easily bone broth made in house, and would congeal if stowed in a refrigerator for a bit. The broth was not very spicy, and it balanced out with all of the other flavors in the soup. The pork was smoked and salted with possible cloves beforehand. It had a separate flavor that was enhanced with soup while it melted in your mouth with no hint of dryness. Noodles were also definately made in house and were about as good as they can get. The bai cai (白菜) was a bit undercooked, and was not cooked with the broth, making them a bit more crunchy and clean-tasting (not bland) than usually prepared. The other vegetables were delicious, including the non-salted seaweed akin to asian dishes. Conclusion: This little restaraunt is a gem hidden in Detroit. Every ingredient in the dishes created all synergize with each other. The atmosphere is nice and the price is unbeatable. This is by far one of the best places I have ever eaten."
1/4/2019,4 star rating,"Good space with a cool vibe. We started with the edamame appetizer, which was packed with spices that looked like they would be gritty and overwhelming. But not so! The edamame was the best I've had and was the highlight of the meal for me.I had the forest udon as my main, which was pretty heavily hyped on Yelp. The idea of giving vegans an udon option is awesome, because no one should be deprived of noodle soup. However, as an omnivore I was unsatisfied. It lacked the richness of typical udon, which I think would be filled if I'd ordered something with meat.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't fooling anyone as a replacement for non-vegan udon.A friend did say the spicy pork belly udon was excellent, so if I could go back I would try that instead."
5/26/2017,5 star rating,"Gotta admit, when we got here, we were a little skeptical.. udon? Not ramen? A smoke bone broth with noodles which usually inside a Bonito broth served with fried tempura veggies and shrimpTacos on a jicama wrap?  But WOW! Broth for the udon was spot on. Nice balance of salt, smoke, and just enough of the richness in the broth. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the toppings of seaweed, a full soft boiled egg, and fresh scallions made this bowl one definitely worth the splash of broth from the slurp.   The jicama tacos were the one of the best tacos we have ever had. Nice and crisp shell with a nice amount of seasoned shrinp. Loved the soy gumball machine deco piece. Definitely a place to try when visiting Detroit. A great place for the locals."
2/13/2017,5 star rating,"I'm extremely impressed with Ima! I went there last week with my best friend and we sat at the rail against the wall. They were pretty full and it was only like 6:00p.m. on a Thursday. That's a great sign! Our server was super nice and suggested the boombap bowl ($11) (sans meat for me) and with beef for him ($15) and the ima tacos ($7) and we ordered what she recommended. We started with the ima tacos - jicama shell with wakame slaw, green chili hot sauce, toasted corn and shiso with garlic chicken. They came with two so we each had one. They were fabulous. Light and flavorful.  The food came and it was absolutely delicious! The boombapbowl I had was rice with cucumbers, fried egg, shiitake mushrooms, slaw and came with a side of pepito chili sauce. His was the same but with ginger beef. I almost ate the entire bowl. She was prompt with the check when we were complete and our waters were never empty. I'll definitely be back and probably get the same bowl...because it was that good!Nice job Ima!"
2/10/2017,4 star rating,"Ima. First of all beautiful name, albeit I am not sure if you say it like ""eye-ma"" or ""E-ma"" lol who knows, and I felt like they were too busy for me to ask. This is a tiny spot in corktown but it's situated among a lot of other popular favorite restaurants so that's promising right? I read ""hot new business"", soup noodles, almost all the pleasant reviews so all the more reason to drag someone with me. My husband and I arrived at 7pm. This place is small. Busy. We found two seats near the front glass by the entrance facing the lot but within five mins about four spots cleared up so we settled down in two of those conveniently. This place is modern, wooden benches and be ready to sit by randoms since we americans like our space this place will challenge that. It's a very tight little restaurant, a little concerning when it comes to maneuvering for the waiters but maybe they've got the hang of it.The menus are conveniently waiting at each empty seat so you have it there when you sit down. A girl approached us and greeted us right away, very sweet. We ordered ima tacos $7 for two as the starter then for entrees I ordered the forest udon with hot toasted chili oil $11 + $1 add on. My husband got the unagi-don $14. The tacos were delicious! I felt like they were tiny salad bites. Clean, fresh and extremely light. Not sure what the dressing was but it tasted like olive oil alone, but the greens and the perfectly cooked shrimp a top the thinly sliced jicama as the tortilla. Very pleasant!!!! A little pricey for what they give but would order again!!!My forest udon was fishy to taste as far as the broth goes. The mushrooms were alright, I wasn't too keen on them. The udon was cooked chewy and overall was a yummy vegan choice. The portion was a little small but filling especially after the starter tacos which I split with the hubby. My husband's unagi-don came with a hefty piece of eel. Sweet and grilled just right with greens, mushroom, ginger and rice. He enjoyed his bowl. We finished off the night with some tofu custard $4 each. I got it with mandarin oranges and he opted for mint. These were super tiny bowls. My mandarin oranges were extremely bitter and not skinned, I think it would taste better with peaches or a much softer fruit but the tofu custard was coconutty and a delicious finisher. Love the brown sugarred edges not sure what they were called but they added a lovely texture. Overall my hubby and I enjoyed this spot. I think the udon dish was okay... but the tacos were exquisite. The unagi-don was could supposedly be repeated. I hope they expand in their menu. However a fun experience. Take your friends or a date here for a fun time. The music is very hip and this place is very unique!!! Thank you ima for a wonderful night!!!"
5/4/2018,5 star rating,"BEWARE. This place is honestly addicting! My husband and I were frequenting here at LEAST once a week of quite some time...literally having withdrawals if we didn't do our weekly Friday night ima night. We've tried all the udon soups and love them all. My absolute favorite is the forest udon with ginger beef and soft egg add ons and a side of kimchi. My husbands favorite is the spicy pork with beef and soft egg. The broths are INSANELY delicious...the kimchi is honestly the BEST kimchi I have ever had in my life, and extremely addicting. I can't say enough good things about this place. The service is fast, the staff is awesome, the food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is vibrant yet cozy! Oh, also...do yourself a favor and get some of those delicious dumplings. Seriously. You'll thank me later."
1/14/2019,5 star rating,Vegan Pho hot and good. Just the way I like it on a Winter's day . Golden curry was perfect mm mm. Best place ever service is amazing give Jamie a raise she is wonderful! Everyone is welcoming and the food came out quickly. Don't forget to feed the meter via the Park Detroit mobile app. I will return!
11/20/2017,5 star rating,Ima is so amazing!! I think it's one of my favorite date restaurants to do or also just to go for girls night. Everything I've gotten there has been amazing. They finally got their liquor license now too so yay!!
11/18/2018,1 star rating,"Disappointed. It is highly recommend to me so I come and try it but it is overated and overprice. I had the lobster ramen for $20+ and guess what, they gave me half a tail, lobster meat is mushy which means it is frozen too long or frozen and thaw a couple of times. I was very disppointed after the first bite. Broth is good, condiments are expensive tho. I recommend you try other ramen on the menu from the normal price range."
1/6/2019,5 star rating,"Ima is my favorite meal in the city. The golden curry with tofu, add kimchi and sesame yuzu sauce is perfection. Also love the vegan ramen and vegan pho, at the Detroit and Madison Heights locations. The service is always friendly and quick even when they're busy (Madison Heights gets packed!) and the food quality is always consistent. If you haven't been yet, go!"
3/27/2019,5 star rating,Food and service was very good and was delivered to our table super fast. My husband had spicy pork udon and I had porcini udon. Both were very good. Make sure to ask for a bib if you are a messy eater.
3/15/2019,5 star rating,Loving the savory udon bowls! Nice all weather patio addition adds communal seating. Great on a cold wet night to warm you up.
6/16/2019,4 star rating,"I absolutely love the place, it's a little hippe and the food is different and great. I got boombap first time and golden curry rice second. The curry had a slight hint of maggi masala and it was great. My friends tried the other vegan and veg dishes and loved it equally. But 4 stars for the price, it might be on the higher side for a casual dining. Well, they are rated the best restaurant by Detroit free press so maybe not casual anymore. And there's a new restaurant in Madison heights :)"
7/16/2017,5 star rating,This place is AMAZING!  I highly recommend.  I had the sashimi bowl (the tuna was warm I would have preferred it cold but was still suoer yummy).  Plus we ordered the tacos for an appetizer - sooooo good with the jicama shell and chicken.  Plus it turns out they didn't have cocktails but they did just get their liquor license so the cocktails are on their way.
11/18/2018,4 star rating,"One of the best noodle soups that I've ever had in my life. the staff was very nice and helpful.I got spicy pork udon which was very flavorful. I got chili oil as a side so I added to my noodle to my spiciness tolerance.The meat had a great smokiness flavor to it. the eggs were just perfect. not raw, but very soft and awesome.Their Kimchi was spicy and I loved it. however the other options on the pickle plate tasted very subtle and not as bold as the kimchi. My friend actually likes the better, however, not my preferred taste.The reasons that I didn't give them the 5 stars are, I think their main sitting area needs more ventilation and their extended sitting area has picnic tables. so you either has to sit with other people and enjoy your food or you have to wait. And their hot sake was barely warm. other than that I loved this place, and I'll definitely go there and will encourage everybody to go there to try their awesome noodles."
9/9/2018,4 star rating,"The little room outside is adorable! The picnic tables are communal and pretty unsteady/uncomfortable. It is heated so you don't have to worry about the weather when you're dining out there.We had the yaki tori and spicy pork ramen soup. The spicy pork ramen was amazing! The noodles were perfectly cooked, the broth had a lot of depth of flavor and the spice level wasn't outrageous. The soft egg was overcooked and more of a hard boiled egg in both of our soups. The pork loin was really tender. I would for sure reorder it!If you're ever in the area on a cold day I'd check them out!"
1/13/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing! Simply just go. We came all the way from central Texas to eat here. Well... not quite but it would have been worth the trip. It's was one of the highlights of our day. All the other restaurants were full because of the Auto Show, bar food in Corktown didn't seem to appealing at all, luckily we saw this place had just opened. We never expected to find such quality Japanese food here. Food: Everything is good. Buy the Jicama Tacos. Flavor upon flavor, fresh, light, well seasoned. I got the Shrimp, but I'm sure it's all good. The noodles were springy, broth deep in flavor, veggies fresh. This is well cooked, lots of hours to make this food this good. I got the udon noodles with smokey broth. Delicious. Worth your money.Dislikes: My only dislike was that the music was a bit too loud and it took awhile to get our check. It's a bit tight seating but cozy. Otherwise not even bothersome."
10/11/2017,4 star rating,"Ima is currently on my fav places in the D list.  The tacos with jicama shell GENIUS, love the noodle bowls, love the tofu custard dessert."
1/16/2020,5 star rating,"I can't say that I'm 100% down with Pho but for some reason Ima Just hits different. The food is great and while the restaurant might be a little tight due to the popularity, it's worth it. If you get a chance check out the Corktown location and the new spot on Cass. You won't be disappointed."
1/24/2017,5 star rating,"Finally--Awesome udon, I don't have to make the trek out to Ajishin in Novi anymore! My favorite was the shrimp ""taco"" that's wrapped in jicama, the spicy udon, and the curry udon. Their broths have so much depth and flavor without being too salty or too bland. Moreover, finally a place that knows how to boil a perfect egg for udon! I'm not a big fan of having hard boiled eggs that have been cooked to death in my udon or ramen. Keep in mind that Rubbed used to be here so it's a very tiny place, but I like that. Communal tables, so get ready to get up close and personal with others. Check this place out, I'm definitely coming back for seconds :) Cheers!"
2/17/2017,5 star rating,"In town visiting an old friend when he offered up this new spot, ima, for dinner. Spicy shrimp tacos with a jicama shell!The best edamame I've ever eatenSpicy pork udon. I ordered an extra egg in mine because I know what I like. The broth was smooth and luxurious. Was so tasty. Could have been spicier, but I'm a little crazy. I stopped just short of licking the bowl. Noel looked a little small at first but was way more than enough, and I'm a heavy eater. Deserves every great review it's gotten. Very friendly staff, and the chef came out to check on us. So so goodWait looked long but only ended up about 5-10 minutes. The food comes out super fast."
10/10/2017,5 star rating,"Five solid gold stars, or red stars if you must.This excellent creative ramen shop does what a lot of New York's ramen shops couldn't; it delivers an unique taste that stood out from a lot of its competitors.A fusion touched here and there led you down to a marvellous musical symphony.The flavour is bold, unique, and they are certainly not afraid of experiment. Concept wise, very similar to what Ivan ramen did for New York, but better, bolder and more creative.I ordered their tori udon, which I devoured...Also had their dumpling as a starter which was very good too. I wanna go back already..."
1/19/2017,5 star rating,"This spot is simply amazing! I've been three times in the last two weeks as I seriously can't get enough. A cute little Japanese-influenced noodle and rice joint tucked in the heart of busy Corktown that delivers a carefully curated selection of mouthwatering food, excellent service, an inviting atmosphere and a great soundtrack. So far, I've tried the spicy pork udon, jicama tacos (tofu & chicken), forest udon and curry rice bowls. All were equally delicious and reasonably priced. Chef Mike Ransom is always happy to see you come in from the exposed kitchen while he's working his magic. I can't wait to see how he evolves the menu over time. As an udon addict, I am thrilled to this addition to the neighborhood and cannot recommend it enough."
5/19/2019,3 star rating,"3.25 out of 5 - not bad, not superb, just okay.----Ima Tacos (3.5/5) - Pretty okay.  The ""shaved jicama shell"" added an interesting crunch.Spicy Pork Udon (3/5) - Also pretty average.  Added Ginger Beef (+$3).  Soft-boiled egg did not have much flavor.  The broth was pretty hearty, but the whole thing tasted like individual ingredients rather than a cohesive bowl."
2/13/2017,4 star rating,"This is a great little place in Corktown. The chefs here are doing a lot of cool and innovative things with their menu, it's impressive. There's no single tables here so fully expect to be sitting at a long table with other parties or at a bar against the window. Despite the place being small and a bit cramped, the service is wonderful. They also have awesome techno music overhead.We ordered the tacos which were great, but the udon here is the real star of the show. The broth is so flavorful and rich. The meat is tender delicious, especially the pork. There are more than enough add-ons to customize your soup--I suggest the smoked trumpet mushrooms."
10/21/2019,5 star rating,"Some of the best noodles I have ever gotten at a restaurant. They are made perfectly and the broth is so good, loved it all. The eel is excellent, my wife said it was probably the best eel she has had since she was in Japan. The pickle plate was fun to try, and they have a small but decent selection of Sake and some other Japanese liquors. Service was great we had a really good server. Came in on a Friday night for dinner and had to only wait about 15 minutes for a table."
8/21/2018,5 star rating,"I have nothing but good things to say about Ima. I have only eaten the udons, on account of them being delicious, and I have not tried anything else on the menu. But I come here for the udon.The spicy pork udon is the best, for sure, but the curry udon (super rich) and chicken(lighter and good when you're under the weather) really hit the spot as well.I highly recommend cracking a bunch of sesame into it and not being afraid of the ichimi togarashi chili pepper, which is sweet and spicy and adds a new dimension to the rich, unctuous broth.I imagine I should branch out at some point and try their other offerings, but man, that udon...The beer list here is good too!"
6/23/2019,5 star rating,"Went back to the Corktown location, months later, and this restaurant does not disappoint. I ordered the Lobster Udon again, and this dish was just as good as last time (I had been dreaming about this Udon since I was last in town). ima is not my go-to noodle spot. Icing on the cake: the staff are super friendly and helpful. When I asked for a to go container, the staff offered to pack it up for me. Super nice!"
4/19/2019,5 star rating,"IMA in Corktown, Detroit is the best ramen of my life! Had the Lobster Udon which was life-changing. There was a problem with my owner, and the restaurant staff gave me a brand new Lobster Udon bowl right away without question. Because this problem was handled so professionally, I can overlook it and, not only would I return here, but I am recommending this place to my friends."
8/7/2017,5 star rating,"Ima is sort of like the understated, younger brother to Johnny Noodle King-- all of the flavor but lacking the often heavy branding overtones endemic to the Inlaws Hospitality restaurants. It is also my local spot, as I can more or less throw a rock from my front door and hit it, so it's a great spot within walking distance if I am ever too lazy to cook.I was a fan of the spicy pork broth, but the forest udon (adding an egg, of course) is pretty solid, too. I really don't like bok choy, which I find to be the absolute weakest link of the brassicas, but I deal with it in the context of otherwise delicious soups. The menu is limited but completely satisfactory-- better to do a few things really well than do a lot of things not as well! Staff are always lovely, service is attentive and quick, the owner is a nice dude, and prices are reasonable."
10/18/2018,3 star rating,"This place is ""fine"". I wasn't displeased with the food but I'm not rushing to go back. Had the garlic chicken udon- it tasted like it was made with garlic powder instead of real actual fresh delicious garlic...odd choice. The dish came with celery greens on top. A huge mess of them. Yummy stuff but could NOT bite through them without looking like a slob. Asked for a knife and the waitress said she usually orders it chopped up. This seems like it should be standard. Expensive for what it was, noodles, processed chicken, an egg and celery byproduct. GREAT service. Was very pleased. Nice alcohol menu. Interesting atmosphere. Food...is fine. It's no Johnny Noodle King."
12/15/2017,4 star rating,"I'm a fan of Ima. It's a small space so don't expect to have much elbow room, but the food makes up for it.I went with a group of friends and we split the shrimp and scallion dumplings, curry udon, and the lobster udon special. The dumplings were served with kimchi which added a nice flavor boost. The outer part of the dumpling was perfectly crispy while the inside stuffing left some flavor to be desired. They were good, but not exceptional. As far as the udon, I was so excited to try the lobster special. It came with a big, succulent portion of lobster tail. The lobster​ tail was well prepared, sweet and not rubbery. However, the broth was not very flavorful, which was disappointing​. Of the two udon dishes, the curry was by far my favorite. The broth had a very robust and rich flavor accompanied by a very divine aroma.I would definitely​ return to Ima. However, next time I would try the boombap. It seemed to be a very popular dish as multiple parties seated around us had ordered it."
12/3/2020,5 star rating,"This is one of those places where I get something new every time I go and it's always amazing. Udon, pho, rice bowls, the shareables -- it's all just really damn good. They have a tent going during covid, so dining in is an option. I've gotten takeout and everything was packaged perfectly and still hot after my half hour commute. Easily one of the best spots downtown!"
12/2/2017,5 star rating,"Food: 5/5Chef Mike greeted us at the door with a great big warm smile. He was inviting, extremely articulate and knowledgeable describing each dish on the menu. I was impressed he took the time with great joy and passion. He started us off with the clam special. The shellfish was fresh off the boat. A divine rich broth with tangy lemongrass and chili to compliment. We were then taken on a culinary adventure with Ima tacos, the jicama shells are brilliant and a perfect texture for these fresh lovelies. Every dish built on top of each beautifully. Best dessert ever - Strawberries & Cream. With each bite I felt a nostalgia that took me back to my childhood. The fresh mint chiffonade did an excellent job of cleansing my palate. Service & Atmosphere: 5/5Light and bright setting, communal seating was lovely. Everything you might need was provided in a minimal way. Wait staff was attentive, not too pushy and very knowledgeable. Overall: 5/5Love Love Love"

10/6/2018,2 star rating,"I made the mistake of trying Asian food in Detroit. The service was good and friendly, but the food quality is atrocious. The lobster udon was oily, the noodles were slightly overcooked, and the broth had no flavor. Oh, and there wasn't really lobster in the udon.The edamame is disgusting and drenched in salt, so please don't get it. They tried to do a cool twist on it and mutated it into something unspeakable. The only decent thing I ate here was the dumplings.I'd rather not eat Asian food than eat here. I feel bad for any residents that think this is good Asian food."

We tried the lobster udon and the golden curry with added smoked pork loin.Lobster udon ($24) This dish is unique and definitely caught our eye when we were looking on yelp, but I felt like it was executed poorly. The broth was tangy and and didn't really taste that good. I would have expected a more creamy broth but what do I know. Lobster portion was all pretty small also. Overall I thought it was mediocre and not worth the price. I was expected to be mindblown from this dish so it was rather disappointing. I would skip this dish. Golden curry ($11) with added smoked pork loin ($2): This dish was a winner in my books. The smoked pork loin was so tender and juicy, definitely recommend adding it for an extra $2. The curry had a small kick to it and had great flavor. Would definitely get this again! Service: Didn't take off stars for this because it was slightly busy, but definitely thought the service could have been better. Our waters were never refilled once and we were at the restaurant for about a hour. Our waiter also never checked on us once after taking our orders and it was hard to even flag him down to ask for anything..."

All the noodle bowls and rice bowls are stellar too . I have zero complaints about this place . Lobster bowl is amazing , salmon bowl and don't get me started on the bbq eel.. melts in your mouth like butter ."
3/8/2019,5 star rating,"I looooove this place! I saw that bon appetit had been here so I knew I could trust their opinion. We got the shrimp dumplings as an appetizer, and split the spicy pork udon noodles. It was amazing, so flavorful and the perfect amount of spice! If we didn't split the soup, for sure would have had leftovers. I also loved the atmosphere, casual but still inviting and comfortable. I will return whenever I get back to Detroit!"
3/12/2018,4 star rating,"I came here the other day after having a hankering for some sort of noodle soup, and was intrigued by ima. I had the spicy pork udon ($12), and added tofu to it ($2). The broth was spicy and flavorful. Generous amount of pork --probably around four slices. The soft egg was actually soft, which is sometimes an issue when getting noodle soups. My only qualm was that the tofu was overly salty, which was a bit disappointing seeing as I added it to my meal. My boyfriend enjoyed the yaki udon, which is a pan fried udon dish with root vegetables. It was a pretty heavy dish, and seemed like it was the Asian version of buttered noodles. Not for me, but he really liked it!I'd definitely come back and try some of their other udon dishes. Also overheard the server talking about how the smoked salmon is smoked in house, which definitely piqued my interest."
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"Located in Corktown. Street parking. Small little restaurant with patio seating. We opted for indoor. Their seating arrangements are a bit like communal seating except there is an area in between the person sitting in front of you where they keep in the condiments and utensils. It does make it hard to chat. The service here is very good as they checked on us a couple times although it wasn't too busy. We all ordered the udon and it was surprisingly good! I was a bit hesitant about going to an udon place in Detroit. The broth was flavorful and hearty. The udon was the perfect texture. It was actually one of the better meals we had during our 5 day visit to Michigan. Definitely, wouldn't mind returning if we were to visit again."
3/2/2019,5 star rating,My first time here. Very unique setup. Food and drinks was great. Definitely will come back. Give this place a try.

11/24/2018,3 star rating,I wouldn't recommend this place.  My Yaki Udon was so mushy :( I would recommend Johnny Noodle King or Urban Ramen instead.
10/31/2018,4 star rating,I was pretty impressed with Ima.  The cool eclectic and chill vibes ooze off the place.  It's a small place with communal seating.  They have a dope beer list with a nice sake selection.  The ramen and rice bowls have unique flavor and come at nice price (I may be completely used to Chicago prices at this point.). If in Detroit come take a walk around Corktown and make a stop at Ima!
11/18/2018,5 star rating,"Probably my favorite restaurant in Detroit. Curry Udon is the best... followed by this -- the spicy tuna. Good for lunch or dinner. Casual but super fun. Good vibes in the evening, too."
9/23/2019,2 star rating,"wasn't that impressed?? seems overhyped. had the forest udon, vegan bowl of broth and noodles and veggies, for $13. seemed bland and overpriced. my friends had the pho which they didn't like that much. i guess i was expecting ramen or levels of flavor similar to ramen, which i guess udon isn't. service was lacking. our server, taller skinny white young girl with blonde hair, seemed kind of rude and cold. didn't come check on us. skimped me on my change when paying the bill and didn't give me a receipt. everyone else seemed nice enough tho. the patio was cutely decorated, but the music they played inside and outside was obnoxious. i wouldn't order the forest udon again, but maybe the curry option. but with so many other options in the area don't think i'll be back too soon."
12/27/2019,5 star rating,Service is great and the food is amazing. Their seafood ramen and pan-fried udon were perfectly spiced and the right amount of noodles and seafood proportion. They also have other interesting dishes to try.
1/25/2019,5 star rating,This is an excellent chic restaurant where you can get many different kinda noodles with various toppings I like the fact how simple yet sophisticated the restaurant looked . We ordered a curry soup and bibimbap . Both of them was very tasty and healthy . We had a hearty meal . I would recommend this for anyone near down town Detroit looking for lunch and dinner
1/25/2019,5 star rating,"I have been here a few times and I always order the same thing because I love it so much! I get the Spicy Pork Udon with a side of edamame and fruit soda. The bowl of noodles is pretty big and is enough to fill you up and maybe even take some home. Also, the staff is friendly and attentive. I usually come during the week days during the evening time and there's always parking in the parking lot across the street and even sometimes in the street. This is definitely a place to try out for all of those who haven't yet !!"

11/29/2019,5 star rating,"Okay let's talk about it. This was my first time trying Pho fr and ima will be hard to top. I got the seafood kimchi and they did not disappoint. It was hella shrimp in it. Hella mussels. And whole bunch of other things I can't pronounce in it. I like spicy stuff too so it being spicy took it over the top. Only thing I would have liked is if the noodles wasn't so thick but with all that flavor I could look past the thick noodles. Also. While I'm here. I should say, crawfish is mad overrated. A lotttttt of work for a small piece of meat. But they put that on top to jumpstart the meal and it's a very decent look. I would suggest. 10/10."
9/23/2018,5 star rating,"Since I've become more ""plant-based"", I'm always on the prowl to find places that have good vegan/vegetarian food. Ramen/noodle places are hard to come by because of the extensive use of meat based broths even if everything else is meatless. But ima has vegan options and it's so good. The place is small and has communal style seating with a cute patio. The service is fast and the portion size is A+. And the food, mmmm. I took my first sip of the broth because that's the gold in any noodle dish and it hit good spots all over. I couldn't finish it and took the leftovers home and ate them the next day (not as awesome the day after because the noodles are soggy) but I love paying for one meal and getting two out of it.Corktown continues to surprise me - I love that the options are no longer just ""let's go to Slow's"". I definitely recommend ima."

3/4/2018,5 star rating,"Well worth the hype! My favorite asian restaurant in the area by far. The space is a little bit small and pretty busy (for good reason), so not great for big groups. The salmon bowl I ordered was unique and full of flavor. A great rendition to the typical salmon don. I can't wait to come back to try more items on the menu. Would recommend this place to all of my friends visiting!"
10/3/2018,5 star rating,What an experience! Six of us tried Ima for the first time and we ALL enjoyed it. Our server Kaylee was great! She suggested items to add in each of our orders. For appetizers I would suggest the steamed edamame and shrimp and scallion dumplings. For entree the tori udon was fabulous. I recommend adding avocado and mushroom to it! And if you like sake...Drunken Whale is a must!
10/1/2018,5 star rating,"Something for everyone. Vegetarian broth with fish, spicy pork, lobster udon and vegetarian udon curry. Yum. Yum. Yum. Very busy. Ima has a young vibe. We had a 20 minute wait on a Sunday evening."
9/30/2018,5 star rating,"I have never dined in, but I have Postmated ima twice now, both times for their spicy pork udon. Each time it has been so. good. The broth comes in a different container than the contents (pork, egg, seaweed, noodles), and I get great satisfaction out of pouring my broth into the main bowl. That counts as cooking at home, right? Anyway, it's not overly spicy, which I'm grateful for. I really taste the spice when I'm slurping the last precious sips of broth. The portion is plentiful and filling. I'm not the best with chopsticks, so I usually make a big mess with splashes, but when you eat in the comfort of your own home, who cares! Long story short, ima is so good delivered. 5/5 will order again."

9/29/2018,3 star rating,"We tried this place based on the yelp reviews and in my opinion it's a little over hyped. So we tried the edmame appetizer, it was good for the price. My wife ordered golden curry with chicken, this was by far the best golden curry I tasted. I ordered yaki udon with chili shrimp. Problem - it tasted as if I was eating Mac n cheese from Panera bread with a side of non chilly just steamed shrimps. Absolutely no worth for the price. For drinks we tried their local fav patio punch, which as described contained vodka but had no taste of it.So overall for food, golden curry was a savior and that's why 2 stars for the taste and 1 star for the location.For first timers who want some new taste, I will recommend golden curry and for anything else, all the best folks !!o"
9/28/2018,5 star rating,"Excellent food, fast service, clean restaurant. Food is very flavorful and is a good portion size. I definitely left feeling full. I had the boombap with beef-so good! The protein portion is kind of small (well, it looked smaller than I would get at other restaurants, but it's probably an average size), but it's definitely enough. The edamame is sooo good too! Took me about 2 pods to decide if I liked them but then they were addicting. Water is serve yourself with pitchers on the tables that the staff was good at refilling when needed. Very friendly and helpful staff. 5/5 would recommend"

9/21/2018,3 star rating,That patio punch is Fan-effing-tastic! I wrote down the ingredients so I could recreate it next summer on my own patio. I was in Detroit for a girl's weekend and this was our first dinner. I had the spicy tuna which could also be considered a deconstructed sushi roll. Everything was good except the flying insects. I had to ask for another side of dressing because one landed in it before I had a chance to use any. It was warm and they had the door to the outdoor seating area open. I assume this is where the flies or gnats were coming from. It really ruined the meal and I took off a star for that.The inside is very nice looking with natural lighting and blonde wood.The location is conveniently located to bars within walking distance if you want to grab another drink after your meal.
9/21/2018,5 star rating,"Very good noodles! I ordered the yaki udon with the tofu and it was delicious. There was this dope sesame butter sauce that made the dish so flavorful and rich and wonderful. My sister ordered the forest udon which was also delicious but a bit more bland because she got the vegan broth so there you go. The edamame was spiced deliciously and I have never had it like that before which was such a yummy surprise! Also the patio punch is tasty af and I would order more than one! Josh our server was very attentive, helpful, and kind. Great spot!"
9/17/2018,4 star rating,"Wonderful. Went here on a Sunday night with my fiance and got the Boombap, spicy pork ramen and the Ima taco. I wouldn't recommend Ima taco with pork. It would've been better with beef. Price was a little steep but we enjoyed are ourselves and will be back."
7/24/2018,5 star rating,"For the longest time, I've been #TeamRamenForLife, but one trip to ima has completely swayed me over to the udon life. My friend and I got to ima around 8 pm on a weekday, and the restaurant was still bustling with people. We split a fresh greens salad and both ordered the spicy pork udon. The udon broth was rich with umami flavor, yet still light and refreshing. Now let me tell you about these noodles--they are THICC. Soft, chewy, and robust, coated with broth in every bite. Another surprise--the pork loin has a distinctly smoked flavor to it. My time in Detroit is limited but I am definitely coming back to ima again, that's a promise."
2/8/2018,2 star rating,"I got overly excited over all the nice reviews that I had to check the place out. The interior is nice and gives a hip vibe. The space however is tiny. My friend and I got seated on the window side where there was a bar. It was hard to eat comfortably because of the limited eating space. For appetizer we got the shrimp ima tacos and then tori udon and spicy pork udon. Shrimp ima tacos were good. Instead of a typical tortilla shell, they use a thin slice of what looked like seasoned daikon lettuce. However, it's super tiny and makes me question if it was worth the $7/8...For my entree I got the Spicy Pork Udon and an add on of the smoked trumpet mushrooms. My waitress brought my food first and said she'd be back with my spoon, but basically forgot about me. I waited 15 mins before I stood up myself and grabbed my own spoon. I then began to dig in but noticed that my trumpet mushrooms were not added in. I waited to grab my waitress attention and told her I was missing the mushrooms and she seemed to not believe me?? She kept insisting to me that it should be there and that it was probably in the bottom. I had to physically go through my soup to show her it wasn't there. She apologized and grabbed me a side plate of my mushrooms. I put it in my soup, went for a bite and noticed how overly salted the mushrooms were. As for my broth, it seemed water down. Not really rich and to my tasting...The restaurant seems to be marketed as your casual small go to eat ramen kinda place, but when you look at the price it def feels overpriced. I probably will not be back. I'll stick with getting champong at a korean restaurant."
1/5/2019,5 star rating,Amazing spicy tuna bowl! I cannot wait to go back and try another dish. Walked out of Ima feeling fully satisfied and no bloated like I usually would.Definitely recommend this resturant for a healthy choice.
1/16/2018,4 star rating,"ima is a super cute Corktown spot that makes vegan Asian food look easy.Like how is that golden curry vegan? How? And so delicious.

We ordered the gyoza and they forgot it but when we told the waitress she put the order in right away and took it off the bill. Talk about great service! I wasn't even mad about it the food was so good I was preoccupied with it. We just heard the gyoza was really good from reviews and wanted to try it. Well you guys were right! It's great! Not for people who don't like ginger though. It has a strong ginger flavor. We will most definitely be back again for more!"
9/21/2019,4 star rating,"The outdoor patio was a chain-link fenced enclosure that seemed too cagey to be comfortable. The diners looked like bowl-clutching internment residents. I sat inside at a communal table and enjoyed watching the kitchen moves. The staff was multiethnic, with the kitchen's internal affairs keeping we diners entertained. I had an unsweetened green tea and the spicy pork udon, for which there is a side menu of adds for $1-2 each. This was my meal of the day, so avocado (1/2, for the oleic acid), a second soft egg (50 g / 73 cal), ginger beef (2 oz), and tofu (2 oz) came nestled next to my bowl's udon, pork loin, bok choy, and egg. The triangles tofu were a little too dense, and as a result, lacked flavor. The broth was flavorful and light. I ate what I could, then saved the rest for my dinner."
5/27/2019,5 star rating,We love this place and Just recently went back after not being able to eat there for almost 3 months I had a baby and I'm breast feeding so my usual is the spicy pork noodles I tried something different and it was so yummy delicious and had my usual of awesome amazing dumplings which I can eat a whole order by myself!! We brought our new baby with us too Great atmosphere and even better food!! Love Mike and his crew

6/30/2018,5 star rating,"Went here with my wife and teen daughter who had been here before. They love it. And now I do to!!We were promptly seated at a long table in a somewhat small, but not cramped, room. Had an awesome waiter named Kevin who gave me some suggestions about the menu and took great care of us throughout the meal. Started with the shrimp and scallion dumplings which were phenomenal. Loved the taste and also the way they were soft on top and crispy on the bottom. Also had the tuna tacos, again phenomenal. Kevin suggested the spicy pork udon, but as it was 100 degrees outside, hot broth was not something I was interested in. Instead, I went with the boombap with the spicy pork as an addition. It is a rice dish with a fried egg, mushrooms and a spicy sauce. As I wanted something spicy, Kevin had us try their hot sauce. Both sauces were excellent and the dish was phenomenal!!! We then had the strawberry dessert which was tasty.When researching the restaurant before going, I saw someone had written that they don't have A/C. This concerned me as it was a hot day. Well, they have air conditioning and the restaurant was very comfortable. All in all, this was one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while!!! Great food, great service, and a really cool neighborhood to explore as well. We will definitely be returning here a lot in the future!!"
1/20/2018,5 star rating,"This place is delightful. From the steamed edamame, to the boombap with ginger beef, to the tea, everything I put in my mouth was an explosion of unique and interesting flavors. I can't think believe a restaurant has me raving about edamame and tea. The edamame is covered in oil, lemon, and chilis and I could eat it all damn day. The hot tea has ginger and toasted rice flavoring it and it is the most delicious tea I've ever had.I cannot say enough good things about this place."
6/7/2018,4 star rating,"A very fun twist on asian fusion in Corktown. A small Corktown spot with outdoor park bench seating on a patio with an adjacent AstroTurf patch to lounge about. But no eating on the AstroTurf! They don't want to be cleaning food crumbs out the ground. Shrimp tacos were delicious, green sauce has a strong kick. And their important Vietnamese/Japanese beverages have fun names like Grape Sac and Yum Yum Milk.Overall 4/5 enjoy the asian fusion cuisine outdoors!"
1/16/2018,3 star rating,"Came here on a cool winter day to meet up with a friend. Since I saw some pretty good reviews about the udon here, I had to drop by and try it out. The place is a little, but comfy spot to dine. Fortunately, I came during a not-so-busy time, so was promptly seated. For an appetizer, I had the shrimp and scallion dumplings. They were a bit too oily for me, but the meat inside was pretty good, especially when dipped in the black vinegar and chili. I wished they gave me a little more of the kimchi to eat with the dumplings. Otherwise, pretty good dish, but I've had better. For the main meal, I went with the spicy pork udon. The broth was delicious and full of flavor (not as spicy as expected, but I just added more chili into it). Though, as I made my way through the broth, it started to taste a tad too salty for me. The pork loin was lean, tender, and had a wonderful smoked taste to it. Loved it the best in the bowl. I'm not too much of a fan of udon (prefer ramen), but I thought the udon was good. It wasn't bad nor extraordinary. The highlight of this item was the broth and pork for me. Overall, good experience, nice staff/servers, fair price-ish ($12 a bowl). May come back again in the future to try out the other bowls."
4/19/2018,5 star rating,"Corktown adventures were very fruitful today! @imadetroit showed out! I tryed two bowls first a Spicy Pork Udon that I LOVED(think this will become my fav hangover cure) the broth was rich, creamy, well seasoned with the right amount of spice, the Pork lean, savory but the gooey soft boiled egg took it over the top for me! Next the Forrest Udon(I exchanged the tofu for beef and switched out Udon for rice noodle, here I wished they offered the flat wide rice noodle it would've made it more authentic) this broth altho milder in flavour had such a savoury depth that I  had to question, Are you sure that's a Vegan Broth? Phenomenal! I've added this to my regular must visits when I'm in the D!"

Our server was friendly enough, but disappeared as soon as the place started getting busy, leaving us waiting for the bill behind a pile of our dirty dishes. The food was fairly mediocre, I've had better udon, ramen, and dumplings in other places. I think the pork-free broth is a huge mistake and sacrifice of flavor. That being said, very cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and the food was fine."

8/11/2017,5 star rating,"Sweet mother of god. First off, the guy who said this was processed ham obviously doesn't know what food is. Number two: Americans who whine about ""authenticity"", doesn't know what they're talking about. Most Americans would either not try authentic cuisine from most cultures, or they'd hate it and say it's not authentic. Knock it off with that crap, eat the damn food, and base it off of that. And I noticed a lady was upset that pork belly wasn't used. Pork belly isn't always used in a bowl of noodles. That's what's great about it. Anyway! I'm a chef and rarely get the chance to go out. We headed downtown after dropping my son off at his mums. Heard about this place from my homie Kobie. Got stuck in traffic and redirected. Took about an hour and I was getting irritable (the weed was no longer a calming presence). We walk in to a cute, modest spot. Server was cool. We ordered. Lady got the sashimi bowl. She said it was difficult to eat, but said it was delicious. I don't care about that though. I'm a noodle junkie, and udon reigns supreme! I cook udon at home at least twice a week. I can't get enough and I've had some fucking dope udon. I ordered the spicy pork udon. Slap me silly, but this is one of the best bowls of noodz I've ever had. Came out ripping hot, and the broth was exquisite. Just enough fat to make ya lips shiny, not too much to where they get sticky. Perfect. The ""processed ham"" that guy was talking about tasted strangely like a beautifully smoked pork loin. It was so tender, I hardly had to chew. And I don't know if you goddamn yelp warriors know about smoking lean pork, but it's not that easy to get that deep smoky flavor, while keeping the meat tender. While the egg was a tad overcooked, I'll overlook it.  6 minutes and 10 seconds cooks a perfect soft boil. However it's easy to overcook and when I do soft boil, I go 5 min and 50 seconds. That ensures it won't overcook when it gets dropped into piping hot soup. But again, it's a matter of seconds and anyone can barely overcook a soft boil, especially if doing in batches and not to order. But, the Yelp warriors always know more. We shared the shrimp dumplings. Phenomenal. The black vin n soy was a delicious dipping sauce for the dumplings that were crispy on one side, soft on the other. Great mouthfeel. This is hands down the best place for noodles right now. Fuck your authenticity. I'll be coming here regularly. And that is the beauty of ramen/udon/soba/somen. The possibilities of what you can do is endless. Ima is doing it better than everyone in Michigan right now. Thank you for the amazing food."

My favorite is I got the spicy pork noodles but since I don't eat pork, I substituted for chicken and it was amazing! I love how none of their noodle broth have pork or beef. Would definitely recommend for any noodle lover!"
9/13/2017,5 star rating,"Sooooo goooood. My favorite. The best.I usually mainly get takeout udon from here, especially if I'm super tired, but the eel bowl is amazing as well. The food is consistent and very good, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I noticed that it seemed to be pretty kid friendly last time I was in, but haven't taken any family members, so can't confirm that personally.Thanks for letting me hang out with my sketchbook while I wait for noodles every time I'm here and sleep deprived. I appreciate y'all."
11/5/2019,5 star rating,This place is super cute! When you walk in the smells are amazing. I ordered the best Edamame I have ever had in my life. It was full of flavor. The staff is super friendly and the location is amazing
2/10/2018,4 star rating,"The food was great.  The menu offers sufficient vegetarian and vegan options.  The pickle plate was a wonderful mix of color, taste and texture, artfully displayed.  The goddess salad was pretty - and pretty good, but nothing to write home about - basically a Japanese Caesar salad - romaine sliced crosswise and drizzled with dressing, dressed up with radish and pink Daikon.  Forest Udon and Curry Udon we're both excellent, if salty.  Added root vegetables to the forest Udon - and in spite of it misclassification as a root, the cauliflower was still very tasty. The chairs are too small and the music is too loud.  Bear in mind that we are right sized athletic people, who enjoy socially vibrant places, just not so loud you have to strain to hear the person sitting next to you."
7/29/2018,1 star rating,"Incredibly disappointed in this place, went in on Sunday evening for a late night dinner. The service was awful, we waited 15 minutes and were not even acknowledged or given water. We ultimately decided to leave. We were initially really excited. Will not be back"
7/25/2018,1 star rating,"Monday evening not meany restaurants open, went here for first time. Very limited seating, floors dirty, table sticky, cheap plastic glasses for water, water pitcher on table with not so fresh water in it. Only one vegetarian noodle, on menu, was not edible. Waitress did not want to be there,never brought my drink or showed up again until she dropped off the bill. Will not return."
7/24/2018,5 star rating,"For the longest time, I've been #TeamRamenForLife, but one trip to ima has completely swayed me over to the udon life. My friend and I got to ima around 8 pm on a weekday, and the restaurant was still bustling with people. We split a fresh greens salad and both ordered the spicy pork udon. The udon broth was rich with umami flavor, yet still light and refreshing. Now let me tell you about these noodles--they are THICC. Soft, chewy, and robust, coated with broth in every bite. Another surprise--the pork loin has a distinctly smoked flavor to it. My time in Detroit is limited but I am definitely coming back to ima again, that's a promise."
7/24/2018,4 star rating,Came at night. Had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes as greeter predicted. A bit noisy but we were able to carry on a conversation as we sat at a counter by the window. Hubby liked the seasoning of his chicken is On dish and I had the spicy tuna bibimbop. Loved the serving size and taste. Parking can be tough. Great service.

7/23/2018,5 star rating,"I had a delicious lunch at Ima with 2 friends on a Sunday. We arrived a little after 12 and got to sit on their outdoor covered patio (a great spot for a rainy day!). The waitresses were very friendly and helpful with ordering, especially since I'm the most indecisive person on the planet. I finally decided on the curry udon with tofu and my 2 friends got the Yaki udon (no broth) and the pork udon. All 3 of us loved our dishes! The broth for the curry udon had strong curry flavors but wasn't spicy (I love spice personally but this makes it good for everyone else). The noodle dishes were flavorful and good sized portions for the price. Having broth with udon noodles is very unique and it was executed well. We all ate until we felt sick because we couldn't stop ourselves - the dishes were just that good (no regrets). I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Detroit!Food - 5 starsPrice - 4 starsService - 4 starsAtmosphere - 4.5 stars"
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"Located in Corktown. Street parking. Small little restaurant with patio seating. We opted for indoor. Their seating arrangements are a bit like communal seating except there is an area in between the person sitting in front of you where they keep in the condiments and utensils. It does make it hard to chat. The service here is very good as they checked on us a couple times although it wasn't too busy. We all ordered the udon and it was surprisingly good! I was a bit hesitant about going to an udon place in Detroit. The broth was flavorful and hearty. The udon was the perfect texture. It was actually one of the better meals we had during our 5 day visit to Michigan. Definitely, wouldn't mind returning if we were to visit again."
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"Really yummy, cute little spot in Corktown! It's tight squeeze seating reminiscent of Japanese noodle bars. Recommend the spicy pork udon."
7/21/2018,5 star rating,"Always a go-to when I am in town.  Very vegan-friendly.  Order the Tofu Ima Tacos and make sure you use ALL of the green sauce. The Edamame is covered in the most flavorful spices, and the Tofu Golden Curry is spot-on.  Very kind staff as well!"
7/17/2018,5 star rating,I love the attention to detail they put into each item. This place and independent and not a franchise. The waiter/staff was very helpful for a vegan friend and recommend a different broth for her bowl.This place is small and I would not recommend coming with a large group.
7/17/2018,4 star rating,Great cozy place. Even though it was small its very loud and kid friendly.  It seated my wife myself and 2 children comfortably.  Great selection of noodle. I indulged my self with the lobster bowl. It was amazing. A tad too butery but other than that it was great. They even had some noodle options for the kids. We also ordered the curry noodle with shirmp and it was very good. Fresh ingredients good staff cool atmosphere. Ill go back.

3/22/2017,5 star rating,"I can totally see this restaurant spinning into something akin to the One Off restaurant group in Chicago (Big Star/Blackbird/Avec/The Publican).I haven't been this impressed in a long time. Our server was inviting and attentive. The owner/chef makes himself visible and frequently checks on guests. The music is AWESOME- no, seriously, it is especially well curated. The logo and branding is spot on and really capture the essence of this space and concept.I am a vegetarian (pescetarian when necessary) and there was plenty for me to choose from with a vegan broth option. The edamame was nicely seasoned, the goddess green reminded me of my favorite deconstructed caesar and the ima tacos were ever so clever using the jicama shell. My friend let me try her tofu from her bowl of forest udon (I don't like tofu) but I liked THIS tofu. The dessert was tasty and the hot tea is delicious."
3/20/2017,4 star rating,"We started with the edamame which was so good it felt obscene. Lemony and just salty enough, I want that spice mixture on everything I eat. Moved on to noodles, because, after all, it's a noodle shop, right? Really enjoyed the (vegetarian) forest Udon which was tasty on its own, but even better once kicked up with a little soy and hot sauce. Finished up with the dessert of amazingly smooth and light vanilla custard topped with mandarin orange, mint sprigs and some crunchy cereal-esque bits. It was the perfect sweet, but light, final note after some very filling noodle bowls. Can't way to go back and try the curry Udon."
6/1/2017,4 star rating,"Noodles! Love noodles and have been on a quest for tasty ones in the Detroit area. I ventured forth with a friend to check Ima out.  The inside is small with casual table seating and bar seating around half the interior.  Part of it faces a wall but I had good company.  The kitchen is visible past a half wall.  We arrived early in the dinner hour and were greeted promptly.  A variety of music played in the background.  (Sort of odd blend of music...) We opted for the appetizer tacos (spicy shrimp, jicama shells) and different noodle bowls.  I got the spicy pork udon and my companion the forest udon.  My companion was impressed with the broth and the quantity of mushrooms available in the soup.  The spicy pork udon was flavorful yet spicy and very filling.  No extra seasoning needed unless you wanted to make it spicier!  Food excellent! Get the tacos!! Get the udon!! Parking here is ? Well we didn't actually see any but since it was early we parked in another lot- shhh don't tell on me.  Definitely visiting again when I'm in downtown area."

4/17/2019,5 star rating,We were there Saturday night and at first glance I was like really. Once we were seated and ordered our food I was pleasantly surprised. This place is a must go to eat I will take anyone I know there for dinner. The staff was super and friendly. The lady who waited on us was knowledgeable about the food took her time to explain the menu.  The food was so good I am glad we decided to go. The restaurant is group seating so you meet new people  we meet to ladies and we talked about different restaurants. This is a must go to tryit
1/23/2018,4 star rating,"Pretty good service - they were busy! But incredibly not loud or a feeling of being crowded despite the communal style seating. Not too long of a wait. We had two of the ramens, and I was able to get a bone broth in replacement of the porcini broth on the forest udon and replaced regular noodles with rice noodles. Beer could have been way colder but it was pretty ignored after we got the ramen. Boyfriend is Asian and raised that way, and loved the spicy udon. Keep it up chef!"
3/18/2017,5 star rating,"My wife and I were returning home from DTW and we wanted some noodles.  We found Ima on Yelp.  WOW.  Anyone can make broth or stocks but Mike has honed his craft.  His broths were excellent, smooth, clear, light and full of flavor without the loads of sodium.  It takes talent to make this kind of broth.  The simple menu of 4 udon dishes with many add-ons seems to allow Ima to keep their quality as high as it is.  We had the spicy pork and the chicken udon.  My wife took half of hers home (nice sized portions), I consumed mine entirely. The edamame was crazy good!  It has community seating (no big deal) and the waitstaff was very attentive, friendly and courteous.  If you're in a hurry and they are busy, mellow out, take a break and relax, it is well worth the wait.  Glad to see this kind of establishment contributing to the rebirth of Detroit.From way out in Ray Twp."

1/19/2017,5 star rating,"I was laying on my couch when my pal Justin texted me 'just got a passport, we should go to Japan'. 'Well how about some Udon in Corktown', I messaged back - it seemed like a fair compromise. Noodles are truly everything to me, my hierarchy is: Noodles, family, friends, social justice, etc. Just to give you an idea..So anywho, we went here - not too bad of a wait on a Wednesday eve, about 15 minutes. I got the forest udon and we split the tacos. The soup was everything I need: (and vegan! but then I added a soft boiled egg, so it wasn't anymore..) complex broth, doughy noodles, smoky mushrooms. So many great textures! I could keep ordered that dish for all my return trips but I will force myself to venture out.The tacos were just alright for me. I liked the shell and the hot sauce but the chicken was on the drier side - I would try a different protein for next time. Overall I cannot wait to get back here."
7/24/2020,5 star rating,"The service here is supreme!! I went here a year ago, and told myself to leave a review because I had such a wonderful experience so now here I am. I ordered Japanese curry, and didn't like it much as it was too salty for my taste. I lived in Japan for a year, so I can definitely be a bit of a snob about the cuisine. However, I don't like to be rude at restaurants after having worked the service industry for so many years, so I didn't say anything and planned to just pay my tab and go on my way, but the server was observant enough to notice I had barely touched my plate and offered to replace it with something else at no cost. I was pretty full on appetizers and cocktails by that point, so I declined and they took the meal off my check and didn't charge me for it. It was so kind! Not every restaurant is willing to do that, and not every server is observant enough to pick up on those little things. She also took the plate away as soon as I said I didn't want it, which is another mark of the incredible service I received. I will definitely go back here when I travel to Detroit again and try something else on the menu!"
8/9/2019,4 star rating,"Mixed Asian styles of food available. Clean environment and quick service. Ordered the pickled vegetable starter, which eas pretty good, and then dove into the Udon.

6/28/2017,4 star rating,"We tried two appetizers: 1) dumplings - awesome! Some of the best I've tasted. They have fantastic flavor and come with delicious kimchi. 2) tacos - we tried them with the garlic chicken. I thought these were good, but not necessarily something I'd pay $7 for again For my entree I had the spicy tuna sashimi bowl. So so so so fresh and good! I would get this again anytime, anywhere. It was $16 but with it! If authentic Japanese food is not your thing, you might want to stick with the ol' Hibachi chain places"

1/28/2017,4 star rating,"Cute tiny place in vastly popular and (dare I say) trendy Corktown area. The food was very delicious! I had the curry rice and my partner had the spicy pork udon. The sauces and broth were very flavorful and good.The only negative is that the seating is super crowded and not a lot of room to move around. I would go back, but would go earlier next time to beat the crowds!"
10/22/2017,4 star rating,"The food is good (and it's definitely 2 meals worth!), but my beer was 7 bucks which seems steep for this kind of restaurant.  However, I would come back. The service could use some improvement."
12/29/2016,5 star rating,"I dined here on their 2nd night open, 12-29-16, and I'm already planning my next visit. Everything was delicious!  The menu is marked clearly with many vegan and vegetarian items. I started with the Green Goddess salad, which was crisp and flavorful. Next, I had the Forest Udon Bowl. This was warm comfort food at its finest. The broth was flavorful without being overly salty. The smoked mushrooms and tofu were perfect. Chef Michael Ransom came to our table and was so nice. He wanted our feedback which of course was very positive. I'm so glad he has returned to his childhood neighborhood and opened this restaurant in Corktown. I predict great success for him and his new restaurant!"

Great atmosphere! Everything we had was delicious. From the kids buttered udon noodles to the spicy pork udon I had, we were all extremely satisfied. Seeing the other dishes come out, they all looked very appetizing as well! We can't wait to come back to try the other dishes!"
11/20/2017,5 star rating,"Fabulous meal last night at Ima. Started with the shrimp and scallion dumplings, hot and a bit spicy, 5 dumplings, tasty.

Will be back!"
1/8/2017,5 star rating,"Had the Edamame and tacos for appetizers. Both were phenomenal,though the spicy pork Udon managed to put both to shame. Our service was friendly air prompt once we were seated. Well worth the 30 minute wait, which is expected at a new spot with (approximately) 40 seats. If you like ramen or udon, and are as disappointed with Johnny Noodle ""King"" as myself, you have to go here."

6/4/2017,4 star rating,"Had been planning to go to Ima ever since it opened. It's really good! The atmosphere is casual, with long communal tables inside and a few tables on an outside patio. We got the tuna sashimi special which had pears, ginger, pickled veggies and a few other things. Really tasty. We also got the Forest Udon which was really savory and not too salty. The prices are very reasonable. We didn't get any, but they had some interesting non-alcoholic drinks. They have ample parking in front and behind the restaurant. Will definitely be making a return visit."
10/27/2018,5 star rating,My favorite ramen place in Michigan! Consistent and tasty. They have an indoor and outdoor sitting. Hipp and casual. They have long tables so it's perfect for large groups. You order in line get a number and they bring the food to you. Their sake is also really good. Try the unfiltered one. The portions are large and although it's a little pricey it's worth it. If you craving good ramen or udon soup I would stop by.
2/15/2017,4 star rating,"Pretty good. More authentic than some other noodles shops in Detroit. Loved the dry rub (but just wet enough!) garlicky edamame. Finger licking great!

10/9/2017,5 star rating,"Their spicy pork udon is one of the best dishes I have ever had. I have been here a few times at lunch, a mix of dining in and takeout.  Service is always warm, friendly and accommodating. Takeout is quick. Ample dining space.  Order at the counter, food runners will take it to you. I am usually a single diner at lunch- they have ample counter seating. Food: I have had so many bad udon bowls, I was really hesitant to order. In fact, I ordered the curry rice bowl, the first time I visited. It was great- perfect rice and toppings, sauce rich and unctuous. I had more time my next visit, ordered the pork udon to dine in- based on yelp reviews. Udon was perfect in every way. Noodles- Devine. Broth- unbelievable!! So rich and flavorful without feeling heavy. Toppings- the pork is what made the dish. Smoked pork loin so juicy and light in smoky flavor.  I can't wait to have it again. I am so happy i get to frequent this place. You should too."

Oh and add avocado on it too because it is pretty spicy!!"

12/31/2018,5 star rating,"I really liked this place! It was simple, cute, and clean. As I walked in, You get a rush I'd spice and broth smells. It is one of those small lunch or dinner spots. A group of five of us went in and got seated immediately. They have very limited seating so we sat next to other customers. This restaurant is mostly udon style noodle soups. There are many vegetarian and vegan options for such a limited menu. The price is average for Detroit $12-15 a dish. I would definitely recommend people who like udon to try this place!"

My sister ordered the forest udon which was also delicious but a bit more bland because she got the vegan broth so there you go. The edamame was spiced deliciously and I have never had it like that before which was such a yummy surprise! Also the patio punch is tasty af and I would order more than one! Josh our server was very attentive, helpful, and kind. Great spot!"
8/13/2018,5 star rating,Hip Asian fusion with picnic style seating. This corktown restaurant is hip but not too trendy. It's pretty small with community seating so not the best for an intimate conversation. There's also outdoor seating in the summer. *the Yaki udon was good. It came in a pretty thick sesame butter sauce which I wished was a bit lighter but overall yummy dish*I also tried the golden curry which I liked more. This tastes more like an Indian inspired dish. Get it with the ginger beef!*busy on weekend nights because small seating area. service is very friendly!
12/27/2017,5 star rating,"My fiancé and I went to ima for lunch yesterday after hearing great things for the last couple months. It completely exceeded expectations! We had the edamame, shrimp and scallion dumplings, curry udon and pork udon. Everything was incredibly flavorful and perfectly put together. The dumplings in particular were out of this world - soft but crispy in the right places, and amazing flavor. Only thing is it's a very small dining area so you may end up waiting a little while for a spot to open up, but it's worth the wait. Cant wait to go back!"
3/4/2018,5 star rating,"YUM!!  Delicious food and friendly staff!!  I always order the udon noodles and I've never been disappointed.  My go-to is the curry udon.  There are so many delicious elements in this dish.  The broth is amazing, and never too salty.  The vegetables are fresh, and the soft egg is perfect.  The packaging was perfect when I ordered a carry out.  They also carry Topo Chico!!  Thanks, ima!!"

11/14/2018,4 star rating,The soup is like nothing I've ever had before! Spicy pork udon flavor is something you need to experience.
1/12/2019,5 star rating,"Okay, I'm by no means a ramen aficionado, but I enjoyed my dish. What's more, everyone else loved theirs. The servers were friendly and efficient. Drinks were great. The music was fantastic! And what I really loved about this spot was that it was warm!!"
8/12/2017,4 star rating,"First time trying it and it was really good! Me and my friend are vegan and vegetarian and they had options for the both of us. We got the tacos and they were unique and delicious. The atmosphere is great, is more of a to go kind of feel but they have some seating to dine in as well. Definitely will return soon!"
2/20/2019,5 star rating,"Always on point! Friendly staff. Great food and vibe. Try the shrimp tacos, dumplings, spicy pork udon or the lobster udon! You won't be disappointed!"
1/1/2020,5 star rating,Ima is excellent! I've tried a few different dishes and they're all good. The staff is helpful with tips for newbies.
10/21/2018,5 star rating,"I've been here a dozen times and I'm still in love with the spicy pork udon. The chef's creations are thoughtful, complex, and just plain delicious! Will be back many times I'm sure."
2/6/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food, sometimes the wait can be long but it is worth it! The appetizer tacos you must try!!"
7/3/2017,5 star rating,This is my favorite place to get Asian fusion cuisine. Everything tastes fresh and looks absolutely amazing. The atmosphere is pretty laid back & depending on the day of the week the music is REALLY good. The house smoked salmon is possibly the best dish I've had all year.
11/3/2018,3 star rating,"We've been to ima a handful of times, each time the food has been delicious. However, each time we have gone, something has consistently been wrong with our order. Not really a huge deal, just kind of frustrating when I have to pick the ginger out of my bowl because it was ordered without, or ask for a side of mushrooms that was ordered, or ask for my missing egg that was supposed to be included in the dish. These are a few examples, among others. Also, as other reviewers have stated, the gai lan and trumpet mushrooms are hard to bite, I would recommend asking for them chopped up so you don't choke to death.The place is pretty small, and it is a personal preference of mine to sit alone, rather than next to strangers, whilst slurping down my bowl of noodles, but it's okay. The service has been fine, a few times the waiter has been awkward and slow, but usually an alright experience. I will be back though, as I find the food to be quite delightful. I would recommend the spicy pork udon, the curry udon (with chicken if not vegetarian/vegan), and the dumplings. The mushroom udon is nice, too.  I did not care for the edamame."
8/31/2018,2 star rating,"Not impressed.  It looks good in pictures, but didn't taste good.  I can't even remember how to describe it as my visit was a couple weeks ago- but that's just it- not memorable.  The lobster udon was overrated and overpriced.  The service was also slow.  Likely will not return."
9/16/2018,4 star rating,Outstanding food. I would deff come here again and again. Dumplings are a must. Oh and the edamame!!!!. Yummy.
9/9/2019,5 star rating,"Such a weak spot for my man and I! Cuz ramen is a weak spot dammit! They're delicious, fast and ever-improving their good service. I usually get the spicy tori paitan, always delightful to eat although the spice and flavor levels were gradually decreasing with each visit. Also, the choice sesame chicken tastes and looks like thick slices of chicken deli/sandwich meat. Unless that's how it's supposed to be?? At least that's pretty much what they said when I asked about the super acidic, tangy kimchi sauce cup sample they had ($2 ""side"" btw). Anyway, there was a time I let the waitress know the flavor was a bit on the light side after she asked how things were and immediately she asked if I wanted a few of the items that will add more to the dish, it helped a lot and she was so accommodating overall. They're a pretty chill staff and don't mind if you're still sitting there trying to finish your big ass bowl of ramen after close time. The place has definitely been noticed by many and is looking busier with each visit, looking forward to the expansion of the place and delicious menu items!"
1/17/2019,5 star rating,"I've only visited once but I give Ima top marks for its simplicity and good, affordable offerings.  Great location, too, in the heart of Cork Town.  Looking forward to returning very soon."
11/20/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing noodles, amazing customer service. The staff is super knowledgeable and helpful! I think it has better noodles than the competing places nearby that we've tried. We will be back!"
7/8/2018,4 star rating,"While small in size, ima packs a powerful and very tasty punch. Usually, I go with the edamame (which is heavily seasoned and fantastic), dumplings, and the Boombap Bowl. In the several experiences I've had at ima, the service is always top-notch and the food is fresh and flavorful!"
8/26/2018,5 star rating,"Man, I loved the tori Udon. Delicious broth, and the chicken was flavorful. Friendly staff, and great atmosphere."
4/19/2017,3 star rating,"The soup here is a big over rated. I can get soup on par with this place from many places locally for a much cheaper price.Places like Tom+Che get very high ratings although the quantity is pretty low, and in terms of quality, it taste OK, but it feels like it can be made at home.This place is like Tom+Che, but the quality is better. I feel like the prices here are a bit too high for soup when I can get food ""higher up the chain"" to say for the same price!"
9/30/2018,5 star rating,"I have never dined in, but I have Postmated ima twice now, both times for their spicy pork udon. Each time it has been so. good. The broth comes in a different container than the contents (pork, egg, seaweed, noodles), and I get great satisfaction out of pouring my broth into the main bowl. That counts as cooking at home, right? Anyway, it's not overly spicy, which I'm grateful for. I really taste the spice when I'm slurping the last precious sips of broth. The portion is plentiful and filling. I'm not the best with chopsticks, so I usually make a big mess with splashes, but when you eat in the comfort of your own home, who cares! Long story short, ima is so good delivered. 5/5 will order again."
11/6/2018,4 star rating,"Probably my favourite place in corktown! Small cozy place that gives you a local joint feel and  at the same time, incredibly delicious dishes. The head chef and owner is the nicest guy I've met! I make sure I say hi to him every time I'm here :DThe only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that the service can be off on some days..some of the wait staff are unfriendly and even if there aren't too many people, they give you this impression that you are wasting their time :/ If you are willing to focus on the food and ambience instead of the staff's behavior, you got yourself a great cozy night out. If you're in the mood for some amazing service today, go elsewhere!"
12/20/2018,4 star rating,"Absolutely love ima! Gets busy on weekends but they have family style seating, so you never have to wait too long for a spot to clear up. Service can be a little slow sometimes. The shrimp and scallion dumplings are amazing for an app. I'd be willing to try any of their dishes, but I usually go with something broth-based. Also love the decor!"
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"I have never had a bad experience here. The food is delicious the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Great spot! Love the shrimp and scallion dumplings, and all of the add on options to customize my meal."
12/13/2018,4 star rating,"Amazing curry! I always say I am going to try something new, but can never bring myself to order anything but the curry udon. The broth has a warm spice to it that calls my name when I walk through the door. The ima tacos are an interesting dish. I love all of the crunchy textures together and the spicy sauce adds just enough flavor to give the tacos a bit of a kick. Definitely not your average taco tho, I like to think of them as veggie wrapped veggies... I took off one star for their lack of dessert choices. I am a huge dessert person and although I enjoyed the strawberries and cream, it would be nice to have a few sweet choices for ending your meal here. The main room is intimate, communal style seating. The patio is heated and has a beautiful flower wall. Great backdrop for Instagram type people. The service here is great. I have always had a friendly waiter/waitress. I Highly recommend this joint. The trendiest noodles in Detroit for sure!"
9/10/2018,1 star rating,Ugh how disappointing I would not recommend the forest vegetarian soup it was over priced and the mushrooms tasted like shoe leather.
9/7/2018,3 star rating,"I'd call it a 3.5. Let me start by saying that there really isn't anything too negative about the place, it's just okay. I do really like the community seating and the cozy, trendy vibe inside, and my food (I had the spicy pork udon) and service were pretty good. It's middle-of-the-road for me just because their menu isn't terribly extensive-- the only kind of noodle they offer is udon-- and the flavors and ingredients were nothing incredibly special. Now, this may just be a personal misconception as I am still new to the Asian noodle game, so I do definitely want to head back and try some new things. All in all, while I wasn't necessarily wowed, I certainly won't count it out."
10/16/2018,4 star rating,"Superb udon. Their dishes exhibit high quality and although more of a ""eat and go"" spot they meticulously care about the dishes they serve. On weekdays order at counter. On busier weekends you are waited on. DON'T sit by window as there are flies hat can fall into your soup."
5/25/2018,5 star rating,"We were waiting at another restaurant down the street and decided to see what else looked good. We sat on the patio and a friendly waiter greeted us. The menu had a bunch of interesting things that we were deciding from. The waiter gave great advice and helped us pick our two dishes, the smoked salmon and the yaki udon. The salmon was our favorite of the dishes. It was amazing, broke apart and had lots of flavor. The Yaki Udon was delicious, full of flavor, we added the beef and it paired perfectly. The patio punch went perfectly with the meal, it had a robust flavor. So many of the other options on the menu sound delicious and I hope we'll be able to come back!"
6/26/2018,5 star rating,"Been anxious to stop by since it opened! Ima did not disappoint. We sat outside on the cute patio with long tables meant for large parties or sharing with other diners. I enjoy the community style tables as it allows for some interesting conversation and meeting locals. At first our service was a bit slow, but our waiter apologized for the wait and was very attentive from then on. The house made punch was sweet, but very tasty! I had the house sake which was definitely enough for two people. We started with the pickle plate which was refreshing and light, then had the clams in sake broth. It was my first time having clams in the shell, and they were absolutely perfect. No clams from here on out will probably be as tender and flavorful. I'll be thinking of them for a loooooong time. My unagi-don was awesome too. The eel melted in your mouth, and cane with plenty of rice and toppings. My boyfriend's lobster udon was tasty with great veggies and tender sous-vide lobster. Overall-experience lived up to the expectation. Clams stole the show, but all the food knocked it out of the park. We'll be back when we're in Detroit again!"
7/24/2018,4 star rating,Came at night. Had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes as greeter predicted. A bit noisy but we were able to carry on a conversation as we sat at a counter by the window. Hubby liked the seasoning of his chicken is On dish and I had the spicy tuna bibimbop. Loved the serving size and taste. Parking can be tough. Great service.

11/12/2018,5 star rating,So good!!! Staff are super nice and every dish I tried was amazing. I wish Ima was in my home town so I could go all the time...
10/9/2017,5 star rating,"The food at Ima is amazing. I tried it for the first time and it was fantastic. Walking into the restaurant I was a bit skeptical because there weren't many people there and the place is on the smaller side but by the time we ordered that restaurant was packed! I enjoyed that all of their bowls, both udon and rice, are very customizable with about 7-10 options for protein and 4-5 options for vegetables. The staff was super nice and friendly as well. I recommend trying this place especially as the weather cools down."
12/5/2018,2 star rating,"Oh boy! Bathroom door doesn't lock so I walked in on a dude pooping before I could even sit to eat...you can imagine my appetite was greatly diminished. Waitress never learned what a smile was, nor how to talk without sounding like she hated the world. Food overpriced for quality."
6/2/2018,5 star rating,This place is exemplary. Amazing vibe. Amazing food. Good alcohol. A great staff. My goodness. This food blew my mine. Got the spicy udon. Perfect broth. Wow!!
7/11/2018,5 star rating,"This is as good as it gets in the D. Affordable, welcoming, unique and well executed dishes, fast, friendly staffing, and the most comfortable environment. Come one come all, vegan, pestcaterian, flexitarian,semi-vegetarian idgaf, this place has it nailed down. When I try the lobster udon I'll let you know what life is all about."
7/7/2017,5 star rating,"How could I forget to give this place five stars! Where to start... very laid back atmosphere and great service every time I've been here. This is a small spot but you have enough room to be comfortable even for a big man such as myself. Very casual atmosphere and the food is AMAZING. I've tried a few different dishes but here the EEL is king! If your looking for Asian in Detroit this is the spot. No MSG greasy fried rice at this spot, only unique delicious dishes!"
10/29/2018,5 star rating,I haven't had something here I didn't like. The udon is super flavorful and there are a variety of options.  I eat here at least once a week.
1/2/2018,4 star rating,We ordered the shrimp and scallion dumplings and the spicy pork udon. Both were super delicious. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the pork in the udon. It tastes more like ham. I wish they had pork belly as an option because I would totally pay more to substitute it!
10/17/2017,4 star rating,"When it comes to Japanese food in the city, these guys do a pretty good job. Compared to Johnny Noodle King, ima tastes more authentic. The best japanese food is still in Novi (Ajishin). I gave them 4/5 because they charge $5 for a pot of tea. Ridiculous. Good/decent food otherwise."
8/19/2018,3 star rating,"This is a cool shop that's recently been opened in Detroit. It's a no fus, hipster joint that serves Ramen. I came here on a whim to try out the Ramen and ended up getting the pan fried Ramen. I felt it was extremely rich, and honestly I couldn't finish more than half of my bowl.Basically, it wasn't my favorite, and the decor wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It's an average place to try Raman around the city. I don't think that I will be back."
8/17/2019,5 star rating,"Server Josh was excellent and his recommendations were on point. I had vegan pho with chili shrimp and my wife had the ugani-don. Both were very flavorful and more than enough. We also shared the edamame and dumplings to start. The edamame has a unique seasoning which was great. The outside seating area is relaxed, and great for a summer night."
1/8/2018,3 star rating,"The place is small very small and you need to eat and run the parking is also an issue. Ok for the good stuff the people are nice, friendly, quick and hardworking. The food is fair you have to know what you're doing if you want to get the meal you hope for. The quality is above average so is the price. You may need to try the menu a couple of times, try this, try that. But Kimchee is not one of the items I would recommend. NOT that's is hot it's just not Kimchee but a local variant. If you're not a student of Japanese cuisine this may be a bit of a  struggle.  Give it a try. If your in the Shelby Twp area also try Willow on 26 mile south side of the street."
9/30/2019,4 star rating,What an experience! We tried Ima for the first time and we ALL enjoyed it. For appetizers I would suggest the steamed edamame and shrimp and scallion dumplings. For entree the tori udon was fabulous. I recommend adding avocado and mushroom to it! And if you like sake...Drunken Whale is a must!
4/13/2018,5 star rating,"I honestly don't know why the hell I haven't posted a review for IMA yet. I've been here at least 8 plus times. I take all my friends here. I absolutely love this place. I love the atmosphere, the food is incredible and out of the box for noodles, and prices are good! I have two favorite dishes I go back and forth with on the menu because they both are incredible. The forest bowl add extra trumpet mushrooms cause they are so darn good. Also, the yaki udon is so freaking good. Both are vegetarian. This is my favorite restaurant in Detroit right now! Which is big because there are millions of restaurants popping up everywhere. Go here, they are doing something different."
11/1/2018,5 star rating,"Really great casual Japanese food! This place is awesome, especially during the colder months here. The hot sake and udon bowls  even thawed my frozen heart. I want to eat their noodles all the time and will come up with any excuse to get it (casual date, happy hour with a friend, family from out of town is visiting, etc)"
8/11/2018,5 star rating,"Being Japanese I tend to stay away from Japanese-American restaurants, however, this place had one of the best curry udon I've ever had. The broth tasted incredible, not to watery, and not to strong. The presentation of our meals were eye opening and the service is phenomenal. I would recommend this to anyone passing through Detroit."
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"I was on a request for a bowl of noodle soup that served alcohol and this place is the sweet spot! I was a little worried when I saw they only served beer and wine but to my delight they served Nigori! The jicama tacos was what made me pick Ima over Johnny Noodle (can't compare b/c I haven't eaten there). I think jicama and tacos go together like tea and water. The jicama shell with the tofu, veggies, peanut sauce-ish w/ the green cup of fire reminded me of a spring roll. I will order them with every visit. I had the Forest Udon which was marvelous! The broth was full bodied and infused with flavor. The mushrooms are awesome! They give a meat texture without the squishy ness of a portbella. The tofu was cooked perfectly. I would've loved a little more seaweed in the dish. The noodles were also perfectly cooked. I loved everything about this bowl and can totally seeing this spot as and meal as a staple! My buddy ordered the curry bowl and loved it. The presentation was beautiful. The place has a very intimate vibe so don't be shocked in you're almost sitting arm and arm with a stranger. The good news is the staff does a great job with seating the guests so you're comfortable anywhere. The music is great I had several moments when I wanted to dance. Great house music is played here. Make your belly happy and eat here!"
5/14/2019,5 star rating,Went here on my birthday! The ramen and rice both were yum. Really cute place with sweet staff!
6/9/2018,5 star rating,"The vegetarian options are AMAZING. I love this place. The noodles are always perfect, the vegetarian broth is so flavorful, and any other vegetarian dish I've had here is always so interesting and tasty. One of my favorite spots in detroit."
4/19/2018,5 star rating,"One of my go to stops. Food is always incredible and a great value for the high quality ingredients. The staff is friendly courteous passionate about what they are doing. Everything I've ever had is amazing. The Forest Udon is one of my favorites and if they still have the Lobster Udon on the menu don't hesitate one but, just bring a friend to share with..."
9/3/2018,5 star rating,Amazing!!! I've been here a few times and have left nothing but full and satisfied. Yaku was my absolute favorite. The sesame sauce is amazing.
7/17/2018,5 star rating,I love the attention to detail they put into each item. This place and independent and not a franchise. The waiter/staff was very helpful for a vegan friend and recommend a different broth for her bowl.This place is small and I would not recommend coming with a large group.
9/1/2019,5 star rating,"A ""must-eat"" spot located in historic CorkTown. Be prepared to wait for a table, as the location is quite small. The menu is extensive without feeling overwhelming. The prices are reasonable and the food is fantastic. Make sure you order the seasoned edamame, you won't regret it!"
5/20/2017,5 star rating,LOVED IT. Curry udon noodles were unique and delicious. Edamame had crazy spices that made edamame which is the same everywhere something really special. Servers were really friendly and smart. They were well versed in the menu. Will be back again and referring friends.
4/5/2018,4 star rating,Shared seating. Quite loud inside. Good service.  Great food. Reasonable food selection  even for vegetarian. Good drink selection.
3/10/2017,5 star rating,"PSA: This place rocks. They are doing great work with passionately created food, energetic atmosphere and seamless service. You are missing out if you don't check ima out."
2/25/2018,4 star rating,"This review is only for the experience and for the spicy pork udon. That's because it was the only thing we tried. The place is cute but the music was so annoying! Just a heads up. The service was fine. I enjoyed the spicy pork udon broth and noodles. The broth packed good flavor, it wasn't served too hot or too spicy and the noodles had good texture. I was a little disappointed with the pork texture. It was a little deli meat ish. It was a good portion and I would come back for it."
2/2/2018,4 star rating,Yum! Spicy pork udon is wonderful- every bite is a new flavor combo! Love the egg with the seaweed!  The edamame is great but super messy so better as a carry out but you could ask for Just salt. The space is small and cozy but in the winter every time the door opens there is a cold blast. Look for the heat vents above the tables and sit directly under one if you are sensitive to cold.
1/31/2018,5 star rating,I don't care if I can't button my pants when I leave or that my eyelids will be so salty the next day that I look like I was crying - this place is SO GOOD. And thank you to the staff who gave me a run-down on the good candy. Y'all are great.
3/30/2017,5 star rating,"Solid black-owned Detroit business. Located in corktown. Wonderful service, and the noodles were so good I took my boyfriend to dinner there just 48 hours after my first visit. Jicama tacos were interesting and tasty.The food was GREAT. The music was good, the service was over the top. This is one of my favorite place. It can get very crowded Fri and Sat evenings, so would be a BAD idea (and pretty inconsiderate to other potential guests) to try to bring a large party during those times. Community tables are a smart way to seat many in a tight space."
2/4/2018,4 star rating,"Delicious non traditional udon. The edamame and pot stickers were great! Friend had the lobster udon, husband had the spicy pork udon and I had the tuna bowl. It's a small space so would be hard to get seats but we were lucky to grab 3 seats by the kitchen at 7:30 on a Saturday during the autoshow."
2/24/2017,5 star rating,Ima is a new restaurant in Corktown and it's the best noodle place in the city. They have limited seating although it was great for a group of me and 5-6 people. The forest udon was my favorite! They also have individual tacos which are also great! Will definitely be coming back here for my ramen/noodle fix.
4/28/2018,5 star rating,Another amazing meal at Ima! One of my favorite places in the city. Best thing is the restaurant is nut free so those with nut allergies can dine worry free!
8/16/2017,5 star rating,"What a fabulous place!  Menu is SO creative and interesting, the decor, service, food = absolutely one of the best experiences in Metro Detroit.  Ima tacos with Jicama shells, spicy shrimp - wow.  Edamame with chili paste - incredible.  My dining partners had the udon and loved it!  We will definitely be back many times to work our way through the menu... If you are looking for a casual setting, value priced food that gives you top level, upper shelf cuisine, IMA IS IT!"
6/15/2017,4 star rating,"Really impressive little spot serving the best udon in the area.  Stopped in for lunch recently and grabbed the shrimp tacos to start.  Jicama shells provided a light, tasty touch.  Almost a hand held salad.  Then came the spicy pork udon.  It's all about the broth.  Noodles a perfect texture, but this has to have been the only time I couldn't be bothered to add anything to the broth.  Lip smackingly good.  I'll be back."
4/2/2018,5 star rating,"Spicy Pork with shrimp, it was delicious!  It was cold outside but the heated porch was toasty warm.  We had a great lunch and will be back soon, we want to try the rice next time we visit."
7/29/2018,1 star rating,"Incredibly disappointed in this place, went in on Sunday evening for a late night dinner. The service was awful, we waited 15 minutes and were not even acknowledged or given water. We ultimately decided to leave. We were initially really excited. Will not be back"
12/9/2017,5 star rating,"I had the spicy pork udon and the curry udon. Both were amazing! The soft egg was perfection on one of my visits. It was overcooked on another, but I didn't mind because everything was so delicious. Both udon dishes had so much flavor, and the add ons just magnified those flavors. Do not get the hard cider; it tastes like medicine! It's a small space, so if you go at peak hours, don't go with a large party. I was pleased I could seat 4 people on a Saturday at 4:30, but in an hour, it would have been a wait to seat 2. Service is courteous and quick."
7/28/2019,5 star rating,"If you're looking for flavor you found it. MUST GET the Forest Udon with no rosemary, add ginger beef and extra tofu with their in house hot sauce."
7/25/2018,1 star rating,"Monday evening not meany restaurants open, went here for first time. Very limited seating, floors dirty, table sticky, cheap plastic glasses for water, water pitcher on table with not so fresh water in it. Only one vegetarian noodle, on menu, was not edible.

7/21/2018,5 star rating,"Always a go-to when I am in town.  Very vegan-friendly.  Order the Tofu Ima Tacos and make sure you use ALL of the green sauce. The Edamame is covered in the most flavorful spices, and the Tofu Golden Curry is spot-on.  Very kind staff as well!"

7/27/2017,5 star rating,This place is amazing!! The atmosphere is fresh and clean. The waitstaff is friendly and helpful. And most importantly the food is refreshing and modern take of Asian cuisine. So far everything I've had is tasty!!
7/17/2018,4 star rating,Great cozy place. Even though it was small its very loud and kid friendly.  It seated my wife myself and 2 children comfortably.  Great selection of noodle. I indulged my self with the lobster bowl. It was amazing. A tad too butery but other than that it was great. They even had some noodle options for the kids. We also ordered the curry noodle with shirmp and it was very good. Fresh ingredients good staff cool atmosphere. Ill go back.
5/19/2018,4 star rating,"First visit there just last night. Patio Punch was really good it's a seasonal drink made in house that is just right for the warm weather soon to be upon us. Golden Curry was very good. The flavors mixed well with the sticky rice and vegetables. Even add shrimp to my dish which add to the dish in my opinion. My wife ordered the Pork Udon which was very flavorful and the noodles were just right. Think the only thing we paused over was that the pork flavor was really dominate in the broth, but the dish name saids it all so guess we can't complain much. The steamed edamame was a good starter to the meal. Will return soon, even with kids in tow."
3/25/2017,1 star rating,Do you like below average service and food that is hard to eat? Well this is the place for you! I can't see this catching on. The endless house music was also unpleasant. Tacos were outstanding. Almost made it worth it
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"Nice vegetarian options. I will be back! If you eat eggs, get a soft egg in your udon."
2/10/2018,5 star rating,My go to place whenever I am craving for ramen. Love the lobster udon... amazingly flavorful... totally recommended
12/30/2018,5 star rating,"Yum! This place is super unique and exceeded my expectations. Unlike other reviewers, I'd skip the jicama tacos next time but my curry with tofu was amazing! My dining companion had the spicy pork udon and loved it. The Stillwater saison was surprisingly delicious as well. 10/10 would recommend if you're in Detroit and looking for some unique Asian food."
3/5/2019,5 star rating,The food was really good. Tried the udon with veggies and it was something I would try again. It's a really small place. More of a lunch spot. Would definitely recommend
11/21/2017,5 star rating,"I love this place.  Went there on a cold day and the noodle bowls warmed me up.  Very nice place, nice folks, amazing food.  I was so full that I could barely finish!"
4/29/2019,5 star rating,So delicious! My friend is a vegetarian and really enjoyed the menu options. The udon is so good. Really enjoyed the balance of flavors
3/20/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices. The spicy pork udon was on point, great flavor with a good bit of heat."
3/15/2019,5 star rating,"Divine!! Went with a co-worker and got several items from the menu. The dumplings were my absolute favorite followed by the bowls of noodles. I had the curry, simply and utterly delicious! I can't wait to go back. I also enjoyed the tacos, it's definitely my favorite Japanese spot. I've heard there is a location in Madison Heights which has a more extensive menu, I'd love to also check that spot out."
6/7/2019,4 star rating,Very nice place just a short walk from the Ford owned train station.
3/4/2018,5 star rating,"I have never tried Japanese udon before, but I'm now a fan! Thanks so much to William for the recommendation and kudos to my server, Reisa, for the timely and excellent service. Will definitely be back!!"
5/2/2017,5 star rating,"Decided to try ima after seeing it in the Freep's best new restaurants list, and it did not disappoint!A friend and I came around 7 on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately at the bar against the wall. Seating is at either a bar or a couple of long tables so be prepared to cozy up to a stranger - it's worth it.We ordered edamame to share, which was seasoned really well and more exciting than your average edamame starter. Our spicy pork and tori udon came out super quick - we didn't even get a chance to finish the edamame before it arrived!The spicy pork was great, just the right amount of spice. The portion is pretty healthy too - I struggled to get through the last few slurps of broth.Excited to try this place again soon!"
5/29/2018,4 star rating,"Really cool spot with delicious food. The menu is well curated flavour wise and so far as heaviness of dishes, few apps and several rice and udon dishes.lI had the pickle sampler which was not large but each type was distinct with the right amount of bite and clean tastesI tried something new and had the curry bowl with no add ons and it was more than enough. It was indeed silky and the curry was fragrant but not overpoweringThe restaurant itself is in a cool industrial space in Ferndale with communal seating and amazing music. All in all the total package"
12/5/2017,5 star rating,My god.  The curry udon (add ginger beef) is one of the best meals I've ever had.  You must go and try this dish.   Awesome staff.  Extraordinary!
2/21/2018,5 star rating,"The patio seating was warm, even in winter, but the spicy pork udon kept me warm long after we left."
1/15/2017,5 star rating,"Yeah that was good. Took the entire family, all 4 of us and we really enjoyed it.  Tone of the best meals we have had since moving to Detroit. The green tea was also really good. We look forward to going back soon."
10/3/2017,3 star rating,"Food and service was very good, however extremely disappointed with the owners customer service and hosting. It was my first time patronizing and most definitely will not return.  ."
2/17/2017,4 star rating,"Ima is a great little noodle shop in corktown. The spicy pork udon was great, I would suggest getting the spicy sauce on the side. The tacos were nice and crisp with a great peanut sauce. My only compliant is that the smoked salmon really needed some acid to round it out. Overall, a really solid addition to the Detroit food scene."
2/16/2017,4 star rating,"Really liked that they are selective with their menu, only serving a few meals which they do well. Service was friendly, food came in quickly and the music was kind of interesting. Only thing I would improve is the doorway: every time the door opens a cold breeze blows over that tiny space. Maybe use some kind of curtain to keep the cold wind out?"
5/8/2018,5 star rating,This place rocks.  The food is so different yet so delicious.  I would love return one day.  Yum!
2/5/2017,5 star rating,"This place is a hidden gem. The service was great and the food was amazing! We got the green goddess salad to start off and it was delicious. The dressing was light and creamy with a twist. I tried the curry udon and added shrimp to it. It was a little thicker than I was expecting but the flavors and textures were on point. The egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were everything! My husband got the forest udon and I must say, we both enjoyed his dish more than the curry bowl. The broth was extremely flavorful and he said the tofu was hands down one of the best he's tried. To top it off, we ordered the vanilla tofu custard with mandarin oranges and mint crisps....phenomenal! It was such a different kind of dessert but so refreshing! And didn't taste like tofu at all! We are already planning to go back next week. Love this place!"
3/22/2017,2 star rating,"The food was Very meh. Way over rated by everyone. We were feeling like some Ramen noodle type food, so we thought we would give Ima a try as it's kinda new. I had the pork curry which was just plainly not good. Rice was covered in ""spices"", pork was thinly sliced and ""smoke"" flavored , the curry itself was bland with no funk. Kinda tasted like my moms curry and she is from Texas. Wife had the noodles which were barely acceptable. Jonny Noodle King is far far better on all fronts.  Don't know how long this place survives when all the hype is over tbh. A little over crowded inside too. They really pack you in, that's what dropped them one more star."
10/30/2017,5 star rating,Best udon ramen ever. Highly recommend the spicy pork udon. So flavorful with a little bit smoky. Absolutely love it
4/11/2018,4 star rating,"Hands down some of the best ramen I've had in Detroit. I always get the spicy pork udon with extra noodles (you essentially get a second meal) and it's fantastic. Service was quick, but my only complaint is the seating. It's family style/community tables, so you either sit next to a different party or at a cramped counter. Overall definitely worth a visit!"
4/9/2018,5 star rating,"I read online reviews of Ima & had high expectations; they were exceeded. The space is laid out for a friendly & comfortable meal. The Ima team members were warm, welcoming & knowledgable.Now, onto the food & drinks. The lobster udon featured a rich buttery broth with crisp greens & juicy lobster. The noodles had a perfect texture & held the flavor of the broth. Did I mention the broth? I would travel to Detroit just for that broth. The grapefruit sake was bright, crisp & contrasted perfectly with the decdent lobster udon.Thank you Chef Mike Ransom for pouring all kinds of love into your food!"
12/30/2017,5 star rating,I had the forest udon yesterday for lunch and I'm still thinking about it. I can't wait to go back. Next time I'm coming for dinner and adding sake to my meal. Great Job!
6/15/2017,4 star rating,"My favorite noodle place in Detroit right now (although there aren't many of them at this time.) Their spicy pork udon is delicious. I especially love the broth. They use udon noodles better than thinner ramen noodles. Not as much a fan of the rice and curry dishes, although I don't have to be as their noodles are delicious. The place is pretty small though I'm usually able to find some seating Within a fair amount of time"
12/20/2017,5 star rating,"I got here right as they opened.  My husband and I split an order of dumplings, shrimp tacos and spicy pork udon noodles.  Every thing was delicious! I'll definitely be back!"
5/22/2018,5 star rating,"I'm so happy I discovered Ima. When I'm in the mood for an Asian fusion cuisine, Ima is the place to go. I love sitting on the patio. The decor and the service are great. My favorites are the shrimp + scallion dumplings, boombap, and house smoked salmon."
9/22/2017,5 star rating,Came with my family and it was the bomb.com. Mike the owner is really nice and the atmosphere is great. We will be back for more :)
7/25/2017,1 star rating,"I hate to come all the way here, and a special event is going on, and nothing is post online"
11/27/2017,5 star rating,"Finally a noodle place that does it right.I love ramen and usually need to travel to cities with a larger Asian population to find a satisfying bowl of hot noodle soup. Although this isn't a Ramen Restaurant, Ima makes an amazing broth with well balanced salt, umami, and heat. While the broth is traditional in flavor, I enjoyed the little bits of creativity. I ordered the forest udon, which has a nice meaty flavor, although it's vegetarian. They sprinkle rosemary on top, which is a surprising addition for a Japanese soup, but worked so well with it.  Price was comparable to other restaurants I've been. Seating was shared across long tables with other guests. My husband and I snagged the last two available seats at 6:30 on a Saturday. After we were seated there was a little line, but turnover seemed quick.  We enjoyed a nice meal and made it out in time to be in our seats for an 8 pm show downtown. We will definitely be back."
2/28/2020,5 star rating,"the staff is so nice and the food was delicious, i was disappointed that they were out of lobster but i was able to substitute it with my choice of protein and the broth was amazing ."
5/26/2017,5 star rating,"Ima is a simplistic restaurant in a cozy, modern dining room. I'm not huge on communal dining (sitting next to another party), but the seating makes good use of the small space. As for the food - we tried the udon and the eel bowl, both were fine, but the star of the show is somehow the Green Goddess salad. It's terrific! Refreshing and has a great tasting dressing. It seems the owner works very hard to please diners, so I would definitely give Ima a try if you're feeling Japanese-fusion food or food on the lighter/healthier side. It's also very nice to see the kitchen from the dining with the chefs and staff cooking away, hard at work. Bonus, probably one of the coolest looking bathrooms I've been in in a restaurant lol."
11/5/2017,5 star rating,"I wish I could give this place 10 stars!!!! My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times and ALWAYS leave satisfied. The menu is simple but I don't think there's a bad item on it. Prices are reasonable and you definitely get your money's worth, portions are huge! There are a whole bunch of add-ons too. Super friendly staff which always makes the experience better. The edamame is a must!! I've had the forest udon (it's vegan! I added the egg) and the boombap rice bowl and both are DELICIOUS! My boyfriend swears by the tori udon and says it's the best broth he's ever had. This is definitely our go-to whenever we head out for a bite. Highly, highly recommend!"
11/3/2017,5 star rating,Great food in a nice setting. Limited menu but perfect if you are looking for a nice intimate ramen shop
8/9/2017,5 star rating,"This place is amazing. Seriously.  You need to go here.  The noodles are tasty and delicious.  Casual, friendly spot with delicious sweet ginger and rice green tea.  Can not recommend this place enough."
10/8/2017,5 star rating,"Hot toasted chili sauce is soooo good. Put it on everything. Forest udon was amazing, extra noodles is a great option for me. Charming assortment of fun drinks to choose from. Love love love. The staff was soooo nice. Some of the best service I've had."
7/19/2017,4 star rating,Really cute little spot with good udon soups. They give generous and filling portions. I'm giving them 4 stars because there was no A/C inside;  some guests looked like they were melting in their seats! Hoping that this was a temporary glitch because I loved the soup.
10/7/2017,5 star rating,"We just stopped by for a snack and the edamame is delicious! Dumplings, also good. Would like to come back and try more of the menu."
12/26/2017,4 star rating,Don't be intimidated by the size of the establishment. Really welcoming and fast service
12/16/2018,5 star rating,I loved the tori udon. The broth was creamy and rich with flavor. The toppings are delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender. The bok choy was sweet and complimented well with the noodles.
12/10/2017,5 star rating,"Bright, fresh, colorful and flavorful.  SO good."
12/10/2017,3 star rating,"Tacos interesting shell, had a fresh taste to them but lacked flavor and overpriced. Spicy pork udon...bland...better as left overs..more time for the flavors develop I guess. Eel bowl ... delicious! Wish there was more eel...as everyone would :)"
3/5/2019,5 star rating,"The service is always great and the food even better. The space is so tiny, but the servers are still able to maneuver around the place effortlessly. This is my favorite Ramen place in Detroit hands down."
8/30/2017,5 star rating,"Tried the Boombap with beef and it was great. My friend tried the Forest Udon and she loved it as well. The hot tea was delicious as well. Friendly and quick service also. Somewhat small on the inside, it was packed around 7 on a Sunday night, but definitely worth the wait if there was one. Excited to come back and try more dishes!"
12/2/2017,1 star rating,I called and they said there was no wait for 2. When I got there 5 minutes later there was a line out the door and a 30 min wait. I wish he would've just been honest with me from the gate and not wasted my time.
2/28/2019,5 star rating,Good food. Slippery noodles. Very nice. Would eat here again. Fer sure. God bless. Get em while they're wet.
11/4/2018,3 star rating,"Not overly impressed with the food here. Prior to going, I read via yelp that the tacos were amazing...got the tacos and they were just ok. The main issue for me was that they tasted watery - the wrapper is some sort of sliced radish (maybe jicama) and the taco itself is topped with more jicama. I also ordered the yaki udon. It was good, but not great. Nothing memorable I'm just going to be honest. For the price that you pay here, you just expect something a little more I guess. Service- it was a packed night, so we didn't really see our waitress."
8/15/2017,5 star rating,"OMG they were WONDERFUL! I love seeing small businesses flourish and manifest dreams into reality! My finance and I have been looking for a decent Japanese joint in Detroit (which seemed to be nonexistent until a co-worker told us about this hip little spot)! The owner and staff super friendly and passionate about their culinary creations; and the customer experience! They even brought me out a little paper bib adored with their logo and tied it around my neck for me so I wouldn't get soup on my white dress as I slurped down delicious udon noodles swimming in homemade bone broth!..Did I mention that their meats were smoked to absolute perfection! They pulled out all the stops and delivered a wonderfully satisfying experience! We'll definitely be ""regulars""!"
5/21/2017,4 star rating,"Fresh and inventive. The owner is sincere and attentive. The Spicy Shrimp Tacos were exciting and bursting with flavor. Menu is completely genuine and creative. A tiny bit expesive is my only critical opinoin. My wife and I share a bowl, taco order, soft drinks $30 before tip."
12/27/2017,5 star rating,I couldn't love this place more. The staff is amazing as well as the food. From the appetizers to the dessert. I could eat here EVERY SINGLE DAY
5/6/2017,5 star rating,"This place is just brilliant. 3 appetizers. 4 noodle entrees, 4 rice entrees, one dessert. All but the dessert customizable by protein and add-ons. Service was awesome and the communal seating made it fun since we met a really nice couple we struck up a very cool conversation with. Spoke with the executive chef twice since he was out and roaming. He's a wonderful guy, the type you really want to support. His love of the food shines through and he makes you want to support it. But you really need no coaxing from him. It was all amazing.The unagi dish was just stunning. The jicama tacos just a wow. And the 2 vegetarians in our party didn't feel like second class citizens. Everything we had was just amazing."
10/13/2017,5 star rating,This restaurant is a Corktown gem. The food is incredible and the staff are very friendly. You will not be disappointed.
6/17/2017,5 star rating,"Everything that I tried was perfectly balanced and the flavors were amazing! I have been here many times now and each experience was perfect. The prices were not too expensive, portion size was spot on, and the service was out of this world! I would recommend the jicama tacos and especially the unagi don. Anyone who comes to visit me in Detroit is going to wind up eating here with me!"
12/1/2018,3 star rating,"Honestly, not sure what the hope is all about. Service was great and nice atmosphere but far from the best ramen I've had. The broth was nothing special and while the noodz were decent, I did not enjoy my meal. Swing and a miss, unfortunately."
5/19/2017,4 star rating,"Not bad for ramen if you don't want to venture too far out of town. I would give it a 3.75 star rating. It is more or less tailored to western clients, from deco to food flavor. Service is ok and friendly.Price is a tad on the expensive side for what it delivers. Parking is a major headache, with quite a few new restaurants popping up on that stretch of Michigan Ave near Corktown. Hope the city does something to solve the issue, or it will choke the revival. Hopefully Ima can introduce more people to the lovely ramen arts. Detroit does have one of the best ramen shops in US, IMHO, as in Matsuchan."
10/7/2017,5 star rating,Gem of a place and no need to leave Detroit! The shrimp and scallion dumplings and spicy pork udon were the best ever of their kind. Will be back!
10/1/2018,5 star rating,"Something for everyone. Vegetarian broth with fish, spicy pork, lobster udon and vegetarian udon curry. Yum. Yum. Yum. Very busy. Ima has a young vibe. We had a 20 minute wait on a Sunday evening."
4/10/2017,4 star rating,"I had the bimbap and it was delightful! Although I felt as though the edamame was a twinge too salty, the delicious noodles more than made up for it! Will definitely be returning!"
8/15/2017,5 star rating,"Can't say enough good things about Ima! Consistently delicious, excellent service, and a lovely little outdoor patio. The Smoked Salmon rice bowl is my favorite-- sooo good!!"
12/4/2018,4 star rating,Went in after a long day of work for a bite of warm soup. It is a small restaurant but the soup was excellent. I had the Tori Udon and added ginger beef with heat sauce. It hit the spot and was absolutely delicious!
5/31/2017,4 star rating,Really good noodle spot. I've never been a huge fan of the ramen noodle spots opening up everywhere but this place does have some nice platters. Flavors are rich and not bland. Decor is not over done but comfortable. I'd recommend people try this place for themselves. I like the vegetarian myself.
5/22/2017,5 star rating,"Wow, I felt like I was back in Japan while I was dining at this place. Service was very nice, foods were really really delicious, and the ambience was simple, clean, & modern. Their tacos were really amazing and so were ramen and Unagi.Only minor complaint would be getting a curry udon instead of a tori udon. Make sure you clearly pronounce which one you are ordering since those two kinda sound alike :)"
10/7/2018,5 star rating,My noodle lovers in the family thought it was awesome. They have been everywhere. Very fresh. Excellent broth.  I had a rice dish that was very good as well. Pretty casual and small. Essentially long tables.
8/27/2018,4 star rating,"My friend and I came here yesterday to catch up. The ambiance is relaxed, which I appreciated because it was hot. Service was good and the food was really good. For the appetizer, we got the edamame (delicious!). For the entrees I chose the spicy pork udon and my friend the yaki udon (both really good with decent portions) and my friend got the strawberries and creme desert (she really liked it). Overall, I liked ima. My only complaint was there were flies around. I understand it's summertime and its inevitable (they have a patio), but maybe some insect repellent might deter them and some fly catchers."
2/5/2017,1 star rating,"The dish is poorly prepared, not worth the money. No uniqueness and i couldn't understand others' reviews.. what is so great about this place.  The service was  slow and i had to ask for every single item i needed: straws for water twice, a fork for my son's noodle after she served the noodle and had already left the table. a spoon for a side of soup i ordered, again after it was served and the waitress had left the table.. Anyway that soup, i think it is called forest, i tasted it once and my spoon never returned to that bowl. No depth to the taste. Just oily. Overall the whole experince was no good and i won't be coming back here for sure. By the way. What are they? A Japanese? Of course no."
5/6/2018,5 star rating,"Food was delicious, staff was friendly and helpful, and the eating space was nice. The curry udon is absolutely wonderful, would highly recommend."
8/17/2018,4 star rating,"They are definitely delivering good service and quality food. I had golden curry with tofu and it was delicious. However I wish they really take care the flies issue. Although I would give 10/10 for their food, it wasn't an overall pleasant experience to see that flies are hovering overhead. And that is why I took 1 star off. I wish they keep doing a good job and working on eliminating the flies. I will add back that star my rating if the issue is solved next time I visit."
8/31/2018,5 star rating,"Went here for the 1st time on a sunday night, was pretty packed but we got seated right away. A little too hot in the place to be eating soup. But the food was A+. Flavorful and nothing was bland. I like the tori udon soup and the spicy pork udon soup. They were both really good. I would recommend those two. The edemame was great as well! Very nice twist to the regular edemames. Great job! Owner is very nice too."
9/4/2018,5 star rating,2nd time there because I was so impressed the first time.  This time I had the Fresh Greens & ima tacos with spicy shrimp.  Perfect for lunch.  Light but full of flavor.
3/19/2017,4 star rating,"I'm very excited this place opened up, we need more Asian food options in the city. It is a cozy little spot that was formerly a sandwich shop called Rubbed. The decor at Ima is unmemorable, maybe slightly corporate looking. My friend and I started out with the tacos. They use thinly sliced jicama (kind of like a jumbo sized sweet radish) as the tortilla which was super cool and something I've never seen before. We got them with shrimp but they were also available with tofu. I can't remember what soup I got. The noodles were super yummy. If you've never had udon noodles they are thicker than ramen, maybe the size of a pinky in width, with a kind of soft, chewy pasta-like texture. The meat in my soup didn't look super appetizing so I ate around it. I'm sure it was perfectly fine and safe, I'm just kinda weird about meat so if you are too maybe order your soup without it. To drink I ordered a Topo Chico. I don't remember seeing alcoholic beverages on the menu. Service was super friendly and quick. I will definitely return."
8/25/2018,5 star rating,"Best udon I've had in Michigan, and better than a lot I had in Japan as well. Spicy pork is fantastic, but the forest udon (mushroom udon) is what's really special here. I've never had a mushroom broth this great, not even abroad. The lobster udon is incredible as well, though a bit pricey."
3/18/2018,4 star rating,Nothing special. Very crammed. Had to get a table facing the kitchen like I was in a time out
11/5/2017,4 star rating,"We ended up at Ima after stopping by two other restaurants that had waits over 2 hours long.  Luckily, we only had to wait at Ima for about 20 minutes before being seated at the perimeter bar; our spot looked out the window.  The rest of the seating was communal.  Ima is a tiny space, with everyone scrunched together like a NYC restaurant.  But the food had BIG flavors.  We started with the dumplings, which were excellent.  I kept the dipping sauce for my dinner, just in case, because it was that good.  I ordered the spicy udon, and my husband ordered a curry dish.  I was able to substitute the pork for chicken, and the meats in both of our dishes seemed to have been roasted and shaved.  Both dishes had banging flavors: mine more spicy udon flavored and his more ginger curry flavored. The soups were topped with perfectly cooked eggs, veggies, and lots of yummy noodles.  It was the perfect meal for a cold, rainy date night.  Plus, the service was good for how busy it was at 6 pm dinner time."
3/7/2018,5 star rating,I love the dumplings and the forest udon they are perfect.  The staff is always nice.  If it's the weekend you will be waiting for awhile.  I do carry out often.
4/14/2018,5 star rating,"For a modest little udon joint, this place is worth every penny you spend here. The broths are high quality and the prices are reasonable. If you like asian food, particularly soups, this place is worth a try."
2/13/2017,5 star rating,"I'm extremely impressed with Ima! I went there last week with my best friend and we sat at the rail against the wall. They were pretty full and it was only like 6:00p.m. on a Thursday. That's a great sign! Our server was super nice and suggested the boombap bowl ($11) (sans meat for me) and with beef for him ($15) and the ima tacos ($7) and we ordered what she recommended. We started with the ima tacos - jicama shell with wakame slaw, green chili hot sauce, toasted corn and shiso with garlic chicken. They came with two so we each had one. They were fabulous. Light and flavorful.  The food came and it was absolutely delicious! The boombapbowl I had was rice with cucumbers, fried egg, shiitake mushrooms, slaw and came with a side of pepito chili sauce. His was the same but with ginger beef. I almost ate the entire bowl. She was prompt with the check when we were complete and our waters were never empty. I'll definitely be back and probably get the same bowl...because it was that good!Nice job Ima!"
2/10/2017,4 star rating,"Ima. First of all beautiful name, albeit I am not sure if you say it like ""eye-ma"" or ""E-ma"" lol who knows, and I felt like they were too busy for me to ask. This is a tiny spot in corktown but it's situated among a lot of other popular favorite restaurants so that's promising right? I read ""hot new business"", soup noodles, almost all the pleasant reviews so all the more reason to drag someone with me. My husband and I arrived at 7pm. This place is small. Busy. We found two seats near the front glass by the entrance facing the lot but within five mins about four spots cleared up so we settled down in two of those conveniently. This place is modern, wooden benches and be ready to sit by randoms since we americans like our space this place will challenge that. It's a very tight little restaurant, a little concerning when it comes to maneuvering for the waiters but maybe they've got the hang of it.The menus are conveniently waiting at each empty seat so you have it there when you sit down. A girl approached us and greeted us right away, very sweet. We ordered ima tacos $7 for two as the starter then for entrees I ordered the forest udon with hot toasted chili oil $11 + $1 add on. My husband got the unagi-don $14. The tacos were delicious! I felt like they were tiny salad bites. Clean, fresh and extremely light. Not sure what the dressing was but it tasted like olive oil alone, but the greens and the perfectly cooked shrimp a top the thinly sliced jicama as the tortilla. Very pleasant!!!! A little pricey for what they give but would order again!!!My forest udon was fishy to taste as far as the broth goes. The mushrooms were alright, I wasn't too keen on them. The udon was cooked chewy and overall was a yummy vegan choice. The portion was a little small but filling especially after the starter tacos which I split with the hubby. My husband's unagi-don came with a hefty piece of eel. Sweet and grilled just right with greens, mushroom, ginger and rice. He enjoyed his bowl. We finished off the night with some tofu custard $4 each. I got it with mandarin oranges and he opted for mint. These were super tiny bowls. My mandarin oranges were extremely bitter and not skinned, I think it would taste better with peaches or a much softer fruit but the tofu custard was coconutty and a delicious finisher. Love the brown sugarred edges not sure what they were called but they added a lovely texture. Overall my hubby and I enjoyed this spot. I think the udon dish was okay... but the tacos were exquisite. The unagi-don was could supposedly be repeated. I hope they expand in their menu. However a fun experience. Take your friends or a date here for a fun time. The music is very hip and this place is very unique!!! Thank you ima for a wonderful night!!!"
2/9/2017,5 star rating,"Was in town from Indianapolis for a different event and sought this place out.  The jicama spicy shrimp tacos were amazing with a clean fresh taste. The broth in the tori udon was flavorful without being too salty, and the egg was cooked perfectly and added to the overall flavor of the dish.  The vanilla custard dessert is a must and a great way to end the meal. We will definitely return to eat here when we come back to Detroit, or may make the 5 hour drive just for this page.  Either way...this place is well worth the trip! So good..."
2/6/2017,2 star rating,"We were hoping Ima would be a good alternative to Johnny Noodle King but we left underwhelmed.  We both had rice dishes which may have been the problem since they are more known for their noodles dishes, but that being said....we had the golden curry which was OK.  Not bad by any means but at $13 was no bargain for the portion size. We also had the Boombap which was a joke.  Don't expect anything close to a good Korean bibimbap.  The bowl was almost all rice with a fried egg and literally a tablespoon of garlic beef plus some carrots, etc. The sauce had no flavor at $14 for a bowl of rice with very little else is pure theft. The service was very good and I love the concept but in our opinion JNK is still MUCH better."

I ordered the forest udon with an egg and hot chili sauce along with the green goddess salad. The flavor of all the dishes was spot on. This is is the kind of meal I am looking for. The curry was finished in a hurry and forest was fire. Being vegetarian these dishes were not lacking flavor at all. The salad was light and refreshing and the dressing was delicious. We finished off the meal with vanilla tofu custard, mandarin oranges, malt crisps and mint. It was an unusually yet pleasant combo. I will definitely come back."

The dressing was light and creamy with a twist. I tried the curry udon and added shrimp to it. It was a little thicker than I was expecting but the flavors and textures were on point. The egg was cooked perfectly and the noodles were everything! My husband got the forest udon and I must say, we both enjoyed his dish more than the curry bowl. The broth was extremely flavorful and he said the tofu was hands down one of the best he's tried. To top it off, we ordered the vanilla tofu custard with mandarin oranges and mint crisps....phenomenal! It was such a different kind of dessert but so refreshing! And didn't taste like tofu at all! We are already planning to go back next week. Love this place!"
2/5/2017,1 star rating,"The dish is poorly prepared, not worth the money. No uniqueness and i couldn't understand others' reviews.. what is so great about this place.  The service was  slow and i had to ask for every single item i needed: straws for water twice, a fork for my son's noodle after she served the noodle and had already left the table. a spoon for a side of soup i ordered, again after it was served and the waitress had left the table.. Anyway that soup, i think it is called forest, i tasted it once and my spoon never returned to that bowl. No depth to the taste. Just oily. Overall the whole experince was no good and i won't be coming back here for sure. By the way. What are they? A Japanese? Of course no."

The sauces and broth were very flavorful and good.The only negative is that the seating is super crowded and not a lot of room to move around. I would go back, but would go earlier next time to beat the crowds!"

My buddys both got the tori udon. Which is a bone broth soup, it was very rich,and  velvety. Overall a good experience i look forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu"
1/24/2017,5 star rating,"Finally--Awesome udon, I don't have to make the trek out to Ajishin in Novi anymore! My favorite was the shrimp ""taco"" that's wrapped in jicama, the spicy udon, and the curry udon. Their broths have so much depth and flavor without being too salty or too bland. Moreover, finally a place that knows how to boil a perfect egg for udon! I'm not a big fan of having hard boiled eggs that have been cooked to death in my udon or ramen. Keep in mind that Rubbed used to be here so it's a very tiny place, but I like that. Communal tables, so get ready to get up close and personal with others. Check this place out, I'm definitely coming back for seconds :) Cheers!"
3/13/2018,5 star rating,"Ima is one of my favorite weekday jaunts. It's a smaller setting than most places so planning to go on slower days is best. Service is amazing and so very friendly! I love their house sake served warm, and opt for smaller plates, like the house pickled veg, rice, and edamame, to create my own rice bowl. Or go for the curry noodles or curry and rice. This chef has a great flare for vegetarian items which I believe creates a better use of flavor and spice throughout all of their dishes. I would consider this comfort food in my mind. Imagine a tiny Asian place with fogged up windows on a cold winter night, with a great cup of hot tea/sake."

9/5/2017,5 star rating,"One of the city's shining new stars in its fast-growing culinary scene. The atmosphere is fun, relaxed, and casual and the food and service are always top-notch! Wait staff are very helpful and prompt - even when the place is packed. Waits are never more than a few minutes, even on the weekends. Everything on the menu is tasty, but my favorites are the smoked salmon with brown rice, curry udon with shrimp, and tacos with shrimp and avocado added. The edamame is very unique and the seasoning to die for! Definitely recommend rounding the meal off with the strawberries and house-made vanilla tofu custard for dessert. TRY THIS PLACE OUT. Even if you think it is not your ""cup of soup,"" I promise, you will be pleasantly surprised."

12/16/2017,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Corktown. The food is out of this world and it's super reasonably priced. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely worth the money and the potential wait you might experience because this place fills up so quickly!
8/15/2017,5 star rating,"I've tried the forest, tori, curry, and spicy pork udon. Every one of them is delicious. Perfect even. I prefer ima over other noodle places I have tried. Be sure to start with an edamame appetizer, whatever the seasoning is on there is amazing. The outdoor seating area is very charming and the owner/chef and out and introduced himself the first time I was there; he's a really nice guy."
10/4/2017,3 star rating,"Still not impressed! Had the forest udon the 1st time and wasn't impressed. I found the tofu too firm and the broth too oily. Went back for a second time to try different menu items. This time I got the tofu tacos & curry. The tofu tacos were bomb! And if I ever go back to Ima, I will ONLY come for the tacos. However, The curry had a mix of flavors that didn't work together. Firstly, the curry was the texture of a gravy, not a curry. Secondly, Japanese & Korean curry tastes different from Indian curry. With a restaurant name like Ima, which means ""now"" in Japanese, I assume they were going for the Japanese take on this dish but they failed. This tasted like Indian curry. The rice was seasoned with some type of seasoning and I think it was an unnecessary flavor addition. Instead of enhancing the flavor, it just made the dish salty. The Chinese broccoli was also an unnecessary addition that didn't enhance the flavor. I love vegetables and I very much enjoy Chinese broccoli...but not in my Japanese curry. Lastly I am very displeased with the waitress who packed my food. The curry comes with pickled ginger on the side of the bowl. I absolutely love pickled ginger, but I eat it alone, like most people. One doesn't normally dip pickled ginger in something or stuff it between something like it was made for a sandwich. I think most people eat it alone. Well clearly the waitress has never tried the menu items here or never had pickled ginger, because when she packed my food in a take-out box, she put/mixed everything together. It became a bibimbap with pickled ginger. It was awful! I had to pick the ginger out of my food. Also, there was a weird situation that happened when I first walked in. I walked in 5 seconds behind a White couple. They were serviced with drinks immediately upon sitting down. However, I waited for about 5 minutes before someone from the wait staff even looked at me. I've never had a situation like this before and I'm not one to usually say that race was an issue but I can't think of any other reason as to why none of the 3 waitresses came over to at least pour me a glass of water. It certainly wasn't an issue of them being busy because at that time, there were only the couple that I mentioned and myself seated indoors. And 1 guy seated outside. So a total of 4 customers. All I got was a ""hi"" when I walked in and that's it. They immediately walked over to the couple when they sat down. I was seated right behind them. Once the waitress was done taking the couple's drink orders, they went back towards the register. And they never came over to me until I called them over. They just stood around the register or kept going back to the couple. It was really bizarre. I already knew what I wanted to order before I even walked in the door, therefore I was ready to order the moment I sat down. Of course, I don't expect them to automatically know that. But I do expect them to at least offer me water, which they didn't. I had to ask for that."
9/29/2017,3 star rating,"I was sold on the idea of this place but haven't been sold on the food yet. I ordered the forest udon, which is their vegan udon. I didn't quite like the taste of the broth but I think that's simply an issue of my own palate. However, the broth was also extremely oily. This was not something that only my palate was sensitive to. My friend also noted the same thing. I also didn't like the way the tofu was prepared. Every time tofu is presented in a dish in the US, it seems to me like they try to make the texture similar to meat. I stopped eating meat because I genuinely dislike the taste of meat. So I don't want tofu to emulate that. I also lived in korea for 2 years and I'm very much accustomed to eating soft tofu soups. I think maybe many Americans would have an issue with tofu as a soft texture except when used for making vegan desserts but how will they ever get used to it if it's always presented in a very firm texture? Anyway I am very thankful that they offer vegan friendly noodle soup dishes. And I'm looking forward to going back and trying their curry, tacos & ice cream dessert."
