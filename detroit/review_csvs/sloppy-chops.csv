4/23/2022,3 star rating,"My husband and I visited 4/22/22 based on a recommendation. We called in for reservations and were easily accommodated, though the reservations really weren't needed at 3pm as there was less than 20 patrons upon our arrival. We were greeted and seated quickly and our server was really sweet. She was attentive and We appreciated it. Our appetizer of fried shrimp was okay. I like home style cornmeal and flour batter etc... but these were like beer battered cod etc but it wasn't bad. My husband had the burger but stated it was not really good, he's not one to complain much or waste so he ate it anyway lol. I had the chicken Alfredo Cajun style and it was good. As a suggestion, I think they should serve a garlic toast or knot with that particular entree. Overall, we had a good  time there for an early dinner. The ambiance and decor were cool, I'd assume it's a jumping spot on evenings and weekends. Last but not least cheers to the bartender who made a darn great top shelf Long Island!"
3/21/2022,2 star rating,"The curb appeal is lovely. The website offered Doordash direct. I used their website ordered and paid for my food. Drove to the location in route to work where I was told ""we don't do doordash, our doordash is down"" when I showed proff of payment I was told to request a refund because ""we out of turkey chops anyway."" Mind you I am headed to a 12 hour shift and I planned on having this meal for lunch. But the worse thing is that the man speaking to me was rude and borderline angry he offered no solution other than get my money refunded. No, anything else I could get you. Is there something else on the menu we could prepare...nothing. SAD."
3/6/2022,2 star rating,"Well, there's a lot to be desired but not fulfilled here. We anticipated and had high hopes. They went unfulfilled. We ordered 2 16oz Ribeyes that contained a good 4-5oz fat/gristle. They were not charred-grilled; they were flattop griddled with tomatoes on top. What?! No grilled onions. No mushrooms. Just very unsatisfactory at a whopping $55 a piece. No sides with the steak. Everything was all carte. So we ordered sautéed broccoli. So blahzé and luke- warm. We ordered garlic parmesan fries. We sent them back to be redone because they were over cooked. The waiter said, they would come out the same because of the grease. We had them taken off the bill. The Sloppy potatoes were just, blah. They were supposed to be topped with cheese, onions and peppers, but everything was underneath the potatoes. The whipped butter didn't even melt on them because they were cold. The reason they got two stars was because M-Dot tried to make it right by giving us a discount and a free drink. I appreciate that. Service was slow because the hostess was waiting tables. There weren't enough wait staff. I forgot that reservations were required but they use a service that never confirmed our reservation. My husband slipped M-Dot a $20 to get us seated, even though there were empty tables. ‍ Unbelievable, but true. Save your money and eat at home."
2/25/2022,1 star rating,"I should have read Yelp reviews before we committed! Quick review: Over-priced, poor drinks, sloppy dishes- and not in a good way, not clean behind the bar. Detailed Review: We went in on a Sunday evening as a party of 3. We sat at the bar. The decor seemed nice enough but there were enough red flags before we even ordered that should have made us walk right back out the door but I was determined to support this neighborhood business. There were wait stations in full view that were junky and unkempt and sitting at the bar, there was a sour smell that lead us to believe they were not cleaning behind the bar well. The bartender took our drink orders. Two of us ordered a Sloppy Old Fashion, which was featured on their drink specials menu. We received two bottom-shelf apple martinis. The bartender was so nice, I didn't have the heart to tell her. Nevertheless, those poor drinks were $12 a piece. My best friend opted for water after our disappointing round. Our second round of drinks were just as bad; a glass of vinegary tasting wine and a bottle of skunky Michelob Ultra. For dinner, we ordered lamb chops. My fiancé and I split an order and my BFF ordered her own. We ordered our chops medium; they came back well. Dinner tasted ok but I could have done better myself. The bill came and I almost fell off the stool! $170 which included a $26 tip...for a party of 3...at the bar! We won't be back and Sloppy Crab is off the table as well."

1/30/2022,4 star rating,"Food delicious,  drinks okay,  wait for food loonnnggggg, people cool,  wait staff and manager really nice and personable"
1/20/2022,3 star rating,"This is a hidden gem. It is best to make a reservation in advance because the place was packed when we went. The ambiance is great they have an open kitchen you can see the food being made while h I love. The macaroni and cheese earned the title ""best mac n cheese."" It was delicious and the price wasn't bad at all. To be honest if I'm in the mood for food I would order just the mac n cheese and some drinks. The filet was over cooked so I wasn't impressed with it at all. I like my steak medium so to me it was like eating tough rubber. The seasoning wasn't impressive either. I did enjoy the surf n turf pasta. Just the pasta part though. Again the meat was g impressive. We ordered a bottle of wine and a few drinks. I did enjoy the patron margarita. I think I would give this spot another shot. I hope the cooks were having an off day because other than the steak not being good the rest was great."
1/12/2022,2 star rating,"I went twice. 1st time was cool but the 2nd time was super awful. Very disappointed that my experience was terrible from the hostess, food, not cheap, etc. Took over an hour to get food & part of our order was cold. Had to wait another 40 minutes. I always support these type of businesses, but im not going back."
1/8/2022,2 star rating,"The restaraunt is cute ,bathroom was pretty and clean but that's it! No heat, no customer service unbelievable. The waitress (Betheny) waited a party of 12 ppl by herself, no help from other employees not even the lady who said she was the manager of the restaraunt. I never been to an establishment where the manager did not pitch in to help . The air blowed the entire time and then one emoloyee started twerking he also said he was the manager, wow! We arrived here at 8pm with reservations and its 10p no food yet and they close at 10p. However, the rest of the staff ate their food and had drinks at the bar while we continued to wait for our food,  Make this make sense! I really wanted to rate this place higher to support Black owned business but I couldnt. Black business owners we have to do better. I don't care who own a business but customer service is ESSENTIAL! I guess customer service doesn't matter at this place because they automatically get 18% gratuity off every bill no matter the party size. Maybe we came on wrong day but it wasnt busy when we arrived."
12/7/2021,5 star rating,Let me first say I suck for not taking a pic of the food but hopefully others will come through. I couldn't let my picture skills or lack thereof prevent me from leaving a POSITIVE review of this establishment. Great adult beverages at a reasonable price. Friendly people and great service. Clean! Nice ambience and lighting. No super loud music where you needed or yell over one another. Open view of the kitchen...cause they know y'all funny actin and wanna see what's happening behind the curtain. And last but not least the food was really really good! Mac and cheese tastes like HOME! So nice to be able to support an establishment in the community that is clearly showing pride in their vision and showcasing their craft. Cannot wait to come go back!
8/17/2021,4 star rating,"Amazing!!!!!!!! I came to visit Detroit and this was one of the places I saw on the news that interest me. The food looked good and it was an area of town that I would not normally visit. When I called prior to arrival I was told a reservation was not needed so that made me feel good. We got there at around 630pm.  They close at 9 pm to be aware of the time.  The downfall is they are located on a corner and there is no actual parking lot so you will need to park on the street.  When we walked in we were seated in like ten minutes which was great. I was hungry so getting seated was important. Lol when seated it took over ten minutes fir someone to greet me but I'm hungry and patient. I looked at the menu prior so I knew I had to try the lamb chops.  What the waitress didn't say was that the lamp chops come with a small portion of mashed potatoes under it.  There is NO need to order another alacarte side of mashed potatoes. (FYI). Be ready to spend because everything is alacarte with an automatic gratuity included.   My friend ordered the pork chops and honey.......Amazing!!!!!!  The sweet potatoe casserole was good I don't think I liked the Mac and cheese.  I didn't drink this time cause I was so hungry but the drink combinations looked worth trying. Overall when I visit again I plan to come back and try something different. Service was good, food was amazing just just the parking could be an issue if a very busy day.  Give it a try it's wS worth the hype."
10/16/2021,5 star rating,Bethany and the General manager made you feel very comfortable and I felt welcomed! It was my birthday they provided me with this rich cheesecake it was soooo good! When in town I'll be back!!

6/11/2021,4 star rating,Flew in to Detroit from Philly to dine in at the Sloppy Chops restaurant for dinner. I enjoyed the food however the waitress was forgetful about things which probably due to her having multiple tables to service. The food was good. I had the Veggie Spring rolls for an appetizer which was VERY good. For my entree I had the Blackened Salmon Pasta. I loved the Black owned Establishment. I would dine here again

9/7/2020,1 star rating,"Disgusting and overhyped. I can't trust you if you fuck up alfredo. The chefs clearly don't give a fuck about what they put out.Extremely bland, took one bite and trashed it.The sauce is definitely not from scratch and as a Chef, I was PISSED."

4/27/2021,5 star rating,"I really enjoyed my visit at this restaurant. Everything was perfect  ; the service, food, and drinks were excellent. Even the bathroom was clean and modern. I would highly recommend this place. It feels great to get a great meal without driving out the city."
10/24/2021,2 star rating,The menu is alocart I'm not a fan of the options there was a long wait time and there is no order there I'm not sure who is in charge then the police came while I was there it was a uncomfortable environment for me
9/5/2021,3 star rating,"The strawberry cheesecake was AMAZING! I don't eat cheesecake, I wanted Seconds! I have been plotting and planning to visit this establishment since I came across it on Facebook a year or so ago. Went last Sunday. Made Reservations, arrived on time. Just Excited....... Only to leave Disappointed.  $55 for lamb chops Kool okay but naw chewy, burnt. I was holding my lamb chop and due to the bone being cooked more then the meat it broke right out my hand. The macaroni and cheese. I need who ever is cooking this to just STOP! I can come and teach on how to make a great Mac ! Green beans fresh but no flavor , I think they were supposed to have garlic butter but Nope. SweetMash potatoes was Stringy ! Like come ON. I also got the Salmon Cooked perfectly YET no SEASONING!! If the pineapple wasn't on my plate , there wouldn't have been any flavor. Customer service was good, manager was great.  I will try it again Only because , it could have been a bad night . Shit happens. But I've had better lamb chops from home cooks that sell dinners out the kitchen."
3/13/2021,2 star rating,I got a pasta from there. It was flavorful but the whipping cream could've been whipped a little better. It was VERY thick! Other than that it was ok. It was brought to me so I can't tell you if it was worth the $ but I wouldn't pay over $12-$15 for it.
9/8/2021,4 star rating,"Fine dining in the ""hood"" and the presentation is nice. No parking lot. You can park on 6 mile or the side street. Twin lobster tower looked amazing. The asparagus was great. It had a nice Parmesan sauce and wasn't over cooked. Lamb chops were delicious. And served on top of mashed potatoes. The smothered potatoes were the only dish that I can complain about. The drinks from the bar were good. The strawberry Hennessy was really good."
6/2/2020,1 star rating,"I hate to leave reviews for small neighborhood businesses when they aren't favorable. However, I feel that Yelp is excellent for helping consumers choose where to spend their hard-earned dollars, so I'll continue on.I wanted to like the place, it's curb appeal is kind of cute. The interior decor is nice.The concept seemed a little odd to me. I don't understand the use of the word ""sloppy"" for a restaurant. Nevertheless, I was aware that it was a small independent neighborhood business so I took a chance.The phone order went well. The woman taking my order suggested dessert. The strawberry crunch cheesecake sounded like a great idea, so I added it on to my order of shrimp Alfredo. I was a bit shocked to learn that the dessert was $10. For a neighborhood restaurant, the menu and price points seem off to me. Dining here is rather expensive.I noticed that they have cowboy ribeyes and surf & turf on the menu. Just seems out of place for a corner in the neighborhood. I would rather dine on such fare at an upscale establishment. But to each their own.I live very close so I waited in my car for quite a while before going in. The flow of traffic in this corona environment concerned me. There were tons of people in and out. Some carrying food, some not. The corner became a little reckless at a point with people whipping their cars around the crowded corner. There definitely isn't enough parking for the steady flow of people. There is no parking lot.I finally went in to retrieve my order and was greeted after standing there for almost ten minutes. There were no waiting customers, however, the lady was taking a phone order and conversing with other staff. When she looked for my order, it wasn't ready. There was a table with bags of food stacked fairly high awaiting customer pick-up. Hopefully, as the restaurant matures, so will the timing.My order of Alfredo though tasty, wasn't what I expected. The shrimp were overcooked and the sauce was thin and runny. The cheesecake was good, but certainly nothing that I need to have again.Sloppy Chops is definitely a ""no"" for me."
9/25/2021,5 star rating,Kim was so nice! Very attentive and friendly. I will be back to see her at the bar. My drinks were good and the food was even better.
10/3/2021,4 star rating,My bestie and I had dinner at Sloppy Chops. The food was delicious and well seasoned as expected. This was my second time dinning there. Bethany was a gracious waitress and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  I recommend eating at the restaurant.  Forewarning there is an eighteen percent gratuity automatically added to your bill. Just fyi.
2/23/2020,4 star rating,"So I got the opportunity to visit this restaurant with five friends for their soft opening and we were all excited about trying their menu because we are familiar with the chef. This soon to be fully open restaurant is on the westside of Detroit in an area that could use more businesses like this. The only downside is that there is no parking lot so parking is at a minimum but this night they did offer valet but I'm not sure if will be available once they officially open.The inside is nice and completely renovated with seating at tables, a few booths and a bar area but on this night the owners had not yet secured their liquor license so we were offered complimentary wine. That would have been ok if the waitress had known more than that they had some reds and some whites and if the wine was served in wine glasses and not juice glasses. I know it is hard to secure good qualified wait staff, especially in smaller places such as this but our waitress could definitely use some more customer service skills. After reviewing the menu which everything looks worth trying, we tried the Stuffed Salmon, the Surf and Turf, the Sloppy Chops(lamb), the Steak Bites, the mac and cheese and the Mosticiolli. All entrees are served a la carte.  All of our dishes were very good and well portions, the only thing was the waitress brought out our items one at a time and some of us was eating while others had to wait. I was half way through my dish by the time my baked potato came out. I would strongly suggest they work on improving the kitchen flow. I think this restaurant could be successful in this area despite some of the minor issues. I doubt if I would go back but I suggest others to give them a try if just to show community support and offer feedback.Also, while there on of the owners did come to our table and asked how our dining experience was so we were able to voice our concerns and give positive feedback as well. I only gave it four stars because the food was delicious."
11/24/2020,4 star rating,"I ordered the catfish fillets, it came with fries. I was impressed and satisfied with my order. My cop workers love this spot and always praise their orders. The Mac and cheese was good as well, better than I expected! If you don't mind the ordering and carry out process give them a try!"
10/1/2021,1 star rating,Food and drinks  were overpriced and not worth the money! Everyone was new and didn't know what the hell was going on!
10/9/2020,2 star rating,"it was not good at all, please hire a new chef. food had to get cooked twice, before taking it home. 1st off food came to me like they had my steak bites in the refrigerator before serving me. firer your manager & chef, small world my mother knows the owner, and called him about this mess. round 2 when i go back might be a better review than the 1st one. sofrom tha brotherz podcast show two thumbs ."
10/1/2020,2 star rating,"This place just fucked up my order, But the place looks great inside, Great inside. I hoping the food was good, cause I was refer by someone else.But the Chef needs to be fired, culinary Arts certification needs to be thrown away in the trash can. My order was $87.00 to come home to a cold meal. Just so happens the owner was in the building and said he would tell the dumb as chef to remake my whole order. IF THIS MEAL TURNS OUT TO BE GREAT, I WILL LEAVE ANOTHER REVIEW ON HERE.So This is a 5 star restaurant, with a 2 star chef from the county or dickerson correctional facility.So when do go ask for another chef."
11/27/2020,5 star rating,I'm so glad to have found this gem! The hostesses are always so nice and professional and the rest of the staff is also top notch! Highest of Compliments to the chef! Food will knock your socks off and is even very tasty when you take it to go! Doesn't matter what you get it's all delicious!!! I'm more than excited about the new Sloppy Crab that's opening!-Court
7/3/2020,5 star rating,"Let's start with the customer services (10Stars)! I called the order in & the lady who took the order was super pleasant. She repeated the order back and said someone will call when it was ready in about 45-1 hour. Someone called around 20 mins later saying the food was ready. Upon arrival the food was in fact ready, I paid and left. Got home, like 15 mins later & the food was still hot. Ordered the shrimp & lobster pasta, strawberry shortcake cheesecake & stuffed salmon. Everything was delicious!"
9/4/2021,3 star rating,"Decent food. Good staff. Would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the ""mandatory gratuity they hit you with upon paying. Me & my wife (2 people), was charged $50 for gratuity. Main dish are the chops, which they have no price on the menu anymore, which is going to run you around $55-65 bucks for 5-6 lollipop chops, sides will run about $40 + each. Charging high end prices for mediocre obeisance.$20 for a mediocre Long Island. Too many surrounding restaurants with better quality for less."
4/19/2021,1 star rating,"I was disappointed by the food. I ordered my lamb chops medium well and they were cold, well done, and dried out. The asparagus that my friend ordered were the smallest stalks I have ever seen in my life and were priced at $7. Oh, and the lemonade that I ordered was warm. For my bill to be almost $100 and the food wasn't even half decent is so disappointing.  Save your money."

5/16/2021,2 star rating,"The restaurant opened at 2pm but we had to wait for someone to open the business Then we had to wait 20 minutes for a waitress to arrive because she was running late to work, although there was a hostess and 2 bartenders we still had to wait for this late waitress to arrive for us to be served at a table. The wait in between drinks, food, dessert and the bill took so long it was VERY unprofessional and was frowned upon on how the business is ran. However, our waitress was amazing and very friendly even though she was late, I understand COVID has caused a lot of inconvenience to businesses and staff is short handed BUT as a business man/woman you should be there too to help the people that's trying to keep your business a float. Oh, to top it off the restaurant don't allow split bills, for a group of 6 it was very annoying breaking down our bills. The food is absolutely good but the service isn't worth going back if you dine-in."
6/9/2021,1 star rating,The worst restaurant I have been to in a long time. 90 degrees outside and no air conditioning plus I had to wait a hour for food while sweating..  When the food got to my table I couldn't enjoy it because I was hot as hell.. Please get your stuff together
7/13/2021,4 star rating,Had a really great time at Sloopy Chops. Service was great our server  Latonya was awesome. In fact  all the staff was very welcoming.  The food was delicious I had the shrimp Alfredo  with a side order of broccoli.   Large portions of food. Dessert was the apple caramel cake also delicious.
5/2/2020,1 star rating,"I pick up carryout, cowboy ribeye bone in, it was dry and I was give a cheap meat cut with no bone in the steak was $35.00 dry out and dry I order it medium well.  I place a call back to restaurant I was told they had updated the menu without updating the online menu.  I should have went to J Alexander.  I know better next time trying to support small business. I will never recommend this restaurant."
8/7/2020,4 star rating,"This was my first time and I ordered the vegetable egg rolls and strawberry shortcake cheesecake...I wished the dessert had more cheesecake instead of strawberry shortcake, but I was kinda looking for a few fresh strawberries on the puff."
5/2/2020,5 star rating,"I've been to the restaurant once so far, but the food was excellent. I will definitely be coming here to eat. The employees are very nice. I can't wait for them to open back up, so I can get the full experience of dining inside and not just takeout. Safety first."
5/19/2021,1 star rating,"Went there for my friends birthday and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. They ran out of many items on the menu, our food took forever to get to the table, and when it got there, multiple things were wrong. The food was extremely greasy, and  the $30 lobster and shrimp mac I ordered only came with 3 skippy pieces of shrimp and the lobster was over cooked to the point it was burnt.  Our server was horrible and took at least 30 minutes to get the simplest things such as boxes. In addition, we had got attitude from not only the waiter, but the lady cashing us out about splitting the bill even though we saw the bill being split at other tables. When we finally were able to leave, after waiting for our bill for another 30 minutes, the security guard made some inappropriate comments to one of my friends. I honestly had high hopes for this restaurant but was sadly let down. I will not be returning."
5/14/2020,2 star rating,"Customer service was great.  Wait time took 2hrs but I understood it was mother's day weekend.   I order 95 dollar of food and the only thing that was good was the lobster tacos.  Beside the tacos I order side salad and two lobster and shrimp pastas.  The dishes had a burnt taste to them.  I came back up there.  The owner replaced them with no problems.  Which I appreciated.  I  got home and one of the meals was just okay and the other meal had the same burnt taste and smell to it.  So disappointed.  Unable to call and speak to anyone because phone lines are busy.  Side note, All the bread was burnt on one side (charcoal burnt).  I am not looking for a refund or food replacement.  Just disappointed with the food especially when you waited was for 2 hours and the money spent.   Staff customer service excellent.   Wish the food matched that"
5/10/2020,5 star rating,"This experience could have turned me away forever but management handled the problem. Preordered and paid for Mother's Day only to get there and they had run out of everything on our order. They made sure we left with food to eat, a refund and offer to return for our original order on the house. The food, though not what we ordered, was excellent. Can't wait to taste what we ordered and already planning to return for Father's Day, if not before. Also anxious to try dining in when the time is right. A gem in our neighborhood. Thanks to the staff and management. - my mom using my Yelp account LOL but yes the food not only looks but IS AMAZING!"
5/28/2020,4 star rating,So I must say that the food here is really good... and it started it to be pretty reasonable to dine here however I first went here on 5/1/20 then 5/7/20 then again 5/27/20 .... so that lets you know the food is really good... but from the last two visits the meal that I was buying went from 24 bucks to 30 ... now listen I get it's a pandemic and all that good stuff and I even get raising ur price a buck or 2 but 6 in a matter of weeks is totally astronomical..... to me I'm just trying to figure out why???? Why the sudden and drastic price change.... not sure if they were doing a test run with prices or what but that was crazy ... to go from feeding three people for 70 something bucks to 95 .... UNBELIEVABLE !!!!
7/30/2020,5 star rating,"I tried to call but the phone lines were busy, so I decided to just go and place my order in person. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I ordered sloppy (lamb) chops, chicken & shrimp alfredo (classic), lobster tacos, and of course the strawberry crunch cheesecake. I gave my phone number and they said they would call me when my order was ready. I sat in my car and waited. It about 15 minutes for my order to be ready. Everything I ordered taste delicious! The portions are generous and very filling. My husband and I ate on that food for two days. I can't say enough great things about the entire experience. We will be back!"
