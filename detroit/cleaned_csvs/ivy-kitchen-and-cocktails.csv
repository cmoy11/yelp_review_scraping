1/14/2020,20200114,5,5.0,Just enjoyed my first experience at Ivy. I have been waiting to try it for a few weeks here since noticing the development while walking by as I live 2 blocks away. Ordered the Ivy burger with an Atwater Dirty Blonde. My beer came within 2 minutes and my burger arrived in 5 minutes. The burger was perfectly cooked and was delicious. This area has needed a spot like this and I will definitely return soon!
1/20/2020,20200120,5,5.0,My second trip to Ivy Kitchen. The food is good and the service is great. They are still new and tweaking things but everyone is so hospitable that's you don't mind  I will be back
1/20/2020,20200120,5,5.0,"Truly enjoyed the grand opening this past Friday. The atmosphere was lively and fun. There was a mixture of people; all kinds of flavors. The buffalo cauliflower is a must try as are the wings. Absolutely loved the kale Caesar salad. I added shrimp to mine. The owner was a perfect hostess mixing & mingling with guests. The female DJ was spinning the hits and setting the mood. If there's anything that I'd d like to see done differently is the parking. That's a ""Detroit issue"". I wish them well and hope that they flourish it's a rough business to sustain. I did I mention I loved the Rusty Screw with Don Julio."
1/26/2020,20200126,5,5.0,"A cute hole in the wall. Please do yourself a favor and try the chicken wings, they are very delicious. They were saucy, a little crispy skin, and flavorful. I couldn't stop eating them. Ialso had the the blueberry rosemary mocktail tHat I added vodka to, and it was AMAZING! I definitely suggest for a happy hour or late nite eats."
1/31/2020,20200131,5,5.0,"Nice atmosphere, nice food, everything was good. It has a very different menu and the ambiance is very cool."
2/2/2020,20200202,4,4.83,"Great good with healthy options. Fun atmosphere. Interesting flavors. Bar area. Also offers brunch on Saturday and Sunday with chicken and waffles, salmon and eggs, & avocado toast."
2/2/2020,20200202,5,4.86,Amazing. Loved the food. Loved the service. Had a great selection of vegetarian options. Cocktails were also great!! Interior was comfortable. A hair on the sparse side. Needs a little warmth and personality. But I'm sure that will come with time. We were there on like its first day. We will be back.
2/9/2020,20200209,1,4.38,"We visited Ivy Kitchen with a group of six on a recent Saturday night. We had made reservations on a google site but there was somehow a mixup and the staff did not receive it. They were kind enough to seat us anyway, which we appreciated. I ordered a bottle of La Crema Chardonnay and was surprised when our server brought out a different brand of Chardonnay that I'd never heard of. The server presented the wine and I said that's not what I ordered. She said ""We're out of that one"" and impatiently asked if I wanted to try it. *A properly trained server would have informed me they were out of what I'd ordered and given me an opportunity to choose something else. We drank the new wine, it was fine and I didn't want to complain. We ordered the wings and buffalo cauliflower as appetizers. The wings were good but the cauliflower was average, I would not recommend. I noticed after we'd eaten appetizers that our server had neglected to put our wine on ice. I asked her for a cooler and she said they didn't have any! What kind of restaurant that serves wine doesn't provide something to keep it chilled??? Next we ordered entrees. My husband got the burger, he liked it. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was meh. Max & Ermas buffalo chicken is far better. Our fries arrived cold. And the person in our party that ordered the salmon did not receive his food until the five of us had finished ours. He asked if they would adjust the bill. *Instead of taking cost of salmon off our bill they charged us half price. We really wanted to love Ivy Kitchen but sadly we would not recommend nor return. They are clueless regarding basic customer service."
2/10/2020,20200210,5,4.44,"IVY KITCHEN & CocktailsWell it pains me to write a review on this fine establishment. This is the type of place I grew up in and on in the city of Detroit long ago . It's intimate and comfortable and off the beaten path . Not the new normal . I love IVY KITCHEN and wanna keep it all to myself but that's probably bad for buisness so if youwant something something different and outside of Downtown, check them out ."
2/14/2020,20200214,3,4.3,So it's my first time here! As I'm walking up the lights on the front were all wrong. Fluorescent lights send the wrong vibe... could have been really sexy. We were directed to a two top that was by the window but it was directly under the outdoor fluorescent lights from the outside../moved to the bar to air and it was way too bright! That could have also been sexy... and if that wasn't enough the light from the kitchen was the first thing you saw walking in! 1st recommendation.....dimmer!.So that's my initial impression Appetizer of grilled carrots was really good!So dinner was the short rib stroganoff. It was good not hot....but still good... on a black plate which is never good because it shows every wipe on the plate... it was tasty. Short ribs were really good!Ok next we're sitting at the bar looking for a bartender....!?! So apparently he left!! The food was good...pasta in the stroganoff was cold but otherwise it was good.The service was good and everyone was friendly but things went a bit awry when the bartender dipped out! The bill came and it was a little bit of sticker shock compared to the caliber of the restaurant. The drinkers were way to expensive for what you getSo overall 1-10.... 6. There's room for improvement!The place has great potential...
2/14/2020,20200214,4,4.27,The first time here I think the place is very nicely laid out very elegant beautiful bar so far the service is great. Please dim the lights on the outside and inside. We sat at the bar and Brandon was our server. Where did Brandon go he never returned. A little pricey..drinks $$$$.. I'm going to support local.
2/25/2020,20200225,3,4.17,"It was a cool interior and the food was good. But extremely overpriced. We had 4 drinks and 4 entrees and dinner was $211 without tip. If we had the same food, and dinner was half the price, I work have been impressed. So good food, but extremely overpriced."

2/29/2020,20200229,4,4.07,"Another gem in the city . I've been here weekly since they have opened , I like the wings and the burger ..... we'll everything on the menu . The staff is friendly and I highly recommend you try Ivy Kitchen & cocktails"
3/1/2020,20200301,2,3.93,I had high hopes for Ivy and sadly it was not what I expected. The food was good but the menu was limited. The drink menu wasn't amazing and it took 3 people to make one drink. It wasn't busy thank god but I can't imagine how much longer drinks would have taken. We ordered the same drinks over and over and every time they came back different. Wouldn't go there again.

3/2/2020,20200302,2,3.71,"Came here for brunch with some friends. Immediately I knew we would be forgotten about because it took 10 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us with some water (and he only gave us two glasses, there were four of us). Took even longer to bring the other waters, at which point we decided to order drinks and food because we didn't want it to take too long. After a very long time, another server came up to us and asked us if we needed something to drink/menus, which obviously meant they forgot about us.The restaurant was not busy and our food took just under an hour to arrive - which was made a little better by the serving ordering us a free round of mimosas. However, everybody's food came except for mine, and when the server finally came by to check on us, all of my friends were almost done eating and he actually had to ask me if I had ordered anything. My food, by the way, was a smoked salmon and egg dish, which consisted of a pile of smoked salmon, 2 eggs over easy, capers, and cilantro. No garnish, no toast, no sides. It was $22. That is absolutely astronomical for brunch, and I had to pay an extra $4 for toast which I asked for when I ordered and did not come with my already ordered meal. My friend got chicken and waffles and asked for syrup, which never came. My other friends both got avocado toast with no problem. I know this place is new and there are always new kinks to work out. The staff was very friendly and we appreciated the gesture of the free mimosas for our troubles. I know that they work hard and I was pleasure with their service (when we were actually being serviced). But I can't forgive the absurd wait times, forgetting my order entirely, and charging me $22 for a pile of smoked salmon. I hope they work it out soon, I would love to see them thrive. For now, though, they need some work."
3/4/2020,20200304,5,3.78,"Y'all...the food here is so good. Unfortunately the service wasn't great. I came in a party of 4 for brunch on a Saturday and there was a huge group there celebrating a birthday, so the staff was struggling to keep up with all tables. Everything we ordered came out slow, even the drinks. At the end of our meal, even our bill took forever to come and I ended up having to take it back up to the bar myself because it didn't seem anyone was coming back for our payment. Despite all this, I'm giving 5 stars because I understand it was a tough situation, the owner came to us at the end of our meal to apologize and ask for feedback (which we gave) and I REALLY appreciated that, AND the food was BOMB.We got shrimp and grits which is quite possibly the best shrimp and grits I've had. It was creamy, not too salty, not too cheesy..PERFECT. I could have eaten two bowls. We also got chicken and waffles and that was also quite possibly the best chicken and waffles I've had, in part because of the buttery syrup that comes on the side. The chicken was crispy, the waffle was a good quality waffle which I always appreciate. I'm definitely going back soon because everything was so delicious! Even with the slow service I still recommend this place."

3/7/2020,20200307,3,3.8,"I had high hopes and was very excited to try this new spot. I left under whelmed. I passed the restaurant; i would have chosen a brighter/larger sign. My girl almost passed it also. It was hard to see. We ordered drinks. She had pineapple and vodka, I ordered the blueberry mock tail but turned it into a cocktail by adding vodka. She enjoyed her drink, mine was overly sweet and no trace of alcohol. She ordered the chicken sandwich and Parmesan fries. I ordered the wings and buffalo cauliflower. She said her sandwich and fries were good. My wings were okay; kinda sweet. The buffalo cauliflower was good, nothing special. I like my food hot(heat hot), the food was served room temp at best. We didn't order dessert; the two choices weren't appealing. I don't eat raspberries or pomegranates. Service was good. Oh and they don't have straws. The waitress stayed for environmental reasons. I personally do not like to drink from glasses. Kinda irritated that I was forced to due to no straws. There are other alternatives that the regular plastic ones..."
3/7/2020,20200307,1,3.67,"I am very sad writing this post about a black owned establishment. This was my and my friends' first time eating here tonight. We were so happy and excited to dine together and to see what all the buzz was about with this new restaurant. Unfortunately, this will be our last visit also. We arrived about 9, seated right away but then our server Ashley seemed to forget about us and our orders. The restaurant was not crowded or full. The drinks were good but arrived late. The appetizers were not hot, and the entrees were untimely and some served cold. When I asked Ashley why we were not told an hour and a half later that there were no more parmesan fries, she said very rudely ""that's just what it is,"" and walked away, no apology, no empathy, no offer of an alternative side dish. Basically, we sat for 2.5 hours, watching others who arrived after us, get food before us only to be served over-priced, subpar food with a side of attitude. The manager came to our table after having a sidebar with the waitress and offered 10% off our bills. It was counteracted by the fact that an 18% gratuity was included for a party of less than 6 people. In the end, our dining experience was a huge disappointment and we all agreed we won't be back."
3/7/2020,20200307,1,3.55,"Came here for the first time tonight. Not only was the service impersonal but it was slow, my party and I waited over an hour for our first round of drinks not to mention an order of the cauliflower which WHEN it came out was 5 prices. We also ordered the wings which were bland to say the least. Definitely won't be coming back nor recommending. Do not believe the hype"

3/15/2020,20200315,5,3.48,"Really good food, good service, very cute ambiance and environment. It's a plus that it's black owned!"
4/27/2020,20200427,1,3.38,I might support your carry out menu but I can't find any prices anywhere. If you want support from the community you need to do a better job communicating
10/17/2020,20201017,5,3.44,"From the moment I called and made reservations for Sweetest Day until actually going, the experience has been amazing. I called to schedule a reservation and the new GM was filled with enthusiasm. I was able to get the day and time I wanted and even called back to adjust the time with no problem. The day I went I was greeted as soon as I entered the door and seated immediately. The server was amazing (sorry I forgot his name). The ambiance was everything! I really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back soon. Keep up the great work."
10/18/2020,20201018,2,3.39,"Okay before you go here be sure to make a reservation andddddd preorder your food, because if not you'll be waiting a very very long time like 3 hours for mediocre food. The owner will even come in and ignore the fact that her staff are short and sit with her friends and have a whole conversation with them while her staff is literally struggling to keep up. Not to mention she's just the owner don't even work there. Butttt the mimosas are strong and the General Manager and waitresses are nice, apologetic and work very hard. My friends and I were so excited and had really high hopes for this to be a great brunch experience, it just wasn't. I hope if you decide to go have a better experience!"
10/21/2020,20201021,5,3.45,"I'm so glad this place is back open during covid! The food is so good, and the drinks are even better. The menu is very creative and a great go to spot for dinner. The service is also great and the owner is super friendly, i'll definitely be going back and recommending to friends."
10/26/2020,20201026,3,3.43,"The food was average and extremely over priced. ONE piece of toast is $4. It's not average grocery store bread but it should state that it's only one slice on the menu. The bartender, Lydia is 10/10. I love how they put the shots in these small, super cute wine glasses. Wouldn't go back though. $60 bill and was still hungry."
10/31/2020,20201031,1,3.35,The waitress was sooooo slow not very attentive I got the shrimp and grits food wasn't hot lacked flavor I added salmon that was seasoned good. My mother ordered chicken and waffles the chicken was bland. The owner was there I would think that she would walk around and Introduce her self and asked if everything was ok that never happened. I really wanted to like this place. The food was average nothing special.
11/1/2020,20201101,5,3.41,"Mimosas and French Toast for Brunch!! What's not to LOVE!! The Service, food and drinks were excellent. Our server was prompt and friendly. We enjoyed our meal and will return soon."
11/10/2020,20201110,5,3.45,"One of my best friends and I went here to enjoy one last patio brunch before the cold weather started. From the awesome french toast to the well-seasoned chicken and waffles, brunch was a hit! Not to mention the offered a variety of mimosas! Customer service was excellent! I highly recommend Ivy Kitchen and Cocktails! We will return!"
11/11/2020,20201111,4,3.47,Came here on a busy Friday night. Service was very slow; 45 mins until we received appetizers. Bartender apologized for the wait. Food tasted great once it finally arrived. We ordered the Mezcal Wings and Parmesan fries. I would recommend both.
11/18/2020,20201118,2,3.43,"Service: The staff was very friendly but very slow and confused. They need some more training in operations. There is no drink menu but there was a special on mimosas. But mimosas took 15+min to come out after each order. Also we wanted to buy a bottle of champagne instead of get individual mimosas but they told us the orange juice pitcher would be 20 extra dollars lol. Atmosphere: Aesthetic was great....but the music was on and off throughout the 2.5 hours I was there. And no music at all for the last 45min. Also, music volume was very loud at times and music choice was a little weird.Food: the food was good....but was not worth the 1.5 hour wait for it. Both me and my friend ordered the same dish (chicken and waffles) but they were plated differently. She had a fruit compote and mines did not. I also waited 30 mins for my last mimosa but the waiter comped it because he said he forgot. Overall, i would only come back if the wait staff got some more training and the operations ran much smoother."

1/3/2021,20210103,5,3.43,"I am giving this restaurant 5 . Even with 7 people calling off it was worth the wait. The owner was very accommodating for our time. The food came out AMAZING.....it was hot, fresh and flavorful. I would recommend this restaurant over and over again. I hate being cold but with the heat lamps I didn't feel the frigid Michigan weather"
1/9/2021,20210109,1,3.37,"Reservation was at 7:00 for 3. We didn't get seated until 7:53. Our waitress took our order around 8:05. Food came at 9:02. I know times because I was so annoyed by the almost hour wait to sit. Ok let me say some things. I honestly couldn't believe how things ran. I couldn't. What's driving me insane is during our wait we went to the bar for clarity. Because when we arrived no one really actually greeted us and when they did they weren't clear on telling us they triple booked and we actually had to wait until a party of 10+ was done. Why take so many reservations if you were already booked. Then at the bar when we were trying to get clarity, I kept seeing the lady from the paper (the owner)...But in a very weird way she was trying to act like she had no idea about the restaurant, the accommodations, nothing. She kept telling us to talk to the bartender which the bartender kept telling us that she's the bartender and she doesn't know much about seating etc. why the hell did the OWNER keep throwing things onto the bartender whom was also confused. It was so weird. Ok the food................the Seafood Soup which was priced as $8 on the menu but came $12 on the bill.....was actually the best thing I had so the $4 wasn't really a big deal. Now let me get to what I saved my appetite for all day. The short rib stroganoff...$26. It was horrible. I'd never tasted something so bland. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHORT RIBS HERE. It literally never crossed my mind that a short rib could be so unpleasant because it's never happened before. There was absolutely no flavor. Nothing. And the brown gravy was definitely powdered or canned. And why in the heck was the sour cream sitting on top of it. I couldn't believe it. The salmon and rice dish was also very dissatisfying. The rice was very over cooked and the salmon had skin....burned skin. Never returning."

My girlfriends and I were immediately welcomed, and although they had a full house, we were swiftly accommodated . The hostess and our server,Emily, were phenomenal! Both full of energy and very attentive. The owner Nya was so gracious, and checked on us many times. The 90s R&B Playlist and funky decor took me back to a time of my past. We decided to split many items because everything sounded incredible. We choose the salmon BLT, prime rib, and seafood chowder. Not a crumb left on any plate. After the generous portions we somehow managed to indulge in the chocolate moouse cake...do it..NOW!Thank you Ivy team..we will be back!"

We sampled the lobster stuffed salmon, beef ribs stroganoff, squid ink linguine and the ginger salmon as our main courses. Each sauce was unique and distinguishable from the next. Licking the plate clean was a definite possibility. The proteins were cooked to perfection. Our appetizers, which came a bit out of order (due to getting back in the groove after Covid, I'm sure) were crab cakes- amazing flavor and plate presentation and wonton street tacos-Just perfect. Dessert- we sampled both of the specials- pomegranate cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. Perfectly sweet and tasty and finished off our meal wonderfully. Keep up the good work- we will be back and recommend to our friends and family as a niche spot full of good flavor and service! The staff was perfectly attentive and managing the new ""rush"" courteously and kindly. Emily our server was adorable, attentive and hardworking. Thank you for the evening!"

However, we had no place settings in case we wanted to eat them with a fork. While we did order drinks that were not on the menu, they were, in my opinion, pretty standard for a restaurant that serves brunch. I asked for a Bloody Mary. What I received was some odd concoction of vodka, tomato juice and olive juice. It's a good thing I do really like olives otherwise it would have been quite unpalatable. If the waitress had told me they did not have Bloody Mary mix, I would have gladly ordered something else. My husband ordered Irish coffee, which according to him, was OK. Plus, the drinks did not even arrive until after we finished the fries.Our entrees were incredibly late. It really seemed like all staff members were avoiding our table. Our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes. We weren't even able to flag down anyone else to inquire about our entrees. Finally, our waitress meanders by and notices our empty table. She asked, ""You don't have your food, yet?"" Only then did she go try to find our food. You know it's bad when the table next to you, who was seated after you and had their food, asks where your food is. Bless their hearts, they asked their waitress to help us out. I told them our waitress was already looking into it. At that point, I was pretty exasperated and told my husband that if our food wasn't ready that I wanted to just pay for our drinks and leave. Our waitress returns and assures us, ""The kitchen told me it would be three more minutes."" At that time, she filled our water glasses which had been empty for about 30 minutes.We waited about 10 more minutes and finally had our entrees. Our waitress did offer to get us a drink on her. But, we declined. The food was decent but definitely not worth almost an hour wait. I did ask our waitress if the kitchen had lost our ticket, or what had happened. She explained that another table had ordered the exact same entrees that we had and the kitchen thought it was a duplicate ticket. As we were leaving, the hostess or maybe floor manager told us we'd be taken care of the next time we came in. As far as I'm concerned, there will absolutely not be a next time.I have since read several other reviews of this restaurant and also Ivy's response to those reviews and I want to say that both my husband and myself have worked in the customer service industry extensively. We consider ourselves quite understanding of difficulties involving short staffing, or staff that is new. The caveat is, those issues need to be communicated to your patrons. When you are left at your table for almost an hour with no explanation, the situation gets rather frustrating."

2/20/2021,20210220,4,3.38,"Great service, great vibe and good food. Went to brunch today with another couple and really had a great time. We were greeted by the owner and she was just super nice. Then to our waitress Emily, outstanding! The menu had something for everyone and we really enjoyed the entire experience. We ordered a ton of food to share and here it goes! Wings and cauliflower to start then Mediterranean and Caesar salad followed by a salmon croissant sandwich French toast burger and chicken sandwich. Everything was really good but the chicken sandwich. Just a bit on the dry side and just wasn't as good as everything else. Doesn't mean it was terrible just dry for my liking. Drinks were really good and the fresh juices were great. I would definitely come back!"

2/21/2021,20210221,5,3.43,"Now that restaurants are reopening, I was finally able to check out Ivy Kitchen and Cocktails. Upon entering, I immediately saw that they were social distancing and had hand sanitizer at each table. That eased my concerns, after quarantine had us all paranoid. The vibe was on point and so was the music!! The cocktail curator fixed some amazing cocktails! The meal was delicious! With the music flowing (and drinks) I had a great time! This will NOT be my only time. See y'all soon!"
2/21/2021,20210221,5,3.46,Nice and intimate restaurant. Servers are nice and food is great! The owner is very sweet and personable as well. Definitely an establishment I will continue to visit.

2/22/2021,20210222,4,3.5,"Had such a great experience here as one of the first restaurants I've been to since Covid restrictions have eased up. I'm giving Ivy four stars for the following reasons, -service was outstanding. Our waitness, Tandra was extremely enthusiastic about the restaurant. She made sure to let us know any specials they were offering that were not on the menu. I'm so happy she did because I ordered their cajun pasta which was on special and it was phenomenal!! Blasting with flavor and tasting so hot and fresh. I loved the variety of cocktails on their menu, Tandra even told us if there was a specific cocktail we wanted that wasn't on the menu, to let her know and the bartender would make it for us! My friend ordered their salmon dish, I got a bite and it was cooked to perfection. Best salmon I've tasted outside my dad's cooking! I wish I took pictures of food but it was so good that we all ate it so fast! I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. The chair and interior were modern, but not hipster. I liked that. The owner even stopped by our table to make sure everything was going well, I felt very appreciated to be there. I will definitely be back and bring friends! Only thing I wasn't happy about was the time it took to originally get seated. The waiting area is pretty small.. But it sounds like the owner plans on expanding the restaurant to make it bigger so I'm looking forward to seeing what I can be! It's worth a visit."
2/28/2021,20210228,3,3.49,Positive points - food very good- to excellent. Very friendly wait staff once we were engaged with them. Nice decor.Negative points - bar service moved at the speed of sludge in winter. Could not understand what the bartender was doing - she looked busy but produced very little and v e r y  s l o w l y. Our drink order required no special treatment (glass of wine and whiskey over ice) but took over 20 minutes to arrive.We had to wait ten minutes to be greeted by a hostess while wait staff ignored us.Very pricey.Would we go there again? Big Maybe.
2/28/2021,20210228,1,3.44,"Had a nice vibe and good aura to it at first, but slowly you start to realize that its not all rainbows and butterflies. The customer service was ok, the waitress was friendly. But thats the most ill say thats good about this place. As soon as i got my cups, they were smudged and crusted and even stained with lipstick. Not sure how that goes unnoticed especially during covid. Aside from the cups we were served water from a reused bottle. It wasnt open in front of us and the tags were worn out but was told it was fresh water served. I ordered the ivy burger, on paper it sounded amazing. As soon as it hit my table. It was a hot mess. My lettuce was starting to spoil and my egg extremely under cooked, so undercooked i could still smell the hens ass that laid it. I can do runny but i cannot do uncooked yolk. The meat and the pepper-jack cheese had a slime texture not even edible. My over all experience was horrible and would not recommend this place to anyone."
3/7/2021,20210307,1,3.4,"My party and I made reservations for 1pm. We arrived to check in at 1pm, and the place was crowded. It's a small restaurant and it seemed like they had over 50% capacity. We ended up leaving bc #1 they couldn't honor our reservation time and #2 it was too crowded."
3/7/2021,20210307,4,3.41,My boyfriend and I checked this place out because of a recommendation and we were very pleased. The food is top notch! With a smaller menu and not much to choose from ... they succeeded with the flavor and presentation. We started with the crab cakes which were $16 for one.... but totally worth it. It's full crab without much filler and tastes AMAZINGG! He had the prime rib stroganoff and I had shrimp linguine... phenomenal! I only gave it 4 stars because we waited about 10 minutes before a server approached us..
4/1/2021,20210401,4,3.42,"Great food, ambitious cocktail menu, a small but accessible wine list and a unique urban atmosphere make Ivy an excellent dinner destination. We split a short rib tacos for starters, a green salad with a ginger dressing, and baked salmon with a splendid ginger glaze over rice and vegetables, an a creamy cajun pasta dish with just the right amount of spice and a rich, tasty sauce. My only quibble, too many hard surfaces, which makes the noice level at times painfully loud. But that's probably just an old guy issue. Certainly can't complain about all the people enjoying themselves so much."
4/11/2021,20210411,1,3.38,"Can I give a NEGATIVE star? The worst experience I've had. I always try to support black business. Keep the money in the community, but this business needs to go out of business. Niya, the owner, should consider a different profession.  The Restaurant business is hard and it's not for everyone.  We waited an hour for our table even with a reservation. The place was not full. You can't have a Saturday brunch and provide bad service and food.  There seem to be a lot of staff running around but no one was really doing anything.  Can someone connect Niya with ""save my restaurant""?"
4/12/2021,20210412,2,3.36,Issa vide I'll give them that... but gotta do better with food n drinks. Crab cakes shouldn't taste like salmon croquettes and how do u f up chicken... Make it make sense
5/1/2021,20210501,1,3.32,"I was visiting Port Huron and drove down to have brunch at Ivy based on recommendations online. After driving an hour and literally being two minutes from the restaurant, they called and canceled. What a waste of a day and way to end my trip."
5/19/2021,20210519,1,3.28,"I visited for my birthday with reservations, which took several attempts to book. I eventually went on Facebook to get it done. I arrived before my guests. From the start it was a problem, I ordered a glass of the house Chardonnay and the bartender took the glass to the owner to verify that the ""weak"" pour was correct. It was not!! Thankfully she topped it off...another strike it was $15 and the tip was already added.Once seated we ordered Veuve Clicquot Champagne...which I had to show the server which one it was on their drink menu. Bless her heart! We actually had two bottles. Not once did I receive a Happy Birthday from the staff nor the owner, Nya when she dropped by the table. Oh...she sent us a round of tequila shots. Yippee....really?!The food we all ordered lacked flavor and creativity...the ginger salad was awful and is not as described according to the menu. Maybe it's the Chef that has the issue...not sure but we will not be returning."
5/29/2021,20210529,1,3.24,"I don't even know where to start! This place has a ton of potential but is lacking very bad right now. Was very excited to go and enjoy brunch at my first black owned restaurant and was left extremely disappointed! We were seated on time, very sweet waiter, but we waited an hour, just to hear they ran out of items! We already had our drinks and was betting on this place so decided to give the benefit of the doubt and wait! (Trying not to be problematic customers) After waiting an hour, and being told no eggs, we were told our food would be ready soon. After another 30 mins I was frustrated and got up and asked the bartender to just pay for drinks and go! After the Bartender went to the back and within 5 mins our food came out. When the food came I expected better presentation , and quality especially for the price! For an hour and 30min plus wait, and for the way the food came I will not be coming back."
5/30/2021,20210530,5,3.27,"This is a great place to chill and talk with friends. The service is nice, you'll be waiting a while for food and drink though.Great experience"
6/10/2021,20210610,1,3.23,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD WORKING MONEY HERE ! I've never felt so frustrated when going out to a restaurant . This is the biggest scam and the staff is a JOKE . If you are reading this , you better take this ADVICE and not come to this terrible place . You will save your time and money and you won't have to keep replaying the terrible experience I play over in my head . I really hope the STAFF working from 11:30am -3pm on 5/27/21 read this Review . YALL NEED HELP ! NO WORK ETHIC !! -5 stars"
6/18/2021,20210618,1,3.2,"This place is bad for business, do not apply to work here as a chef.. The incompetence level is amazingly through the roof, the owner and her employees are thieves.. Not only are you schedule for 13-14 hour shifts everyday, you can't get a break until after you worked 8 hours.. A complete slave ship; it's very sad that this is the very first black owned restaurant I ever worked at and it's ran exactly how I thought it would be ran.. ""just like a nigga"".. The owner is disrespectful as fuck and there's a reason why this bullshit business goes through so many chefs.. I worked 30 plus hours on my last couple days there's and on my last check I had a check for only 8 hours.. If you're a chef don't waste your time applying to work here unless you want to be disrespected, cheated out of money and have your personal belongings stolen.. Complete waste of my time and energy."
6/19/2021,20210619,2,3.18,"Out for a Saturday afternoon brunch to support Black Businesses for Juneteenth and visited Ivy Kitchen on Jefferson Ave in Detroit. We made a reservation and when we arrived, there was only one other group there. That was fine. We sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly bartender. It was downhill from there... our orders were given to us separately and were spaced individually. One of our drinks was garnished with an orange that appeared to not have been washed/cleaned. At least that's what we felt. The potatoes, chicken, and waffles were dry AF. The positive things are the place was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the paper towels were quality... Would I recommend?? Idk"
6/28/2021,20210628,1,3.15,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Food is trash, service is trash. Asked for a water refill and our servers exact words "" we gave you water 20 min ago"". I don't understand how this place is still in business. Black, white, purple I don't care business is business & these people don't handle it. Great location though if it goes out of business I'm gonna scoop it up and open something great & show them how it's done. I never write reviews but this time it was a must."
6/30/2021,20210630,5,3.18,This place ROCKS from the service to the food My Wife and I stopped by for a bite to eat in which turned out to be dinner my wife had the salmon BLT (Turkey) bacon which was quite delicious and I had the ginger salmon and I must say that it was also quite scrumptious we had their trademark wings which was also delicious and for desert we shared a cheesecake and a double Choclate muse Cake and just like everything else not only was the food delicious but the presentation was excellent and Bianca was cool and down to earth and I must say that we will be back most definitely
7/28/2021,20210728,5,3.2,I had the salmon sandwich. It was simply amazing. I would like to try more pescatarian or vegetarian options from this restaurant soon.
8/1/2021,20210801,1,3.17,"If you're one of those people that looks at reviews to make a decision on where to eat, read this review.. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. The restaurant hours are 11am-10pm. We had an 11am reservation time and showed up at 11am, but the doors were closed and the restaurant was not open. At approximately 11:05am a lady in a white Range Rover pulled up and open up the doors, but the customers were not allowed in. It was a beautiful morning so we didn't mind waiting. We wauted in line until about 11:25 to be let in Ivy Kitchen and be seated. Our server was nice, overwhelmed, and inexperienced. She took our order (didn't write anything down), went back to the bar and looked like she wrote down our order and then came back to our table to confirm what we ordered - complete waste of time.. The food was alright, but the service was horrible. We sat at our table for approximately 10-15mins before having to ask for waters which came about 25mins later. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time. Half of our food came out while others waited. The fries were literally uncooked. The food is NOT worth the price. Oh, there's an automatic 18% gratuity on every bill for ""your convince"". I enjoy supporting local businesses and always try to, but this is an establishment I would never recommend or return to.PS they don't have ranch"
9/20/2021,20210920,1,3.14,Definitely should have read the reviews before we went here. Inside looked promising until you decide to sit and dine. Everything was way over priced and the food was no where near worth it. I'm very patient at restaurants but the service was beyond slow and there was an excuse for everything. Not a place I'd go back to.
9/20/2021,20210920,5,3.17,"Ivy was a wonderful experience, the staff was friendly and the food and cocktails were excellent. Specifically the salmon and the jalapeno infused cocktail- it's got a great kick! Keep up the good work."
9/21/2021,20210921,5,3.19,If you like tasty appetizers and good drinks and great service.. The bartender Big D Devin was great and very attentive...It was all Soooo freaking good $8 happy hour menu
10/3/2021,20211003,2,3.18,"The food was pretty flavorful, but I would avoid going unless I had some extra time to waste. It ended up taking 90 minutes from seating to eating because of how short-staffed they were. It took 40 minutes before they took our order (though they brought us water after 20). Another table simply got up and left. I hope they figure out how to manage their capacity because I know a lot of small businesses are hurting for help. Until then, if you've got other plans later that day, I'd look someplace else."
10/3/2021,20211003,1,3.15,"Came to this restaurant with high hopes with a group of 14 other educators today. We were really excited for their brunch menu. The service here is beyond slow we waited 45 minutes to even get our drinks that we ordered and we only got them because we threatened to leave. We then tried to get up and walk out after an hour and ten minutes because we still didn't have our food only to be stopped by our poor waitress who is running around like a chicken with her head cut off saying that our food was on its way. Two hours into our visit, we still have not received our food. The owner was behind the bar the entire time, and never once stepped out from behind the bar to help this poor waitress. She only stayed behind the bar to serve people drinks, people who she wanted to serve drinks to not anyone else. We finally had to ask for food to go, because we had been there 2 1/2 hours with no food, no water refills, and no apology from the manager or the owner. I can't see this place staying in business for much longer unless it is backed by an independently wealthy person."
10/10/2021,20211010,1,3.12,"It was not good. Service was bad, food was awful and the ambiance was lackluster. I went there on Saturday for a great dinner with my book club friends. Well I was so shocked by boring ass menu which was very different than their website. One of the managers shared they were too lazy to find someone to update the website with the new Fall menu. Isn't that stupid?! It demonstrated the lack of effort they put forth in their business. Its a new restaurant and they are losing customers with their lack of appeal. The food is unseasoned and not fresh at all. I ordered the mezcal wings, the chicken was not fresh, no flavor of mezcal and too much sauce on the wings. I ordered for dinner Spicy Chili Lime chicken, yuck. It was frozen fried chicken drenched in nasty bbq sauce no chili lime and it was over boring brown rice, very dry. I'm embarrassed for the chef and owner. They need to temporarily close and hire a restaurant consultant for help or they'll be closed permanently before the year is over. I want them to make some real changes and get more serious waitstaff. Fired the chef, find someone who can cook for their demographic. Food with flavor!! Add small decor changes, get another bigger tv, add flowers to tables maybe some tea lights. Turn the lights low after 6pm...upgrade the spot. There is some potential but they need to work harder!!"
10/23/2021,20211023,5,3.14,Great food and flavors. Loved the atmosphere and Mikah was behind the bar and gave amazing service! Definitely coming back!
10/29/2021,20211029,5,3.17,"I was a bit skeptical of this restaurant due to the number of reviews saying that either the food wasn't up to par or service was terrible but I Had an absolutely amazing time here! This restaurant truly knows how to cater to its guests. We came for a reservation for 10 ppl, they let us seat early once we got 4 since our table was staggering in. They typically make you wait for your full table. I am so relieved they didn't due to the fact that some of our guests didn't arrive until two hours later. Each table was decorated with fresh roses and it gave it a romantic and comforting ambiance. I tried something new for me and got the shrimp and grits which was very good it had a slight sweetness to it that offset the smokiness of the cheddar and bacon.. I got a side of eggs and that really set it off. They had a full bar so I was able to try multiple flavors of mimosas such as mango, cranberry, etc. (At only $5 per glass!) And I could get a shot of bailey's in my coffee! I have no complaints about my visit and love supporting black owned businesses such as this. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu."
12/9/2021,20211209,1,3.14,"The is a below average restaurant. Server took 20 mins to come to table, drinks took another 25 mins, apps were good but took forever as well. Our reservation was for 7:15 we didn't leave until 9:30. We did order until 8, food took another hour to arrive at the table! We got boxes because we had other plans and the food was not great. Major KICKER, there was only 5 tables in the restaurant including us. They add Gratuity to the bill, probably because of the terrible service and food quality. I love to support new places but this one has a lot to learn!!!! Beware, the manager was fixing bills because food was being sent back from other tables."
12/17/2021,20211217,5,3.16,"Good food & atmosphere, still working out some bugs because of COVID but they make up for it with caring staff. Mika is a manger who has went the extra mile numerous times to make sure I was well taken care of. Chef Mike has came out to make sure my meal was prepared to my liking which is great, and on any given night you might come in for a meal and find yourself setting next to the owner. I can easily see myself being a regular in this neighborhood restaurant."
12/19/2021,20211219,5,3.19,"Great vibes and food was good. Definitely make reservations they fill up. Our table ordered..shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, beef rib hash, and the appetizers wings. The wings is fire! The drinks were good."
1/19/2022,20220119,1,3.16,Very bad food and service.The space is pretty cramped through disrupting the flow of the eating experience
2/5/2022,20220205,5,3.18,My sister and I visited this restaurant recently . The hostess sat us immediately when we arrived. The waitress greeted us with a smile and friendly customer service. Our food came out quickly and tasted good. They played good music as well . I will definitely be going again
2/6/2022,20220206,2,3.17,"I'm giving 2 stars just because the food and atmosphere were great. However, the unorganized service and staff makes me want to give 0 stars. My reservation for 5 people was at 1pm. They make a point when of letting you know that your table is only held for 5 mins when you make the reservation. But our table wasn't ready until almost 120. We were set right at the door where all the other waiting patrons were standing. Meaning butts on your back. Most of the people were polite and tried to move up b it it's awkward. We sat for at least 10 minutes before we were given water and menus. Our waitress was really nice but you could tell they are short staffed. She took our drink orders and the next thing you know we don't see her or our drinks for the next 20 mins. Finally the hostess comes over and says they had an issue on the patio and they moved our waitress out there and the gentleman would be our server. He NEVER came to our table. The hostess took our food order and finally brought our drinks to the table. The food took another hour before it came out, and it didn't all come out at the same time. 3 of my friends were almost done with their meals before the last 2 came out. While the food was delicious I will never go back. If they are that understaffed they should limit the number of reservations they take on a day."
2/12/2022,20220212,5,3.19,Food and the service was great. I went on a Saturday morning with some friends. We had reservations and our waitress helped with menu suggestions!!
2/20/2022,20220220,1,3.16,"We saw the good reviews and decided we'd try a Sunday brunch (just 2 of us ). Usually I will post a picture or two but after waiting over an hour for our food I was too hungry to take pictures. This was frustrating. Typically if a restaurant is running behind the tables are made aware, our table was ignored and not updated. This could have been a staffing situation, and we are understanding of that- but then notify your tables of the wait. The only reason we received our food is because we kindly mentioned something to the manager. The table next to us waited 40 minutes for their drinks. The other table next to us got their drinks within 30 minutes, placed an order- then waited 45 minutes for them to notify them they are out of the food they wanted. Management- the wait times need to be addressed. This experience for us, and all of the surrounding tables was simply unacceptable for a $75 bill."
3/5/2022,20220305,5,3.18,"First, just like dinner on Thursday, the food was excellent. It was just superb and secondly, I let it soak in that this fab culinary spot created by owner Nya Marshall deserves a lot of credit. It made it through the pandemic when more places that I can mention are already closed and shuttered.Don't get me wrong, Nya and Ivy had some tough days during the pandemic. I know because I came and doubted that I would ever return. But this week, I gave it another shot. Without knowing my reluctance to come back, the crew worked hard to make sure that everything was true to the original mission of providing a completely satisfying culinary experience and pleasant service with a dynamic urban vibe. And I learned that if you have any problems, just ask for Mika, the manager, who knows her stuff and makes sure customer service is not just lip service.After it opened in late 2019, one publication said: ""Fine dining has returned to Detroit's East Village neighborhood. Just a hop, skip and jump from Belle Isle sits Ivy Kitchen + Cocktails. Owner Nya Marshall completely funded the revitalization of the once abandoned building to an upscale eatery. Not only does she own the restaurant but she owns the building.""Ivy not a place to have a quick meal, but it is a place to have a good meal. So, bring a friend or two. Soak up the ambience and appreciate the fact that you are dining in a spot that is still there because the power of a woman made it so. I know it was rough. If Nya Marshall can transform a vacant building into a fine dining establishment, open just before the pandemic, survive and work like nobody's business between the kitchen and the front of the house, she can do anything. Congrats Nya. I'll be back and I'm bringing more friends.#GirlBoss #EastsideDetoit #FineDiningDetroit #IvyKitchen"
3/17/2022,20220317,1,3.16,Me and my husband have been here twice but never had a chance to sit down. Both times reservations were made and accepted. First time they had a brunch excuse and dinner started at 5pm. Second time I made a reservation on Saturday at 5pm (dinner time) and they had a private event and the next time dinner started was at 7pm smh. Also was told by the owner that she would call and set up reservations on the house but guess what I never received a phone call. Try and support but its so hard these days. next time I will reserve J alexanders and be treated properly. I cant believe I cancelled to come to IVY and not be seated AGAIN!
3/18/2022,20220318,5,3.18,"My friend and I were looking to get dinner before our concert to see Mitski, the queen. Ivy Kitchen + Cocktails was close by, so we decided to have dinner there. Immediately upon walking through the door we were warmly greeted by Meka (I believe was her name), the restaurant manager. She sat us down and got us drinks. The decor was chic and upscale. We felt like queens. The chairs were unbelievably comfortable. I felt like I was being embraced by a cloud. There were REAL roses on the table. Wow. Our food comes, and it is so elegantly plated. I got short rib wonton tacos, which was a true chance to take. I had no idea what wonton tacos entailed. These tacos..... if I could say anything - it is that I died that evening and was resurrected by these tacos. I was slain by how magnificent the taste was, but was brought back to life wanting more. My friend's burger was divine. She told me, ""excellent burger, quite messy, good pickled onions"". Her description is nothing short of divine. Not only was the food impeccable and the decor off the charts, but the people there are absolutely astounding. They were warm and loving. Even the other customers there were so kind! All around, this place deserves 10 out of 5 stars. When in Detroit, go to Ivy!"
3/23/2022,20220323,2,3.17,"Ya know I really wanted to like this place. However, the wait time is entirely too long for basic breakfast food, over an hour and a half for a croissant with bacon cheese and salmon was absurd! While the food was good the overall experience was poor. I don't know that I'll be returning."
3/28/2022,20220328,4,3.18,Highly recommend reservations and patience - it's worthwhile! You get a selection of two juices with a bottle for mimosas. Best dish was salmon sliders (3); second up chicken and waffles; shrimp and grits are good to share but don't steal the show. Service is slow and they don't seem very experienced but friendly and down to earth. Come ready to chill and enjoy the time eating with loved ones.
4/3/2022,20220403,5,3.2,"It was love at first bite. This was my first visit of many more. The French toast is AMAZING!!!! ( sent from God ). The steak was cooked to perfection. Grits and Shrimp on Point. Food was fresh, hot and Scrumptious. You would think they hired a live DJ the music was so tastefully R & B. Vibes Live & Poppin. Liquor drinks ready to get you there ( tip...stir before sip). Wait staff professional and pleasant. They deserve their tips. By the way I said YES... I'll be back many more times"
4/4/2022,20220404,4,3.2,I've been coming her since they opened and the food and experience have gotten better. The last 3 times I came for brunch and every dish was amazing. The service sis still a little slow but the servers were nice and its COVID so I have patience because my food is good and I'm supporting the community. I will continue to support.
4/9/2022,20220409,2,3.19,Wanted to go there for brunch with a friend and they never answered the phone and had a voicemail machine which seemed like someone's personal number
4/17/2022,20220417,5,3.21,"This was my second time visiting Ivy kitchen! My mother and I came from Easter Brunch and it was amazing! Service was great, food was fresh and the staff were super friendly! We also had the Buffalo cauliflower (not pictured) it was fresh and very flavorful"
4/24/2022,20220424,3,3.21,"If IKC replaces Tanya/Tonya (sp?), it may have a chance. I'll never go back as long as she's there. Rude and discourteous at best! She actually rolled her eyes at me and my husband. We initially made reservations for a party of 4, and as we were walking in the restaurant out two guests called and let us know they had to cancel. We let the staff know as soon as we walked in 3 min early. The host seemed to be ok with that but not Tonya who approached the host stand at that moment. So we suggested that we'd take a seat at the bar as to not impact table reservations (changing from a party of 4 to 2). Tonya looked at us and literally rolled her eyes. She continued with her negative energy toward us throughout our dining experience (as she'd moved from the front host station to the bar area where we were seated).The food was great and ALL the other staff were excellent, professional--particularly the bartender Angelica, who was our server. I hate that one bad apple had to spoil this review, and more importantly our Sunday brunch! It's unfortunate that one individual who was not directly connected with our service or quality of our food is the reason we will not revisit IKC or recommend the place to our family and friends. (Coulda been five stars if not for Tonya. How disappointing.)Update:Should've read the reviews before we visited. But since many of the negative (and 1-3 star reviews) were from 1-2 years ago, we may have still given IKC a chance, being that it's a Black-owned restaurant. We were seated right away at the bar (for our 11am reservation). Given drink and food menus. Our orders were taken right away. I don't like salty food, so the shrimp and grits was delish (flavorful)! My husband ordered à la carte and each side was perfect. LOVED the playlist! Music was a little loud, but I enjoyed it. Food came in a timely fashion. Again, everything and everyone was great...except for Tonya."
4/27/2022,20220427,5,3.23,I really enjoyed my time at Ivy! Happy hour is from 4-6. My dinner was amazing. The seafood chowder is delicious. I had the Cajun pasta and my husband had the Ribeye both delicious! You won't be disappointed!
4/29/2022,20220429,4,3.23,"We had a very enjoyable dinner at this establishment last night. The owner and staff were very attentive, and the food was GREAT. My Ivy Burger was cooked to perfection, and is one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. I highly recommend trying this place out. Nice people, nice atmosphere, and nice food!"
5/1/2022,20220501,1,3.21,"If you're looking for a job, they are most certainly hiring. The wait time for seating (even with a reservation), drinks, and food is ridiculous. We stood with several others who had a reservation and watched several tables leave as we still stood. I counted 7 empty tables. No hostess or at least if there was one, they along with the general manager and busser were on the floor trying to cater to all the unsatisfied customers. When we finally got seated, we waited a good while before someone to came to our table. Seeing how things operated we decided to be prepared and order drinks and food as soon as someone came to the table... that's didn't help.... at all. We ordered 2 drinks so we wouldn't have to wait a long time for the ONE waitress to come back and take the order, send it in and wait for the bartender to make it, but that evidently had no effect because we did not get our drinks until an hour and a half(maybe more) later, after we received our food. Reminding the staff that we were waiting on the drinks, for over an hour, did not help either in case you were wondering . In the background, we could hear workers complaints about doing tasks beyond their job description due to lack of workers and what not. I certainly understand patience when it comes to the service industry especially with the times right now of every one looking for staff, however if you do not have servers, you should book reservations and seat accordingly. There's no reason you should be seating every single table inside and out with only one server. I counted a good 4 people waiting tables, one being the GM, the actual waitress, the busser, and whom I assume was the hostess. Now to our food... I ordered the shrimp and grits and wings. The entree was alright (shrimp wasn't even deveined but I chose my battles), however the wings did not come out until probably 40 minutes after my actual meal came out. They were very delicious but I would've like them with the rest of my food. The people I was with also order wings, eggs , potatoes and French toast. I had a chance to to taste the French toast and it was pretty good however the potatoes weren't and they never received the eggs. This was my second time coming to ivy kitchen and I hoped after a year, it would be a better experience but it is sad to say it was the exact same, if not worse. I would also like to mention, we watched the bartender urgently serve the people sitting at the bar while everyone in the dining area waited for drinks. They were able to get the drinks they ordered, refills, and another all before we received the drinks we ordered when we were first greeted. And I know my feelings were warranted because there was a group of ladies standing behind us in the line, also with a reservation, that sat next to us and we all complained together the entire time due to the experience. I truly hope and assume this inconvenience was due to the weekend rush and that it's not a constant thing every single day. (just for a little perspective, the reservation was at 1:30, they never answered the phone so we stood inside for about 40 minutes, and left around 4:30/:40... there was only 3 of us)"
5/1/2022,20220501,1,3.19,"Ivy Kitchen did not have enough staff to properly run this restaurant. Me and my friends reservation was at 1:00 pm. We was seated around 1:15 pm so that was ok. The waitress took our order about 5 minutes after we were seated. We waited for about an hour and a half for our food. We waited 45 minutes just to get some water. When the food finally came out, it was not good. I ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was not seasoned at all and the eggs tasted like powder eggs. Maybe if they had enough staff the food and service might have been better but unfortunately it was not. I think they should of just shut down early because of the staff shortage."
5/3/2022,20220503,3,3.19,"Made a reservation and arrived on a Saturday evening. It wasn't as crowded as we thought it would be nor was the seating area as big as we expected. Something I instantly liked was the music choice. Very nice for the atmosphere.We were seated immediately upon arrival. Once seated, we were given wrinkled paper menus that had sauce stains (-_-) ewAfter looking over the menu, we ordered the following appetizers to share: wings, seafood chowder, and short rib wonton tacos. All three came out together within 20 minutes and were enjoyable. For entrees, we ordered the Cajun pasta and the sweet chili Thai chicken. I wanted the black ink pasta, but apparently they don't have that entree anymore. To our frustration, it took OVER AN HOUR for our NONCOMPLICATED entrees to come out. Like seriously, how frustrating! And to make matters worst, both plates tasted average. Nothing spectacular to brag about whatsoever. It was quite disappointing."
5/7/2022,20220507,5,3.21,"Food Drinks Ambiance Service I just ended a call with the staff at Ivy Kitchen. The call ended because I hung up, abruptly. I hung because the employee or staff who answered the phone to assist me was horribly rude. I'm leaving this review as a courtesy to the owners & the staff of the restaurant and I'll tell you why, the restaurant is growing a poor reputation but it is a very good experience. I really love it.I learned of the brunch spot from a friend who planned a brunch date for our group. My friend learned of the establishment because her parents went and gave their feedback of the experience... because that's what it is when patrons learn of an establish and choose to go because of the reference & attraction... we go to have an experience. An enjoyable experience at our own cost. An experience made possible by the combination of the establishment and the patron- i.e SUPPORT. My friends parents told her that it was a very nice place, the food & drinks were good BUT the service was awful and that they'd not return because of that one but. My friend still chose to give it a try because her parents have exquisite taste. The food was amazing, we asked to thank the chef in person & he came out. We loved our drinks. The service & interaction from the staff was just not good. We didn't even want to tip but we did. We went to the bar after we ate and the bar tenders were cool. I said all this to say, please make adjustments to your business work environment for the employees because the service is ruining a really good experience as well as leaving a bad impression on supporters. Which is a shame because yal establishment is lit! And it's black owned. I prefer to and enjoy supporting black people and their businesses. Your patrons are black people and majority native Detroiters."
5/8/2022,20220508,1,3.18,first of all they couldn't even find our reservation and we stuck waiting for 10-15 the point of a reservation is to be seated at that time. the food was ok but you could tell the food had been sitting there all day. i will not be coming back again terrible experience.
5/21/2022,20220521,2,3.17,"It brings me no joy to write this review but my hope is that the owners of this cute spot WANT to be great at what they do and will value this criticism and use it for improvements. Came here midday on a Sunday (around 1:30pm) recently with a reservation. Was a busy spring day but the restaurant did not seem at all prepared for that in terms of bar staff in particular. It was not so packed people were lined up at the door or every table was full though. We were seated outside where only some of the tables have any sort of awning. Should offer more or at least ask in terms of preferred location. We were boiling in the sun. The speakers outside even were so loud we had to shout across the table to be heard. We were only 2 people. This was brunch. Not a nightclub. We waited a full 30 minutes from placing our order for a glass of cranberry juice and a sangria. This is not a huge place - so travel time from bar to table wasn't the issue. Presumably, the sangria is premixed and only needs to be poured. There was NO reason this should have taken this long. Our waitress kept saying she'd be back with our drinks next time she came by - then she'd walk by repeatedly without them. Said the bar was backed up. Again, what we ordered should be basically pouring 2 drinks. It also took us a long time to even get waters and then asked for a pitcher of water (since it was so hot and we were seated in the direct sunlight with no awning). Also note, the sangria was pretty terrible. It was at least an hour before we got our food. And we ordered quickly. Short ribs and shrimp & grits. both were good - so that's a good thing for sure!I've spent many years in hospitality in both fancy places and turn and burn alike. When the kitchen gets backed up, you make up for it with the drink refills, the water attentiveness, and generous pours of both from the staff. People will forgive a long wait for food if you keep them lubricated usually. And we had to keep asking even for that!When we got our bill, there was 18% autogratuity that was NOT mentioned to us. We saw it before we tipped. We were a party of 2. There's no need for autograt on a 2 top UNLESS the place knows its not offered great service and is trying to be sure the staff still gets tipped. We'd have tipped 20% regardless. but sneaking in the 18% autograt is just tacky. There was no need for that. Overall, cute decor. good food. potential here. But really a miss for the moment."
5/27/2022,20220527,5,3.19,Pleasantly surprised by this spot. Friendly service great food and cocktails. Thank you to the lovely server and wonderful manager truly appreciate your hospitality.
