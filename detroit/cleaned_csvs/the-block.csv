9/20/2015,20150920,4,4.0,"Previously named The Grill Midtown, The Block has a new menu and décor. We were there for Detroit restaurant week and enjoyed their short menu for this special week. We enjoyed the wing appetizer, a vegetarian entrée of sweet potato chips, carrots, artichokes and a creamed cheese spread all over a couple of slices of nut bread. It was very good. Others had "" Rockin"" chicken or steak. There were two dessert options--a apple taco filled with ice cream (everybody loved it) and a bacon brownie(a little weird and spicy----- some loved it but others hated it)) Everyone was happy with their meal overall. The wines were good ,a Bollini Pinot Grigio and a 1865 Malbec. Service by Solange was perfect. We will definitely go back and explore their regular menu.One point to know is that they have free parking in a parking structure in the side street just west of the restaurant. There is also some street parking."

9/28/2015,20150928,5,4.33,"This place has changed for the better! Me and a group of friends went on a Saturday night during Detroit Restaurant Week and we truly enjoyed our meal...so much that I had to write a review about it. This three course meal for $25.00 (with the restaurant week discount) was the best meal I'd eaten all year. First Course: My husband decided to get a little funky and order the Watermelon BBQ wings, which were outstanding! The sauce on those wings made me feel like it was the fourth of July in my mouth. With a great melody of sweet barbecue sauce and the faint taste of watermelon, it was phenomenal. I ordered the shrimp with with chili sauce, which was perfect. Other friends order the Kale caesar salad, which was so good that we've dreamt about it everyday since...Second Course: Everyone including my husband ordered the tenderloin, which they all loved. I ordered the pan seared glazed salmon with a twice baked potato and parmesan corn on the cob. The pan seared salmon gave me so much joy, it was perfectly seared and the glaze acted as a sweet cherry on top. Third Course: If you Love bacon & brownies like I do, the bacon brownie will blow your mind.  I appreciate great meals and this place does not disappoint. Make sure that you get Michelle as your waitress...she's the bomb! Thank You for the great meal ""The Block"" - Kesha McKinney"

10/4/2015,20151004,4,4.4,"I would give The Block 3 1/2 stars..We started with the alfredo potato skins which were AMAZING. Highly recommend this as a starter. We then ordered boneless wings in rock n rye, sweet chili, parmesan/garlic, and bacon/bourbon. The sweet chili definitely stole the show. The food was great, the service was the issue...I asked for a moscow mule with valentine vodka - the server didn't know a mule could be made with vodka and also wasn't familiar with the available vodkas-also, we ordered 20 boneless wings thinking they would be similar to the size of the boneless wings found at buffalo wild wings - instead they were more like chicken tenders (which was fine) but the boneless wings come with more than 5 wings which was not mentioned to us until the dishes were brought out leading to WAY too much food for 2 people to consume.TLDR: Food is great, definitely try the potato skin appetizer - stole the show. Service needs A LOT of work."
10/4/2015,20151004,4,4.33,"Nice, casual atmosphere with great waitstaff, and apparently they validate parking (I parked in a free spot on the street). The crab artichoke dip was great, and the kale caesar salad and cornbread side were good as well. I hadn't been to the Grille Midtown, so can't speak to whether the new place is better or worse. There wasn't a whole lot on the menu that I'm dying to go back and try, but would definitely consider this place a solid dinner option in the future."

10/11/2015,20151011,3,4.11,"it was decent, I guess my expectations were just a little high. we had the rock and rye wings, and I had a chili devil beer, eh not the best, but definitely not the worst. this place has potential, but one thing I noticed... our server read off the beers to me, ive been in restaurants for 3 years, and a server for a year, and I know that's a no-no. menu and beer menu should be memorized, but atleast she was nice, and prompt 3 stars. minus 1 star for not knowing the menu, and minus a star for the food selection and theme. There called ""The Block"" but the only 2 things that give me a ""Block-ish"" feel, was there sign (awesome sign btw) and the menu on a clipboard."
10/18/2015,20151018,2,3.9,"After hearing the ratings and doing my research I decided to give this place a try and sadly to say that I am giving the Block a 2/5 stars. I made a reservation for a party of 15 and the staff sounded really pleasant and adjusted to what I needed, to make my party feel welcomed. But don't let that nice personality fool you! As my guest started to arrive, we only received ONE menu for the whole table until they realized us sharing that menu. Once everyone ordered, we waited for a very long time ( about 20-30 minutes) before the food came out. I understand that we have a big party but the restaurant was not busy. The only reason why this restaurant is getting any stars is because of their food. Although they had a limited amount of choices on their menu, their food was delicious and had a variety of flavors. Throughout the night we consistently received bad service from the waitresses. They would come to our table and asked if we needed anything. When we told them what we needed, they never came back with it, even when we told them multiple times. For example, when my guests ordered drinks, they waited over 30 minutes to either remind the waitresses or receive their drinks and by that time my guests finished eating. Soon my guests and I became agitated after the consistent bad service and I informed the waitress that I wanted to talk to their manager. When the manager came, I told him what had happened and that we were unsatisfied with their service. He apologized and asked what we needed which was nice but nothing was done about the service besides the restaurant giving one free slice of cheesecake to me. In addition, each of my guest were automatically charged for 20% gratuity, I'm sorry to say but that the waitresses did not even deserve that much of tip.I have mix feelings about this restaurant but I probably will not be eating at the Block again."

10/30/2015,20151030,1,3.5,"I was Grill Midtown fan. But, sad to say they changed the name to The Block and the menu. Sorry to say it is not worth the stop. First negative, we ordered a salad that arrived 5 min before entrees. I had the Rockin Chicken. Definitely NOT Rockin! It was a chicken breast BBQ sauce and dry - not good!! My wife has the Salmon. It was good but lacked creativity. Sides were all good - asparagus, grilled sweet corn. I understand they are bringing back old menu! They need it. One compliment the staff was receptive to my comments."
11/3/2015,20151103,2,3.38,"Name change alert: This used to be The Grille Midtown . Same owners, same staff, so I'm not sure why the name changed, but it did, between the time I made the DRW reservation and the time my party arrived to eat.I got my usual Gang of 10 together for Detroit Restaurant Week (DRW), and this is the place I chose for us to go. I'm not saying The Block isn't worth a visit, because my experience is based solely on DRW, but what I can say is that I've been doing DRW, spring and fall, since 2011 and this is the least good place.Nothing was particularly horrible about The Block, but nothing (except the corn bread) was particularly wonderful, either. And a couple things were kind of weird. Weirdest of all, we were waited on by two different servers, which resulted in four of us getting each course of the meal about 5 minutes before the other six. So, for each course, four of waited with food in front of us before we could eat. Not a big deal, but weird. Another weird thing. Two of us ordered Long Island Iced Teas and got drinks with no cola in them. Just booze. Yowza! And instead of remaking the drinks (not really necessary), or taking them back and adding the cola (easiest course of action), we each received a glass of Coke, which we then had to mix with our drinks. Yes, it was a mix your own drink experience. So, needless to say, service was sketchy. It was friendly, but it was sketchy. I could still give a three or even a four star review with weirdness and sketchiness, but the food wasn't up-to-par, and that's a killer.For appetizers, those of us who ordered the wings agreed they were yummy, but those who ordered the kale salad got sore jaws. For entrees, the Salmon was overdone, the chicken was overdone, the tenderloin was overdone, and the vegetarian dish was missing the sauce that (when it came out later, at our request) tied the whole dish together. Dessert was the only solid course. Apple taco consumers and bacon brownie consumers alike were pleased."
11/17/2015,20151117,5,3.5,Stopped in on a quiet Tuesday night and grabbed some calamari and a Stella Artois. Calamari is one of my tests (hollandaise sauce being the other) of a good restaurant because it is so easy to mess up.The calamari was fantastic and the Stella Artois is poured from an authentic Stella Artois European style tap. Completely satisfied!
11/22/2015,20151122,3,3.47,"I ate there with a large party, including 3 kids, after a Sunday football game. It was the perfect menu, atmosphere and price point for our group. Several in the group ordered mac and cheese and cornbread, which were both delicious. Calamari and salads were all good as well. I ordered the burger and asked for it to be cooked on the rare side of medium-rare. It was completely cooked through, and the patty seemed like it was preformed and frozen - almost store bought. It was really not good. My husband got buffalo wings and they did not come with any kind of dressing on the side, which was disappointing. Other than that, everything was fine, but the Block definitely has some kinks to work out. I appreciate a small and thoughful menu, but for that to work each item has to be executed really well. That sadly was not the case today, but I think the potential is there."
12/3/2015,20151203,3,3.44,"I really enjoyed it here! Came with a GF during DRW and sat at the bar. Although the service was a bit slow considering they were not packed, everything we ordered was good. The rock n rye chicken was a bit over done but had nice flavor. The jalepeno margaritas were made ""skinny"" for us and done nicely. A solid 3.5 stars."
12/16/2015,20151216,1,3.29,"Two experiences here have shown me that this place is awful...awful menu, awful service...the only reason this place is in business still is it is so close to the DSO. Go to Union Street, you'll be better off. Or Selden Standard...that place is better."
12/19/2015,20151219,4,3.33,Everything I had for dinner last night was fantastic. The Mac n cheese was a hit and the grilled salmon BLT sandwich was wonderful. My friend ordered the rock and rye chicken wings and they were so good. The only disappointment was the cookie dessert. The menu says it's served in and iron skillet and it was served on a plate. Presentation is such a huge part of a dining experience so hopefully a change this or accurately describe it on the menu.
12/19/2015,20151219,3,3.32,"We tried to get in a another local place but the wait was over 1.5 hours. So we got in the car and called up The Block to see if we could make reservations that night, they told us they could take us in 10 min....Im glad they did because the food was amazing. I ordered the pan seared salmon with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus....every bite was awesome.. My husband ordered the mac and cheese with bacon and chicken, very creamy and rich and he loved every bite... The only draw back to us returning is the waitress seemed shy and uncertain, she was not knowledgeable about the drink menu at all and spoke so low we could barely hear her.. Slow service..we asked for s certain food out first and it came with our meal.. Then she gave me the check to sign and didn't give us a pen and when we asked another waitress for one she told us we could borrow it but that she was not our waitress...lovely atmosphere great food service thumbs down!!"
12/22/2015,20151222,4,3.35,"I went on a Sunday. The sign is inside which made it difficult to spot it out. Just when I was going to give up, I found it. I parked on the street.I ordered the Alfredo potato skins as an appetizer. It comes with three. They were surprisedly great. I ordered the loaded chicken that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. This was delicious. I ordered a dark knight for a beverage and that was nasty. But there is a wide range of things to choice from. Service: unorganized, switched in and out, could be betterOverall, the food is bomb so I will continue to patronize here."
12/23/2015,20151223,4,3.38,"This review is mostly based on the $3 Happy Hour Wings - get them grilledStaff and servers here are delightfully friendly and attentive - free validated parking in Alexandrine structureThe Rock N Rye BBQ is sweet and tangyBuffalo is a great traditional buffaloBring back the Watermelon BBQ - savory with a hint of sweet - was my favorite but returned to see it was gone !Garlic Parmesean is a creamy sauce but I thought it had too much parmI wouldn't recommend the sweet chilli it was a bit salty and dry without any kick to ItMac n cheese is creamy Alfredo style sauce if you're into thatDRW my steak was cooked as ordered, the deserts were amazing Bacon Brownie was great- Apple Tacos were huge! I'm not a fan of baked potatoes in general so my opinion here would be biased- I thought they were okay. Kale salad was drowning in dressing"
12/27/2015,20151227,1,3.27,"The food here used to be good when it was Midtown Grille, but the service has really seemed to go down recently. We grabbed a drink after an evening at the DSO and the waiter somewhat rushed us out of the door and we waited at least 10 minutes for our drinks, when the restaurant was rather empty. I wish this restaurant was more friendly to the late night crowd and had better service. Not recommended for grabbing a drink anywhere near closing time."
12/30/2015,20151230,4,3.3,"I ate at this location twice when it was The Grille, so I wanted to try it with its new name and menu. Both my friend and I really liked what we had! She order the loaded potato soup; I had a chicken noodle soup. Both were tasty and could have been the meals by themselves. She ordered the cornbread muffins that include whole kernels of corn (yummy!), and we each had different salads--hers was the one with fried chicken, and mine featured grilled chicken, black beans, and tons of veggies. All of our portions were huge and tasty; we went home with enough for another meal. And our service was terrific. My friend called her significant other before we left to say she'd found a new restaurant for them to frequent, and I plan to get more friends in to experience The Block and, I hope, enjoy it as much as I did!"
1/8/2016,20160108,2,3.25,"I wanted to like this place. Honestly. But to wait 1.5 hours for a kale salad that consisted of barely washed, uncut kale leaves with a glob of store bought Caesar dressing and microwaved soup is unacceptable. I'll give it another try in a month or so... Fingers crossed..."
1/14/2016,20160114,3,3.24,"The reason this restaurant is getting 3 stars is because the food was definitely a 5, but the service was definitely a 1. My boyfriend and I went here before Home Alone at the DSO and got there about 545p.m.-6p.m. for a 7:30p.m. show, so we had time to spare. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but filled up fast as we gotten there. Our server clearly was either brand new, or working her first serving job ever. She was attempting to be personable which is great, but her professional service was so terrible that it didn't make up for it. We didn't order any drinks, but we did order the calamari for an appetizer which was really good. It had a spicy, sweet flavor to it. The appetizer however, didn't come for almost 45 minutes. I ordered the Rock and Rye BBQ Grilled Chicken Breast which had cheese and bacon on it and requested broccoli instead of mashed potatoes. She told me they didn't have broccoli, but it was on the menu. I showed her and she said, ""oh okay, you can do that."" Our food came about 10 minutes after the calamari appetizer. We are now almost at an hour for a restaurant that wasn't busy when we ordered. I also had an empty glass of water in front of me the entire time. My food was excellent, but came atop mashed potatoes and with no broccoli. The asparagus and the chicken with bacon and cheese were all melted into the potatoes which was unfortunate because I lost half of my meal because I didn't want to eat the mashed potatoes. We asked for the check as soon as possible in order to not miss the show.And a side note - they only have a one-person bathroom and there was a line, so then I spent 10 minutes waiting in line while some girl was doing her makeup. I'd go back if I had a different server, for sure!"
1/14/2016,20160114,3,3.23,"Good quality food and a great salad menu. I would definitely return for dinner. I gave them a 3 rather than a 4 because I felt that although the flavors and ingredients were well balanced, the amount of toppings looked a bit sparse. There was a good sized piece of chicken but really limited on the crumbled blue cheese, sort of a key flavor in a fruity salad if you ask me. The pecans were very limited as well and since they are the only crunch on the salad I was a little sad especially because they are cinnamon toasted, but I could not get a good sense of the cinnamon because the pieces were so tiny and far between. Service was great and I will return to try the dinner menu, hopefully someone will be checking the plates before they leave the kitchen during the dinner rush. I am actually booking a dinner party here so I clearly have faith! The atmosphere is great and the happy hour specials and cocktails look promising.Hopefully I can improve their score, I really want them to do well! Until next time...."
1/14/2016,20160114,5,3.3,Great Atmosphere.The Alfredo baked potatoes are AMAZING. Great drinks. Nice professional staff.
1/21/2016,20160121,5,3.36,"Had the sirloin...... awesome!!!!!! Huge portion and cooked exactly medium rare..... Very reasonable price for portion... my new steak place. Fresh mash and grilled asparagus...... For sure will be back. Try the Block Punch. $8, but one is good..... worth it....."
1/22/2016,20160122,4,3.38,"One of my favorite restaurants and bars in Midtown Detroit. Chef Kevin Browe has found a way to balance the menu with great gastropub fare foodies, beer geeks and wineos will love and sophisticated entrees perfect for the DSO crowed, date-night, business gathering and networking. Some of the highlights I like are the twice-baked Alfredo potatoes, bacon-wrapped shrimp and the buffalo chicken sandwich packs a punch. Try the wings to perfect during anytime but during happy-hour nothing goes down better then TheBlock wings and beers."
2/4/2016,20160204,4,3.4,"Happy hour deals honestly deserves a 5 star, the space is very nice inside too! The hostess was very kind, offered us parking advice (they validate parking structure tickets) and watched me down the block to make sure I got to my car okay! The service was slower then some restaurants but they were very attentive and present for us, so if I had asked she probably would have speed things up, but our group was chatty :)"
2/5/2016,20160205,4,3.42,"Enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere! The entire wait staff was pleasant and curtious. The bartender provided the history of the place which I found to be fascinating and it added something special to my experience! Will absolutely go back!"
2/7/2016,20160207,5,3.47,Great service and food. Staff was friendly and attentive. Favorite thing about this restaurant is the portions. You will not leave hungry. I will be back!
2/7/2016,20160207,1,3.39,"We arrived at 5pm. The waitress said they were already out of the special, Mahi Mahi. Around 5:30 they ran out of cornbread. My husband tried to order a second drink, and they ran out of Two James Vodka. For dessert, my friend ordered the cheesecake bites for our table. Guess what? They were out of that too!!! WTH? Service was a little slow. We won't be back."
2/8/2016,20160208,3,3.38,"The GoodWe visited on a Friday evening around 7pm and the place was packed! After a short wait the friendly hostess seated us at the bar. The menu is simple but adequate to suite many tastes. Look and feel of The Block was satisfying enough and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. Looking to keep things simple I choose the Salmon BLT ($12 - popular item from what I saw) and my wife chose the Chicken Avocado Panini ($10) with side salads in place of fries. To drink we selected draft beer at $5 each (selection of about 8 common beers). The BadMaybe its growing pains or that it was busy but service, though friendly, was slow and much disorganized. Wife's beer was flat and mine had a funky smell. Most people were drinking good looking mixed drinks ($8), so go that route instead of beer. Salads were fine, Chicken Avocado was flavorless! My salmon was a nice portion but like the chicken could have used a little spice. VerdictMore restaurant than bar, not a hangout kind of place. I would like to think I would try it again but with so many other places popping up (Awesome!), especially in the same area, I probably wouldn't. Unfortunately like the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression."
2/14/2016,20160214,1,3.31,"As soon as we realized that this place was a reincarnation of the horrid Midtown Grille, we should have left. But, alas, we didn't. The tables are packed in so tightly that it is virtually impossible for the servers to get to the outside tables with any efficiency, which they do not. Although seated at a window high top right away, it took 15 minutes for a greeting and another 15 for our drinks. 15 after that, following a serious discussion of whether to check out or not, we ordered a salad, fries and wings. The pear and fennel salad was the best part of the meal even with the wrong dressing and gives this review its one star. 20 mins later a heaping pile of wings were delivered- no fries. Those were forgotten and would have gone back in at the end of the queue. No thanks. The amount of breading on the large wings, some still raw on the inside, was flat out gross. I peeled most of mine off but still felt yucky after eating two. If you ignore my advice and muster the patience to visit this place order them grilled. The bacon bourbon or sweet chili sauce were the best out of the four we tried. By the way not many other diners looked happy with their experiences either. The table next to us ordered the chicken soup, which was delivered with no broth. More broth had to be brought in a shot glass and poured in the bowl of noodles. We had a horrible experience at the Midtown Grille and unfortunately nothing has changed for Block. We will not be back. Ever."
2/16/2016,20160216,5,3.36,Great service..Happy hour was great. Drinks strong n great priced..the wings and calamari was sooo good
2/28/2016,20160228,4,3.38,Everything was soooooo delicious!! Service was excellent!!! Couldn't find the place at first and the host came outside to find me and show me where to park! Waitress was great! Food great! Won't be disappointed!!!!
2/28/2016,20160228,5,3.42,"Been a few times, always good. Food is tasty and the happy hour has great deals. Relaxed atmosphere, I always sit at the bar or the high top tables cause I like that kind of seating."
3/1/2016,20160301,5,3.46,"The fennel pear salad is really tasty. You can never go wrong with the Alfredo Mac and cheese, either. I've gotten the salmon BLT and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I've also gotten the classic burger as well and it's really good. The desserts look appetizing, but I'm normally too stuffed to continue on. Service is always on point. Staff is friendly and efficient. Check it out!"
3/2/2016,20160302,5,3.5,"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is great, the wait staff was great, the food was great, the manager on duty was very active going around talking to all the guest. Now lets talk about the food...The food was some of the best that I have had. The fresh ingredients they used really showed. The taste and the quality of my dish was top notch. I ordered the wings to start off with...let me tell you...best wings in Michigan. The Rock and Rye wings are like nothing you have ever had before. It is a must that you try them. For my main course I ordered the filet mignon was cooked to perfection. It was tender, juicy and melted in my mouth. I probably did not need a knife to cut it but I used it anyways. If you are ever in Midtown Detroit you must check out this place. You will be glad you did.....ohh yea if you park in the parking structure you can validate your ticket and park for free."
3/8/2016,20160308,2,3.46,Where do I start.... Came in no one greeted us for 5 min so we just took a seat anywhere. It took another 10 min for some one to recognize us sitting down which basically killed the rest of happy hour. We both ordered the steak.... One medium one medium well... One steak came back well done and the other was a rainbow from rare to medium well...the Mac and Cheese was good but it was cold...... So went on to get deserts can't fuck that up right... You only had one job.... Microwave the damn cookie and pull the ice cream on it. Shit was ice cold......
3/9/2016,20160309,5,3.5,Great service and excellent food!! Very good location ....the bonus was the parking validation free parking in midtown is always a plus.
3/14/2016,20160314,5,3.53,"The block was very good..The host went out her way to come to my car and show me where to park and get in the resturant.. The service was 5 Stars ..The food was excellent, i was very impress that the cooks handle it without the Chief being there..Myself & my girls enjoyed everything ..Were Bartenders from Motor City Casino & The Block will be our new spot! Thank you for excellent food & customer services!!!"
3/21/2016,20160321,2,3.5,"I decided to try this place based on a friend's recommendation. It was brunch time on a Sunday and no this place doesn't serve brunch. So I started with the calamari and grilled wings. The calamari was good. The wings were served raw, like the bleeding type of raw. I informed my server who didn't seem shocked. Another order was sent out and they were under cooked as well. After that I didn't enjoy the experience. Even the chicken breast on my salad was a tad undercooked. Very disappointed. Side note: the manager never came over to apologize for the raw chicken and the wings were NOT taken off the bill."
3/23/2016,20160323,3,3.49,The food is good (try the wings!). The beer is good. But the service...a little slow and not always precise. Irregardless they are friendly. I'd recommend this place if you have a little extra time. Definitely worth the happy hour.
3/25/2016,20160325,3,3.48,"I would probably rate them more of a 3.5. Which is still ""A-OK"".A friend and I dined here on a Thursday and had a pleasant experience. When we arrived the host wasn't at her stand, but that isn't something that bothers me. When she saw us she was apologetic and sat us wherever we preferred. We opted for a high top by the window. They have several seating options, bar rail, high tops and regular tables and booths.Inside is fresh and clean, I love their ""Block Sign when you first enter above a booth.Once sat a greeter came over to fill our water glasses and let us know our server would be with us.Our service was good, it took her a minute to come by to check on us when my friend needed ketchup, but no harm no foul.We had ordered the wings with parm garlic for an appetizer. You can get these grilled or fried, obviously we went for fried! Let me tell you these were some real wings! Meaty, large and the sauce was fantastic. This was no bdubs. For my entree I ordered the Chicken avocado sandwich which was large. The chicken was tender and a very good size piece. The avocado spread was fantastic and it was served on a crisp brioche bread. You can chose from sweet potato fries, fries or salad. I opted for the side salad with was a spring mix with cucumbers onions and tomatoes. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was fantastic. Creamy rich gooey goodness. Not a dry crispy over done noodle. Prices are all reasonable, but I would prefer they had a little more variety on their menu.On our way out the host informed that they have a happy hour Monday-Friday 4-7p.m. She rattled off a bunch of drink and food specials, so this will definitely go on my list for happy our spots."
3/28/2016,20160328,5,3.51,"Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, great drink specials. The food smells and tastes awesome! I highly recommend the loaded chicken. !"
4/16/2016,20160416,3,3.5,"Went to The Block yesterday evening for the first time. Had been before the rebranding when it was Midtown Grille. Just a few changes were made to the decor. Nice, cozy ambience still remains. Had a couple of Billy Ocean cocktails and the Alfredo Mac. Enjoyed both thoroughly. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the desserts. Ordered the bread pudding. It lacked flavor and was way too gooey for me to eat. So, I sent it back to be replaced for the cookie. One third of it was not fully cooked. Sent it back only for me then to discover that it way much too sweet for my tastebuds anyway. Still would go again. But, definitely avoid the desserts."
4/28/2016,20160428,4,3.51,"Went here on a Monday for dinner and loved it. Street parking was easy to find even with the M-1 construction. Our waitress was outstanding. Friendly and attentive. I ordered a salmon BLT with the garden salad (and an Oberon, of course). Wow, it was delicious. Loved the aioli and the cranberry walnut bread. The salmon was perfectly cooked, too.The atmosphere is friendly and they have great happy hour specials. I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a casual, delicious dinner for a fare price and perfect portion."
4/30/2016,20160430,5,3.54,My wife says 5 stars / the food was excellent with large portions - Smokehouse burger great & salmon Blt delicious... Service good too! I agree with wifey we will be back! Ps. The Egg & Rum bread pudding was surprisingly thumps up!!
4/30/2016,20160430,3,3.53,"Sometimes a restaurant is in the perfect location and you really want it to succeed. That's how it is with me and The Block. It's situated right next door to Orchestra Hall which makes it the perfect place for dinner before the DSO. I have been here twice (Once it was named something Grille) and both times they lost my reservation. Each time I was able to find it for them in their book, while no tables were available. They tried very hard to make it up to our parties. The manager was fabulous and the food delicious and most was on the house. What made the evening sour was the hostess at this restaurant. She could not bring herself to say a mistake was made. Could. Not. Do. It. She began by telling me no one would take a reservation same day, and no one would have been there at the time I called. When I told her I talked to someone at length, she gave the impression that she was sure I was lying. I had to ask for the manager, and together he and I found my reservation in the book. After that she kept telling me what to do ""for future reference"". We took a seat at the bar and had a great dinner. Most everyone was great. Afterwards this hostess walked us half way to the hall, reminding me the mistake was mine and again telling me what to do ""for future reference""... Good grief, a final lecture as a send off. It doesn't matter what your policy is, if you take a reservation, it must be honored. Sorry miss hostess, for future reference... We are never coming back. Nothing is worth being made unwelcome. In my humble opinion, this girl needs a good talking to. She is the face of your business. I made the best of a bad situation (and tipped well) and she was rude and condescending. Lesson learned."
5/2/2016,20160502,1,3.48,"It should be called ""the worst"". the service was the worst service - my meal was screwed up and didn't even come. we were a party of 6 and every meal came out one at a time at different times. you cant just change the nsme and expect results. hire real service people and train them. diners beware."
5/2/2016,20160502,5,3.51,"Yesterday, I went to The Block for brunch with some of my Sorors. I say brunch only cause we were drinking before 5pm, they don't have a brunch menu. :) I was able to get a groupon for $18 for up to $35 worth of food. As an appetizer, I got the shotgun shrimp! It was EVERYTHING. The shrimp are a decent size, battered with this sweet chili sauce on it. It was sooooooo good and enough to share!! I'm super indecisive, so I asked our waiter, Van what he would recommend. He told me that everything on the menu was good, but the best seller is the The Block Alfredo Mac & Cheese. I was kinda leery to order this dish because I don't like eating pasta because it is so heavy; however, I am glad I ordered it. It was very creamy and cheesy with BACON bits in it. I know mac and cheese at restaurants can be hit or miss but The Block fasho doesn't disappoint. It is a large order of food as the entree but they also have it as a side. I should have ordered the side because I couldn't finish the entree. The Mac & Cheese was $14, which I thought was a bit pricey; however, you can tell that they make it with quality ingredients and the size is huge! Our waiter, Van was very accommodating, he was able to answer all our questions and did everything to make sure we were happy, including serving us mimosas even though they weren't technically on the menu. :) Ambiance is cool, they have like old school r and b playing. It is a bit drafty in there though, not sure if it was only in the area we were in (because we were close to the door) or not. Either way, if you get cold easily, take a jacket! The food and service is phenomenal and to top it all this is a BLACK OWNED BUSINESS! They also have a really good happy hour, can't wait to go back and check it out!"
5/22/2016,20160522,2,3.48,"What a disappointing experience. The first night we tried to go they had run out of food at 9 PM and so were serving just appetizers. We thought OK, will have just a couple of appetizers. We were seated and after waiting over 20 minutes for water, no drink order taken, we tried to place our order for one of the three appetizers on the menu only to be told they were out of the shrimp!...so we left.Always believe in giving a second chance, so we returned the following day. Wish we could say our experience was better but ordered wings that weren't crispy, a salad missing one of it's main ingredients & so-so Mac-n-cheese. After a bit of an attitude from one of the hosts, it was good service at the bar--bartender & waitress were both great."
5/25/2016,20160525,4,3.49,"Went here on a Wednesday night. Our server's name was Jasmine and she was wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating. We had the calamari and shrimp for appetizers and the loaded chicken was delicious. Overall, the experience was great!!!"
5/25/2016,20160525,3,3.48,"The service here is hit and miss. On some nights it's great, but on others there is not enough staff to handle the amount of customers (mostly on Fridays). Even during the week, the service is slow when the restaurant is less than half full. If they get the right combination of great customer service and consistent quality food, this place could easily have a great crowd and eventually open up another location."
5/26/2016,20160526,4,3.49,"Previously Midtown Grill. Went on a wednesday evening and had great food. I had the smokehouse burger and my friend had the A1 peppercorn burger. He asked for sauce on the side, since many places usually use too much, and while that didn't happen, they didn't drown it. We both liked the burgers, but we also split the mixed berry salad and it was amazing! the strawberry vinaigrette was awesome. Can be a little loud because of high ceilings. Service was only OK but I think I had someone new and she was doing her best."
6/18/2016,20160618,3,3.48,"My friend and I just tried this place for dinner. Super cute atmosphere but definitely loud-if you're not ok with high noise level you might not care for this place. There is no sign out front, only one inside on the wall. I got the shotgun shrimp as an appetizer. It was delicious, a little too much sauce but still good. My entree was the salmon BLT which comes on a cranberry walnut bread. The bread is amazing-sandwich is great, messy but great. For dessert we got the bread pudding which was to die for! I would go back and next time indulge in the Mac and cheese that they are apparently known for."
6/18/2016,20160618,5,3.51,"I've never posted a Yelp review until I came across this place. Everything about this place is perfect. The atmosphere is on point, it's very clean (especially the bathroom), and much more. Our waitress was EXTREMELY friendly and prompt, our waters was always filled, the food came out unbelievably quickly we order the shotgun shrimp as an appetizer, it was crispy and flavorful. As entrees, we got the lime chicken salad and the chefs special- ribs. The portions are HUGE. I'm a big guy, 6'4"" and couldn't finish my meal. Both our meals were delicious. For desert, we had the brownie ice cream- also delicious. As for their drinks, we had their sangria, which was by far the best I've ever had (coming from someone who has been to Spain). We will definitely be back. This place is perfect with Groupon."
6/27/2016,20160627,3,3.5,"We dined in here on a double date a month ago and we enjoyed ourselves here. For starters, we ordered their boneless wings that were delicious, I just wish there was a few more on the plate. The chicken bites were easy to cut through with a fork and their signature sauces were a great combo. My better half enjoyed The Veg burger which she finished and I opted for their Kale Caesar salad with Salmon on it. The salad was mediocre as the lettuce felt a bit old but the salmon had flavor. I also ordered a side of the fries that they advertised as shoe string fries but were just regular fries when we got them. One of my buddies tried the Salmon BLT which he stated as average as well. As for their drinks, our table enjoyed a variety of draft beers and fresh cocktails. For parking, we parked a block away and walked to the restaurant, upon entrance, a sign read if you park in the structure closer to The Block, they would wave the parking fee but we parked in the wrong lot and they would not reimburse me for the parking fee which was a bit of a letdown. We'd come back here maybe after the Woodward construction is all completed."
6/30/2016,20160630,5,3.52,"I'm working in Midtown Detroit on a very hot day here in the city and decided to go to The Block for lunch. I ordered the Salmon BLT with side salad and Cilantro Lime dressing. The best Salmon I've had from a restaurant in EVER! Ya here me....EVER! The salmon was seasoned perfectly and moist. The Cilantro Lime dressing should be bottled and sold. Can't wait to get back, soon and try the happy hour! The Block absolutely deserves a 5 star rating!"
7/11/2016,20160711,2,3.5,"My wife, son and I visited The Block for the first time last night.The decor of the place is very cool. I especially like the names of Detroit locales painted on the wall. It can get pretty loud, but we had no trouble hearing each other talking at our table.The food was very good. We had the wings as a starter, with BBQ sauce. The wings were large and meaty, and the sauce had just the right balance of sweet, smoky and spicy.I had the chicken avocado sandwich. My chicken breast was perfectly done, juicy and moist. There needed to be more avocado cream sauce, though.My wife had the Class Act burger, and it was perfect. She ordered it medium rare, and it was served precisely that way.The highlight of our table, though, was the al fredo mac and cheese. My son had the entree, which included bacon and grilled chicken. The portion was huge, and the flavor was outstanding. My wife liked it better than Slows.I had the cucumber mojito, which was delicious, but the straw was too short to reach all the way to the bottom of the glass. My wife's cucumber gimlet was great.The only thing keeping my review from 3 stars (or more) was the service. Our waitress was quick to take our order and serve the food, but after that, we had to flag her down for anything else. Sometimes twice. We ran out of water at our table, and we had to wave to her for that, we asked for a carry out box, and we had to ask her twice. Mind you, it was a good 10-15 minute wait for her to come by the second time.Worst of all, especially for the restaurant's bottom line, as we were waiting for her to bring our boxes, we overheard the waiter at the table behind us explain several specials to his table that our waitress never mentioned. She also never asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks or dessert.When the M-1 rail line opens next year, this place could be good lunch option for workers in the central business district, but the service needs to improve a lot."
8/11/2016,20160811,1,3.46,"I had very high expectations for this place, but in almost every way (except the beer selection), I would have been better off simply going to Olga's Kitchen or Champs. First, there was no one up front when we came in, near 5 minutes later of waiting in an empty restaurant someone finally came. When we got seated, they took almost an entire 15 minutes to tell us what we wanted to drink. After receiving our drinks it took another 20 min for them to come so we can give them our order. It took near 15 minutes for the appetizer to come, which was very small in quantity for the price paid (Champs was nearly 3 times the size!), and they forgot our silverware!We waited near 12 min for someone to come so we can ask for silverware, and no one came. We then decided to eat it without silverware because the food was getting cold. Near 30 minutes later, they gave us our food, but forgot to give us our drinks we ordered, and charged us for it giving us the drinks after the meal! The burgers were great, but there are many items on the menu that were mediocre for what you believe you would get for the price. If you want to hang out somewere with your friends in detroit, I would suggest another business near as this is the type that goes out of business in the near future due to bad management."
8/19/2016,20160819,5,3.48,"My review of the block is long over due. I have been coming here for a few months now. I love it! The people are so nice. The night manager is just awesome and I have never had a bad server. They have some of the best happy hour prices out there and the craft cocktails are very good. My favorite is the strawberry smash and the cucumber mojito, just tasty!One thing that really sticks out for me on there menu is the Salmon BLT. It has this cranberry walnut bread with a salmon filet, lemon garlic aioli, lettuce, tomato and bacon. Its also really good on a brioche bun. You just don't see sandwiches with a salmon filet as opposed to a salmon burger as often. I really appreciate it. Its my favorite thing to get. I give them five stars for the salmon blt and for customer service. I wish I knew that night managers name. He's awesome."
9/2/2016,20160902,5,3.51,"This is one place that I have never been disappointed by in the Midtown area. Each of the appetizers are phenomenal, salads are all filling and tasty and the cocktails are always on point! Last night I had the Pan Seared Salmon and it was sooo good - cooked perfectly and the sides complimented it well. I always sit at the bar when I go and service from the bartenders has always been excellent. Definite must try if you are in the area!"
9/16/2016,20160916,4,3.52,"Great food. Tried the vernors ribs and chicken wings. Amazing. Prices are fair. Negative: too loud and service somehow slow. Anyway, overall a great place."
10/2/2016,20161002,3,3.51,"I went to The Block after work with a large group of co-workers. The food was good. The service was ok. I had the salmon BLT and it was tasty. The salmon was cooked nicely. Other people in our group ordered the alfredo mac and cheese, burgers, and ""crispy"" calamari. The calamari was not crispy, it was quite rubbery. Everyone seemed to enjoy their sandwiches and mac and cheese. We had two servers for our group, and they seemed disorganized. The bar drinks and food arrived quickly, but a lot of errors were made. A server forgot to bring someone's soda. A lot of the plates were mixed up or given to the wrong diners. When we received the bill, we asked to split the cost equally on credit cards and our request was denied. We did not expect separate checks for the entire table, but we should have been able to split the cost. I have never seen a POS system that did not allow you to run a credit card for any specific amount.I definitely think The Block needs to put a little more effort into their customer service."
10/3/2016,20161003,3,3.5,"Came on a monday night for dinnerParking: Easy street parking. Ambiance: It's nice! I liked the interior and the bar area.Service: Attentive! This was nice since we had a big group with us. Food: Not too vegetarian friendly. No veggie appetizers at all =(They did have a couple salads, 1 sandwich and 1 main entree that were vegetarian.I got the beet ravioli. This was WAY too sweet. The sauce was creamy, but with the beets being in the ravioli, it made the dish not savory and too sweet.Had some sweet potato fries - wayyyy too salty. It was hard to eat. I would come back here out of convenience to work, but i'm not sure if i'd come back otherwise until it becomes more veggie friendly and the flavors are balanced out better."
10/23/2016,20161023,3,3.49,"Sometimes I like to wear a wig and pretend I have hair. Other times I like to wear a nice suit and tell people I'm an attorney. And sometimes on the weekends I like to wear a dress and pretend....never mind. I'm getting way ahead of myself and into daddy issues you don't wanna know about. But what you do wanna know about is how this place is. Pros: +Nice decor.+Friendly wait staff.+I heard they have a good happy hour.+Plenty of choices in their menu.+Ribs are nice and fall-off the bone.Cons:-Ribs are tender, but largely unflavorful. It would be nice if they had some kind of dry rub or bbq sauce on it. They had some green mayo sauce that they *drizzled* on, which barely tasted like anything at all. I took my leftovers home and put some Kernel's Seasons popcorn seasoning on it and the difference was night and day.-Fries taste like something I had for lunch in middle school. I mean, Wendy's has better fries. They also put my fries under my ribs, leading to soggy fries. Not cool bro, not cool.-Flavor in whitefish does not reach the meat of the fish. The cheese on it is pretty bomb, and the fish is tender, but it doesn't taste like anything. Overall this place is like me putting on a wig and playing dress up - it's just a fancy looking 70's diner. It offers nothing I haven't seen in other places, and the dishes are generic to say the least. But if you like basic, dependable, and are the kind of person that sticks to what you know works instead of trying new things, by all means go here. But if you like new experiences, break out that rubber mask and ball gag and call your dominatrix up to go elsewhere. You won't regret it. Or maybe you will.But isn't that what makes life interesting?"
11/3/2016,20161103,5,3.51,"Salmon BLT is LIT! I highly recommend! I visited The Block with co-workers for Happy Hour. Despite the food specials for HH, I was intrigued by the Salmon BLT so that's what I got! I was expecting a traditional salmon patty, but what I was served was an actual whole piece of deliciously cooked salmon. It was served with walnut/raisin bread, which was a very nice complement. The sweet potato fries were epic (some of the best I have ever had) and served with this yummy mayo sauce. Portion sizes were on the generous side (thankfully). It's a nice, cute restaurant that seems to really turn up around happy hour. My coworkers enjoyed the wings, mac&cheese, and the quesadilla. I will definitely be back to try the HH selections as well as to revisit the Salmon BLT experience.Second VISIT: WINGS ARE A1!"
11/5/2016,20161105,5,3.54,Omg what a place!!! We were walking down the street and we were drawn in by the enthusiastic waitress who had an amazing personality! What an awesome place. Great wings! It was our first year anniversary for the manager treated us with bread pudding and cheesecake! Absolutely amazing. We are so so happy with The Block and cannot wait to come back! Shout out to Kim and Blair for being so cool!
11/10/2016,20161110,4,3.54,Great black owned establishment. Great food and Michelle was a great bartender/server. Chicken quesadillas were amazing. Drinks were great too. Totally satisfied
11/18/2016,20161118,4,3.55,"Looking for a Nice spot in the Urban District, the now ""Midtown"" to grab an incredible bite to eat. The Block is it! After hearing about this, I Ventured in for myself.If you are a foodie too, this place has a great Happy Hour menu. I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla. From the First Bite I became a Fan! This Buttery Wrap had perfectly seasoned chicken with Gooey Cheese goodness, as well as melt in your mouth peppers and onions...! I'm no Sangria connoisseur, but after a suggestion and recommendations from the Bartender I had their Specialty Made Concoction - nicely served Rich Red drink-blend! (caught a glimpse of a tray passing by, see for yourself!) I tell you it was delicious...it went very well with my Buttery Sensation... It felt good to come back (to my old walking grounds!), rounding the corners to see how the area has pretty much been Retouched with new Establishments and Places to eat! I will definitely be adding the Block to my Return list.....Bravo!"
11/29/2016,20161129,5,3.57,The Block is awesome! The staff is extremely friendly. Our waiter was not getting annoyed at the millions of questions we asked and has a perfect answer every time. The drinks were well made and the food was delicious. Definitely a place you will visit more than once.
12/1/2016,20161201,3,3.56,"The food was served in a timely manner and it was good, however the waitress tried to give a inaccurate wine lesson that had more to do with her taste than mine."

The only thing I don't care for is the seating - we opted for high seats, and while high seats aren't known for comfort, these were most uncomfortable, because they have no back support. Next time I'll choose the low seats.The food was great. We'd just come from a concert near downtown, and it was very late in the evening, and we were hungry. I had the ""Shotgun Shrimp"" appetizer, and it was soooo good! I followed that with the ""Fritos Chili"" with a side of cornbread. The chili was tasty, and the cornbread was a nice accompaniment. I had ginger beer as my beverage...delicious. My friends had the ""Salmon BLT with Sweet Potato Fries"", and the ""BBQ Wings"", and were very happy with their choices.Nice crowd. Love that it's black-owned, and I'll continue to visit as long as the food, atmosphere and service remain on point."

It has a nice chill atmosphere as well. Most other places around here that aren't expensive are pretty low quality, and the expensive places have no business charging as much as they do for the quality of theirs. This is definitely the only place that I feel has very reasonable prices for amazing tasting food. Definitely give it a try!"

I also tried the pear and fennel salad. The salad was good and there was enough for two people. My friend ordered wings and the alfredo mac n cheese. We shared it and I enjoyed that too. For the price during happy hour, overall I had a delicious meal. I will definitely make this one of my usual spots."
12/31/2016,20161231,3,3.67,"Perfect for a quick bite to eat and a few drinks. The wings are pretty good if they are done! The mac and cheese is alright. The drink menu is a bit different, but they will surprise you with a well mixed spirit! Service was fast and on point."

1/16/2017,20170116,4,3.66,"Another cool new place to try in Detroit! This place is small but offers a full menu and bar. I arrived around 6 in a Friday and wanted to sit in the bar area. The hostess was extremely nice and accommodating! I only had to wait a few minutes for a high table in the bar area. The food menus offers delicious comfort food type options like Alfredo Mac & Cheese and ribs with a white BBQ verbose sauce. However, I decided on the smoke house BBQ burgers, yum. It came with seasoned-to-perfection fries. I also enjoyed two blood orange margaritas! The service was quick, polite and attentive. I definitely want to go back to try the Mac and cheese!"

A few of my friends have gone there and talked about how amazing it was and they were correct. We went at about 6:45pm, so the HAPPY HOUR crowd (Who was a tad bit loud and obnoxious) was there, but after they cleared out, the Dining crowd was kool and the vibe was good. I had the Mac and Cheese, with Bacon and Chicken...soooo good. My friend had the Chicken wings and enjoyed them. I will go back"

2/4/2017,20170204,5,3.69,"Amazing restaurant!! The service, interior of the restaurant, and food/drinks all exceeded expectations. I noticed that they have a $1,$3,$5 happy hour menu with drinks and apps that sounded appealing. Can't wait to go back and try more items from the menu. Literally everything looked amazing, and as far as the meal I ordered, I've never eaten so much in my life!"

This place has a nice happy hour special in the bar area Monday through Friday. The place has a nice ambience and a clean streamlined decor. Parking is a bit annoying, but they do offer discounts in a parking structure for ease."

2/17/2017,20170217,4,3.71,Cute new hidden gem right in the heart of Mid Town Detroit. The place has a rustic chic vibe and cute decor. My friend and I ordered a cilantro chicken salad. I'm pretty picky with chicken and this was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and blackened with great seasoning. The dressings are also all made it house. The salad was delicious and s great portion. We also split a side of the Alfredo Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese looked like typical Mac and cheese. I didn't taste or see anything Alfredo about it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about... no pun intended. Prices are fair and service was friendly/attentive. I'd come back again and try their burger and sandwhich selection.
2/17/2017,20170217,5,3.73,Very good food and even better service. I had the chicken and my wife had the salmon. Both very good.

2/24/2017,20170224,5,3.75,Delish lunch today after the DSO with my mom. We ordered the Pear and Fennel salad to split and the salmon with bacon BLT and sweet potato fries! What a wonderful meal. Fantastic service! Nice vibe.
2/24/2017,20170224,4,3.76,Really liked our dinner.  Good menu choices & as an alternative burger person the Turkey burger was a good one. A little slow on the service though.
2/26/2017,20170226,4,3.76,Visited for brunch today. The food was good. Service was a bit slow but it seemed understaffed. Great bottomless mimosa deal
3/3/2017,20170303,5,3.77,"Epic eating spot in mid town Detroit, ,, Wowsa I say the Happy Hour special rules. Best I've had in Detroit City proper for sure. Look got all this and 4 Beer's for 20 bucks yeah baby Outrageous Mac n Cheese, Calamari, Chicken Quesadilla and those Whole Wings drenched in addictive Garlic Parm Sauce OMG these rock, a must try. Going back really soon, don't miss Detroit Cities best Happy Hour. #theblockdetroit #macncheese #happyhour #garlicparmwings #dinedrinkdetroit #detroit"
3/10/2017,20170310,4,3.77,"OK, I just visited this place yesterday, upon walking in we were greeted with great customer service and seated promptly. The decor is nice with exposed brick and a nice contemporary swanky bar...IT was nice. We made it in during happy hour and they have $5 ""you call it"" drinks, dollar beers, $3 wine's, and $5 appetizers ( I had the wings) yum! As far as our server goes, we had ""Nick"" and he was very attentive and knowledgeable about all the drinks and food items. This go round... I tried the ""shot gun shrimp"", ""shrimp and grits"" & ""tomato bisque"". The shot gun shrimp we're just ok to me and that's because I really don't care for sweet stuff and I prefer battered shrimp of a softer consistency over crunchy but they were ok so, l ate the majority of them. NOW...The ""shrimp and grits"" were the BOMB and the tomato bisque was delicious! Over all, I had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back. My only complaint is that they only have one bathroom stall and the parking is in a parking structure with a door right next to the restaurant that LOCKS after a certain time (NOT SURE WHAT TIME) therefore, instead of just walking out and going through a door that leads to the structure...you have to walk around the corner to enter...ok, I hope this helps you. Thanks for reading!"
3/12/2017,20170312,4,3.77,Very cute place. Service was great. The only complaint I have about this place is that we made a reservation and we were not told that you cannot split checks for more than 6 people. But the food was definitely something I would go back for.
3/22/2017,20170322,3,3.77,"The Block was OK. I came here to grab a bite and drinks with friends. I ordered a burger and fries a cocktail and we shared the Mac and cheese with shrimp.  The service was poor, but the food was pretty good. My server made a few mistakes on our order and blamed the table. She argued with us for a while, which I found was counterproductive LOL.Food, good. Service, eh. would definitely recommend people to try it our though."
4/1/2017,20170401,1,3.74,Horrible customer service! The staff is completely un accommodating. The male host is attitudinal and rude. I will never return to this establishment.
4/3/2017,20170403,4,3.74,Mac n cheese made me cry a little just cuz how good it was. Burger and fries were good too. Not great but definitely give it a go.
4/4/2017,20170404,3,3.74,"Not really my cup of tea... It's too in between a bar and a restaurant, and neither thing is that well done. I went for happy hour and the specials are pretty good, but I probably won't be back."
4/11/2017,20170411,5,3.75,Best happy hour in town. And Deanna is the best waitress I've ever had! The food is tasty too. Block mac and cheese and wings! Can't beat it! (Unless they bring back my garlic parm sauce. The wings were 100 times better 2 months ago.
4/16/2017,20170416,3,3.74,"We arrived at 11:15am on a Thursday and were quickly seated since we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Even with that it didn't keep the waitress from forgetting to place our appetizer order. This was realized when the side salads that we'd ordered with our sandwiches arrived from the kitchen first. The salad was forgettable, and the blue cheese dressing runny and bland. When the shotgun shrimp appetizer finally arrived, we realized it was well worth the wait. Absolutely delicious. I also ordered the salmon BLT and was wowed. Now this is a sandwich. Perfectly cooked salmon, crispy bacon, citrus aioli all on cranberry walnut bread equal perfection. Seriously. I kid you not. The bread was the perfect accompaniment to complete this sandwich. I want another sandwich as I type this! My friend had the catfish po 'boy and we were not as impressed. The cornmeal coating was too crunchy and the catfish itself was watery and near tasteless. The remoulade sauce was not good at all. I can't even describe its taste, but it's not the traditional remoulade sauce I'm familiar with. This po 'boy does have one of the best presentations I've seen of a sandwich though (see pic). For dessert, we shared the brownie sundae and caramel fudge cheesecake. We enjoyed both of these also. If my review were based on the shotgun shrimp and salmon BLT, it would be 4 stars, but we're returning just for those two things."
4/18/2017,20170418,5,3.75,"All I have to say is amazing. I love the Smokehouse burger, Sweet Chili or Buffalo Wings, Alfredo Mac & Cheese with Shrimp added. In fact I'm stopping by today for me. Happy Hour is approaching!!!!!"
4/29/2017,20170429,1,3.73,"I just left this restaurant absolutely insulted. The host and manager were the two most unprofessional individuals that I have ever meet. We were told that it was going to be a 45 minute wait with no one waiting but us. The host asked if we were going to wait. I said sure since we were the only one's waiting. She then replied, well we just seated folks so we don't know how long they will take to eat. So we moved to the section to wait. We saw two tables open, cleaned and reset. Still no one came for us. My brother-in law inquired and then was shown a book by the manager that had folks with reservations. Then as my brother in law walked back to our party, the manager and host physically mocked him. How unprofessional!!! A waitress walked by me and I asked for another manager or the owner. She turned and looked at the manager and said that he wasn't the manager and the manager was in the back. I requested to speak with the manager. The waitresses left and when she returned, she went to clean another open table. I walked up to her and inquired if the manager was coming to speak with me, she said he was the manager and that he told her that he had already addressed our concerns. I said to the young lady, I would have appreciated that she would have shared that information with me. The manager then walked up and said that I could leave and that he could tell that I was hostile. I never raised my voice or yelled nor use inappropriate language or threatening body language and same for my members of my party (2adults and 2girls). I responded calmly and said, we are leaving and yes I was upset, but that he should know that it was never about the wait. We brought our daughters down to enjoy a nice meal and then we were on our way to the theater. I shared with him that I felt that the host and he had produced a hostile environment. I shared with him how I and other folks in the restaurant witness his behavior when my brother in-law left from inquiring about empty tables. I shared that several friends had recommended this restaurant and how disappointed I was regarding his behavior and the hostess. He listened and apologized while moving items on the empty table and waited for us to leave the restaurant. We stood for a total of 30 minutes to then be asked to leave because we inquired about the empty tables. We end up at McDonalds before the theater. This situation left a horrible impression for the girls and all that were impacted by the host and manager's unprofessional behavior. Great food is what I was told, but the customer service was so horrible that I was actually asked to leave. Wow!!! I hope the owners read this review for I would never want any customer to be asked to leave because they asked a question."
5/20/2017,20170520,1,3.7,"Never got to try the food because the service was just so terrible. I made a reservation by phone for a birthday dinner - and they were unable to find our reservation. There were plenty of empty tables, however They were unable to seat us- and were extremely rude to us. The hostess and server were snotty and uptight- unwilling to make any accommodations. we asked if they wanted to lose our business and they said they simply did not care. what a terrible experience. We will never return."
5/27/2017,20170527,5,3.71,"Love the food, love the ambiance! Shot to Nick my waiter!!loved U and you just can't bet the price!"
5/27/2017,20170527,4,3.72,Met my co workers here for weekday happy hour. We enjoyed the happy hour menu so much. I finally decided to order the fish Po boy it was good but too much bun. The atmosphere was nice. Not to crowd. The service was ok. Waitress seemed a little irritated at times but I would come back again.
6/2/2017,20170602,4,3.72,"I came here for happy hour recently and had a great time. Loved the location, vibe, and service. I tried the shrimp appetizer (amazing, wish it came with more), block Mac (tasted more like a chicken carbonara dish... it was pretty good), and the Salmon burger (the cucumbers made it taste like a bougie Damon croquet... that was aright too). Because the shrimp were so good, I'd be willing to come back. It gave me faith that there are some gems in the menu!Oh, the blueberry Long Island was great. Strong and tasty."
6/4/2017,20170604,5,3.73,We had DSO tickets and were looking for a place within walking distance from Orchestra Hall.I remembered The Block and do made reservations.We were seated right away and told our seated vet we were in a hurry. We were served in time to make the performance and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
6/5/2017,20170605,4,3.73,"I've been a couple of times at different times of the day and week. No matter what day or time the food is amazing!! Their chicken wings are cooked to perfection, the calamari was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh and an added plus is their extensive bar. They also have a Sunday brunch that is just as delicious. I had the Chicken and waffles with mango mimosa's!! YUMMM! I love the fact that it has a laid back vibe too. I would definitely suggest you try this place."
7/9/2017,20170709,5,3.74,"Came here for brunch today and we all loved our meals. We started the with coffee and sweet potato muffins and they were amazing!! Everything on the menu looked good, and in the group of 5 we tried 4 different meals that everyone loved! Staff was super friendly from the minute we walked in and the place got packed for brunch quickly! But service and timeliness of food was perfect. Also- they have almost bottomless mimosas (4 refills) for only 13$!"
7/10/2017,20170710,4,3.75,"We visited The Block for happy hour and dinner, before a show at the Majestic Theater. Very close to the theater, just a block away. Small contemporary dining space, with a bar and nice happy hour. We chose a four top table in the bar, as required for happy hour. Limited happy hour menu but something for everyone. If nothing you like, the drink prices aren't outrageous. The wings were a surprise - not saucy, large whole wing with nice flavor, garnished with green onion. The mac N cheese is a must. Some can be bland and over cooked, but not this one. Not too heavy on the sharp or smoke cheese flavor; went well with the wings. Calamari are in strips, not rings. Nicely cooked, not overdone. For dinner I had the shrimp and grits. Mediums sized shrimps on a bed of cheesy grits. Good but I was pretty full from the appetizers. The burgers are huge! Hubs put his together then had a hard time eating it. It's surely a mouth full. There are many places around The Block to hit for eat and drinks. Their advantage is the stellar happy hour - though I do wish they would choose a better white for the special. It wasn't very good. Our waitress was hilarious and just great. I wish I could remember her name. She kept us laughing. Get there early to get yourself a table. They fill up fast."
7/23/2017,20170723,3,3.74,My food was good even though crab cakes were very small. My waitress was not friendly!!! Staff was just hanging out at the hostess stand.
7/31/2017,20170731,1,3.72,"We had a bad experience! I made reservations for 5:30 PM, when we got there the place was almost empty. It was early for dinner. When we came in the host was on his phone texting and did not acknowledge us at all, other than throwing our menus on a table and never even making eye contact. The waitress came over, and was friendly at first. Once we ordered happy hour items we were later informed that we had to move in order to get the happy hour prices. We collected our items and moved 2 tables over to get the happy hour deals. While waiting we noticed another group of folks come in on their way to the Tigers game(this was a Friday night 7/28/17). That group was seated and they waited approximately 15 minutes to be served. Sadly they never got past waters and the group of 4 left out. At this point my friend and I had been there for an hour and still had not received our appetizers nor had we heard back from our waitress. We had to search the place for her. Once found, we cancelled our food and paid for our drinks and left. 6 people including myself and friend left the establishment that afternoon between 5:30 and 6:30 PM. I'm sure none of us will EVER return. Poor customer service is DEATH to an establishment, especially on a Tiger game night. We ended up going to Mexican Village where we were promptly waited on! The food came out in less than 10 minutes. A floor manager checked up on us and the staff there was friendly. Midtown Detroit must do better! I will never return to The Block, which is sad. The food on the other tables looked so good!"
8/1/2017,20170801,2,3.7,"I only had happy hour. It was ok. The Happy hour only include beer, a house red, and a house white. Deals on apps are so so as well."
8/5/2017,20170805,3,3.7,"I went to The Block for a second time for lunch today. The wings were $11 for five whole wings. During happy hour the wings were $6. The first time I went there they had garlic parmesan cheese sauce as a choice for the wings. This time no more parmesan cheese sauce... bummer. I also had the mac n cheese. It was hot and cheesy, but a little too salty. I asked if they still validated tickets, if you park in the structure around the corner. They did when I was there the first time. They do not anymore. Totally different experience eight months later."
8/12/2017,20170812,3,3.69,"I ordered the salmon BLT here and shared a shrimp mac and cheese with my wife. I really expected more from this place from the reviews I've seen but it wasn't that special. The server we had messed up our orders and we had to wait an extra 15 minutes on top of the 30 we we're already waiting just because she mixed up our orders. Then she argued a little with us about how we were at fault, which we found to be really counterproductive. Overall the food was good but the service was awful, but I'd still give this place a try if I were you, it's not THAT bad."
8/14/2017,20170814,3,3.69,Closed on Mondays apparently. Took an Uber down here to find out. Yelp shows that they are open...
8/30/2017,20170830,1,3.66,"I've been to this restaurant two other times and the service was great, however on Tuesday 8-29-2017, the service was horrible. The waitress Christine was not a good waitress at all, she took forever bringing our food, as a matter of fact I had to ask the concierge at the front door to see how long it would be; by the way we were the only two in the restaurant at the time. She never came back to the table to ask if we needed anything else to drink and my mom had to ask her three times for her coffee. I will go back, but she definitely will not be my server. That I will make clear. My mom said she will never come there again and we should have went to Zef's which was down the street and had better service as well as the food. This day they get a thumbs down, for a lousy waitress. She needs to be retrained."
8/31/2017,20170831,5,3.67,The Block is very tasteful. The presentation there is everything. My 2 favorite appetizers are the shotgun shrimp and the spinach dip. The cocktails are made to perfection. Majority of the menu is excellent but the most popular are the Vernor's ribs and the barbecue chicken. Any time someone comes into town it is my pleasure to take them to the block.
9/3/2017,20170903,2,3.66,Well maybe if i would of dined in the Food would of been better!!... The Wings were Dry as if they had been sitting a while. The Mac/Cheese!! Blah Too Bland... The PoBoy Sandwich.. Tasted Poor!! The Restaurant seemed nice!!!
9/9/2017,20170909,4,3.66,I would have given them a 5 but the service is very slow. My favorite is the salmon. I have tried it several different ways and it is always great. I also love the pear salad. I typically get it topped with salmon. The noise level is a little loud but not too much.
9/11/2017,20170911,5,3.67,"This place is truly a hidden gem. Their brunch is small but perfect and the food completely matched. Our David was the bomb. Com, very attentive and completely amazing. He knew his menu, our drinks were never empty and we were all very happy. I can't express how much we liked the environment this past Sunday. I'm glad I didn't base my visit off the reviews. Another highlight is a Dj because they do a brunch and boozy event Sunday's. Take my advice and go to the block on the block."
9/20/2017,20170920,5,3.68,Quick stop for a cocktail. Yummy craft cocktails and daily mystery cocktail is an awesome bargain. Love the decor and big windows to watch the hustle bustle of Woodward in Midtown. Appetizer menu was super diverse and the presentation of the food was tip notch!
9/23/2017,20170923,2,3.67,"Honestly. It was so mediocre. The service (like everyone says) is SUPER slow. It was funny, I read the reviews and one person said their drinks were never empty. Well. Ours were never full. I asked for water once. The second time I didn't even ask. Am I wrong, I feel like the server should notice that. Ours was talking to the host and couldn't care much less about us. I got a burger that came w bacon and cheese on it. I didn't eat the bun so I used my fork and knife to cut it. The cheese and bacon just sat on top. It wasn't even melted. I'm sorry half ass. Nobody there seemed interested in customer service. We will not be back."
10/3/2017,20171003,3,3.67,"Pros: Within walking distance of the new Little Caesar's Arena... adequate service... small but interesting menu... decent vibe.Cons: Parking is sketchy... menu is small... and, all beers cost the same, which makes no sense at all.Stopped in before the Paul McCartney show and had a very good Salmon BLT with a couple of pints of PBR. The Mac & Cheese was also very good as was (I heard) the Shrimp & Grits. If you're heading to the LCA, give it a try."
10/8/2017,20171008,4,3.67,"So my girlfriend and I came here as a last min choice for brunch but it should have been the first. Let me start off with the appetizer; we had home made pita chips with spinach three cheese dip. So simple but so delicious, definitely one of the best appetizers I've had . I ordered the chicken & waffles which was good too, waffles are rich and filling, apple pie similarity as far as taste ! Again, delicious . 8/10My gf had the cure, a waffle and egg sandwich combined with their maple syrup was AMAZING, with a side of potato gems so delicious. Overall the food, service and even the music selection was more than exceptional. The Block - 8.5/10!!!!I'm definitely coming back !"
10/8/2017,20171008,4,3.67,"Had lunch there last Friday with some fellow former WSU co-workers around noon at WSU. and were quickly seated and ordered drinks. The Blow your face off IPA was very good and food and service were excellent. Two of us had the salmon-pistachio topped with a mild white sauce which came with white rice and sauteed asparagus & carrots. Others had parmesan crusted whitefish and a shrimp po-boy. Everyone liked their food and portions were appropriate for the prices. Shortly after we arrived, droves of people kept showing up. Mostly older retiree types which is rather puzzling to me, but they were quickly seated but I suspect they had a much longer wait than we did for their food. The atmosphere was rather dull and sterile and seating not particularly comfortable. But based on the quality of food and service, I think this place will be a hit in the Midtown dining scene."
10/14/2017,20171014,1,3.65,"First time at this place, the restaurant was half empty however we waited 30 minutes to be seated... We had 12 ppl with us however they only can seat tables of 8 at the most.. Ok, got it. But when we do get seated, they seat us at two tables pushed together with....11 seats. So we basically could have actually sat together. It took the waitress about 15 minutes to bring us water, then another 15 to come take our order. Then an hour for us to get our food. We order a side of fries, side Mac N cheese, two brownie sundaes and two veggie burgers.... An hour??? Again, not crowed AT ALL. First impression was a bust....I'll probably never go back again. I need to just cook more at home... SMH..."
10/18/2017,20171018,5,3.66,"I had an amazing time at The Block. Our waitress Dea was very hospitable and her recommendations were perfect. Our food was extremely delicious. A last minute birthday celebration turned into an amazing night with the perfect food, waitress and atmosphere. I will definitely be back and would recommend this spot to anyone inquiring."
10/19/2017,20171019,5,3.67,"Went here for Dine Drink Detroit week. Wow, yummy. We had Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. Best I have ever eaten. For dinner we had the Pistachio encrusted salmon and the Steak Frites. Again, cooked perfectly, great flavors and not too much food. It was just right. Good service. We will be back."
10/25/2017,20171025,1,3.65,"I was quite disappointed with this restaurant. A few friends and I gathered here for dinner Friday night and we had absolutely the worst service. No one was asked for drinks or water till about 15 minutes after we sat down. No waitress or host came to our table till we specifically stopped and asked someone. When we did receive our food, the runner was very rude on several occasions. We asked for ketchup and mustard three times, and received no response. We ended up waiting about 10 minutes and then one of us went to the bar to get it ourselves. The food was surprisingly not bad, but none of us will go back due to the complete lack of customer service. Please improve staff training and attitude!"
11/1/2017,20171101,4,3.65,Pretty good atmosphere and happy hour spot. Service is good and their happy hour specials are amazing. I usually get the salmon burger and fries.
12/5/2017,20171205,5,3.66,"Best wings in Detroit, hands down. I wish I had taken a photo to add to the review, but I inhaled them. The GM welcomed me at the door, and the service was top notch. I hope there are more establishments like this to come in the Midtown area. So happy to see my old stomping grounds on the rise!"
12/5/2017,20171205,4,3.67,The food and service was very good. Had the Spanish in R choke dip for an appetizer which was very tasty the chips were a little salty. For the main bill had the tilapia with the parmesan crusted excellent choice very tasty and meaty The food came out in a timely manner and the ambience was very nice.
12/7/2017,20171207,4,3.67,"We went here for a girls night with reservations and were seated right away. The ambience was cute, it was a small restaurant but we really liked the vibe. The only thing is, that I wished the waitress knew more about the food, because when asked about what was good, she was unsure. I usually like recommendations. I got the salmon burger, it was a little salty and dry. I was hoping they had the chicken and waffles like on yelp but must be a seasonal thing. Everyone else enjoyed their dish and I had samples of theirs. We got the pistachio salmon, steak frites, and a vegetarian version of the mac and cheese which was really good. I would come back and try a different dish for sure!"
12/14/2017,20171214,5,3.68,"Wow the shrimp appetizer was really really good and so was the spinach dip!!!! I had the shrimp and grits, yummy but felt like it needed a sauce. The chicken Mac pasta dish with bacon was excellent (Block Mac) it was worth it. You will enjoy. Staff was very attentive and friendly."
12/16/2017,20171216,5,3.69,Great spot to grab a drink and a nice-but-reasonably-priced dinner. Friendly service. The whitefish is smashing.
12/17/2017,20171217,2,3.68,"The food was just OK, I would not drive out of my way to eat here. I ordered grilled cheese sandwich and creamy tomato soup.  The soup was not creamy but it was extremely salty and the cheese wasn't even melted.  My husband ordered a burger, it wasn't anything Spectacular."
12/28/2017,20171228,5,3.68,"Great food, fun and atmosphere! They have happy hour from 4-6. Parking free on Selden or across the street on Woodward. Stop by sometime."
1/16/2018,20180116,3,3.68,"The apple slaw was #Delicious!!!!!!!! Other than that i was underwhelmed. I was hoping to be blown away by the food.... but sadly it was just :-/ (meh) . I ordered the sticky ribs, Scallops and potato hash."
1/21/2018,20180121,4,3.68,"Very cute restaurant. I have been trying to go here for a while. I didn't check to see if they were closed on a monday, and another time they weren't taking tables during their switch from lunch to dinner. Finally my friend and I were able to go! We were greeted at the front and offered happy hour which included select beer $2, wine $4, and apps $6. You have to be sitting in the bar area, there are high tops as well.We ordered the calamari app. It was not traditional dish. It was the strips that were breaded with a sweet chili sauce. Very tasty though. Our waitress did take some time to get our order, but we were in no rush. I ordered the salmon and my friend got the chicken sandwich. We both really enjoyed our meals.The salmon was cooked wonderfully and the veggies had a little too much seasoning for my liking but were still good. My friend says their breakfast is worth the visit, so hopefully I will be back soon. It is a little hard on a college budget and the endless options of detroit eateries. Definitely worth the visit if I were you!"
1/22/2018,20180122,5,3.69,"Great food and atmosphere, we will definitely be returning in the near future!! The staff was friendly and efficient."
1/29/2018,20180129,3,3.69,"First time here and while the food (salmon blt, the mac, and crab cakes) was great, the service was not. From the time we walked through the door. The greeter or lack there of was definitely not the friendliest. The waitress had a don't care attitude as well and billed us all wrong then had the nerve to question it. All in all the food was amazing but some of the people on staff made it hard to enjoy the first time experience. Kudos to the cooks."
2/5/2018,20180205,4,3.69,"Literally stumbled upon this place this past weekend. My siblings and I were looking for someplace to eat before the Pistons game and walked right past this place, looked in the window and decided to check it out!Nice vibe in here, we were greeted and seated within two minutes of walking in. There is a good size bar with seats along with tables lining the wall. The kitchen is somewhat open air so we you see what is going on. I had the vegetarian burger and it was delicious. It was not the traditional black bean, it was nice to have a little change. I really enjoyed my food.Our waitress Tanyalyn was amazing. She knew EVERYTHING about the menu, we had a question and she had an answer. She is a star. This place is great for a small group lunch or a get together with the girls over wine. I look forward to my next visit!"
2/15/2018,20180215,4,3.69,"Very good customer service. Even though we weren't pleased with the lamb chops, we were able to get them replaced with wings which were enjoyed and the waitress bought us a brownie. The manager was really nice and the place has a nice setting and ambiance! I love it's location as well. I had the salmon dinner which was decent as well. Just need to work on cooking to the requested amount (ex: medium not well done) which was incorrect for both orders. Overall I'd go back."
2/17/2018,20180217,2,3.68,"I order the burger and added bacon and asked for no tomato. No bacon was added , tomato was still added even though I requested no tomato. Over all ambiance was very nice. Service wasn't bad, but it was not all that great either. Service is extremely slow, so don't plan anything after dinner. My suggestion, is don't get too excited to visit."
2/25/2018,20180225,4,3.68,Had breakfast at the block one of the mornings. If you've read any of our previous stories you know I'm a little obsessed with breakfast and this definitely hit the spot. Got the chicken and waffles and I can't complain at all. They also had these delicious sweet potato muffins that came with our breakfast. If you eat there and they ask if you want the sweet potato muffins your answer is yes. Trust me you'll thank me.whiskeytramp.com/blog/20…
3/18/2018,20180318,2,3.67,"We went here for happy hour on a Friday, and arrived before the after-work crowd filled up the restaurant. Our beers took a good 15 minutes to arrive after we ordered them, despite an abundance of staff and no rush of other customers. Service was friendly, but exceedingly slow given we only ordered drinks. Also, no prices or details on the drink menu, which is just a personal peeve."
3/22/2018,20180322,5,3.68,"I love this place. Food is well prepared, well plated and delicious. This is the kind of laid back neighborhood joint where you could come thru several times a week. The drinks are on point and the menu does a great job of accommodating gluten allergies. There are several great options including a warm gf brownie with vanilla bean ice cream. The scallops, pan roasted chicken, lamb chops are just three of many great entrees on the menu. The service is great, too."
3/25/2018,20180325,5,3.69,"Went back to this place yesterday for the second time and once again EVERYTHING was excellent.. The entire wait staff is polite, the restaurant itself is beautiful and the food is out of this world. The ribs are fall off of bone good and the spinach dip is to die for... If you have not eaten here, do yourself a favor and eat there."
4/2/2018,20180402,3,3.68,"Had dinner here once. The service was good, the food was ok. I wanted to try a new restaurant in the city since my mom had came in from out of town. She enjoyed her catfish po boy and my sister enjoyed her salmon burger, but I wasn't excited about my shrimp pasta dish.."
4/14/2018,20180414,1,3.67,"Absolutely done. I just had the worst service of all time in this restaurant. I stood for 30 minutes with my party of 6 and watched as tables cleared. A friend of mine asked when we would be able to sit down and the host said ""it will be fifteen minutes"" she asked why we couldn't sit at the multitude of open tables, he said ""it will be fifteen minutes"" in the most rude tone you could think of. This is the second time I have had bad service here recently. After the way the host spoke to my friend today, I will never come back here. My office often ordered the block for lunch, I was in charge of that, I won't be giving them our business anymore."
4/17/2018,20180417,1,3.65,"Horrible service! Appetizers came before drinks arrived. Waitress was inattentive! Beer sizes were not the same. 2 totally different size glasses. Quesadilla appetizer was great! To add insult to injury, our dinner NEVER ARRIVED!!! No need to return!"
4/18/2018,20180418,4,3.65,"Last minute dinner plans with S. and no preferences, we picked The Block on Woodward in Midtown. This Michigan winter refuses to leave and the menu mentioned comfort food dishes, so it just made sense. We started with spinach dip with puffy fried pita bread. Soooo good. S. ordered their house burger which looked juicy despite being well-done. I had a piping hot large bowl of cheesy grits and Cajun shrimp. This is one of the few reasonable decisions I made this week. This is good for a casual or date night place. It feels like a good fit for Detroit."
4/22/2018,20180422,5,3.66,"My wife and I and another couple had reservations for an early dinner last night before a DSO concert. We were seated promptly and were greeted immediately and pleasantly by our server, Ryan.We advised him we had concert tickets, which really wasn't an issue since The Max is a block away.We ordered cocktails, which were terrific and very reasonably priced.Ryan suggested certain dishes like the spinach dip with homemade pita chips and the salmon entree. I tried both and Ryan's recommendations were spot on.Service was remarkably fast considering that the restaurant was packed. The restaurant was well-staffed and the kitchen manager was on top of appetizers and entrees coming out hot. Just a note: I appreciate a server asking me how I like my fish prepared. My wife likes her fish well done, while I like a mine more medium. Our salmon was identified according to our preference and each of our dishes was cooked perfectly.   We had a great experience and look forward to visiting The Block again soon"
4/23/2018,20180423,5,3.67,My party had a great experience! The food and service was great! I loved my lamb chops'
4/27/2018,20180427,1,3.65,"Went here for lunch with 5 colleagues and not only did it take close to an hour to get our food, it took an extra 30 min to get our bills as our waitress was nowhere to be found. On top of that we weren't inform that gratuity had already been added (as there menu states tables of 8 or more). So I had left a hearty tip just to find out it was on top of a already 18% tip. Needless to say I will not be going back."
4/30/2018,20180430,5,3.66,"I stopped in here to grab a quick drink and a snack with some friends before heading over to a meeting. I'd been inside like two times before but never had anything more than water, so I'm glad that finally changed. It's perfectly located on Woodward right around Mack Ave and there's parking on every street so it's not difficult to get to. The inside is gorgeous with lots of seating available and is full of natural light from all the huge windows that look out onto the street. I wish it would have been happy hour when we got in but we were just about an hour too early. But their happy hour menu looks suuuuuper legit so I'm definitely going to have to come back for some of that. I ended up just getting a side of mac and cheese and their mystery drink, that I forgot to write down but I know it had gin in it. I was very pleased with the cheesiness/creaminess of the mac. It was very comforting and the green onions on top were a nice touch. And my drink was nice and strong from what I can remember, so I'll definitely be having more drinks and much more to eat here."
5/20/2018,20180520,4,3.66,"I've been wanting to check this place out, and Sunday afternoon was the only time I could get here. Only a brunch menu was available, which is totally cool with me, but it did limit what I could get. Fortunately, the food is excellent. Since it was a Sunday brunch, I got crab cakes and eggs. The crab cakes were tasty...not as much crab as I would have l wanted, but reasonable for the modest price. My wife's salmon burger was fantastic: the toasted bun was like the best garlic bread I've ever had, and the salmon was cooked perfectly.But, the most fun I had was with the Bloody Mary Bar. They give you a mason jar with a bunch of vodka, and you get to add whatever you want to it. The tomato juice mix itself was good enough to stand on its own, but it was a blast building my drink with bacon, pickles, green onion, cheese...there was maybe too much in the glass, but it was fun!My wife didn't mind that I took my time making my drink: she got the seriously yummy strawberry mimosa, which gave you 4 drinks for $15. After 3, she was tipsy.I think The Block is getting more business than they expected: they were jamming for a Sunday afternoon, and the staff was not quite up to the job of keeping a whole room full of customers happy. Some places don't seem to understand that, no matter how good the food is, customers won't come back if the service is bad. The good news is that the food is so good that we'll definitely be back.SECOND VISIT: this time, we got an excellent waitress. The food was awesome, as it was last time, but the service just made things so much better. I got the flat iron steak and eggs, and the steak was prepared perfectly. We also got sweet potato muffins, with a cinnamon butter, and it was amazing. This wasn't on the menu, so make sure to ask for itFOURTH VISIT: We came here during the week, when they had their regular menu. As much as I love the brunch menu, the dinner menu was a welcome surprise. My lamb chops were buttery soft, with a robust gravy. The accompanying roasted asparagus served mainly to provide a fresh alternative to the richness, but the chops were so good that it hardly mattered. The walleye my wife ordered was good, and a nice lighter alternative to the chops, but the vinegary tomato stomped on the delicate flavors.We ended with a cinnamon French toast with ice cream dessert that's as rich as it sounds. Black coffee was a perfect accompaniment."
5/21/2018,20180521,3,3.66,I have been here twice; once for lunch and once for happy hour. My most recent visit at happy hour was okay the calamari was good my wine was good and I had a green tea shot. My girlfriends and I said at the bar for a couple of hours and the service was okay. I would visit this place again.
5/23/2018,20180523,4,3.66,"Food was really good, but service was slow. Would go back but be sure to give yourself plenty of time."
5/24/2018,20180524,2,3.65,"I dined at this restaurant not too long ago. My friends and I went for Sunday brunch. Now I want to start off by saying, that I had heard so many great reviews about this place for months. I was super excited for the next time I would be in the downtown area to experience the food. I am not exaggerating, when I say that my friends and I waited two hours for the Sunday brunch. The place is small, so my friends and I, accompanied with two other groups of people were all smashed in the entry way of the restaurant, just standing and waiting. One of the greeters finally asked us to move over, to allow other patrons to come in and put their name on the list. Where were we going to move over to? There was a hallway where some chairs were, but other groups of people were in that hallway waiting as well. I felt so bad that it was like we were literally hovering over people and their food while we waited. So we debated if we should leave, or stay. We had already paid for parking, and didn't feel like finding somewhere else to go downtown. Plus, I just felt like I had to have this wonderful experience of food. So after the 2 hour wait, we were finally seated. I ordered The Cure brunch selection with sweet potato muffins on the side, and a side of the Woodward BBQ Wings. Now the food was good! Not over the top as I was told, but I did like the food. My friends also like the food that they ordered. There was also a DJ, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant, I could vibe too. But I was just too turned off and irritated by how long the wait was. Now, I would try this place again b/c there are so many other menu items I've read reviews about that I want to try. But I will not go for brunch anymore, b/c maybe that was just too many people that they couldn't accommodate."
6/5/2018,20180605,5,3.66,"My spouse and I tried this restaurant out for Detroit Restaurant Week. I was highly impressed with the food, the shrimp and grits is delicious. The service was attentive and courteous. The menu was limited because of restaurant week, but I am excited to visit this establishment again to try the full menu."
6/26/2018,20180626,4,3.66,"A bit pricey and portions were kinda small but the food was very good. The spinach and artichoke dip was amazing, I would go back just for that. The servers were very friendly and the place is clean and nice."
7/19/2018,20180719,3,3.66,"First time here. Went with my oldest daughter we wanted to try somewhere new so we tried here. The service was excellent the food takes a bit long to get though. The place was clean it's small to me but still enough room. The food is hit and miss. We ordered the Shot Gun Shrimps which was just okay for me I feel the sauce they use should be also given on the side it needed more sauce. I was also expecting it to be spicy because of the name but it's not. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese which was the star of everything it was delicious! Then there was the Crab Cakes they were good but wanted them fried harder and the sauce was kinda bland but we ate them anyways. Next was the Chicken Tacos the meat tasted like nothing they need to do better on that and the green aoli sauce they give with it there is no flavor at all I ended up using the sauce from the shrimps on the tacos to help it out. They have a great concept there but they need to do something about their sauces they are too bland add some flavor to it so we can be wowed! Overall I'm glad I tried it, I probably won't go back, but if I did it would be for happy hour only. For 50.00 and some change you gotta come better than this!"
7/22/2018,20180722,2,3.65,"Staff and atmosphere were very nice. I ordered the crab cakes for brunch and couldn't finish. Offered to my husband and he also could not finish it. The crab tasted more like fish and that was essentially the only flavor. The entire dish (including the potatoes) needed salt. I rarely add extra salt to anything, but it was like literally none was used. Would not return."
8/5/2018,20180805,3,3.64,Food was slow arriving but service was good. The Mac n cheese was delicious but other items like the chicken tacos were not.
8/12/2018,20180812,5,3.65,"My waitress KAYLA was amazing! I informed her of my food allergies and she went above and beyond to make sure that the proper accommodations were made in order to prepare my food. Her customer service was impeccable! We wanted for nothing in her care. Oh did I mention, EVERYTHING we ordered was Delicious, and we tried a few items. We had the shrimp (sauteed), wings, and macaroni abd cheese w/bacon. Our compliments to the Chef for creating such a flavorful and tasty meal."
8/12/2018,20180812,5,3.66,"Loved the food and atmosphere. Lamb chops were delicious, and the macaroni and cheese was delicious. Will definitely come back."
8/19/2018,20180819,2,3.65,"After several weeks of wanting to try out The Block, my girlfriend and I finally decided to stop by on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. When we arrived at 1:30 PM, we both were very impressed by the place, commenting on how much we enjoyed the atmosphere inside (fun crowd, clean environment and a live DJ). After being told the wait would be about 15-20 minutes for a table, we put our name on the list. It's from this point that things began to slide downhill. After 45 minutes of waiting and watching several parties who arrived after us be seated first, we were designated a table. Having a minimal menu selection for brunch, we set our eyes on The Cure and Hipster Heaven, both in which are relatively simple when it comes to brunch food. Upon placing our order at 2:30 PM, we waited...and waited...and waited. Mind you, by this time the hostess had stopped seating guests due to the fact they shut down the kitchen and reopen at 4:30 PM for their dinner menu. So, at this point it's only the people left in the restaurants orders who need to be prepared. However, the process of preparing our food still managed to take well over an hour. When our food arrived, the restaurant was quiet (as the DJ had already packed his equipment up and left) and empty (as all of the other guests had finished their meals, paid their bills and left as well). While the food was decent, it was nothing worth waiting an hour, or even 30 minutes for.As we were finishing up our meal, we decided that we would give the restaurant another chance at a later date based on our optimism that maybe we just came at a bad time. Unfortunately, any chance at redemption was lost when the hostess mocked us as we exited the building saying: ""That's why you have to make a reservation on Sundays."" The irony in this statement was that our lack of reservation did not have any impact on our wait time for food. After all things being considered, it will be quite some time before we choose to bring our business back, as there are plenty of other restaurants in the city that embody Detroit hospitality much more so than here."
9/1/2018,20180901,1,3.63,2 hours in and still haven't received my food. I assure you that i will not return. Extremely limited selection as well. If your are already downtown please do yourself a favor and find somewhere worth it
9/9/2018,20180909,5,3.64,"There are so many things to love about this spot! It's a cozy size, not too big and not too small. The staff was great. We were seated quickly. I had the Pineapple Strawberry Mimosas and Stuffed Apple French Toast. It was the best toast I've ever had! I will definitely eat back!"
9/12/2018,20180912,3,3.64,Attended their Brunch & Boozy event. The wait time for seating was lengthy. The grooving tunes by the DJ allowed for some enjoyment during the wait. The service once seating was okay. The food was much better and the highlight of the experience for me.
9/19/2018,20180919,4,3.64,"Great salmon. Nice atmosphere and a welcoming vibe. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry, but a nice place to hand if you have time and want a good meal for a decent price. Great drinks and brunch on Sunday. It is a solid go to if you are in the neighborhood."
9/22/2018,20180922,4,3.64,"Food was great, service was superb, but my drink was a little too sweet. Nothing bad enough to stop be from coming back again. Definitely recommend!"
10/7/2018,20181007,4,3.64,"Visiting the city and searched for black owned restaurants. Glad we chose The Block was a great choice, great area and the food was really good. I didn't give it a total 5 stars because the service could've been a little better but our waitress was nice. We had the salmon and portobello burgers with sweet potato fries (some of the best I've had)."
10/12/2018,20181012,3,3.64,"Stopped in here for a bite to eat prior to attending an event next door at the Garden Theatre. It was during their happy hour time, they had some decent options on drink specials. I was happy they had Jack Daniels Honey because alot of bars don't have it. We ordered some wings & fries...the wings were fried but I think without flour. They looked good but lacked flavor but the fries were nice and hot and crispy. The atmosphere is really nice on the inside and the bartender was polite but not very friendly but maybe because she appeared to be the only person working the bar area(even though there was a ton of people in the kitchen area). I would go back to try to something else on the menu."
10/15/2018,20181015,2,3.63,"Ordered 3 medium rare smokehouse burgers. All 3 were received overcooked beyong well done. When the manager was informed they said we should have told them earlier.The dining experience was very slow. From sitting down to receiving the bill, we spent 2 hours at the place...Save your money and go elsewhere"
10/20/2018,20181020,2,3.62,"Finally made my way here after putting it on my agenda for months. Nice cozy place for grabbing drinks before going to a show in midtown or downtown. I ordered the salon burger and it was one of the most delicious salmon burgers I've had a restaurant in a long time. It was seasoned perfectly and the came on a toasted bun. I got the sweet potato fries which you can never go wrong at any establishment. However, my boyfriend hates his food. He got the ribs with a side of greens. The ribs were tender, but they were boiled oven ribs, not something from the grill. I tasted his greens and they were bland, and just scraps of greens. I definitely was expecting them to taste like Floods greens (same owner) and they didn't. I decided to try to Mac n cheese hoping it taste like Floods and was disappointed in that too: very bland and more like Alfredo sauce. Chicken wings weren't awesome either. You usually can't mess that up, but we didn't enjoy those either. I probably be back for salmon burger only and drinks."
11/1/2018,20181101,5,3.63,"Stopped in Halloween day for light snack & cocktail. Planted a seat at the bar with Michelle who was very insightful. Her and the manager encourage me to try something different. That i did, short rib fries which was DELICIOUS!!! I will indeed be back. Thank you for the service in The Mid-town area (Thumbs up)"
11/4/2018,20181104,4,3.63,Cute and quaint and UPBEAT! Perfect spot to deliberate and chat loud calmly first time here and I love it! Def will be back!
11/10/2018,20181110,5,3.64,"Came here before a show/concert at the Majestic since it's just right down the street. What a great place! Our server was great because we came in for happy hour which was ending in a minute (I got stuck in traffic), so we were very thankful she didn't give us a hard time about ordering with one minute left on the happy hour clock. We got the brussel sprouts and Mac and cheese, You MUST try these two items if you are eating here, they were delicious. I was also very impressed with the happy hour white wine. I even have it pictured below. I hope to come back here soon for dinner or just for some more snacks and drinks during happy hour!"
11/18/2018,20181118,4,3.64,"A solid restaurant in midtown. The menu isn't super creative but has a nice range of dishes with large portions that will appeal to most people. The happy hour is excellent. Delicious wings and a burger and beer deal that's under 10 bucks. The atmosphere is relaxed and the casual clubhouse decor is appropriate for a mid-end date night or pre-show meal. It's usually full of patrons and is pretty lively, too."
12/5/2018,20181205,5,3.65,"Was going to a concert nearby and decided to stop here due to their awesome happy hour menu and great reviews. Had a hard time finding parking since it was a Friday night, so we ended up in the parking structure behind the restaurant. I had read online that happy hour was only served in the bar area, but the hostess said it applied to the entire restaurant. We got in about 10 minutes before happy hour ended and our waitress didn't come over to take our order until exactly 1 minute before happy hour was ending. Thankfully she let us place our orders with no issues. We ordered the bacon brussels, and the alfredo mac and cheese to eat. The bacon brussels were so delicious! They also had some kid of nut on them, I want to say peanuts? The mac and cheese was also to die for, so creamy. I also got a miller high life draft for $1 which was a good deal. Service was great, and I cant wait to come back to try more of their food!"
12/18/2018,20181218,1,3.64,"I can't sugarcoat this review, I have never been to anything worse than this place. So let's begin from the beginning, waited at the hostess stand long enough to look at the menu and know what I wanted to eat. The server finally came and I ordered a simple coca-cola to drink, along with a side salad and the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap. Literally 20 minutes go by, no coke, had to go to the bar and get it, mind you the busser got it for me and the general manager standing there like a deer in headlights. Alright, would like to start on the side salad that I ordered, no where insight. Oh here it comes with my wrap, as you can see from the picture, the wrap dried up under the heat lamp. But they continued to deliver this wanna be $13 wrap to me. I asked who brings out the side salad with the main entree? She looked at me like I was crazy to want it before the wrap. Thank goodness we didn't order an appetizer, it would of came after our meal. This place is a joke, short staffed, how do you have 1 server and a busser? What makes it worse is the general manager is there acting like he's working when he was doing nothing. But then if the GM is working like that, can't expect the 2 employees to be any better! Avoid this place at all costs, there are plenty of other places to visit in Detroit better than this dump."
12/19/2018,20181219,5,3.64,"My second trip to Detroit in the past 3 months and this the 4th time I have dined here. The atmosphere is great, food and drinks are wonderful and the service is awesome. This is definitely a Detroit favorite for me and I have not been disappointed yet. I will be back."
12/21/2018,20181221,2,3.63,"My coworkers and I decided to go here for our holiday drink happy hour after work so we called ahead and was told that we could only reserve a table for 6 people. We decided to go anyway and try the bar for overflow, which was needed. The food was excellent the wings and Mac n cheese superb also the drinks were tasty and got the job done BUT ALL THAT was over shadowed by the EXTREMELY RUDE WAIT STAFF!! Omg I have never ever experienced this type of total disregard foul mouth nasty screwed up faced female wait staff attitude on 1000 in a very new NOT CROWED small bar / restaurant. Avoid at all cost if your not about that bs because you will have to show your ass in here WOW disappointed to say the least."
1/8/2019,20190108,5,3.64,"I like the atmosphere of this hip and trending spot. The food is an additional benefitS there's nothing like enjoying a delicious meal at a esthetically pleasing restaurant.I would definitely recommend for the young hipster, or trendy eater"
1/24/2019,20190124,4,3.64,"The Alfredo Mac and cheese is phenomenal. I also had the buffalo wings - solid and the coffee - weak. Great happy hour specials, nice looking place, right next to the garden theater.Recommended."
2/14/2019,20190214,5,3.65,"There's some bias to this review, but I don't care. My recent outing here was possibly the most fun I've ever had eating out. I'll tell you all of the splendor:I walk in with my ex-boyfriend who is also a bit more than that or whatever and we're both dressed exorbitantly fashionable for Sunday Brunch. I'm rocking my new cotton-candy hair and Supreme/North Face Summit Series Collab jacket, VETMENTS sweatpants, and Air Jordan 3 DB doernbechers. Luke is wearing some kinda badass Russian trench coat with appropriate decorations. Anyway, we look super gay. The hostess compliments us on at least 3 of the 5 things mentioned and asks us 'what we're out doing looking fabulous this morning.' We're tickled. She then almost screws it all up by telling us they have tables without chairs that we can stand and eat at. I don't care. I hear good music. I'm already stoked at the idea of dancing half the time. I'm down. I'm not sure how Luke is about to feel about that. He's also about it. Hell yeah.Our waitress is funny, charming, and attentive. I do that thing with my eyes to her that could be interpreted as 'let's do this' kinda flirting, but because I'm rocking homo-swag it means something else entirely that hasn't quite been given enough form to really be defined. I'm vibing hard. This place is ALIVE. The two sets we caught both had dope playlists. The whole place is singing and dancing. I know all the songs. The cooks all got down. I twerked with the waitress. We ordered a pitcher of strawberry mimosas to start.The mimosas were delicious. Luke ordered chicken and waffles and I went with crab cakes for some dumb reason. I don't think I'm really all that into crab cakes. These were perfectly cooked crab cakes--paired with garlic potatoes and my preferred presentation of mixed greens--but seriously, they're so whatever compared to chicken and waffles with bits of pears and cinnamon syrup happening. I think I just tell myself they're healthy or something.Anyway, I'm going even harder at this point. The first pitcher of Mimosa's is dry. This one dude who I think might have been the promoter or something was wearing a white-fur beret with a white sweater and looking just as incredible the rest of the way down. A dude break-danced to Get it Girl by 2 Live Crew. People choir-mimicked Ja Rule's voice in I'm Real ft. J-Lo. I was in heaven."
2/19/2019,20190219,1,3.64,"The only reason why I even rate it a one is because I server was very polite and the food was amazing but overall, our experience was so bad. We will never visit this establishment again. I met friends here on Valentines Day for a birthday dinner. More people came to celebrate than the reservations stated and we weren't allowed to pull seats up at the ends of the tables, even though it wasn't a fire hazard because it wouldn't have been blocking any isles or walkways at all. The greeter at the front desk was consistently rude throughout our dining experience. From the front door until we left. Rolled her eyes a lot and was very argumentative/disgruntled even. She had quite the attitude that evening. Maybe because it was so busy or .. who knows but I didn't appreciate it. She informed us the rest of the party would have to sit at the bar and not at the table. So they did, just to keep confusion down. When they tried to buy a drink for our friend for his birthday, from the bar, which they informed them to sit it, the bartender stated they couldnt do that. It was too confusing when it came time for the bill. Wha? We also tried to take pictures for his birthday and the Manager sent our server tour table , after taking 3 pictures, in our seats, to inform us that the flash was disturbing the rest of the guests so don't take pictures. Who even complained? Was the manager psychic? Ridiculousness! If we hadn't ordered food already we would have just left and went to another establishments. So many made up rules for a party of 20 spending good money. You cant sit together, you can send drinks to the table that you cant sit at, and you cant take pics? It was Valentines Day.. Who not taking pictures sir? Smh. It was my first and last visit, as well as the other people that were in the party. Oh well, we tried to support."
3/2/2019,20190302,5,3.64,"We went for restaurant week in Detroit, we did not have the RW menu, we went to the main menu and happy hour.  Tremendous, we had the salmon BLT which was delicious, the gumbo was very good, my daughter who is very selective really liked the Block MAC which was an Alfredo version, and I had the shrimp and grits which as a group we thought was the best thing we tried.  Great happy hour drinks, where are you going to get a $1, 16 oz beer? Service was very quick, and it was a Friday evening so they were busy!  My only suggestion was the kids clearing the plates were a little aggressive trying to keep things clear, but let's make sure the food is done! :)Go, go, go!"
3/2/2019,20190302,4,3.65,"I love great service. The Block has GREAT service. The food was very good. We went for Restaurant Week, and tried two of the three specials, and we were pleased with everything we got. Not ""blown away"", but very pleased. They appear to have a great Happy Hour menu, and we're definitely planning on going back for that. I highly recommend checking out this great addition to Detroit's new fantastic restaurant scene!"
3/18/2019,20190318,2,3.64,"My coworkers and I decided to go here for our holiday drink happy hour after work so we called ahead and was told that we could only reserve a table for 6 people.

4/4/2019,20190404,5,3.64,"We were off to see Hamilton at the Fisher. My son found The Block online, made a reservation and we ate there last night. It has a limited menu, but the choices are healthy, delicious, and served very professionally. I had the prime rib burger and it was out of the world. The meat was juicy, tasted great, and even though I passed on the bacon, it was one of the best burger I ever ate!My wife had the salmon blt and she talked about how much salmon was in the sandwich. My son had stuffed chicken thighs and he ate everything! My daughter-in-law had tomato bisque soup and salad. She ""complained"" that there too much soup and how thick and delicious it was.It was a great dining experience!"
4/26/2019,20190426,5,3.65,"Second time here and another wonderful and tasty experience! For sure their Brussels Sprouts are awesome, every table had them while we were there, no exaggeration . Didn't have a long wait on a busy Friday, and everyone working there made you feel welcome and were genuinely friendly, thanks!"
5/2/2019,20190502,5,3.66,"Home on Woodward! Soulful dishes and service. Old Detroit in New Detroit - who could ask for more! Don't eat all the shrimp, save some for me!!! IF I'm not full on that huge amazing fried chicken sandwich!"
5/8/2019,20190508,3,3.65,"I came here before seeing a show at the Fox Theatre. It is conveniently located on Woodward. It reminds me of a neighborhood spot, located by Wayne State. The food was good but not amazing."
5/19/2019,20190519,5,3.66,"The food was delicious. I had the salmon blt with the risotto and a salad. It was a late dinner so there weren't that many people at first. Later after some of the shows let out, it got crowded. I saw some amazing dishes come out."
5/24/2019,20190524,4,3.66,Current management TURNED THIS PLACE AROUND! Hubby and I are empty-nesters so we dine out nearly every evening. We stopped going to the Block a couple of years ago because the experience was awful on so many levels - BUT no reason to rehash the past because this place is now one of our favorites and in our regular weekly rotation. Great food - Attentive service - Nice atmosphere!
5/24/2019,20190524,5,3.67,"Awesome food, awesome experience. I probably have a biased review because I had just left Kuzzo's where people who were actually seated had been waiting for 2 hours for their food....but quick thinking made a friend and I try The Block. We were served ASAP and had our food in no time. The wings are BOMB, the sweet potatoes fries, everything. The chicken sandwich, to die for. I was just truly pleased and will continue to go back."
5/29/2019,20190529,2,3.66,Everything here is below average (from the service to the quality of food). Over cooked burger and bland Alfredo Mac was my meal. I was able to try the fries which were the only good thing here if you like them flour battered. I don't see another visit anytime in the future.
6/1/2019,20190601,5,3.67,"One of my go to spots. Service is always exceptional. Finally tried the shrimp and grits it was delicious. The salmon burger is always a hit. Had the pleasure of working with Tracy, she was great. Ambiance is great, love the location. Happy hour is also a good time to visit. Perfect spot for date night or a good place to pop in before an event."
6/2/2019,20190602,5,3.67,"Let me start with the service. The server we had, Van, was phenomenal. I'm not sure I recall having a better server in my adult life. He was friendly, conversational, attentive, yet not overbearing.Our food took a little longer than usual, and Van took care of that as well, with a completely guest oriented solution. Big shout out to Van.Second, the food was incredible. I had the shrimp and grits, while the SO had the Salmon BLT. Both were just amazing, and our plates came out full and went back to the kitchen pretty much licked clean.The deserts we had were the Key Lime Parfait and the German Chocolate Brownie, and those were mind-blowing.I can't recommend this place enough."
6/15/2019,20190615,5,3.68,"First let me start off by saying that I have never felt a desire to post a review for anything in the past but I feel so compelled to share with you that this was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had! We met for dinner prior to a concert at the DSO. The restaurant was quite busy and although we had reservations we had to wait quite awhile to be seated but let me tell you that the wait was well worth it. The food was delicious and our server Van was outstanding!  He was very attentive to our needs, extremely kind and he made us feel like we were an old friend or family member he had not seen in awhile. Van truly made our dining experience a wonderful and meaning event. My hat goes off to Van! Thank you!"
7/1/2019,20190701,5,3.69,"We go to The Block before the DSO concerts. It is a short walk from the parking deck. The service and food are great. The Slushes are tasty, We will be back next season."
7/27/2019,20190727,5,3.69,"Stopped here before a concert at Little Caesar's Arena. Every single thing we ate was amazing. Crab cakes, a creamy vegetable soup, and chicken/bacon Mac and cheese. Nice atmosphere. Close to the Q Line so we can hop on and take it back to the arena."
8/2/2019,20190802,4,3.69,Happy hour is a must! $1 beers and cheap appetizers. Entrees are also on point. Service is questionable sometimes but bartenders are always great.
8/12/2019,20190812,2,3.69,"Heard from many people that The Block is a good restaurant. My husband's company worked on their interior and I've been dying to try their shrimp and grits. Made reservations that were not necessary due to the place being mostly empty. Hostess and server were friendly and welcoming. I wanted the whiskey cocktail, but they didn't have it, so I tried the Margarita Slushie, wasn't good. Husband had a Heineken. For appetizers, I had chicken avocado wrap and my husband had wings; my wrap was good, his wings were okay. The shrimp and grits were extremely flavorful and I really enjoyed the mini tomatoes, but I almost tipped my bowl over, because the serving is not generous; not worth $17. My husband had the Smokehouse burger; not worth $15. So $70 for 2 people, won't be back."
8/15/2019,20190815,3,3.68,The reason for the 3 star is because of the service. Otherwise this would be a 5. Service can truly kill an experience at a restaurant. I went to meet a group of girls after work. They have great happy hour specials that go on till 7pm. What we weren't informed of is that there is one bill per table. So if you go here bring cash or have your cash apps ready. One issue was how the waitress presented this. She had an attitude stating that she split the bill twice and that's against their policy. So there wasn't more she could do. She also took away the happy hour menu from our table at 630 which was rude we still had an additional 30 mins to order food or drinks. She was made you hold mid order to run off and do things. Overall the food was great but the service was trash. Maybe she was having a bad day but She needs to pull it together.
8/16/2019,20190816,5,3.69,"This place is great! My fiance and I started with the brussel sprouts appetizer, and the siracha lime vinagrette on top was the BEST! We could have eaten 3 more plates of them. I got the crabcakes with grits, and my fiance got the shrimp and grits with a side of risotto. All were fantastic! The grits were so flavorful, as was the risotto. The crabcakes were beyond tender and the shrimp were so buttery and delicious. The food came out soooo quickly! Very minimal wait time, and the restaurant was busy. We were very impressed. Our server was very nice and friendly too. We will definitely return!"
9/2/2019,20190902,2,3.68,"The drinks are great, the food is good but the customer service is absolutely AWFUL! The hostess is insincere, rude, abrasive and will make you want to turn around an exit the establishment. The service was also slow for the restaurant to only be at 65% capacity. Overall the food and drinks are not good enough to make up for the bad attitudes and service."
9/7/2019,20190907,3,3.68,"Great music. Nice space. Not much seating but a cute vibe. Server was okay not really helpful with recommendations but we tried a variety of things and everything was pretty good. I had the shrimp app and crab spinach dip. Both were very good. Shrimp was salty but had a nice batter to it. I had a Caesar salad with it , way too much dressing but got the job done. Friends had salmon burger and shrimp and grits. They said Salmon burger was very good seasoned nice and fries were yummy. salmon burger comes with cucumbers but my friend doesnt eat that, so she asked for lettuce instead and they charged her. -_- stupid. But anyways. Shrimp and grits were ok nice size portion but grits were runny. Flavor was interesting , like smoky and cheesy but not spicy. Overall Good. Would return if they expanded their menu options. Pretty limited."
9/7/2019,20190907,4,3.68,"I had the salmon burger with fries ($14). I really enjoyed the flavors of the burger, especially the crispy edges. The fries were not too skinny, more like hand-cut size. It doesn't come with lettuce, if you want it - it will be $0.75. Overall, I really liked this place. Service was good as well."
9/12/2019,20190912,3,3.68,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. The hostess was pleasant soon as we walked through the door. We've arrived about 30-40 minutes before our reservation, it wasn't busy at that time and they seated us right away. Van was our server and he was really great,and he was very attractive. The inside is cute, intimate, and inviting. I had the Woodward wings with the sweet chili sauce and the Alfredo Mac. It was ok, it got the job done. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits, and she really loved it. It's not priced to bed for a nice dinner. I would come back to this place. I also, think it's a nice restaurant for a date night."
9/26/2019,20190926,5,3.68,"I'm surprised by the mixed reviews of this place, though I've only been here for Sunday brunch and maybe that makes a difference. It was delicious!My wife, a couple of friends, and I split the French toast bites, the sweet chili wings, and the mango passionfruit mimosa carafe. Everyone enjoyed each everything. For a meal, I had the meat lovers skillet which was really nicely seasoned and had generous portions of each of the meats.The ambiance is cool, with nice views of Woodward Avenue and a DJ playing some good tunes in the background.I'll definitely be back, at least for brunch."
10/2/2019,20191002,5,3.69,"I can't say enough good things about the Block! I hosted a happy hour for 20 people in the bar on a weeknight and it was one of the best events ever! The drinks were cheap and plentiful, food was great, and the best part was the staff! Nicest, most accommodating and wonderful people ever. Marion (I think that was the name, FOH) was AMAZING, so kind and felt like she was part of our group. The bar staff was so fantastic. I LOVE this venue - especially for a group. What a special place. :)"
10/25/2019,20191025,5,3.69,One of my places to eat! I can always count on a good meal here. I love the wings. I get them with no sauce . The Avocado Greek salad is my FAV. Simple with a twist and hearty. Cool vibe with great service. The Brunch is amazing as well!!
10/30/2019,20191030,4,3.69,"I was visiting Detroit from DC and had a great time. Food was fantastic and so was my service. I had the salmon blt without bacon, sweet potato fries and shotgun shrimp. Full of flavor, the food came out hot which was a plus and it didn't take a long time considering how packed to capacity they are"
11/3/2019,20191103,2,3.69,"The food is really good. The service is hit or miss. Great happy hour menu. But, I beg you to stop using Spumante to make Mimosas. The result is a disgustingly sweet concoction that is too syrupy to drink. At least give your patrons the option of champagne. I would love to come back for brunch, but the fake mimosa ruined the whole experience."
11/4/2019,20191104,3,3.68,"Went on Sunday before a show at DSO.  The food was pretty good, but they only had 3 pre-made brunch cocktails. That makes no sense, as restaurants really do well on alcohol, but the ladies ordered one regardless. It sucked and they sent it back. We were 'allowed' to order beers, but it took like 20 minutes to get a drink. I think Amy place that puts an automatic 19% gratuity on the bill for a group of 5 people does a disservice to the restaurant, and guarantees a tip regardless of service."
11/23/2019,20191123,4,3.69,Visited for happy hour and Thursday.. the food was excellent and the service was even better..Look forward to returning.
11/24/2019,20191124,5,3.69,"This place gets it right. I love the atmosphere, food, and service. Every visit has been consistently a great eXperience."
11/26/2019,20191126,1,3.68,The hostess is very rude; unfortunately there are other complaints with the same issue. She refuses to accommodate or even be polite and friendly.
11/28/2019,20191128,5,3.69,"Our experience was most enjoyable. We stopped in to grab a bite before a show at the Fisher. Took advantage of the fantastic happy hour specials. Shared the brussel sprouts, wings, and mac & cheese. They were all very delicious. Our server was helpful and friendly. I would recommend and looking forward to visiting again."
12/25/2019,20191225,4,3.69,"If you like a good happy hour for social and bites, The Block is a place to visit. The space is not very large, so getting their at a reasonable time is suggested.For the happy hour, I got the chicken wings, Mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. The wings were small, but good enough to snack on. Get the Thai chili sauce! The Mac and cheese and brussel sprouts were ok. It seemed like the cheese on top was a late throw on in the broiler. Also, the brussel sprouts could have been charred a little longer. I've been here for brunch which is very good. Their mimosas are A1. One of my fav spots to hit up while in Detroit!"
1/2/2020,20200102,3,3.68,"The Block is cool. I've come here a few times after shows at the Symphony down the street, and when they first opened. I like the servers, and the drinks are pretty good. The food is indulgent though, it can be difficult looking for healthy and tasty options if you don't want a salad."
1/3/2020,20200103,5,3.69,Food is super good! I had the shotgun shrimp and the Salmon BLT. Both I would highly recommend. The shrimp is very filling and the shotgun sauce is a great touch! The salmon BLT with the cranberry walnut bread is very flavorful! I am definitely going to order that again! I had a side salad with the poppyseed dressing which is a little sweet for my liking but still a good pairing with the salad.
1/6/2020,20200106,4,3.69,"As a family of 4 from Canada we made reservations on NYE before the Red Wings game. We love downtown Detroit but hadn't visited this restaurant before.  We were able to park directly across Woodward for free! Nothing over the top but cool interior.  Our hostess was super friendly and attentive. Our waiter was also very friendly and helpful! Our meals tasted amazing and portions were appropriate.  Bourbon glazed salmon, mac'n cheese chicken bacon, buttermilk fried chicken burger and chicken tenders were excellent.  I mean awesome! The short rib fries appetizer was out of this world! I recommend this establishment without reservation and will be back for sure!"
1/7/2020,20200107,4,3.69,I dine at The Block occasionally and it's a great go to. I ate the Buttermilk Chicken sandwich this visit and it was a huge flavorful and crispy piece of chicken with some sauce and pickles atop. The holiday Christmas Colada was a delicious wintry mix. I brought some friends who had never dined at The Block before. They enjoyed their experience and they said they will return!
1/10/2020,20200110,5,3.7,The alfredo mac and fried pickles were the perfect combination! Add a drink and you've got all you need. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back.
1/14/2020,20200114,5,3.7,Hands down some of the best chicken wings you will ever have!! The waffles have the best spice added with pears and cinnamon. The Mimosas are outstanding. Strawberry- pineapple and passion fruit mango WOW! The one thing that I would say they need to focus on is their staff. I asked a few question and our waitress couldn't answer questions about the menu?!?! Also not very friendly! I did love the music on Sunday with the DJ. Great Place
1/18/2020,20200118,1,3.69,"Half star wasn't an option. We were really excited to come check out this place! Arrived at The Block and everything seemed happy and inviting! We were brought directly to the bar area which had overly loud music playing. The hostess asked if we were there for karaoke, which we replied, ""No."" She turned around and was going to clear off the table for us, and we quickly decided we were just going to sit in the karaoke bar area. Somebody brought us two waters a couple minutes later and then no one ever came back to our table. We sat there for at least 20 minutes, with servers walking by our table ignoring us. A server standing directly at the end of our table was not trying to make eye contact with us. We casually got up and headed towards the door, off to the AMAZING Rock City Eatery across the street. We told the host upon exit that, ""No one even came to our table."" He replied, ""Alright, man, you have a nice day!"" We love exploring restaurants around Detroit. We over tip. This restaurant has an 18% gratuity added to each check. I now understand why. Skip The Block and head over a few blocks to Rock City Eatery. Amazing food & happy, inviting people who are tipped well."
8/23/2020,20200823,5,3.7,The food was great from the sweet chilli wings to the block mac n cheese. The waiter was very cool also.. We sat outside with lots of shade.
10/7/2020,20201007,5,3.7,"This is the greatest place to go for all of your fall needs, they have the best mum's around bigger and better than anywhere about half the price of all the other competitors and local stores. They have a big selection of pumpkins, gourds and corn stocks. Anything you need for canning they also have also purchased vegetables by bulk. This place is the best to go in the spring for all of your flowers, then they open back up in July for all fresh Michigan Produce. And then they finish up in the fall with everything you need. I've been going here for over 30 years and I've never been disappointed you might wait in line a little bit but the savings are worth it the service is always incredible and they're always happy to see you."
2/10/2021,20210210,4,3.7,"I don't care if it's dine in or carryout, The Block has the best damn shrimp and grits I've ever had. And the portion is huge! Can't comment on anything else, I haven't had anything else. THE BEST, FLAT OUT!!!!!!!"
2/22/2021,20210222,5,3.71,"This was my first time visiting. I enjoyed each and every moment. Upon entering the restaurant, I was instructed to complete The Block Contact Tracing which was a simple survey. The greeter and waitress were very welcoming. Social distancing was enforced, there was a contactless menu and hand sanitizer available for use. The food and drinks, go try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!!!!"
3/15/2021,20210315,5,3.71,"Listen...for brunch...they have this phenomenal menu item that was so good that when they pulled it off the menu, everyone complained about it and they brought it back and I was forever thankful for that. The name of this item is The Cure: it is a melty-cheese omelette style egg and bacon held in between two waffles and complimented with an orange jalapeño syrup for a slight twang and garlic house potatoes.It's ok, get a little messy with it! Get some mimosas with it because they give a healthy portion and they come in a few flavors.The spot is intimate but the trade off is banging house music and the beaming sun from the big windows exposing a grand view of midtown Detroit!It's a top brunch spot and recommend for me."
4/10/2021,20210410,5,3.72,My boyfriend and I went here for Detroit Black Restaurant Week and had a great experience. The tables were spaced out nicely to feel safe during COVID. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Our server refilled our drinks several times without us asking. We got the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer and it was delicious. It comes with warm pita chips and the dip to chip ratio was perfect. I ordered the chicken bacon club sandwich with fries for my entree which was also awesome. Overall we had a great experience and I would love to dine here again.
6/26/2021,20210626,5,3.72,"This is my 1st time in Detroit and I must say the people here at The Block really took care of me. Despite me arriving after the brunch had ended, the waitress asked the cook if it was too late to whip up something. A Crab cake Charlie and 2 mimosas later I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the customer service! Thank you to the Team at The Block. You made my last day in the D special!"
10/14/2021,20211014,4,3.73,"SORRY TO BE TYPING THIS IN ALL CAPS, BUT IT'S LOUD IN HERE. IT'S 11:30 SUNDAY MORNING AND THERE'S A DJ BLASTING TUNES. I LIKE THE MUSIC, BUT DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO LOUD ON A SUNDAY MORNING?After a while, I got used to saying something to my wife, her saying ""WHAT?"" and me doing the same when she tried to talk to me.The great news, though, is that almost everything I loved about The Block is still here, and just as good as before. I'm heartbroken that they no longer offer the flat iron steak breakfast. This was my favorite breakfast at any restaurant. While I mourn the passing of the flat iron steak, I found a new favorite: the Fiesta Skillet, a symphony of Chorizo, Andouille Sausage, Green Peppers, and Scrambled Eggs, with a generous amount of sausage (and heat). The chicken and French toast is a great spin on chicken and waffles, and really an improvement. The chicken had an amazing dry rub, and the French toast was deliciously sweet.And, the service was great. You should still make a reservation if you want to eat here: I saw several people get turns away when they tried to walk in. The Block it's still so great that I don't mind coming back here and shouting to be heard over the music. The real music is being made in the kitchen."
10/24/2021,20211024,5,3.73,This place is a true vibe! We went for Sat brunch at 12:15p (reservation on Open Table) and had a great experience! We loved the live DJ! He played great music and catered to the crowd that was small when we initially got there and was quickly larger when we were leaving. We loved the food!!! Shrimp and grits were perfection! We loved how the French toast wasn't super thick and the syrup was so delicious as was the chicken and potatoes! We will for sure come back when we are home.

11/4/2021,20211104,4,3.73,We found this place via Yelp because we were in the area attending a car show. We wanted to make reservations but they were booked up according to the website. We decided to go by to see how long the walk in wait would be. So glad we did! We got immediate seating. The restaurant itself is very pleasing to the eye. The decor is nice and the atmosphere was friendly. The hostess and waitstaff were all pleasant. We ordered our food and waited about 45 minutes for it to arrive. (The only reason it got 4 stars). We were kind of annoyed by that but the food was worth it! Everything we had was delicious! My fave was the short ribs and fries but it was all delicious! We will definitely be back!

Michelle was our awesome friendly server. Get there between 4-7pm for the happy hour specials; the roasted Brussel sprouts with balsamic, bacon and cashews are not to be missed. I enjoyed the short rib fries (think upscale poutine). The short ribs were tender and delicious. My husband enjoyed the smokehouse burger and said it was tasty and juicy."

1/30/2022,20220130,5,3.75,We had the chicken and French toast and the shrimp and grits. Both of them were amazing. The Block never fails me.
2/10/2022,20220210,4,3.75,The food was good. There wasn't any tables open. I tried calling to reserve a table but their phone system doesn't allow you to speak to anyone. My friend and I sat at the bar. It was pretty loud but it was from other customers talking. The service we received at the bar was okay. My water didn't get filled and I believe the bar tender checked on us once. I did not like the seats at the bar. The seats are backless. There is no where to put your coat.

2/13/2022,20220213,5,3.76,"The Block provided me with the best meal during my entire trip. I was searching for a Black Owned business to support, and they came highly recommended. We went there for the Saturday brunch, the wait was 30 minutes, but it was well worth it. They have a 90-minute table limit due to how popular the place is. We sat at the bar because it was quicker. They had a live DJ who killed it, but don't plan on having a conversation unless you are prepared to yell because the music is LOUD. But it didn't bother me because he was playing some great music. We got the wings for an app and they were tasty. I got the Crab Cake Charlie meal, which came with potatoes, scrambled eggs, and a salad. The crab cakes were amazing, cooked to perfection, and the sauce was wonderful. The potatoes were the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had. Just the right amount of crisp and salt. The eggs were okay, and the salad could've used a little drizzle of dressing, but the rest of the meal was so good that it didn't matter. My wife got the Valentine's Strawberry shortcake and it wasn't bad. Crab Cake meal 1-5=5. Wings 1-5=4. Cake 1-5=3."

3/2/2022,20220302,4,3.77,"The food is what makes this place as there is little to tout about the atmosphere or service. To me, this is an elevated twist on soul food in a good way! Baked Chili-Pepper wings were delicious. The bacon brussel sprouts definitely hit the veggie spot. The water and soda tasted as if the gun hadn't been cleaned in some time. Everyone eating during the late-lunch time period of the day, seemed to be a regular and acknowledged by the staff with pleasantries. I wish I had time to enjoy some of the cocktail creations that were offered because they sounded delicious."

3/8/2022,20220308,3,3.76,"The food was very good, the atmosphere noisy and rough. But the lingering impression is that, when I apologized for being 15 minutes late for my reservation, the woman at the 'front desk' treated us to a curt little lecture, telling us that they unusually only waited 10 minutes on reservations (what, did I need to feel grateful to patronize this place?), then seated us at a table that was freely available! Embarrassing and rude. Make any rule you want--it's your business, after all--but HOW you communicate it matters."
3/16/2022,20220316,5,3.77,The service and food was excellent. Recommend for Brunching and for the atmosphere. Especially on Sunday.
4/8/2022,20220408,4,3.77,Loved this place black owned and the food was amazing I had the spinach dip and smokehouse burger with Fries it was delicious I can say if they can chop up the spinach it was long strands wish they was cut and my margarita with the Anita liquor mixed I loved it the service was good but the server I'm not sure her name she comes off as she has an attitude but I think that's just how she is not sure b/c other times she was nice they def need more servers!!! but other than that I'll prolly order my food to go it was good ‼
