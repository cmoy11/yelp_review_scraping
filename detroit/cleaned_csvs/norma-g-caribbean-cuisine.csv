8/22/2018,20180822,5,5.0,"Everyone was friendly/helpful, the service was great and the food was good. I tried a little bit of everything -- codfish balls, beef patties, chicken pelau, coocoo & callaloo (only thing not pictured) and mango tango for dessert. Everything tasted fresh and was seasoned well. They didn't have any doubles, so I will definitely be back to try those soon. The owner was very nice and you can tell they are all doing their best to pay attention to details and feedback so they can make whatever changes are necessary to have a successful business."
8/24/2018,20180824,5,5.0,"I loved this new place in town! Just opened last week, and I couldn't wait to try it as I haven't had really good Caribbean cuisine since I was in Jamaica. I sat outside on a beautiful evening in the nice patio area, and was almost immediately greeted by the owner who was working his way around the tables saying hello to everyone and making sure that all was well. That was nice. Everyone working here was very welcoming and friendly, and for a busy night in a new restaurant everything ran smoothly and the service was great.I started with one of the specialty cocktails, Sorrel and rum, made with Sorrel flowers (a type of hibiscus, which is used in Jamaica traditionally for Christmas drinks), clove, cinnamon, and rum. It had a nice flavor, and a good punch. Don't drink more than one, haha.. I ordered the jerk chicken wings app, and though they were very good and cooked perfectly, I was really hoping for a much spicier jerk seasoning than what was here. But I also understand that restaurants need to please the masses, and since the crowd here was mostly white and Grosse Pointe.. Yeah, better not make it too spicy.For the entr√©e, I ordered the curry goat.. I couldn't wait to have this dish, as it's damn near impossible to find decently prepared goat outside of the islands - and this dish did not disappoint. I was in heaven.. The meat was tender, perfectly spiced, and served on a bed of jasmine rice. I absolutely loved every bite. I'm still dreaming of it a day later. The fried plantains on the side were a nice traditional and tasty touch, too. I really wanted to try a dessert - they have three choices, all made with local Wally's frozen custard, but I just didn't have the room for another bite. Next time.. because I'll definitely be back to this wonderful little restaurant. Another tip to the owner - I love a good cup of coffee after dinner, and was wishing that you served Jamaican blue mountain, but was told that you do not. Maybe someday?"
8/29/2018,20180829,5,5.0,"Lester's brick and mortar expansion from his famed food truck is a hit! The space is an extension of his family's culture and traditions. While I haven't had everything on his larger menu yet, the goat curry and chicken pelau are fantastic. The vegan curry and doubles are awesome too. Also has Batch Brewing on tap! Dang ma bang!It is also worthy to note that he is still amidst a run of soft openings (as of August 28) to fully train BOH and FOH. Maybe an unorthodox method for the rare Trinidadian joint in Jefferson Chalmers, but hey I'm thankful to be along for the ride."
9/2/2018,20180902,2,4.25,"My heart hurts to leave this review. It took a long time to open up and I had been counting the days.  They had two soft openings and I went at 9pm on their hard opening, which was a Tuesday night. Interesting and fun colors and design. Not tacky Caribbean.  The menu was small, but whatever. There were 4 of us and we had several items on the menu. Beef patties, jerk chicken wings, fish balls for apps. The beef patties were delicious and well priced. Everything else was cold. Not warm. Room temp cold. I asked and only the patties were cooked to order. When I pointed out the apps were cold I was essentially met with shrugs and the comment 'We are doing what we can.' We had Curry chicken, goat and jerk chicken sliders mac and cheese and chicken pelau for our entrees. The goat was good. The rest was just okay. Again, nothing was piping hot. And with the exception of the goat particularly flavorful. The curry chicken and pelau had almost no chicken. Literally about 2 tablespoons of chicken bits.  Jerk was a dissapointment. It is supposed to be hot and spicy. It was literally not. Oddly, there was not jerk chicken entree option. It was the hard opening and our entire stay in this West Indian restaurant they played house music. Good soulful house, but not soca, dancehall or reggae.  It all felt like their target demographic is people who have never had or are brand new to west indian food.  They have 2 dessert options. 2 different styles of ice cream which were delicious. Their sorrel cocktail made with rum was Also well done. I figured it was new and give it some time. I love West Indian food and perfection takes time. I returned again 2 weeks later this past friday at 9:40pm with a kid and another adult. We are greeted at the door by a friendly host. We turn down the offer of a seat as we are interested in take out... Only to he informed they do not do take out and they are more of a sit down place.  I know they have take out containers as we used them last time. The place has a full bar but only 2 tables in house so they are not slammed. The description here says they do take out. So we left confused... and hungry to go somewhere else.  My final assement is the place is great for a drink to start the night out or meet a first date. Or for those looking for something different for dinner. But if you're looking for traditional west indian fare or spicy jerk this is not the place. Basically, hipster West Indian."
9/4/2018,20180904,2,3.8,"Food was OK, but I think I'm been spoiled by Jamaican restaurants. They did a great job inside, decor is lovely. When I walk in hostess greeted me promptly and I say I'll sit at the bar. I sit down and when bartender comes over I ask to order, she informs me ""we're not doing carry out yet"" hahahah who said anything about carry out?So I say well I was going to eat here at the bar, while looking around at the two other people who were sitting there I ask if that's OK?I ordered the curry chicken and it was the strangest version I've ever had. I've eaten this dish for years, all different Caribbean styles and never anything like this semi vegetarian style with barely any chicken at all, just a few shreds, and a ton of chick peas. I'm glad I ordered a side of plantains because the meal comes with just three slices. I asked for hot sauce which they don't have, so bartender brought me a tiny portion of a spiced sauce that was OK, but why so skimpy?I wish them well, but I probably won't go back."
9/13/2018,20180913,5,4.0,"Dishing in the D had a great dinner here on September 14th. The food was delicious! We had a group of 14, so we tried everything on the menu, from the oxtail sliders to CooCoo and Callaloo, curry goat and chicken, chicken pelau, and the soft-serve (with rum and with mango). The service was terrific. The staff is warm and welcoming, and they know the menu. The craft cocktails are really tasty. The jerk chicken wing appetizer had just the right amount of heat, with a dipping sauce to add the extra zip you might want. The CooCoo and Callaloo is polenta with an okra/spinach sauce - don't let that fool you, the polenta is meltingly tender and creamy, the sauce smooth and unctuous - even okra haters loved it. Cod fish balls were also a hit. Doubles are a Trinidad street food - fried bread around spiced chickpeas - with a terrific tamarind sauce. The building itself is beautiful - a great job renovating it for the restaurant. This spot is well worth the stop - they will make you feel at home, and you'll be well fed and happy."
9/16/2018,20180916,5,4.14,Went here last night! Everything was SO AMAZING tasting! The Mac and Cheese is to die for! Very pleased!!
9/18/2018,20180918,5,4.25,I had the jerk chicken sandwich to go. The jerk chicken itself tasted great but I wish the bun had been toasted. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more!
9/19/2018,20180919,1,3.89,"Customer service was good that definitely made up for the food, vibe was stale, the most inauthentic Trinidad food ever, please take the doubles off the menu until u find someone who can make it properly that bara was hard and lacked flavor, the Channa unseasoned, tambrand sauce bitter just all bad, not a good representation of my country's food at all. The Mac n cheese was bland and lacked seasoning. Only customers who haven't tasted the real deal would remotely enjoy the food. Then no soca like really? I was very excited to finally have a Trini spot in the city but was left highly disappointed."
9/21/2018,20180921,4,3.9,"I ordered the cod fish balls, vegan curry medium spice which is not pictured, and mango tango custard. The cod fish balls were a little on the salty side but I did like the sauce that comes on it. My curry was good the medium spice has some heat to it so be warned if you don't like spicy foods. Other foods pictured are chicken peleau and goat curry which was order medium spice but wasn't spicy at all."
9/24/2018,20180924,2,3.73,"I am a Trinidadian and I was looking forward to finally having proper Caribbean cuisine in Michigan, but I was sadly disappointed by the food at Norma G's. From the shredded curry chicken (why???) to the dry chicken pelau that barely had any chicken. Who puts Oxtail in bread??? The Doubles was no where close to what I'd buy at UWI or Curepe Junction. Maybe this place works for non-Caribbean people that don't know what the food is supposed to taste like. But for me it was a major let down, because I grew up on the island and I've tasted the great food there and in New York and even as close as Toronto. So it is possible to make good Trini food outside of the island. Hopefully they realize they don't have to water down the food to try please the masses because the genuine stuff is good enough to stand on its own. I want this place to be successful, the building is nice and the people are very friendly, but the quality of the recipes have got to get better!"
9/26/2018,20180926,5,3.83,"This place is a must , the Jerk Chicken is to die for and as far as the Norma G's punch go it is the truth I love the Caribbean atmosphere and the people are great the chefs does a excellent job at making Jerk chicken and the macaroni and cheese is on point 5 STR SHOUT TO TINA THE HOSTES COLLEN THE BARTENDER AND TO THE CHEF AND THE ENTIRE STAFF FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY"
9/28/2018,20180928,5,3.92,"Oh my! So pleasantly surprised. If my friend hadn't been with me, I would have driven right past NormaG's. So happy I didn't!. Everything that came out if the kitchen looked and smelled tantalizing. We ordered the appetizer called Doubles which is chickpeas and I'm not sure what else was spices and it's in between two pieces of like griddle bread I'm not sure they're better but I think it's a corn base absolutely fabulous and then we got that cuckoo which is white polenta with the callaloo which is it's more like a sauce but it's made with okra and spinach and so delicious so delicious my friend ended up getting the trifecta dessert which was an ice cream with rum and cinnamon and she was rolling her eyes it was fabulous I definitely recommend this place next time I will definitely try the goat Curry"
10/7/2018,20181007,4,3.93,"This restaurant is a breath of fresh air and a very positive addition to the Detroit restaurant scene. The Trinidadian food was delicious: spiced just right, and not strongly enough to overwhelm the natural flavors of the primary subjects of each dish. The prices and portions are very good, coupled with exceptional quality of food and a warm atmosphere - elements I find so sorely lacking with many of the new ""trendy"" restaurants in downtown/""midtown"" Detroit. Lester Gouvia has done a tremendous job of creating a well-designed, open, and window-abundant building on what once a vacant lot in Jefferson-Chalmers (and there is a patio, too) - a neighborhood with great community spirit that has been steadily working towards revitalization. What a great addition to this neighborhood. The restaurant, named after his mother, does honor to her. Thank you Mr. Gouvia. I will certainly be back (and back, and back . . .)."
10/9/2018,20181009,5,4.0,"Great food, the patties and jerk wings are super amazing. Beautiful restaurant, the setup is nice and colorful. The hostess was delightful and asked us how was the food and want our feedback. Great location I felt safe. Nice atmosphere & with pleasant Reggie music."
10/20/2018,20181020,1,3.81,"Sigh... So it is 11:26pm on Saturday October 20 2018 as I write this review. The restaurant despite a sign out front claiming to be open until 11:30... is closed. I am at home munching on Subway from the next block over. I am home from work sick and decided to give Norma G another try. After all, West Indian is my favorite food and the curry goat was decent. I shlep myself into the car and drive the 2 blocks to Norma G's at 10:57pm... only to find it closed.  Did they close their doors for good? Is it just a slow day? Family emergency with every staff member? Who knows... But i left a previous bad review and hoped for a better experience. Hopefully if theybare still open the owner will take some advice. Detroit has no really good, authentic, down home west Indian food. Those of us who salivate at the thought of jerk, roti, doubles, curry goat, hardo bread, rice and peas and a taste of home would spend our hard earned cash at your establishment. Give us a place to come and to trust me brudda... we soon gon come. ... Or he closed early on a Saturday night."
11/2/2018,20181102,5,3.88,"Tried for first time tonight. I thought the service was special and outstanding. The owner came out to talk to us and offered samples before ordering, which was a highly appreciated touch. The hostess also was very pleasant and spent time at our table talking to us and introducing the menu. The food was unique and tasty. I had the curry goat over rice. It was tender and delicious. My wife had the jerk chicken sliders which was also good. The only disappointment was the fries were cold. Otherwise a nice cute place to try."
11/15/2018,20181115,4,3.89,New east side eats. Red Beans & Rice is delicious! Service awesome. Spicy if you like it HOT. Nice croud.Chris our Server was kind ... knowledgeable and attentive.Yes I will be back and highly recommend it.Meet Lester the owner..cool guy!
12/8/2018,20181208,5,3.95,Definitely a definitive spot! The food was a 10! Jerk wings we're stellar! Highly recommend it. The only critique was the fluorescent lights at the front door and the windows needed to be cleaned! Minor things for the quality of the food! Really want to see these guys make it! Come get some authentic Caribbean!!Sorrel and rum was amazing!!
12/8/2018,20181208,5,4.0,"I love the food, the service and the decor. I appreciate that this great place is located inside the city proper and even though it is a bit of a drive for me, it is worth the trip. As a pescatarian, I tried the cod balls, the coocoo callaloo, mac and cheese and the fried plantains, all of which were delicious."
12/15/2018,20181215,5,4.05,"So good, we tried a bunch of dishes and everybody loved them. The staff was super helpful, because we didn't know a lot about the cuisine. Good beer selection, and my wife liked the punch. The wings were great and the ""doubles"" were a favorite appetizer."
12/17/2018,20181217,5,4.09,"A new addition to Detroit's eastside Jeff/Chalmers neighborhood, I think they have a winner! Quick basics - there was enough variety on the menu to not be scared away by the Caribbean label. I was wondering if this was going to be one of those one and done places for me, but I will definitely be back to try more things and have the Braised Oxtail again. It was the special, it was super tender and flavorful and served over red beans & rice with a side of cooked/seasoned cabbage and some plantains. It was Delicious. My son had the curried goat - medium heat - it was great too. A bit too spicy for me, but he loved it, I'd go for the mild when I return. Also served over rice with plantains, but no cabbage. The owner, Lester stopped by to say Hi, the wait staff was friendly. A tiny bit slow, but not terrible. It used to be a bank, but they've done a good job repurposing into a restaurant. The inside is cinderblock walls, high ceilings with exposed duct and piping. That makes it a bit chilly inside and not super comfy feeling. They've painted the walls and put murals inside to improve the look, but it's still cinderblock. I'm wondering if he's waiting to see how successful they'll be before investing more money into the building. I think summer there will be awesome when they can open up the big roll up window and let the outside in.We were there on a Saturday night, to our surprise a guy walked in and started setting up steel drums about 15 feet from us. We said 'Uh oh, I hope we're not about to get our ears blown off'. But when he started he kept it mellow and as an accompaniment to his singing. Very nice. Finally - Sunday morning my son couldn't find his wallet. I fb msged the restaurant, within an hour they had replied that they had found it. Despite being closed on Sunday, Lester met my son there at 6 to return it!!!! Thank you."
1/29/2019,20190129,2,4.0,"Ok, sorry to say but what's going on here. Cold fries. Cold meat. I was so disappointed. I could tell my meat on my jerk sliders was reheated in the microwave. Ugh , I might try this place again , but it hurt my feelings."
2/5/2019,20190205,3,3.96,Norma G's is not Carribbean food. Certainly not Trini food. The food tastes good and is cooked well but it lacks so much soul. It is food that Grosse Pointe (the suburb just north of Norma's neighborhood that physically built a wall between itself and Detroit for reasons that history has made plain) is excited to eat from. Spices are replaced by (inconsistent) heat. Jerk seasoning tastes...underdeveloped. Part of the problem is saying that they are cooking an entire subregion's food. Is it Jamaican? Trinidadian? Cuban? Is the owner nervous that making food actually taste regionally appropriate will upset the general bland palate of the Midwest? Are they a bit insecure about their (general) culture's flavor profile? Can they hire at least some Black and/or Caribbean servers to give the impression that they exist in Detroit and cook food from a particular cultural vantage point?
2/8/2019,20190208,5,4.0,"We tried the Doubles, Mac and Cheese, Ox Tail Sliders, and Goat Curry. All had amazing flavors and we can't wait to try more. The cocktails were also amazing. The owner Lester is a stand up guy and provides great service. The restaurant itself has a great soundtrack and vibe I highly recommend Norma G's to anyone looking for amazing unique food and a nice place to sit down. We'll be back!"
2/23/2019,20190223,5,4.04,We really enjoyed the oxtail sliders - awesome app or meal if you get a side. Curried goat was really flavorful as well! Would also recommend the sorrel drink and Al's punch. The best part of the night however was the incredible service we received. I hope future diners can meet Lester! He went out of his way to make our night extra great last night.
3/19/2019,20190319,5,4.07,"Breath of fresh air in Jefferson Chalmers. If you are nearby, worth the stop. If you are far away, worth the drive. And who knew oxtail could be that delicious?Owner grew up in Trinidad and is bringing the street food to Detroit. Was told that it is the first new business on the strip in over 30 years. Think of it like the slows of Corktown. If you are heading east down Jefferson and hit Grosse Point you have gone about two blocks too far. This great addition is nestled nicely in a newly updated building. Came during the winter, but looks like they have a great outdoor patio area. I would say kid friendly as the layout is nice and open. Some of the best service around, and Lester will check in to confirm everything is copacetic. Happy hour pours until 7 for some featured cocktails and select beer and wine ~ Reasonably priced. Oh and that food- get the oxtail tacos. It's similar to the sliders, but The ""tortilla"" it comes in puts this dish at an 11/10. Lester if you are reading this make those tacos a dinner item! Jerk chicken was to perfection, wings were delicious. Beware... the fries are real good, but you get a lot of them. Servings sizes on the dinners were more than enough, but be sure to try the appetizers or shareables."
3/19/2019,20190319,5,4.11,"Went on Valentine's Day with my husband so this review is late. Really good food, great atmosphere . . . . I LOVE what they have done to the place. The owner is so sweet that he followed us out with a rose for me on Valentine's Day! All the ladies received a rose from him that night. Very special. I will return for the food and the atmosphere with the kids."

3/28/2019,20190328,5,4.19,"This is one of the best Caribbean restaurants. The curry goat is my favorite. The oxtail entree is also great. I came back two days in a row to try new items on the menu and they were amazing as well. The people are nice, very inviting, and I love the Caribbean feel of the restaurant. I will continue to service this place. Great place!"

3/30/2019,20190330,4,4.21,We visited Norma Gs the other day and it feels like your mom and aunt are running the place. The decor is a little confusing but nice and modern and clean. My husband got the oxtail and loved it.The chicken tacos are excellent. The plantains excellent. I would highly recommend either just order appetizers or go straight to the entree because they have very generous portions and you will not eat it all. One of the signature drinks is the Caribbean mule. If you are a lover of the Moscow mule then this is not a drink for you. It is bitter and I did not enjoy it. The service is nice fast and very friendly. Go when you have time for a long meal because there will be a lot of conversing with the hosts.
4/1/2019,20190401,5,4.24,"Amazing place! So happy to see a sit down place in my neighborhood. The food is great, and service is outstanding! Will continue to go there."

4/9/2019,20190409,5,4.3,"Great place! Very welcoming, especially Tina, who is like a hostess/server/BOSS! So friendly!!! Food is great. I came a couple days ago and tried the jerk chicken sliders, the ox tail sliders and Mac-n-cheese. Must have hit it at an off time because chicken was really dry. When I tried the chicken on the tacos today, they were MONEY! So delicious!!! The doubles appetizer is BIG, very filling, tastes very similar to Indian curry with tamarind sauce. The curry chicken dish is great too! Medium spice was just right! Great place overall! Will be back!!!"
4/19/2019,20190419,3,4.26,"I really want to like this place. I live in east Detroit and this is close by. That being said, I will give it another chance, but our first experience was rather underwhelming. We ordered the doubles and frankly, that was our favorite part of the meal. Different and flavorful. We ordered the curry goat (there was so little curry in this, it was basically tasteless. and very little goat, we really had to poke around to find tiny little bits and it was all bland. some of the rice was undercooked) and the chicken pelau, which had very little chicken and the rice, peppers and squash were all so overcooked it was one giant blob on my plate. Everything was brown and piled in a heap, no thought to presentation. We split the Wally's frozen custard, but again...for a not-inexpensive restaurant, your desserts are pre frozen and shipped in from Harper Woods? I would love to see a bananas (plaintain) foster or something FRESH with fruit and flair.Like I said, I'll give it one more try and maybe sample the oxtail entrees, which seem to get decent reviews, but underwhelming thus far."
4/24/2019,20190424,5,4.28,"For vegans and non vegans alike! Thank you for bringing Caribbean charm to the East end of Detroit. Good food, atmosphere and great prices. Highly recommend!"

5/5/2019,20190505,3,4.32,"While the food was fairly good, I was disappointed that they were out of potato salad on a Friday late afternoon at that! I then asked for Cole slaw; needing something to offset the spice of hot Caribbean food; but slaw is not offered as a side; but yet it's served on top of some sandwiches. What am I not getting here??? Drinks could use an extra alcohol punch for the price too. With that being said, I will return because I really like Jamaican food. Also, nice decor. Hope they will read this and be accommodating."
5/23/2019,20190523,4,4.31,"Great addition to the area! Marked down a star because my dine-in experience left something to be desired. I've gotten carry-out several times and it's always great. I recommend the jerk wings, tacos and curry. Oh! And the beef patties! I think everything may be good here! I'd like to see a bit of a menu expansion, since everything I've had is tasty."
6/7/2019,20190607,5,4.33,Fantastic food and cocktails! We sat outside on the patio area - it's such a nice atmosphere they have created out there. We will be back to try more of the delicious dishes!
6/8/2019,20190608,4,4.32,"So nice to find a place on the east side that serves up Caribbean food! The decor is fun and bright and nice that there is a patio option as well. The fried dough appetizer ""Doubles"" with chick peas was delicious. Not sure what the chopped salsa like accompaniment was, but it was spicy and complex and I loved it. I ordered from the vegetarian part of the menu - the okra plate with polenta It was a delicious generous serving that I will eat tomorrow with rice. I love plantains when cooked properly and these hit the spot. A sweet bite after a spicier bite is a nice combo. Our server gave me a side of the house hot sauce and it was delicious! Perfect balance of acidity and heat. My friend had the goat curry and loved it. Excellent service and thoughtful that the owner stopped by our table. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 - the sangria and martini were very small pours. Way too much ice."
6/12/2019,20190612,5,4.33,This was a perfect setting from the door to the outdoor patio seating! Great music in the background of course Caribbean jams pushing through the speakers. I was invited here by a friend for dinner and I must say Norma G has a place for my palate. The atmosphere was peaceful being it sits at the cusp of Detroit and Grosse Pointe entry. Also they do have a happy hour from 3-7p that we missed literally by 30 minutes! But there is always next time!
6/17/2019,20190617,5,4.35,"Let me say one word... OXTAILS.  My first time having them EVER couldn't have started at a better place.  Although this place is fairly new, I recommend all to give it a try. The staff is super friendly!!!"
6/23/2019,20190623,4,4.34,Really enjoyed Norma G. Fun and creative menu and pleasant waitstaff. Prices are reasonable. Will dine here again.
7/12/2019,20190712,1,4.27,"So... yea. That happened.You know when you walk into a restaurant that you're hella excited about. Get seated, pick out what you want from the menu the host gave. Then you get the talking.Me and my husband can definitely talk up a storm. BUT!!! there comes to a point where you run out of things to talk about and the conversation goes to. ""Man, i'm so thirsty... is anybody going to come bring us a glass of water any time soon?""Anyways, long story short. There was no, ""Hi! I'm such and such. I'll be taking care of your tonight. Let me get you some waters while you decide on what you want."" Nope... none of that.These are what i would've ordered.Oxtail Sliders:   Nope, wouldnt know what they would taste like. Because i didnt get the chance to try it.Beef Patties:   I'm a Tri-State native and i loooooove beef patties. I would've loved to have some, but nope, didn't get a chance to try that either.Anyways,, goodluck guys! I'm sure we're just two less customers you guys have to deal with.Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
7/15/2019,20190715,1,4.21,"***This review only deals with the service and not the food***My husband and I came here because we both had it book marked in our Yelp. So we drove away from downtown Detroit to get to this place. This restaurant is located in a rougher part of detroit but seeing the place it is safe and there is parking. We walked in and got seated right next to the hostess counter, which was not bad. The place had outside seating. So this is basically when my review will take a hard turn for the worse. We got seated with menus. We looked at it and were super excited to try the food. However, we never got to try the food or drinks. We didn't even get to try the tap water lol. Our server never came to us, even the hostess that sat us never came back to see if anyone came to us. Other servers walked past us plenty of times. After 15 to 20 minutes we ended up walking out. My husband ended up forgetting his fanny pack so he went back in and the hostess confronted him and asked why we left. However, she never tried to apologize.All I have is negative things to say about this place. Bad business, too far to drive from other things and just bad vibes from this restaurants. Will never go back and advise people to do the same. Sorry but not sorry!"
7/21/2019,20190721,2,4.17,We have been here at least 4 times accumulatively hoping to have the kind of experiences we have read about on Yelp. Still don't get why people are rating this place so high. The food is bland and the portions are small. Rice is the main ingredient. I'm about as fond of Norma G's as I am the new bike lanes on Jefferson.
7/24/2019,20190724,5,4.19,"Have always had great food and service A++ highly recommend. A favorite spot.Another review said the neighborhood is rough, but that is false.They also said it was ""far from stuff"" but what I think they meant was it's far from where they happen to live ‚Äç"
8/4/2019,20190804,5,4.2,"As Darth Vader might say: ""Impressive...most impressive.""Extremely high quality food, with good-to-excellent taste in everything I've eaten and imbibed from this place. There is plenty to like about their menu, and even if not everything is a home run, they're hitting with extra base power on just about everything.You *must* try the Doubles. You must! If you don't, you're only hurting yourself. This is a prime example of vegetarian (or is it vegan?) fare wherein you honestly don't miss the meat. Considering the price of $6 for two of them (thus, Doubles!), it's a perfect appetizer for one or two people...enough to nicely whet the appetite. Terrific textures and flavors, affordable price point, not to be missed.If buljol is available, get that, too. If they have a mango and vanilla custard over pound cake with mango chutney for dessert? Get that, too. In fact, just try things...if you *think* you'll like it, you most probably will.Service/people are lovely and on-the-ball, with smiles and great attitudes. It's a nice room, but not pretentious at all. Carribean cuisine shouldn't be pretentious, and this isn't...just darned tasty.Look: every item might not be the best you've ever had anywhere (their jerk chicken, while good, isn't my fave in the area, but it's nothing to be ashamed of, either!), but I can guaran-stinking-tee you there are some items on the menu that you can't get anywhere else in the area, and they are worth trying. Branch out a bit and roll dem bones...the menu is very approachable, and the kitchen has the chops to pull it off. Fried plantains very much held their own.Want to test the waters? Get yourself some Doubles. And a Norma's Punch or a Wee Lymon from the bar. Have some fun...play around with your taste buds. This is the kind of place that invites such novelty, and adeptly produces it on a plate.You want to eat here, even if you aren't aware of it yet. Did I mention the Doubles?"
8/5/2019,20190805,5,4.21,"Birthday dinner for a friend. Loved the vibe.First course: Buljol on crostini w/egg - excellent.Second course: doubles with curry channa, mango chow and tamarind sauce.Third course: Stewed snapper on coo cooFourth course: Jerk chicken w/beans and riceFifth course: Mango and vanilla custard over pound cake w/mango chutney. Service was excellent. Chef/owner visited our table briefly to insure that we were happy.Rum Olde Fashioned also excellent.Will I return? Absolutely, yes!"
8/7/2019,20190807,5,4.23,"Phenomenal food, phenomenal staff. Phenomenal restraint. Would 100% recommend."
8/21/2019,20190821,5,4.24,"Really good flavorful Caribbean cuisine. Our server , Martha, was attentive,funny and efficient. We will be back!"
8/28/2019,20190828,5,4.25,Ok. Second Round for the Total Knock Out!!! My husband and I ordered the curry goat and jerk wings! Unbelievable!! I literally had no words! The meat of the chicken wing fell of the bone. It was so rich in flavor that the party began on my taste buds!  My husband ordered the curry goat and I ate his. Enough said. Enjoy fellow yelpers. Thank you and your welcome.
10/12/2019,20191012,5,4.27,We loved this spot! Went with a group of friends for my birthday and they could not have been more accommodating and fun. Everyone was happy with their meals-- will be back!
10/14/2019,20191014,5,4.28,"We had an absolutely wonderful time. The food was fantastic and service likewise. The steel pan player and singer were brilliant. With Trini roots we can vouch the food is the best. Also, with great vegan selections all palates were delectably satisfied. We'll be back!!"
10/18/2019,20191018,5,4.29,Love this place in an up and coming area of the D! Excellent drink selection and creative Caribbean inspired food. Friendly responsive service. Recently renovated building. I had the snapper with curry. Snapper was perfectly done and the slightly spicy curry was a perfect complement. Dessert was a trifecta which is Wallys genuine custard with rum and cinnamon. Rum was a perfect complement to the old favorite of Wally's custard.I'm so glad we discovered this unique place on the East side.
10/25/2019,20191025,5,4.3,"Good food. The beef patties are so good, you'll want to order more. The oxtail tacos are out of site. Great atmosphere. I throughly enjoyed the rum margarita."
10/26/2019,20191026,5,4.31,"WOW!! Enjoyed an amazing dinner tonight and can't wait to come back and try some more. Tina was so awesome when it came to recommending and catering to what we wanted. My husband doesn't do spicy and can be particular about his food. Tina went above and beyond to make our experience top notch and unforgettable. We tried different appetizers, Mac and cheese, and I had the Goat Curry. I had never had goat, so Tina ran in the back and got me a sample without me even asking!! The flavor was unreal!! We love trying new places but we have never been to a place that treated us this way. . I'm so glad that not only our night landed us at this place, but that we have leftovers as I'm already wanting more of my dinner!!! Thank you and can't wait to bring some friends!!"
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.32,"My favorite placed closed down. I was sad and then I went here. My new favorite place is open and delicious. If you like good food, you will like this place. There are a few Caribbean spots around the metro area. They are in strip malls and well... when you want to have a great dinning experience and enjoy Caribbean food, this IS the place to be. Jerk chicken... yes. curry chicken... yum. Fish cakes... and thank you. Oxtail sliders... I will have another. And they have a full bar to come along for the ride. Go here. Eat well. Live well.D√©cor: 3 out of 5Food: 5 out of 5Drinks: 4 out of 5Service: 5 out of 5Cleanliness: 5 out of 5"
11/11/2019,20191111,4,4.32,"Visited last Friday with my husband and godson. We called before leaving the house to find out what the wait times were and a hostess with a lovely voice and manner asked the size of our group and then said 'we've got a nice crowd here but there isn't really a wait. Come on down here, we'll find a table for you.' And with those words and her wonderful manner I was already in love with the place. We arrived and she greeted us with a smile and placed us at a corner table right away. There was indeed a full house but the atmosphere was lively, there was a nice mix of local diners and our waiter Ricardo came to the table right away to start our service. My husband and I ordered curried goat, while my godson ordered oxtails. I ordered a tropical-sounding drink called Tiki something-or-another and the owner came by and introduced himself and added another shot to it which was a nice/fun touch. The drink was large and delicious and complimented the meal nicely. I loved the curried goat, although I had a bit of a hard time navigating around some of the bones. It had a rich flavor and I ordered medium heat which was just right for me but may be too hot for some. I tasted the oxtail and it was delicious. The meals came with two slices of plantain each. I thought that was a bit skimpy, so ordered more for the table. We topped off the meal with rum cake which was a delicious bite. All in all quite an enjoyable experience and my husband and I plan to return soon. The jerk wings looked delicious and there were a few other menu items that looked intriguing. My only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 was the small amount of plantain per meal; also our waiter didn't return to check on us enough mid-meal when my godson wanted to order an additional side--macaroni and cheese--and once we finally got his attention after some time and he got his order he was disappointed with it and we all tasted it and agreed the macaroni was very overcooked. But yep, we're undaunted, a couple small glitches in an otherwise lovely evening and I'm looking forward to next time."
11/12/2019,20191112,5,4.33,"We had a wonderful dinner. Stewed tomato shrimp, oxtail dinner, oxtail tacos, jerk chicken, fried plantains, braised cabbage.Service was wonderful and they have a happy hour."
11/14/2019,20191114,5,4.34,"An incredible oasis to escape to on a snowy winter day!! Fabulous cocktails (Al's Rum Punch is my personal fav), the jerk chicken tacos are to die for, and the atmosphere puts you on island time! Don't catch a flight, catch an Uber to Norma G's"
11/19/2019,20191119,4,4.33,"Norma G's is on the list of Best New Restaurants of 2019. I appreciated that the list included this restaurant, some flavors different from the rest of the otherwise mostly American fare of the list.Reading the reviews, there were several complaints that the food was not spicy enough, that real Caribbean cuisine is much hotter. Well, of course it's not as spicy as the inspiration! Opening and maintaining a restaurant is tough, it's Michigan and it's not a good business move to limit your customer base. Not all of us want our taste buds burned off in every dish. That being said, I thought that the spicy mayo that was served as a side to the wings and on the tacos was quite spicy, at least for this Midwestern tongue. So if you need an added kick, they have at least this option. The space itself is cool, bright colors and some whimsy. We did not make it before the cold weather began so we're seated inside, in warmer weather they have a patio space. We were able to be seated right away without a reservation. The service was friendly and capable of giving opinions on food. A friend and I shared the wings, the oxtail tacos and the jerk chicken. This was more than enough food for the to of us and we had leftovers. Everything was great, very flavorful. There was plenty of chicken in our order as well (maybe they fixed this issue?). The wings were great, the meat fell off the bone. The only change I would have made in retrospect was ordering wings and jerk chicken, while very good, the flavors were very similar.They do offer a wine list and several cocktails, including a couple more unique options."
12/3/2019,20191203,5,4.34,"We love Norma G's!! So grateful that it's in our neighborhood (Jefferson Chalmers). Warm atmosphere, friendly efficient service, and consistently delicious food. Bright, fresh, satisfying. We try to go at least once a month!"
12/11/2019,20191211,5,4.35,Delightful! Every visit is delicious! I love it! The flavors and the drinks. Easy to park and so cute.
1/2/2020,20200102,2,4.32,"Oh how I want to like Norma G's. I live in the neighborhood and have been three times, each time underwhelmed. The drinks were ""eh"" the first time I went, but the curry goat was okay. The jerk chicken really isn't popping. The only thing that's really good to me here are the beef patties. And I've tried the oxtail sliders, oxtail dinner, macaroni, and even more. I'm just not impressed by the flavor at all. The service has always been good though."
1/6/2020,20200106,3,4.3,"Just a-ok for me. Was definitely more star worthy from my husband as he loves ""jerk"" flavoring. I do not. Therefore, what am I to say? Cute decor (not my style though)...very pink and turquoise with some whimsical decorations. Again, flavoring was very ""jerky""...and I just do not care for that....however, it is definitely a must try! You may love it so much!"
1/7/2020,20200107,5,4.31,"AMAZING. I'm so happy to have this by my house.The cocktails are a little on the sweet side but no complaints from me - I like tropical drinks.We got the coocoo & callaloo and the curry goat. My partner loves okra and he loved the coocoo/callaloo - he didn't want to share any, haha. Everything was absolutely delicious.Our server was very attentive and the inside is very pretty as well - no matter what seat you get, you're basically sure to get a window seat, which is nice. I imagine it would be a cool place to eat while it's raining or snowing."
1/28/2020,20200128,5,4.32,Nice variety of tasty dishes. friendly helpful staff and nice space. Cool vibes. Sat at bar and enjoyed a quiet space with great food.
1/30/2020,20200130,5,4.33,"What a gem! We were craving some good jerk chicken and we found that and so much more at Norma G's. We came in on a Friday evening and were able to be seated promptly. First of the interior is so vibrant yet casual and comforting. Every member of their staff was so kind and warm, particularly our waitress Tina as well as the owner who came over to say hello to us and every other table. The food was amazing- so much unique and delicious flavor. We got the jerk chicken dinner and the curry goat dinner, each served with rice and sweet plantains. The proteins on each were cooked to perfection. They were tender and packed a punch with their spices. We also got the side of Mac and Cheese which I absolutely loved. For drinks, we got the Sorrel Martinis and were blown away by those. It was like nothing I had before for a martini- the Sorrel was a flavorful and aromatic hibiscus infused drink that gave such a wonderful fruitiness and spice to the martini. To top things off, we finished our meal with the Mango frozen yogurt. They source their frozen yogurt from a local favorite and mixed it in with this wonderful mango chutney. A light yet delicious cap to our evening. We had such a wonderful time here and can't wait to spread the word as well as come back ourselves!!"
2/14/2020,20200214,1,4.29,"Seriously horrible experience. We heard the waitress say I don't want to be here multiple times to the hostess. She also looked under the influence of something. To top it off the food was absolutely horrible, it was cold and over salted. After I stated that I didn't like anything and that the waitress obviously didn't want to be doing her job. There was no offer to fix anything. In fact I didn't even have an appetite to touch the food after my experience. I am a restaurant owner myself and would genuinely never ever allow anyone to walk out unhappy or unimpressed. It's unfortunate. Too many people working, not enough working to please the customer."
2/15/2020,20200215,5,4.29,"I just had the most amazing meal + experience at Norma G's :) Food is INCREDIBLE.. everything I tried (jerk chicken, doubles, curry) was on point, perfectly seasoned. The staff was attentive & pleasant & personable ...despite the fact that it was Valentines Day & the place was (comfortably) jammed. The ambiance is pretty perfect.. low light & colorful decor. Great place to take your Significant Other;)Also, I must add that for being a higher end dining experience, the food is very reasonably priced. Anyways, I'm so happy I found this place.. Can't wait to return to try more deliciousness ! I'd give more stars if I could :)"
2/15/2020,20200215,4,4.29,"This was my first time trying this place, overall a pretty good experience. The food was GREAT, I recommend the Jerk Wings. Those were one of the best wings I've had in a while. I also tried the beef patty that was really good. For my entree I got the jerk chicken and was not disappointed. The only reason I'm not giving them a five star rating is because of the service. Our waitress was very rude, but I soon realized that she was the only one that was like that. The rest of the staff is very respectful and helpful. Overall the great food outweighed the terrible service so they'll see me back again soon."
2/21/2020,20200221,1,4.25,We stopped to give this place a try. We were there 90 minutes before the closing time posted online and on the door. There were at least a dozen people inside but the door was locked when we tried to enter and they just looked at us like we were from outer space. We thought it would be good but I guess not.
2/22/2020,20200222,4,4.25,Good food with friendly and accommodating staff.The waiter noticed that we were not thrilled with the wine. (He noticed we traded glasses) He immediately asked if we wanted to try something else. He was nice enough to take the wine off and let us have a pair of cocktails at happy hour prices. The place was not packed but busy enough. Our dinners came out within 10 min of our placing the order. The food was hot and well prepared. The only down side was the portion size. (may have been a little small)That being said.. we will be back.
2/23/2020,20200223,5,4.26,Service and food were phenomenal. I didn't take pics of the food because I was too busy eating We went on a Saturday night and there was live music so that was super dope. The owner is involved and the staff friendly and attentive. The jerk chicken was to die for and the portion size was huge I had leftovers.If you've ever been to the Caribbean or have had authentic Caribbean food you'll want to come to Norma G's to relive those memories.Great restaurant will be back
3/1/2020,20200301,1,4.22,"The service was extremely slow, the food was not horrible, but definitely not worth $100 for 3 ppl. The patties were the only good thing and they are outrageously priced at 2 for $7. The jerk chicken is not jerk. The waiter told us the special was the seafood for the exact price states on the menu... Now I'm very sick to my stomach. I can only conclude that they wanted to get rid of it before it went bad.... Too late! It was definitely bad!"
4/4/2020,20200404,5,4.23,"Our first takeout since ""stay home, stay safe"", and we couldn't have made a better choice! The place was so cheery, and so clean-- my credit card and the card machine were sanitized between uses. Service was upbeat & professional, and the food was phenomenal. Our favorites were the goat and jerk chicken platters, which were so flavorful and generously portioned. The rice and beans were well-cooked and not dry, and the cabbage was a nice touch. I'm so happy we finally had Norma G's cuisine, and it was such a fun and delicious way to end the week. Can't wait to go back!"
5/12/2020,20200512,3,4.21,"Very nice atmosphere, they were kind ( I was dressed like a bum, on my way to a factory). They treated my well, the food wasn't ready when I came to pick it up within the 20 minutes they told me it would be ready. Food was tasty not my favorite Curry Goat meal Ive ever had but not bad. I really liked the inside of the restaurant it was very festive."
6/12/2020,20200612,5,4.22,"This was my first outing to a restaurant post COVID and they did not disappoint! The best part of the night was our server, Martha! So friendly and sweet! Everyone needs to try the amazing food here! Plantain fritters are to die for! Head to Norma G's now!"
6/13/2020,20200613,4,4.22,"We were looking for something other than pizza and I noticed Norma G. Caribbean on Yelp. We got two meals, the jerk chicken with rice and beans and a vegan dish. Both were excellent. Still not ready to eat out, but the restaurant was attractive and the staff we met were super nice. We'll be back."
6/27/2020,20200627,5,4.23,"We love this spot!! The food is always great, and their cocktails are fantastic - Time to Tiki is the last one I had and it hit the spot. I was grateful that they remained open during the pandemic and was never disappointed in the carry out. Lester is a great host and is sincerely happy to see all of his guests enjoying his delicious food. Norma G's is a great addition to the neighborhood and we're happy to have them in the regular rotation. Tip- check out the specials. We tried the oxtail nachos recently and they were fantastic."
8/1/2020,20200801,2,4.2,Recently had a bad takeout experience. Ordered the curry chicken entree with jasmine rice and two side orders of plain roti. They ended up giving me two stuffed rotis with dry curry chicken. Realized it when I came home and it was already too late. I also requested spicy curry and this was very mild. Roti soggy and not what I expected.
8/21/2020,20200821,2,4.18,"I was looking forward to trying Norma G's because I'd heard such great things. Myself and a friend ordered two curry goat entrees (one spicy and one mild), two orders of mac and cheese, a cocktail, and ice cream. All for take out. It was mildly expensive but we assumed the food would be worth it. We did not receive the ice cream in our order. The goat was not spicy at all. I'm not saying that the spicy goat was really only mild. I'm saying that both entrees had absolutely no spice to them. They were bland. The mac and cheese was not good. I thought it might fair better the next day after I had a chance to heat it up (we got it cold). But even when heated it was still bad. The cocktail was good. I liked that we could order it to go and it was a generous serving. I would not recommend."
9/2/2020,20200902,5,4.19,"Best food ever, and a great atmosphere. Want to come on a Friday night for the live music."
9/7/2020,20200907,5,4.2,"I had a great time at Norma G's even during a pandemic. I had the rum flight, beef patty, and jerk wings. Everything was perfect. The wings were flavorful with some heat. Will comeBack."
9/12/2020,20200912,5,4.2,"Came here on a whim for my birthday dinner. Great live music and generous food portions, with nice variety on menu. Food and drink were delicious! Owner came out to greet us. Indoor/outdoor seating. Will absolutely return."
9/13/2020,20200913,5,4.21,"Amazing experience!! My mom and I came here on a Wednesday (I think?) and felt so welcomed. The owner, Lester, and our server (I'm so sorry! I forget your name! But she's Lester's sister in law and we LOVE her) made us feel so welcome! We had a few questions and were walked through our experience perfectly. :) We knew the food would be amazing, but the drinks were delicious too, thank you bartenders! We can't wait to come back. Thank you!!!"
10/14/2020,20201014,1,4.18,"The food is subpar, not exactly authentic West Indian food , I digress. This is NOT worth $25 for not takeout, literally 2 sKimpy sweet plantains. I would never go back !"
10/17/2020,20201017,5,4.19,It's one of my fav carribean restaurants. The oxtail .......anything oxtail here is super delicious. The sliders are my fav. Actually I've tried the whole menu and wasn't disappointed lmbo
10/28/2020,20201028,5,4.2,"My husband and I had an amazing dinner at Norma G's! Our server (I believe named Mackenzie) was excellent. We ordered the jerk chicken wings and doubles for appetizers. The chicken wings were cooked perfectly and came with a tasty dipping sauce. The doubles had a flavorful veggie filling that we really enjoyed. For entrees we had the curry goat and the oxtail that's our server recommended, and we loved both. We were impressed that the owner came by to check on us multiple times, and we chatted with him about his food prep process. In terms of COVID safety measures, we sat in a cozy heated tent, and we were spaced with plenty of distance from other guests. We will definitely be returning to Norma G's soon!"
11/6/2020,20201106,5,4.2,I haven't been to Norma G's in a minute but I should have wrote this review from the get go. What a wonderful place. Staff is awesome food is delicious. Going back this weekend.
11/19/2020,20201119,5,4.21,"Came here last week for the first time for dinner. Recommended by one of my co-workers. Caribbean food is my all time favorite so I'm very picky about where I get my favorite foods from.From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out, the hospitality was 10/10. Very warm and home like. I felt at ease and ready for a good time. All the appetizers were amazing! Oxtail tacos, jerk chicken, beef patties, and jerk chicken tacos. My taste buds couldn't get enough. I was so indecisive about what to order for my entr√©e that I got curry chicken and the oxtail dinner. Both of them were phenomenal. I even ordered a drink (I don't remember the name but there was rum and cinnamon in it). For dessert, the mango tango and the trini trifecta. Both great tasting! I can tell, The owner and the manager are all about this place. They're there running the show and making sure things are running smoothly whilst having pleasant customer service. I love seeing that. I know I've only been here one time so far, but I've already made up in my mind that I'm a regular here now. No question about it. At least once a month, I'll be here to enjoy what my heart desires."
12/8/2020,20201208,1,4.18,Awful customer service from the manager. He served me BURNT wings and proceeded to yell at me after I politely asked him to remake.
12/19/2020,20201219,5,4.19,"Got take out tonight. It was probably one of the best, if not the best, meal we've had this entire shut down. The red snapper was cooked to perfection! To top it off, this small business is owned by the nicest folks!! Highly recommend."
12/26/2020,20201226,1,4.16,"I was visiting from Los Angeles, CA and a friend he took me to Norma G to eat. I found the Caribbean food to be discussing. I am Trinidadian and I can tell you, it is no way this restaurant would survive in Los Angeles California with this horrible food. The West Indies community in Los Angeles would not eat there because the food is not satisfying. The doubles were not tasty, green beans on top of rice?? that in not our traditional food, the patties were dry. Most Americans will eat at Norma G's not knowing the real authentic taste of Caribbean food for this reason, Americans don't know. The atmosphere is nice, the food I didn't finish it. Either they need a new Chef that knows how to cook Caribbean food with a flare, or get a real cookbook on Caribbean cooking. I gave you one star, lucky to get that. Left all my food on the plate. Yuk ! left your restaurant disappointed in the food."
12/30/2020,20201230,5,4.17,"Amazing! I can't believe I waited this long to try this place. I got a variety of items: ox tail tacos, curry goat, plantain fritters, and jerk chicken wings. Everything was amazing and tasted good as lunch leftovers. Everything was flavorful and the meat was so tender. Please don't sleep in this place"
12/30/2020,20201230,1,4.13,"I am in town visiting for the holidays and I wanted my family to try Caribbean food. I called and placed my order at 4:30pm for a 5pm pick up. My father, who was driving had a 6pm meeting so we wanted to make sure we were able to pick up the food in time and drive back. We arrived at approximately 5:15 (we live about 30 minutes away from the restaurant) and the food was not ready. In fact, they hadn't even started plating the meals (as we could see through the kitchen door that was wide open and by the confusion of the chef that came out from the back). They claimed they were just waiting on the snapper to cook. We were finally given our food around 5:40. The man who delivered the food blamed it on the woman in the front that took our order. Very disappointed in the service and will not be returning."
1/16/2021,20210116,5,4.14,"This spot has some of the best if not the best Caribbean food in Southeast Michigan!! I initially thought this was a Jamaican spot until corrected by the owner who is good people and accommodating but this is from Trinidad and it's just as great. The Trini Tacos, THE BEST ON THE MENU HANDS DOWN!! I can eat the Trini Tacos every day if I could!! The sauce that is made is awesome. The jerk chicken and curry chicken is awesome as well with a great kick of spices even at mild. The pricing is perfect for this restaurant. I wish COVID-19 wasn't going on because it's definitely cozy on the inside just picking up my food so it would be nice to sit down in there to eat and drink if you drink. I wish DoorDash and UberEats would stop trying to rape people from their money so this restaurant could be added. I suggest everyone try this place. You will not be disappointed. I've gone twice in one week and thoroughly satisfied. If you don't get anything else though, please get the Trini Tacos."
1/24/2021,20210124,5,4.15,I have been to this gem several times; however nothing compares to the service we had yesterday. Lester created absolutely delicious meals for my daughter's 17th birthday. From the beef patties for appetizers to curry goat and jerk chicken entrees everything was great. Even the pickiest of the eaters found a favorite in the tacos and jerk sliders. We had a variety of meals and NONE disappointed. What a joy to have in Detroit!!! Thank you so much Lester! MANY BLESSINGS!!
2/19/2021,20210219,5,4.16,"Found this spot on accident and sure glad we did. The food was amazing, the plantains were so good. We stopped in towards the end of September and were able to experience the patio dinning. We will return again!"
3/4/2021,20210304,5,4.17,"This place is such a gem and the staff are amazing and friendly. We really needed an authentic tasty restaurant in the Jefferson/Chalmers area that we can frequent. Their food is always excellent, especially the OX tail and this is the first time I have ever eaten it. If you haven't been here yet, you need to plan a visit!"
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.17,"I want to first start off by saying thank you Heavenly Father for blessing the east side of Detroit with this gem. Lol that food didn't make it out of the parking lot, it was just that good. I ordered the beef patties and the jerk chicken entree. That food was seasoned just right and tasted just like the Caribbean. I would definitely recommend any and every one to go here if you're east and looking for some yummy Caribbean food. You won't be disappointed!"
4/1/2021,20210401,4,4.17,"Very welcoming staff. Delicious food that keeps its flavor, even when carrying out. Particularly enjoy their Caribbean tacos. Oxtail and shredded chicken are my 2 favorite. House cocktails always a treat"
6/16/2021,20210616,5,4.18,"Delicious! People are friendly and helpful. The oxtail is my favorite, so tender. It gets busy on the weekends so order early if you want oxtail."
6/22/2021,20210622,2,4.16,"So I gave Norma G a glowing review & since then I can't find out WHEN THEY ARE OPEN! The closing hour posted for a Tuesday is 10:00 p.m. It's just after 8:00 p.m. & I was just told, yes by a host answering the phone, that the kitchen is closed. Then why in the name of Scratch Perry did y'all pick up the phone? The other night? They just weren't open. We did not know that there was a private restaurant in the nbhd. Dang."
7/1/2021,20210701,5,4.17,"Wonderful food and drinks in a great atmosphere. Owner is a prince of a guy and the staff is very attentive, even during this post-covid environment when every restaurant is struggling to find workers. The support from the Detroit and Grosse Pointe communities is proof of the caliber of this restaurant.  Highly recommend, please support."
7/17/2021,20210717,5,4.18,"I had the pleasure to visit this restaurant. My only regret is that I wish I had gone there sooner. Everyone including the owner were very welcoming. We felt as though we knew them for a longtime. The owner is also the chef. Apparently the restaurant is named after his mom. How cool is that? Although I'm very familiar with Trinidadian dishes it was my first time having oxtail tacos, I was pleasantly surprised with how great they tasted by using a secret ingredient. Drinks of all kind were phenomenal. It's such a chilled vibe, great atmosphere to be in. The owner would also talk to customers at the table to make sure that everything is ok. He was warm and enthusiastic toward each customer. Something that is really scarce in Detroit. I wish I could give Norma G 100 stars. I would totally recommend them."
7/24/2021,20210724,2,4.16,"Was so looking forward to eating here and was extremely disappointed with our experience although it was only a 7 minute interaction. Based on previous reviews, we called in advance to get reservations and to ensure that it would be open at our anticipated time of arrival. The person who answered the phone ( this was last Saturday) told us they weren't taking any reservations, and asked when we were planning to arrive. We told them we were going to walk in around 7:30-8:00pm and they indicated ""That's a busy time but you can try to walk in, but we don't know how busy we'll be"". The website indicated that they close at 10:30pm. So I confirmed that we would be coming. We arrived at 8:20pm and it looked good because as we prepared to walk in, it didn't look to be busy as they said it would be. WRONG! We arrived and proceeded to enter the restaurant when the hostess approached us and said ""I'm sorry but the kitchen closed at 8:20."" Us: "" Us: ""But I called and they suggested since they weren't taking reservations that we could try to walk in, and no one told me that and the website says you close at 10:30"" Her: "" Sorry the website is wrong"". "" Us: Since it just closed and we're here, and we called in, can you fit us in anyway?"" "" Her: No, sorry"" WRONG ANSWER AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!Fix the website or tell the people who answer the phone to update people!According to other reviewers, this is not an isolated incident, so if you want people to patronize your restaurant, you should practice the same level of customer service that you evidently do when people eat at your restaurant for those who are 'trying' to eat there. How difficult can it be to have your hours changed on an online site, or to tell people your hours if they changed when they call in? We specifically arranged our dinner schedule and drove to your restaurant to patronize your restaurant and this is the treatment that we receive? Very disappointing and it will be a long time before we get up the energy to try again given this treatment. Even sadder that we were not the only future patrons that had this experience."
8/4/2021,20210804,5,4.16,"The Best! Caribbean Restaurant in Detroit, it's Down the street from my Favorite Spiritual Store, La Botanica 14704 east Jefferson Detroit mi.Candles, Oils, and More."
8/10/2021,20210810,5,4.17,"Authentic cooking with a passion on the Caribbean style of serving and dining make this the best restaurant in its category nationwide. Even in the tough times of Covid, the owner and his team helped us to make a recent dinner a top notch experience.  With a larger group, we were able to try a wide selection of starters and main items. Jerk Wings were my favorite but everything rang the yummy bell for the group. Take a trip to the Isle and visit this warm and welcoming place. Be sure to say hello to the Chef...who also is the owner."
9/15/2021,20210915,5,4.18,"Norma G's immediately feels like your neighborhood place even if you don't know anyone there. The service is always super friendly, and the food is unique and tasty. Give it a try!"
9/17/2021,20210917,1,4.15,"I have passed this restaurant several times and decided to give them a try. I ordered the vegan curry and plantains; both were very bland, no favor. I very disappointed, I was expecting earthy ginger spices with a spicy cumin curry sauce. It isn't authentic Caribbean food you would find in Jamaica .. It is not even a close replica."
9/17/2021,20210917,5,4.16,Always in my top spot if I'm not cooking this is my 1# option for some good food in the state of Michigan Mr.Lester and his team are awesome
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.17,This is a great place. Beautiful ambiance. Good food. Friendly accessible chef/owner. Nice neighborhood joint.
10/16/2021,20211016,4,4.16,"Norma G's is worth checking out! The staff is phenomenal and the food is always on point. I love the plantains, always order extra because they're so good! Everything has a good amount of heat and the cocktails are strong, just how they should be ;). Love how the place is decorated and the owner always comes out to say hello to his guests. Fun vibe and a great place to get your Jamaican fix on the east side."
10/26/2021,20211026,3,4.15,Came for the doubles because I'm Trinidadian and have been craving them since I got to Detroit but they tasted nothing like what they were supposed to and it made me so sad lol. Everything tastes kinda off.. wishing the food was more authentic.
10/30/2021,20211030,5,4.16,"This place is WONDERFUL with a capital W!! Lester, the owner, has done a tremendous job outfitting this spot. Clean as a whistle as well as inviting. Cozy yet contemporary.We sat at the bar area and enjoyed jerk chicken sliders, which my wife had sampled here previously, but I had not. We also sampled the mac & cheese which is a tad different than most of the more gooey macs you find at restaurants these days. It is a tad drier with different cheeses, but I really liked it. Sometimes the others can be a bit too ""heavy"" for me, but this was just right. The jerk seasoning and cole slaw on the sliders was well-balanced and delicious.my wife opted for a rum drink (when in Rome) of which there are many from which to choose. She selected Al's Punch and really enjoyed it. I tried the Rum Old Fashioned. I enjoy an Old Fashioned made with bourbon, but this was a nice change of pace, made by the owner himself. Quite tasty and not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated.The ""bartender/server/friend of the owner/assistant manager who's name we didn't catch - she might be Nancy, if I overheard another employee correctly - is also delightful. Upbeat, helpful, friendly and efficient.Can't wait to try some of the other dishes - especially the wings. We will be back soon and often!!"
1/18/2022,20220118,5,4.17,AMAZING FOOD with AMAZING SERVICE! My husband and I have been wanting to try this place and it sure did not disappoint! Tina was our waitress and she was absolutely amazing. Throughout our meal she would give us a few samples of the different dishes so that we would get a full Trinidadian experience. She even had the chef come out and chat with us about the dishes! They were both extremely sweet and made our experience so much better! We learned from the chef that all his meat is halal! We started out with the jerk wings which were AMAZING! It came with a chipotle sauce which was spicy and went great with the rub on the chicken. Next we got the oxtail tacos. The oxtail was extremely tender and juicy. This is what they are known for! The combination of all the ingredients were perfect. These tacos were very filling! For our mains we got the red snapper and the vegan potato dish. Both were super flavorful and the portions were HUGE! Both dishes came with plantains. I only wish I got the potato dish a bit more spicy. I got the medium instead of the hot. We also bought a bottle of Norma G's spicy sauce! Must must try! Unique and fun experience!
2/3/2022,20220203,4,4.17,"Norma G's is such a great addition to the area! Every interaction I've had there has been really friendly. I've enjoyed of their jerk wings, trini tacos with oxtail, and the curry chicken. I wasn't a fan of the plantain fritters but they can't all be winners. The food is consistent whenever I order it which is surprisingly hard for other restaurants to do. They're definitely worth a try!"
2/5/2022,20220205,1,4.14,"This restaurant was very unprofessional. The manager was extremely rude and the food was beyond basic. Would not recommend, do not waste your money."

Tried the nachos last time I was there and will be getting them again on my next visit. If you want to eat somewhere that truly appreciates your business, has excellent food, and tasty drinks NGs is the place."

We were immediately seated in a front corner, perfect for families- our food arrived promptly, hot and delicious. The tiki Cocktails were superb... and a ""rum tasting"" served up by the owner was a great compliment to a fun evening.  Very excited to have a family friendly option so close to our house- we will be back, time and time again."
3/23/2022,20220323,5,4.14,"Just visited recently after a long hiatus and it was great. Perfect time to visit I shortly after they open so anytime after 4:30 pm. The jerk wings were fabulous. Plantains were perfecta d a dish I had jerk chicken on a fluffy waffle with agave was the right mix of spicy, savory and sweet. Also enjoyed the doubles and cod fish cakes. My dinner date and I tried a variety of cocktails were were delighted at each turn."
4/1/2022,20220401,5,4.15,I first met the owner when he had his food truck at Eastern Market. I've been wanting to go to the restaurant and finally made it there last night! I loved it and can't wait to go back. I had the goat curry and thought it was excellant! I'm not a cabbage fan but the addition of it to this dish was so interesting and delicious! The trini tacos were amazing - but the oxtail one was really spicy - I liked it but be warned if you don't like spice! Our waitress was great and very attentive and the owwner stopped by to chat. My friend and I can't wait to come back and eat our way through the rest of the menu! Please support this restaurant - he made it through covid but is still not as busy as he should be for the quality of the food! Go see him soon!
