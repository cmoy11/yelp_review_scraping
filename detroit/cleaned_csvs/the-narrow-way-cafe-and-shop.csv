7/27/2017,20170727,5,5.0,We tried Narrow Way for the first time today and LOVED it. Top notch coffee-my iced latte was amazing and definitely kept up with the quality of other local favorites like Red Hook and Astro. Also loved the decor- really nice spot to sit and relax. Owner Sabrina was sweet and approachable. We'll be returning soon!

7/31/2017,20170731,5,5.0,"What a beautiful space! The coffee is delicious! They serve Rishi teas. They do smoothies. This is exactly what we need on Livernois. Plus they open at 6 am weekdays. While you're there, check out the gorgeous bathroom."
8/5/2017,20170805,5,5.0,"All I can say is WOW!!!! This place is impeccable and is such a breath of fresh air. Upon walking I was immediately greeted by Micah and David. They were so pleasant. I knew that I would love David no matter what because he was rocking a Michigan shirt. So I am usually a corporate coffee connoisseur (lol) but in the last few months I have found a new love for local owned coffee shops. This place is giving me Portland meets Detroit vibes. I will definitely be a new face at such a dope coffee shop this place is one of a kind. They make smoothies, tea, and all types of coffee. Also their music choice is amazing. Another great business filling in the gaps of the city. Making Detroit a place to be!!!!"
8/5/2017,20170805,5,5.0,"This is a very good coffee shop in the growing Livernois Avenue of Fashion area. I stopped here with my dad while waiting to be seated at Kuzzos right next door. The staff is extremely nice. We walked in and were instantly greeted by many members of the staff. I had the cortado and it was very good. There wasn't a ton of options however there are enough for a new shop. The entire ambiance of the shop is very trendy. This is a very good place to come hang out, have a drink, and help support the community"
8/5/2017,20170805,5,5.0,Stopped by today and got the Iced Caramel Mocha. The drink was tasty and I was very tempted to try a pastry. I'll try one next time I visit because I will definitely be back again! Great customer service and an overall good vibe.
8/15/2017,20170815,5,5.0,"Super dope decor, creating a great ambiance! I already have menu favorites- two being the Island smoothie, and the spinach brioche roll for baked goods!"
8/21/2017,20170821,5,5.0,"Today is my first day. I really enjoyed this place. I had two Mocha for a little over $4 each. It was delicious and kept me energized as I studied. The staff was friendly and professional. If I needed time to myself to focus on my work, they respected my space, but if I wanted to be social they were engaging (which is awesome). They greeted me at the door. The interior decor is modern, stylish, & simplistic. The signage is very nice. It is a small cozy environment with wifi. The glass window opens up as a outside seating area (very nice surprise). Despite closing early during the week, they still get a lot of traffic/business. They also serve a small selection of pastries. I do wish they had some green leafy options available, but outside of that I do like the venue and intend on coming back. Oh and their bathroom is really nice!"
8/21/2017,20170821,5,5.0,"I was immediately drawn to the aesthetic of this place! The tile is beautiful, there are succulents lining the bench seats (so cute!), the women's bathroom is absolutely gorgeous, and the garage window that opens brings in so much light and a nice breeze! As someone who does not drink coffee regularly, I found there are a lot of non-coffee options on the menu (smoothies, tea, baked goods, etc.) which I love and appreciate! Their smoothie selection is incredible and each time I walk by the bakery case I want to try EVERYTHING in there! Some of my favorite menu items are the mango-strawberry smoothie, an iced chai latte, the spinach brioche roll, and the samosa strudel. Also, the customer service here is top notch! Everyone is super friendly and they really seem to take the time to get to know their customers. What put this place way over the top for me is that I received a 10% off FOR LIFE during their Grand Opening, how amazing is that!! Narrow Way has instantly become my favorite go-to coffee shop near my work! Everyone needs to check this place out!"
8/28/2017,20170828,5,5.0,First time here. Cool space. Good service. High quality pastry and coffee based drinks.
9/12/2017,20170912,5,5.0,"All I can say is THANK YOU! An excellent addition to the University District area. Mellow atmosphere, fresh pastries, and great Cappuccinos! Love that they offer non-dairy alternatives and a retro-modern decor. This cafe's a winner. So grateful that it's right around the corner... perfect place to ""work from home"". :*)"
9/18/2017,20170918,5,5.0,"This is THE coffee spot in Detroit.Interior design is on point, modern and clean without being pretentious or overly trendy. They serve Zingerman's coffee, so you know it will always taste good. They rotate light, medium, and dark roasts. My friend ordered an Americano, the only coffee drink she ever orders, and said it was one of the best Americanos she's ever had. I have yet to try to pastries but they serve Avalon products, so you know their food in on as well. Service is always excellent and there are outlets with both regular sockets and USBs next to every table. They also have a small bar style table at the front window that opens if it is nice out, so you can work outside and/or choose to stand and work.This business began as a coffee shop operating at the owners' church (about 4 miles from the new shop). They saw so much success, they decided to open a full brick and mortar to better serve their neighborhoods. They were awarded a Motor City Match grant to contribute to their opening. I learned this the first day I went to Narrow Way. I was working there in the morning, and one of the co-owners sat down with me to just chat and ask for my feedback about the place. Super friendly!Location is great for me, on the Livernois Ave. of Fashion, which is centered between Bagley and University District, with UDM and Ferndale nearby. I work here twice a week with my business partner because it's such a wonderful place and a business we are proud to support. The only ""problem"" is every time I go here I am so tempted to eat at Kuzzo's and now I have to actively stop myself from eating delicious chicken and waffles twice a week, lol."
10/6/2017,20171006,5,5.0,"A new coffee shop as good as it could get. Staff is super friendly. You can tell people enjoy working here. I enjoy coming here now and then. Pastry is very good and fresh. Out of the available savory options, Samosa is mind blowing. My other favorite in sweet section is this squared cake with almond paste on top of it. I wish this shop was closer to my home, so I wouldn't have to look for an excuse to drive here for 25 min."
10/31/2017,20171031,5,5.0,"Narrow Way Cafe & Shop is the newest coffee shop in the neighborhood. Its a great place for a nice coffee date or to lounge and study at. The staff are friendly and easy going. I appreciate that they took the time to go over their menu, which has a nice variety of coffee and smoothies to choose from. I went with an iced coffee and enjoyed it. I'll have to come back another time to sample their other drinks off the menu.While I did not get the chance to try their pastries, they do offer a nice selection such as brioche rolls, samosas and croissants."
11/26/2017,20171126,5,5.0,"Yes! My first visit was Saturday. The place was pleasantly crowded and service came with tons of smiles. While I didn't sample the baked good (next time), my cafe con panna and my fiancé's flat white were great. I'm so happy to see this cute little spot filling a very large coffee hole in the area. Until next time Narrow Way."
12/17/2017,20171217,4,4.94,Great service and delicious coffee. But is was lukewarm...I'll be back to try them again.
12/19/2017,20171219,4,4.88,"Narrow Way is a new little coffee shop that is a great option for studying or meeting a friend to catch up. The coffee is Zingerman's, the wifi is strong and free, the decor is sleek and hip, and the staff are friendly and efficient. Prices aren't cheap, per se, but they're reasonable. It's very clearly a place where you're welcome to stay as long as you want, regardless of how much you spend. That said, support this place! Also, y'all, there's a PRINTER. Because sometimes you need to print a page and who even has printers anymore? Okay, I do, but I use it so infrequently that it lives in a bin under my couch and I hate having to dig it out and set it up on those rare occasions I need to print a ticket.My only complaints here is that everything is served to-go, and the restrooms are unnecessarily gendered. Personally, no matter how good the coffee, it all kinda tastes the same when you're drinking from a paper cup. Getting my warmed (ok, microwaved) brioche in a paper bag was similarly disappointing. The cashier said that they're ""working on"" getting mugs and plates. There are two individual restrooms, one marked for women and one for men. They could easily both be gender-neutral. There's no reason not to. Once they address these two things, Narrow Way will be a 5 star coffee shop in my book!"
1/17/2018,20180117,5,4.89,"Really glad you guys put an ad on Yelp, otherwise I wouldn't have noticed how close it was to me. Anyone who lives in Ferndale would benefit by making the whole 3 minute drive here for fresh delicious pastries and amazing coffee. Upscale and modern like an LA coffee shop, but cozy and welcoming like you'd expect from your neighborhood. The manager on duty really took her time to make me a drink, and even asked me if I had time for her to make me fresh whipped cream on the spot. I didn't even tell her I'd been sick in bed throwing up for weeks and all I had been craving was a ham & cheese croissant and a frozen coffee. The time & care & attention to customers is something other independent hipster shops like the Red Hook have lost, but we continue to go hoping that spark will come back that captures us in the first place. I've lived all over the US and enjoyed the finest coffee & shops. This place made my week. Support local small businesses!!! We need more of this!"
4/19/2018,20180419,5,4.89,What a beautiful spot with peaceful music and loads of charging ports. The coffee ice excellent and the buttermilk biscuit is soooo soft and delicious! This is def a new fave.
4/21/2018,20180421,4,4.85,"Great service, atmosphere. I got brownies. Will be back to try the coffee and tea. Very nice owner. Great location."
6/11/2018,20180611,5,4.86,"Starbucks make way for Narrow Way Cafe & Shop! This place is amazing! I met one of the owners and she told me to stop by and I was not disappointed! The design of the space is very contemporary and clean. They even have a rolling door that gives you a feel of outdoor seating, with views of The Avenue of Fashion (Livernois). The staff was excellent, very accommodating and made great recommendations. I ordered a Hot Chocolate made with Almond Milk and it was so good I ordered a second one. Great flavor and probably of the best hot chocolates I have had in awhile. Overall, Narrow Way Cafe & Shop is the new hot spot! You will all around enjoy your experience there. I'll definitely be back to check out other items on the menu."
8/8/2018,20180808,3,4.77,"A nice cafe in a not so nice neighborhood. Complimentary WiFi and very modern decor. Coffee menu isn't very extensive, but it's got a great atmosphere. And delicious baked goods. I'd recommend the carrot cake if you enjoy that sort of thing. Parking streetside or just around the corner is public/residential.Overall 3/5 great service and atmosphere for a community cafe in an area that needs it."
8/10/2018,20180810,5,4.78,"Super friendly staff, especially Deb! I'm not from MI and she was friendly AF! She even offered to add extra whipped cream and chocolate drizzle to my Caffe con Panna (which was amazing, BTW). Super friendly, super helpful staff. And the setting was very sleek and modern, perfect spot to probably get ya shit done on a computer or something. Love it and would def come back if I lived around here!!!"
8/28/2018,20180828,5,4.79,"This is basically everything I want in a coffee shop--beautiful, modern, clean shop; great coffee and super nice people. Would definitely recommend!"
8/31/2018,20180831,5,4.8,"Just stumbled upon yet another gem along livernois! Friendly, good work space, great vibe. Can't wait to become a regular here!"
10/16/2018,20181016,4,4.77,"Narrow Way is a nice little gem and its right in my neighborhood! Upon opening the door, I was greeted immediately with a Good Morning! The young lady suggested I download the app for rewards and pre-ordering. The spinach and feta brioch roll is soft and tasty. I also ordered a hot cocoa. It didn't taste like it. I still drank on my way to work. I called to the cafe and spoke with the manager who explained they used toasted marshmallow in the drink. There was no compensation offered. That won't make me not come back because I still had a great experience there."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.78,"I definitely will be supporting this place. I love how its low key and not a college scene. No offense but I like my coffee shops with a certain level of ""work"". I love seeing board members conduct meetings. And that they call you by your name here. Everyone is always polite and I never feel rushed. I've had the teas, caramel mocha, strawberry mango and a few pastries. All have been on point. A new worker made one of my drinks and I didn't like it. They quickly accommodated me. There's always seating spots. There's a printing section. It's a must try."

1/19/2019,20190119,5,4.79,"Got an email that The Narrow Way had some of the best hot chocolate in Detroit. And... YES, THEY DO!!Delicious! Creamy, just the right sweet and perfect drinking temperature. The staff was SO friendly it made me even happier. The day I stopped in, I was out running errands so took it to go. Next time, I'll make sure I have more time to sit in this lovely space and read for a bit. Try out some of the other offerings on the menu. Narrow Way has a wonderful, comforting ambiance, makes a person want to slow down and enjoy. Today, as the snow falls, would be a perfect day for that. So would any other day though. This place deserves its wonderful reputation. Definitely looking forward to some time spent here. And did I mention; the hot chocolate is amazing."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.8,"My new favorite coffee shop. Friendly, fast WiFi, good coffee, great vibe, and great pastries. What more could you want."
4/19/2019,20190419,5,4.81,"This cafe is what I've been waiting for. A low key but friendly environment, playing smooth jazz with a full menu and diverse clientele. I'm so grateful for what the Narrow Way is bringing to our community. From the decor to the menu, which features many vegan options, this spot is perfect for small meetings or serious study. The baristas are welcoming, patient, and kind. Thank you Narrow Way, I cant wait to come back"
6/17/2019,20190617,5,4.81,"So I started with what I didn't realize would be the best ham and cheese croissant I've had EVER (kick your game up Paris) and a rich cup of Zingermann's drip coffee. Relaxing atmosphere. Some quiet chatter, just enough not to feel isolated. Peaceful. Then... the whole world opened up. Or so it felt. From staring at the Avenue of Fashion through clear glass panes, to feeling fresh air and hearing the hum of life on Livernois after the garage door wall was raised was equal parts invigorating and settling. Delicious coffee and food. Engaging staff. Tidy and comfortable. When the weather cooperates, sit in or out. I'd drive 30 minutes and pass other cafes for this cuppa!"
8/3/2019,20190803,4,4.79,"Open during construction, thank goodness! I need to get down here more to support this lovely business (and you do too!). They make great espresso drinks and pastries, but my bestie and I agree that their chai latte is the best thing on the menu. The only sadness is that they don't have ""for here"" cups for the iced version. If they did, you'd catch me sitting in the open-air seating on a nice day - they can open up the outside wall so that the adjacent row of seats faces Livernois. I'm hoping that the construction project on Livernois will leave a wide enough sidewalk for this cafe to have European style outdoor tables. I've never tried to do work here, but it has a ""good for working"" vibe."
8/3/2019,20190803,5,4.79,"The cutest coffee shop with the most friendly staff. The shop itself is so warm and inviting, with jazz music and decor out of a magazine. At the recommendation of the staff we got a cruffin (mix between croissant and muffin with everything seasoning) and carrot cake. The cruffin was amazing and just right for breakfast! Will definitely be back before we leave the city!"
9/15/2019,20190915,4,4.77,"Super cute coffee shop and a local business. It's a great alternative to going to Biggby or Starbucks. Great table space to open your laptop and get some work done. It's always fairly quiet and the bakery items are delicious. The only downfall is that it is closed on Sundays, which hopefully changes once all the construction ends on Livernois. It would be a great place to grab a coffee and do some shopping!"
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.78,"This is hands down the very best coffee I've ever had every time I go. I love this place. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. You may have a small wait but it's so worth it. And if you watch them make the beverages, you'll understand why. My favorites are the iced caramel mocha, the iced turmeric & ginger chai latte, and the hot cocoa. My only problem is that there aren't more locations.I'd give 10 stars if I could."
1/26/2020,20200126,4,4.76,"Narrow Way Cafe & Shop's style is modern, simple and neighborhood-y. There is an excellent selection of baked goods (sweet & savory), coffees and teas available here. These could easily rival any other coffee house that I've patronized. It's a great place to pause for refreshments between running errands, or sit down to catch up with friends. I love seeing this beautiful coffee shop café in the heart of the Avenue of Fashion. The area is a meeting point of a mix of neighborhoods. Detroit needs more places like this for locals. I wish Narrow Way cafe much success and long life in the neighborhood."
2/1/2020,20200201,5,4.76,"Best white mocha I've had in while! Environment is fantastic, staff was incredible. Cozy spot to work or meet. See for yourself, you won't be disappointed!"
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.77,"I love that this gem of a coffee shop is right by UofD, came here for a coffee study break between classes and I love it here!!!! Love the ambIence!!"
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.78,"Clean, contemporary, cool interior. Three young ladies very warmly greeted me and took care of me right away. I had a Lemon Cloud pastry, light and zesty, and a green tea. Yummy. I'll be back."
2/15/2020,20200215,5,4.78,"I enjoy coming to Narrow Way in Detroit and supporting a great small business. Coffee's good and the pastries are getting even better. I just saw yesterday that they are now offering sandwiches and salads from Avalon. I always get good service but yesterday was exceptional. I don't know if it was the half off pastries after 4 p.m., or the fact they handled my order which was unusual but not complicated, but the ladies behind the counter were so friendly. They offered suggestions and they responded really professionally to a little bit of confusion. They said thank you and goodbye in such a friendly way. I'm surprised I never wrote a review earlier, but this is really made me come back and post it here.Also, I'm a brewed iced tea fan. They don't have it, but the Rishi tea brand is really nice and worked well over ice. Also, that prosciutto cheese croissant was on point."

The shop has been freshly renovated, complete with hardwood floors, industrial lights, exposed ductwork and a garage door that can swing open on nice days to provide an open air feel.

8/8/2020,20200808,5,4.8,"I feel safe ordering from here during the pandemic. They've got a walk-up window open so you don't have to go inside, and there are well-spaced tables outside if you want to sit & sip. (Bring sunglasses...the new white pavement makes it super bright even on a cloudy day!) You do have to give your credit card to the employee to take in to charge, so bring some hand sani, or download their app for touchless payment. I've enjoyed their iced Americanos and cold brew. My partner has been trying their different lattes--they have some unique options; very fun. The people are super nice. I like cream in my coffee and have learned to ask for ""just a little"" cream--they tend to be generous with half&half, so keep that in mind when you order (there's no self-serve add-ons at this time.)"

10/26/2020,20201026,5,4.82,"I absolutely love this place. Since Covid-19, I miss going in and having a seat to enjoy my Bostock and coffee to the relaxing music. Wonderful atmosphere and the staff is terrific."

Only debt and credit right now with Covid! Atmosphere was very spaced out without tables and everything felt very clean inside! They have almost anything you can think of with a baked good section also! I enjoyed a hot Chia Latte and can only say good things! If I'm ever in the area I would stop by. Support small business and the small man's dreams!"

11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.83,"Proof that a good attitude and a great idea, properly executed, can lead to success. I visited at noon on Monday, 11/16/2020. Three (3) bright enthusiastic people behind the counter greeted me with a smile ---how's that for a retro experience!?!?The first basic measure of a coffee house is **not** how well they make foo-foo sugary drinks, but how good their *coffee* is in a good ol' hot American brew! I was not disappointed. I got the medium roast, one teaspoon of sugar and medium on the creamer --- my barista hit the nail on the head. They said they've been open for three years and I wish them all the best in these trying times, but I know that I will be back. With me working on 8 Mile Rd on the Ferndale side, this is an easy lunchtime trip for me.Now, do they do gift cards? I forgot to ask. They would make the perfect holiday gift for my employees!Keep up the good work, folks; I'll be seeing you regularly as long as that coffee stays hot and tasty and and as long as I am greeted by smiles!"
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.83,Stopped in here for a coffee and staff was very friendly. This place has a very cool vibe and is clean/following COVID practices. Street parking was super easy right in front of the store. Will definitely be coming back here to try another drink as they had an extensive menu!
11/17/2020,20201117,5,4.84,"This is such a cute place with the best service! There is a lot of parking along the street. I ordered the lavendar chai latte, and omg this was the best chai latte I've ever had! It was hot, spicy, and so delicious. They also have an assortment of Zingerman's pastries (YUM), and they toasted a chocolate croissant for me. Loved everything about this place!COVID-wise, they do a good job. There is a large hand sanitizer station right as you walk in, and everyone in the store was wearing masks properly. Only credit/debit cards right now d/t covid, and all tables were moved away."

11/18/2020,20201118,5,4.84,Seriously good macchiato!!! I wish that there were more around! Hard to find a place that can make one just right! THEY DID!!! Can't wait to go back and try everything else!!!
11/19/2020,20201119,5,4.84,"I did have an Americano while I was here. And it was great. But the real reason I'm here is to tell you about the croissant I ate that nearly reduced me to tears. This croissant is a prosciutto and parmesan croissant that they have in their baked goods case.If I had known the deep emotional reaction I was going to have over this croissant, I would have bought everyone they had. I probably would have given them to people on the street if it weren't for COVID. ""You deserve to know what joy tastes like."" I would say.The croissant was perfectly flaky and delicious and buttery. The prosciutto was tender and salty and good. The parmesan embraced all of these qualities and brought everything together in such a perfect way. When I say that it nearly brought me to tears... this is not an exaggeration. It was perfect. Just perfect. I'd warmed it up for just a little bit in my microwave. (The staff offered to do this at the cafe but I knew it was going to take me a minute to drive home and that sometimes croissants can be deliciously flaky shrapnel, so I didn't want to chance eating it in the car.)Go for the coffee. Stay for the croissants. I'm sorry I neglected to take a photo."
11/19/2020,20201119,5,4.85,"I always like coming here. The environment is cozy, service impeccable, cafe clean, and they adapted to COVID-19 safety guidelines very well. There are a variety of drinks from which to choose, as well as soy and almond milk. Narrow Way also has an app! Happy to support this wonderful black-owned business."
11/24/2020,20201124,5,4.85,"Even though I don't drink coffee, cute coffee shops make my heart sing & Narrow Way is SO CUTE! Even before I walked in, I knew it was going to be cute, because it has the cutest Issa Rae mural on the side of its building! But the inside is so aesthetic & gives it a very unique vibe that I haven't seen at any other coffee shop! The people who work there were so friendly & helpful as well! Everything is very pandemic friendly, plenty of space to space apart, hand sanitizer available right when you walk in, pastries covered from the open air, etc. I ordered a London Fog (because I always prefer tea!) and it was so delicious! Their menu has something from everyone - coffee, tea, smoothies, pastries, hot chocolate, and more!Their pastries are sourced locally from Zingerman's, which as a Michigan student, I STAN! I tried the vegetable bread, something I had never thought to try from Zingerman's, and it was the MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER! Don't be fooled by the name - it may have a ton of vegetables in it, but it tastes like a delicious moist piece of pound cake, spicy, flavorful, an autumnal party in your mouth with every bite! It's the perfect place to grab a quick pick me up if/when you're in the area! :)"
11/30/2020,20201130,5,4.85,"This is a great spot on the avenue of fashion. I loved going in here, the inside is so sleek. I had an iced lavender chai on the distanced sidewalk patio this summer and it was a delight. I look forward to getting a warm drink to take driving around looking for holiday lights."
1/22/2022,20220122,5,4.85,"My boyfriend refers to The Narrow Way Cafe as ""the really good coffee shop,"" and requests it any time we are in the area. I never say no as I love it just as much as he does! I almost always get the Iced Mocha because it is delicious and tastes like I'm drinking a chocolatey dessert. The walk up window is super cute and the workers are always friendly. Try Narrow Way if you haven't already!"
4/10/2022,20220410,5,4.86,"Great drinks. Tasty snacks. And I felt comfy the moment I walked in. At the time there was no indoor seating, but no problem--they made the right choice for their business, and I respect that choice.I'm looking forward to going again."
5/29/2022,20220529,5,4.86,"My older sis got me coffee beans from here so I was thinking about trying their in-house drinks.We came close to 9:15 on a weekday and it wasn't that busy. It's mostly parallel parking around here, but it's pretty easy in the morning.When we came in, there was one person in line in front of us. The staff is friendly! They seem to know their customers. They greet you upon entering and bid you goodbye.I got the iced vanilla latte while my sister got a cortado. That vanilla syrup was fantastic! I'm not sure if they make it in house, but it's something to come back for.My sister found the cortado to be a bit lackluster. But I think she wasn't a fan of the espresso. They only have almond and soy as the alt milk options, so I hope they add oat since some folks are allergic to soy and or nuts.They also sell a good variety of baked goods!"
