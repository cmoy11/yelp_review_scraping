11/26/2021,20211126,5,5.0,"Truly the best vegan food we've ever had!!! We have been vegan two years now and this is by far the best so grateful that we decided to come! Truly God sent service was kind, fast, and friendly. Will be back tomorrow before we go back to TN. Just visited Detroit for the holidays and I'm glad we came here p.s. I had the D- boy with sweet potato fries"
12/8/2021,20211208,5,5.0,"A great addition to Livernois Ave restaurant row!Beautifully decorated, friendly staff. I ordered the Jackfruit bowl,with quinoa & brown rice & avocado. Delicious!! The bbq sauce was tasty, I ordered the sauce on the side, like to add to my taste. Finished off with Hibiscus tea!!! Glad to have a place for vegan lovers close by! Definitely will be back to try other menu items!"
12/15/2021,20211215,5,5.0,"Excellent service, delicious burgers, and amazing dipping sauces for the fries and sweet potato fries. Did I mention the smoothies and teas????  You can't go wrong here with anything.  Looking forward to adding this to my regular rotation of spots to go for some great food."
1/5/2022,20220105,3,4.6,The food tasted really good and loved the fried cauliflower but portions are small and the food is really expensive.
1/12/2022,20220112,5,4.67,This place just opened and it is so good! I tried the DBoY and the What's Beef. Also got curly fries that were beautifull seasoned as well. If you are thinking about checking them out.... DO IT!
1/13/2022,20220113,5,4.71,"The burger was fantastic! The food is fresh, delicious, vegan comfort food cooked to perfection!!!!!"
1/16/2022,20220116,5,4.75,"Came here for lunch with some colleagues, but it has limited seating and is more of a takeout spot. SO yum. Owner was knowledgeable about food allergies and the gluten free buns were *chef's kiss*. Apple pie smoothie was one of the best smoothies I've ever had, periodt. Will definitely make part of my usual rotation."
1/26/2022,20220126,5,4.78,"I had a carry-out order for several people and yes the place is on the small side. But Trap Vegan is one of the best vegan restaurants in the Midwest. The Soul Survivor, Sweet Potato Cheesecake, What's Beef, and Trap House salad were all amazingly good. So was the Michigan Cherry Pie Smoothie. Usually, there is one thing that is just okay. All of it was great. We had a non-vegan who loved it, too. This place is local, black-owned, creative, healthy, and so delicious. Many restaurants are suffering right now, so consider supporting these great people who are giving back to the community with wonderful, healthy food."
1/27/2022,20220127,2,4.5,"I will start by saying the food is great. My issue with this establishment is the professionalism. They told me in the past they don't take orders over the phone, i never heard that but i said okay. I tried to order through doordash but doordash had the whole menu except the sliders i wanted, so that forced me to have to go in and order (very inconvenient). Then today, i made an order through their website. I tried calling them a previous time and explaining what part of the website i was confused about, but she wasn't understanding me. After ordering on the website i called them 6 times, and let the phone ring for at least a minute each time. Now when i ordered, i put in the description how i wanted my sliders. I was scared they weren't open the reason they weren't answering the phone, but lo and behold, they were. I walked in, it was completely empty besides the young lady at the front counter and the older lady in the kitchen. I explained how i called, the young lady says 'oh i'm sorry we've been busy' uhhhh okay. I ask her to see if it was made the right way in which i put in the notes, she goes over to the older lady, and comes back over to me and says 'i'm so sorry it does say that but she didn't do it'. so i tell her just give me what they made because i had to go to work, and this was my lunch. I am beyond upset that people don't want to read. I don't know if she was trying to hurry and do the order to get back on her phone or what, but this is unacceptable."
2/4/2022,20220204,5,4.55,So glad I found this place! Staff was friendly and helpful. The sliders were amazing and so were the sweet potato fries. My food was fresh and ready quickly. Can't wait to come back again soon!
2/22/2022,20220222,5,4.58,I met the owner on my visit and the food was just as pleasant as she was. I had the What's Beef burger with curly fries. The burger was fresh off the grill and juicy! I liked it so much I came back the next day and had it again. Love finding great vegan spots.
2/22/2022,20220222,5,4.62,YUMMMMMM on a trip far from home and was so happy to find this new gem. Food is GREAT! It was a little spendy and one of my orders of fries were forgotten BUT I LITERALLY DONT EVEN CARE!!!!! It was seriously so tasty. 5 big stars. Will be back again.
2/26/2022,20220226,1,4.36,Very slow service the order was not right just very unprofessional small nowhere to eat
3/5/2022,20220305,1,4.13,"This place sucked, we ordered food online, we picked it up after waiting over 30 minutes, got it home, half the order was missing! Tried to call, voicemail was full!! Paid $60 for 2 sliders and a vegan hamburger;("

3/15/2022,20220315,3,4.0,"I was very excited to try Trap vegan because I saw multiple post on Tik Tok. I had back to back meetings so I ordered via Uber Eats. I selected the Soul survivor burger with curly fries and a K. Rae special smoothie. The burger comes with pepper Jack, caramelized onions, mushrooms and trap sauce. My delivery lady called to say they didn't have curly fries so they were going to substitute truffle fries. When my order arrived it was regular tater tots which tasted like they were fresh out of a bag. The burger was ok. There wasn't a lot of flavor in the burger but the trap sauce was delicious! The smoothie was also great. I'm not sure I'll be back but I can at least say I've had them."
3/18/2022,20220318,5,4.05,Vegan burgers are the best I've ever had. The customer service woman was very kind and let us know when they had sold out of an item. Definitely going back.

4/28/2022,20220428,5,4.21,"It was my first time here today. Soul survivor burger was yummy! Also got the truffle fries, really good quality. I'll be back!It is a small business and the wait can take a little minute. But it's worth the good quality"
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.24,"The food was A1. We ordered the DBoy, What's the Beef, and sliders, plus sweet potato fries, sweet tea, and a smoothie. Everything was delicious. The D boy is one of the best burgers, vegan or meat, that I'd ever had. Smoothie contained actual fruit and not fruit syrup. Ordered in Person, food took exactly the amount of time they said it would, about 35 minutes on a Friday night right afterwork. Be patient when going in as this is a new business. Will definitely be back."
5/6/2022,20220506,4,4.23,"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We ordered around 7:10 and our order wasn't ready until about 8:15 - the automated system says food will be ready in 20 minutes, but that didn't seem to be the case, so just plan ahead- Trap Vegan was worth the wait!We tried the D Boy and What's Beef Burgers, fried cauliflower, and truffle fries (we wanted to try the tots, loaded nachos, and sweet potato fries but they were out). Both burgers were great! I thought the D boy was especially well-seasoned. I regretted having the cauliflower tossed in sauce and then taking it home. It got a little soggy. I should have either eaten there or gotten the sauce separately. Still, the sauce was great and I didn't have any trouble finishing it. The truffle fries were seasoned well- not an overwhelming amount of truffle, just enough. Overall I'll definitely be back, and I'm hoping to try more menu items"
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.26,Baybeeeee! Soul survivor is life! Best vegan burger I ever had and I've eaten my fair share! Worth the wait because everything is so fresh and hot! Pack your patience! Staff is so friendly and the music is a vibe. Only downfall is that it's small inside and will more than likely be a carryout joint for most. I love it here! Try the hibiscus tea.
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.29,Every time I come here I'm never let down. Their burgers are the best but I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and try the loaded nachos and was not disappointed! My picture really does it no justice.
