4/30/2022,5 star rating,"A hidden gym in the heart of the east side. I had the Spicy CHICK'N tacos. They were so good and filling. It comes with two tacos but one is literally enough to have you full. It came with sweet potato wedges, I normally don't like sweet potato anything but I tried them anyway and they were BOMB! Warm and soft. The tacos had a smoky flavor paired with guacamole, a cucumber sauce I think, tomato and lettuce! I would def recommend giving this place a try if your into vegan food, even if your not into it you will be after eating here!"
4/26/2022,5 star rating,"Everything was super hot and delicious! We got the gumbo, lentil soup with cornbread and sweet potato cookie. My stomach was sooo satisfied:)"
4/23/2022,4 star rating,"Good food. Some dishes are best served fresh as opposed to take out. Food was very tasty, although I didn't get the sauces in my to go order (which I was looking forward to trying) my husband and I placed a large order and maxed."
4/22/2022,5 star rating,Customer services was excellent and food is delicious! 10/10 would recommend. The portions are great too! Bang for your buck.
4/14/2022,5 star rating,"My top 3 vegan restaurants in Chicago. Food made with love is always made to serve. Great flavors and unique options. Allergens perfectly placed on menu, so you can what to avoid. Great people great food."
2/23/2022,3 star rating,Love this place as a solid option for vegan eaters. Not the worst but not the best. The fried polenta is very good
2/17/2022,5 star rating,"Jerk Tofu Wrap with roasted sweet potatoes was delicious. Extra garlic sauce ots set it off. Greens and cornbread. Their collard greens are great but I thoroughly dislike that dry cornbread. I think it's hot-water cornbread, which was a staple in African American homes decades ago. Some like it, others, like myself, do not. There was a potato corn chowder soup special one day and it was amazing. I wish they'd make it a regular menu item. Last but not least, there's this strawberry lemon cake that is one of the most amazing vegan cakes I have ever had. I definitely need them to make me a wedding cake with these flavors, even if there's no groom: just me and this beautiful cake."
2/12/2022,2 star rating,Food sometimes really good sometimes not -- like Forest Gump you never know what you're going to get. Service people rude.
2/1/2022,4 star rating,"I am not vegan but decided to check it out with a friend who is. I think they are closed to dining in but they allowed us to stay and eat but they're was no one to serve us so we ordered at the counter. Our food canned in delivery containers also. This meant also no water for us which was not ideal. We ordered the falafel fritters and oyster mushrooms. I thought they were both delicious, flavorful and crispy. Slight earthy taste to the mushrooms but not overpowering. I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for a tasty vegan place, just don't expect to dine in. Street parking was available but scarce."
1/28/2022,3 star rating,"The food was OK to good. I liked the fried okra and the oyster mushroom tacos. The combo platter with greens, beans and cornbread was ok, but not worth the price of $19. And I had to return because they forgot the cornbread.But the biggest challenge is the man at the front counter. He has no people skills and was barely attentive at all. The chef in the back was friendlier and redeemed the experience a bit. This turned my 4 into a 3."
6/2/2021,4 star rating,"Tried this new vegan spot with my friend today. He comes here often and raves about the ""chicken sandwich"". He ordered it again and mentioned it was delicious but kind of greasy. According to him the sandwich is not as flavorful as he would like but it balances out with the crunchiness and barbecue sauce. I had the Buffalo cauliflower and thought it was great all around. The flavor of the sauce was tasty and it had the crunch factor to it that made me forget it was actually cauliflower."
12/18/2021,5 star rating,"Nice dining atmosphere, but small. The food is fantastic. We had the falafel burger, spicy chicken sandwich, red beans and rice and the vegetable stir-fry with tofu. Everything was delicious. The food is locally sourced. Great spot, highly recommend."
11/16/2021,1 star rating,"Majani has been slipping lately. I order all the time online and a few instances happened where they ""didn't see"" my order. This last time the order was just incredibly later than what the online prospected. Why is it traditional that every time I order Majani, I'm late coming back to work...when I had more than enough time on my lunch. I ordered the spaghetti bowl w/ extra BBQ Cauliflower a sorrel, and a Fudge....my online order that I picked up came out to  $41.77....I was under the  impression that extra cauliflower meant a side of cauliflower.....the Cauliflower was in the bowl and only came with 4 pieces (where's the extra??) and that Mikes Vegan Fudge was TERRIBLE. It was listed as cake on Chow Now. It was gritty and it taste like coconut oil with cacao in it. Although this is my first complaint on Yelp...I over looked a lot. I vow to never come back. BGabs be late all the time....but they food always worth the extra money and wait. NOT This place. I feel cheated buying 1 bowl a drink and a fudge for $40. Especially since it was Trash."
10/16/2021,5 star rating,"Best Vegan Soulfood in the UNIVERSE! I don't know what kinda vegan sorcery y'all got going on in this joint, but I'm here for it! Popped up from the LOU for the weekend to visit fam in South Shore, and baby, got my whole life in the black-owned vegan joint. Clean establishment, great front staff and good service. I'll be back. Oh, and do yourself a favor, get that Soul Bowl w/a side order of oyster mushrooms. Wash it down with a Ginger Lemonade. Ok, bout to nap this off. Peace."
4/16/2021,5 star rating,"I Highly recommend the BBQ Roast Sandwich. It was messy in all the right ways. We also ordered the BBQ Cauliflower wings and the sauce was divine. Fried okra... great. And to finish off our glorious meal, the double chocolate cake. The only reason you stop eating it is because you have to say oh my God after every bite.Will definitely be back again!"
7/24/2020,5 star rating,"5/5 5/5 5/5 !!This is currently my FAVORITE vegan restaurant in Chicago! It's so good I've ordered it 3 times in 2 weeks :) and it's BLACK OWNED! Oyster Mushroom Sandwich - THIS ITEM MAKES NO SENSE!!! From the breading, to the texture, to the flavor, this sandwich is unmatched. It gives you a Chicken sandwich vibe with an island twist. I don't know how to describe it other that, freaking amazing! Beans and Rice - Every time I've ordered this I've been pleasantly surprised. They switch up the bean daily but it always has this ""curry/masala"" twang to its. The chickpeas and rice has been my favorite! My 2nd fav is the kidney beans followed but the black eyed peas!Crabcake Sandwich - As a southern girl who was once OBSESSED with seafood, I am a harsh critic on seafood substitutes. With that being said, they did a great job blending spices and Old Bay to recreate the concept! Jerk Tofu Tacos - I cant emphasize how AMAZING these are! The homemade white and green sauces will literally make you slap someone. The flavor is out of control! Hot Water Cornbread - This is the only item I wasn't crazy about."
5/15/2021,4 star rating,"Ordered delivery and the food traveled well, the sandwiches were both really good and packed with flavor. The cauliflower was a little soft, I think the packaging made the food sweat which made the fry taste soggy. Overall I was satisfied and I ordered there again!"

8/5/2019,4 star rating,"I'm originally from Chicago but currently live in VA. I visited here about 10 days ago with my mom. My mom is transitioning to vegan and I'm a meat-eater. Let me start off by saying the food is great! We were blown away. I've talked to my mom on the phone at least 3 times since our visit and every time she mentioned how good the food was. I've included pictures for your enjoyment.I would recommend NOT getting water unless it's bottled. If I knew what toilet water tasted like, I would imagine it would taste like that. They need a filter or something. Not even lemon can make it taste good. No one comes to a restaurant for water, so this is definitely not a deal breaker. The main reason I'm rating a place that has great food 4 stars is, service. I tried to place a catering order last Wednesday and it took multiple emails and calls (using the number on the website and restaurant) to confirm my order.  I will say that they were timely in sending their catering menu (sent within minutes of the initial request).I'll update my review after my event."
6/14/2020,5 star rating,"Wowww so good. I got takeout during covid and it was getting plenty of business - great to see! I'm not vegan but loved everything I tried: ""crab cake"" sandwich, sweet potatoes (what do they do to them??? I need a cooking lesson), orange lentil and vegetable soup, hot water cornbread. Took a minute for my food to come out but totally worth the wait. Do yourself a favor and support this Black Owned Business stat."

9/2/2020,5 star rating,"Ordered off Uber Eats, I don't know why it took me so long to try this place. It's a bit of a distance from my crib so I wanted it delivered, and y'all know how delivery orders tend to disrupt the original integrity of the meal.I can't believe the presentation, the flavor, and the freaking quality of ingredients!!!!! Oyster mushrooms in the tacos were crunchy but cooked perfectly. Black eye pea fritters were spot on. Not sure what the sauces i got were but they were fire (one of them was mango? So good).Keep doing what you're doing, you're definitely doing something right."
6/4/2019,5 star rating,"Hello World!Majani's is the ""spot""! Small, quaint restaurant with a very welcoming vibe. Fast, friendly service with a smile! Now, lets talk about the food; the barbecue cauliflower is AMAZING! Lightly breaded with a tangy cue sauce that has a ""kick""! Collards greens so flavorful, you would swear they were seasoned with meat. But, NO! They are just that darn good. Gluten free, hot-water cornbread! Oh my! Stop by Majani's for an unforgettable, flavor explosion!"
9/15/2021,4 star rating,Fried oyster sandwich was amazing! & sweet wedges are good too! Ginger lemonade is ok.
1/12/2022,2 star rating,"Hate that I had to change my original rating. I am currently sitting and waiting on my order.  No one in the restaurant right now. I was Not greeted when I walked in. I stood looking at the menu and still no words came my way. I looked up and the cashier was just standing there.  I asked if I could order and I did. I was given the total and I paid with my card. I even gave 20% tip, in which I was hesitant about giving. I was handed the receipt and no Thank You. I am big on customer service and I don't care how good the food is, the customer service put a bad taste in my mouth ."
2/1/2018,5 star rating,OMGoodness.....first time...will not be my last...I had the lunch special and BBQ Cauliflower to share with co-workers. This the best place..
6/16/2021,4 star rating,"Although this is a good option their taste is inconsistent; I can never tell what quality of flavor I'm going to get when I order (they""ve missed items I ordered in the past & last night the flavor wasn't as good to me than when they were newer). Maybe the dinner rush is a bad time to expect quality flavor..."
2/27/2018,5 star rating,"I realy enjoyed my first experience at majani. I asked to ""start"" eating before 7p at 6:20p (before even ordering) and I was served, (appetizer, entree with drinks), ate and paid by 7:55p . I didn't feel rushed or given a small portion (although I looked at the dish and thought it was small) in fact I took home a to go box.I gave 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5 ) because their mixed vegetable dish promised ginger as a flavor. I was enticed by a flavor that's hard to find and I was a little disappointed by the weakness of the ginger. I mean it was ok but if the ginger lemonade can be on point I know the stir fry could have left more impact.But wow, service, food (bbq cauliflower appetizer satisfied my comfort food craving while being healthier than other neighborhood options), great drinks (ginger lemonade, a red drink called sorrel: a great version of hibiscus tea) for $40 was sooo worth it. I'll be back.. See you there."
5/3/2020,5 star rating,"LOVE THIS PLACE. Truly one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Living so close (in Hyde Park), I can't believe more people don't venture here! Its amazing! The people are so very nice and the food is so delicious. The first time I went, my friend and I wanted carrot cake but they were unfortunately sold out of the flavor for the day. The staff surprised us by thawing a single piece for us and it was ready after our meal. This kindness is unlike any other restaurant I have been to and we were very touched. The cake was also delicious! I will most definitely come back in person once quarantine is over and in the meantime, please support this business!"
9/18/2021,5 star rating,"You don't have to be a vegan to love the cuisine here! It's perfectly seasoned and cooked. The greens and beans were tender and infused with flavor. Hot water corn bread is more like a fritter than an actual bread- no leavening- but that didn't make it any less delicious. My favorite was the barbecue tofu: sweet, smoky and savory with just a little kick of heat. The portions were generous and satisfying. Note- this is not fast food. It's made with love, and the place was busy with carry out orders. If you're in a hurry, call your order in ahead."
5/31/2021,5 star rating,I love this place. The food is soooooooo good!
11/22/2020,5 star rating,The cauliflower tacos are sooooo good.  It has quickly become my favorite item on the menu.  Three bbq cauliflower pairs well with the guac inside of the tortillas. And the sweet potatoes just seem to never be enough  The strawberry cake is bomb.com tooI rarely have anything that I didn't enjoy.
4/3/2021,5 star rating,"I'm not a Vegan, but this is one of my go-tos for takeout. I usually order from UberEats and my order is always hot and fresh.  The gyro and taco salad are my 2 favorites. BBQ cauliflower is a tad too spicy for my liking. Fried grits are good as well."
6/4/2021,4 star rating,Really good food.  Have not been disappointed! Every time I order for pickup my foid has been ready. Staff are courteous and friendly. I recommend this place.
8/15/2018,4 star rating,"A friend and I recently visited the restaurant on Sunday, 8/12 for brunch on my birthday.  I didn't know what to expect since I was visiting from out of town. I did read some of the other reviews but I like to try places for myself to demystify pros and cons feedback posted from others.It's not a large restaurant dining area but the atmosphere was cool. However, the restaurant doesn't have air I think and the windows and door was open. I'm not sure if this is normal for the restaurant or not.  It was cool enough for us to eat considering it is summer.We both ordered the Sunday brunch for $15.  Also, we had the BBQ Cauliflower as an appetizer.  They were flavorful and delicious.We tried samples of the Hibiscus tea and ginger lemonade.  I preferred the ginger lemonade that was good but a bit Spicy which is to be expected with ginger overpowering.When the brunch arrived it was a lot of food which consisted of Scrambled Tofu, Lentil Sausage with tomato gravy, cheese grits, fried potatoes, collard greens and pancakes but I chose French toast.  Everything was delicious.  I could only eat over half my plate and I asked for a to-go container to save the rest for later.  I ordered a Strawberry cupcake that was regular/normal sized but it tasted good.The waitress was attentive, nice and provided good customer service.  We ask for her to take a picture of us.I would definitely recommend the Vegan  restaurant to others.  I will be back again in the future."
8/20/2020,4 star rating,I had the oyster mushroom tacos and side of greensThe greens were fineI did enjoy themThe tacos........were the friggin bomb!I was trying the food out since I happened across the location while running errands few weeks ago I've wanted to try vegan soul food for some time so I was happy to have found this placeIssue:The menu is taped to the window in the doorwayThat doesn't allow for a comfortable reveiw or decision making because people are passing back and forth while everybody's trying to maintain social distanceService was okay....seem like they're still getting accustomed to this new CoVid-19 setup It wasn't exactly smoothBut I did enjoy the tacosHad I eaten them hot I might've gone right back for more (joke)2 tacos w/sweet potatoes fries (???)And greens 16 oz  (pint size plastic container) Total $18.47
1/2/2020,4 star rating,"Well seasoned, interesting, DELICIOUS food. Check. Uber nice, fast, skilled wait staff. Check. Clean bathrooms, cool restaurant decor. Check. This is our 2nd time and we came from Aurora. Have told all our friends. Don't forget the ginger lemonade. We got 3 to go."
2/19/2021,5 star rating,Everything was perfect ! I enjoyed the bbq cauliflower wings ! Wow so delish! I ended up eating mines before the gym ! Haha! Going back for my cheat meal this weekend!
9/9/2020,4 star rating,"Good food for those in the veggie, vegan world.I've been to both locations and will go back to the south location because parking is more convenient. Their drinks and deserts are hood as well."
2/10/2018,3 star rating,"I wasn't really as happy the second time around. The service was a bit off. They didn't have anything offered on the menu and to me its a bit pricey. Maybe its bc I have been really beefing up my own vegan cooking and have enjoyed some great meals (many better) at home. I will suggest you try this place. The barbecue cauliflower is still mouth watering and I haven't mastered it yet. Very crispy and the sauce is delicious.Also if you have a menu item that you know is a big hit and very successfully you would think you would keep them in stock. They NEVER have the sweet potato cookies. Come on that was the other reason i came there. Also give us vegan's and veggies more options than tofu. Tofu is not the end all be all, its not even good for our body. Stay away from the soy!"
9/15/2017,4 star rating,"Yummers!Great customer service, wonderful vegan options and I love that that get what they cook from local farmers and businesses. The chef even came to our table to check on us. If I can get my mom to eat vegan you know the food was great. She enjoyed every bite. This place was better than expected and those sweet potato cooked man o man. Been trying to get there for months and it was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back!!!"
7/11/2020,2 star rating,"Food is good. Be careful if you have food allergies. They do not list when SOY and ALMOND products are used in ALL of their dishes. Well, to their defense, they didn't when I ordered last. I had to contact the restaurant, request to speak to the chef and explain that something new was used in a dish I regularly ate from his menu. First 3 times fine, last time, severe rash and swelling in mouth. ‍He tried to help. I just decided not to eat there anymore.  Too much creativity from the chef in his recipes.  Proud for him and his accomplishments. Good for most, bad for me."
3/5/2019,5 star rating,"I heard about this place via a friend, and she gave high recommendations. I, being the person who usually invited her out to try different healthy, vegetarian, and vegan options, was someone who must go... Or so she insisted.She was RIGHT!!!I only stopped through to pickup a call in order, but I loved it!  It's cute, quaint, clean and the food gets an A+The menu was great. You can also see them cooking IF you stand near the register/dessert counter. The things I saw being carried out while I was waiting at the carry out area were super tempting! I was also pleased to see they do offer some gluten free options. My burger had great flavor, and those garlicky roasted sweet potatoes were special savory treat!!! #MmMmMmI look forward to coming back, and sitting for dine in service."
5/11/2019,5 star rating,"YESSSSS! Thank you Majani's for coming far south. Thank you for introducing good vegan and vegetarian food to the masses. I love the restaurant in South Shore so it was a blessing to see them come to the Pullman neighborhood. If you haven't been there, you are totally missing out. I love everything they had to offer but my absolute favorites are the fried oyster mushroom sandwich, fried grits and jerk tofu tacos. The area that they are located in is absolutely amazing! And they are opened 7 days until 10pm!"
3/16/2021,3 star rating,"The food here is excellent and I love to support great local businesses, but unfortunately I waited half an hour past the time they said it would be ready and finally gave up and told them I needed to head home. The restaurant is refusing to refund my order :( It was a little scary inside because none of the people were wearing masks around their faces (they had them on, just not pulled up)***UPDATE. They refunded my order. I will definitely return to this restaurant. The food is delicious and it's worth giving another chance. I do hope they start wearing masks to protect each other and the community! :)"
12/4/2020,5 star rating,"I love bacon, but when my body needs a break this is a great place to come. Stars for flavor, presentation, and atmosphere. I almost don't miss the meat...almost."
3/5/2021,5 star rating,This spot is SWEET. Not only were the Cauliflower Tacos jamming but the quality of ingredients was superb. The staff was courteous efficient and very welcoming. I live very close and just ebiked down to exchange. Now I will be definitely frequenting the Majani and look forward to trying everything on menu can't wait.
1/10/2019,4 star rating,"Majani is a delicious and light homage to Soul Food and in 2019 I'm here for it! First impression:I Heard: will this be dine-in or carry outI Saw: a thousand-watt smile directed at me by the server, (Mariah) and one of the Chef's. The space is a mix of four-top tables, a two-seater, and a large community table.Before coming, I had heard so many great things and thought it would be best to go with a staple that everyone raves about. To that conversation I will add - Do not under any circumstances leave this establishment without trying the barbecue cauliflower and the sweet potato cookie. Everything is made fresh to order and that is an added awesome point from me.The BBQ cauliflower was so good I didn't want to stop. It wasn't lost on me that the integrity of the cauliflower remained while giving me the feel of a substantial bbq dish. I did, however,​ request more barbecue sauce.For the​ main entrée,​ I went with the Black-Eyed Pea Tacos and the Sorrel Punch. Damn ​that that sorrel punch is everything - sweet and delicious. I cannot really call the flavor profile but it's a definite winner.  The tacos were good. Packed with spice and a great texture. I will say it was awkward to eat. The Black-Eyed Pea filling is two huge balls per taco. Might be a good idea to make strips or some other shape.I sat there to enjoy the ambiance​ and savor the flavors. No rushing, just enjoying a meal. The staff was very attentive but never did I feel rushed. Now my favorite part of any​ meal, the dessert! The sweet potato cookie was delectable and so decadent at the same time. It satiated my sweet tooth with just the right amount of icing. I hear that people come in and order these things in quantity so if it's your desire to have this, call ahead and show up early.Another cool thing about this place is that by supporting Majani, you are directly supporting local farmers. The bulk of their ingredients come from local growers that they list in the restaurant. I am looking forward to trying more and also when the seasons change to see how the menu varies and adapts to seasonal changes."
3/9/2019,5 star rating,"Taking the sweet potato rolls home.  I thought they'd be crispy for some reason, but their aren't, in fact they are cold and fresh.  Not for me, but I'm sure the wide will love em. Enjoying the fried grits with extra ""gravy"" and bbq cauliflower.  ‍‍"
3/30/2018,5 star rating,"The sorrel is REAL!!!!  Order it without ice for the full experience and you'll thank me!  So on this episode, we had the BBQ CAULIFLOWER, Fried black eye peas, and mixed veggies - FIRE!  Now I am full...  I didn't finish the appetizers above and I'm waiting on my lentil and mushroom burger.  (Rolling my eyes). Oh well, I'll have much to enjoy as I watch Loyola get with Michigan in the Final Four tomorrow!"
6/17/2017,5 star rating,"The food was PHENOMENAL!  I remember when Chef T had his place  in Mt. Greenwood, so happy he is back to serving the public...  now let's get to it - my wife had the Black Eyed Pea tacos, and they were UNBELIEVABLE!  As for me, I went with the ""crab cake burger"" and OMG  it was better than crab cakes in Maryland!  The salad dressings are all house made and delicious.  I sampled the avocado and garlic dressings - DELICIOUS!  I turned back and had the dinner which consisted of egg plant (SPECTACULAR), green beans (the best I've ever had), crab cake, and a salad - FILLING.  I've found. New favorite in ChicaGo.  If you want a true souls vegetarian experience, look no further AND you'll find the service to be what you'd EXPECT for your hard earned dollar!"
6/19/2020,5 star rating,"I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. I ordered the jerk tofu sandwich- helpful hint get the onions on it they were so deliciously caramelized! The jerk tofu was so flavorful, and there was the right amount of tofu! The sandwich came with delicious sweet potatoes! They may be the best sweet potatoes I've ever had. The collard greens and corn bread completed this amazing meal. I will absolutely be back here again and again! Support this amazing Black Owned Business!"
1/15/2020,3 star rating,"We went about a month or so ago. My mom loves this place! We went pretty early to avoid a crowd- it was very small and service was slow and not that great. The food was OK. Some of it was cold. Specifically the scrambled ""eggs"".  I plan to visit again- hoping for amazing HOT food next time."
6/8/2017,4 star rating,"The food was great. The salad was one of the best I've ever had. We got the black eyed pea bean burger with sweat potato and the dinner which included a stuffed red pepper, mac and cheese, eggplant and green beans. Everything was delicious. I loved the burger, but the patty was very thick (which is not a bad thing for some people). Everything was also flavorful, but the green beans could've used a bit more seasoning. The sorel drink was spectacular. It was a punch that contained strawberry, banana, and mango juices. Yum!Our waitress was a bit amnestic which made for an interesting experience. I requested sauces on the side, so I could control my portions of what went on my burger: she forgot. I requested some salt and pepper for the green beans: she forgot. I requested a fork for the double chocolate cake (that tasted like heaven btw): she forgot. I recommend everyone try this spot out. They're pretty new, so they're working out some logistical things with the menu. The menu changes daily until they figure out something standard."
2/12/2020,5 star rating,"Had the lunch special which was outstanding. Jerk tofu and perfectly cooked collards. Mac n cheese was good too. Candied yams were the perfect sweet note to end on. Can't say enough good things about it-great food, reclaimed interior, supports local urban farms and solid value. As a north sided, I hope more of my compatriots make the trek as it is well worth it. I am not a vegan but Majani would make it an easy transition!"
1/30/2021,5 star rating,"This is my second time trying them and both times were great! I'm a new vegan, only been trying it for about 3 weeks. So this place gives me hope for enjoying flavorful meals without meat. Don't get me wrong, nothing compares to meat but this is a close second. It's definitely worth a try if you want a good vegan meal. The gyro is delicious. The protein isn't quite the texture of a normal gyro meat(lamb) but the flavors mimicked it very closely. The bbq cauliflower are DELICIOUS as well!!! I'll keep coming back!"
4/1/2020,4 star rating,"Got (covid quarantine) takeout from here and was very impressed. It's vegan food that is not trying to be the typical healthy vegan cafe stuff. It's very tasty, filling, but still sits well and doesn't feel greasy. I loved the sweet potato home fries. The sloppy joe was verging on too sweet of barbecue sauce for me but I still happily ate it all."
10/8/2020,5 star rating,"One of the best places in the South Shore area. I absolutely love their food, their service, and their ambiance. The owners of this place did an amazing job with everything!"
3/14/2020,5 star rating,"I have eaten here about half a dozen times go through delivery and in the restaurant. The food is excellent, sometimes the proportions are off like the bred to whatever ratio. But that's cool because at the end of the day it all tastes good as hell. My only big criticism about this place is just a lack of space inside of the restaurant, sometimes if you get really crowded and that's really frustrating trying to find somewhere to stand while you're ordering your food so be prepared for that you won't end up frustrated like I was. Anyway like I said the food is banging check it out. Also everybody in there is black and beautiful yeah, even the patrons oh, I know it said it gets crowded but it's crowded with some really awesome people I don't know what it is about the restaurant it just attracts some of the friendliest most beautiful people in the community."
6/20/2021,5 star rating,Very delicious & flavorful food... alllll the food I tasted is sooooo delicious.   I love vegetarian food more now...
9/23/2020,3 star rating,"The lentil mushroom burger was dry, not sure if DoorDash delay had any fault. The sweet potatoes were great. The chocolate cake was very good, for their type of vegan products, which are often globally mediocre. I'll go back to try other products one day for another chance."
8/30/2019,2 star rating,"The first time I visited this restaurant more than a year ago, it was very busy. We placed a takeout order and waited more than half an hour; we went back to the car to sit down until the food was ready. I had chalked that experience up to the timing of our visit, but the wait time made me continue to think twice about going back for a while.Recently, inspired by advertising for their vegan ""chik'n"" sandwich, our family decided to go. The place was mostly empty, with one active table besides our own, so I was hopeful that we would be served quickly this time. It still took over half an hour for our entrees and appetizers to come to the table, despite people who came in AFTER us being served their food. When the food finally arrived, to my disappointment and annoyance, the sandwiches offered were literally NOTHING like what was advertised. To his credit, the owner seemed to notice that we were not being served properly and tried to intervene. But it honestly doesn't seem to matter if the place is busy or not; I have come to the conclusion that I cannot come to this place if I am actually hungry, because I will be made to wait no matter what, and pay a relatively high price for it on top of that.On the bright side, the food tasted ok, especially the cauliflower. But the fact that we did not receive what we actually came for, combined with the inexplicably slow service, is going to again make me rethink coming back to this place. Disappointing."
12/28/2019,4 star rating,"It has a homey kind of charm, located in an area deeply entrenched in Chicago culture. The BBQ Cauliflower was my fave by far!!! So tasty, with just the right amount of spicy, the breading was not too thick & was fried to golden perfection!! The Gyro Sandwich was very tasty, could have used just a tad bit more sauce. The stir fry was a little smoky and didn't have its own distinct flavor. The service was really good and the atmosphere was very pleasant."
8/11/2018,1 star rating,"Seven months ago, my beau and I visited Majani and I was displeased with the presentation of my food. Mustard and ketchup does not belong on avocado, let alone a lentil burger.  Fast forward to today, my mother wanted to take me out to eat as a post-birthday treat. So, I decided to give Majani another try, to support black businesses. Days ago, I was just at True Food Kitchen for my birthday and had a great time and experience. Upon arrival at Majani's, the front door was open, which meant there was no air conditioning and on an 80-plus degree day. It bothered my mother more than it bothered me, because she's in her senior years.We are told that we can seat ourselves, so I walked to a table with four chairs, but only one setting of flatware was present. A waitress offers water, nothing else. I asked if I could have water without lemon and you would have thought I asked for a percentage of the restaurants profits. Bizarre.. Shortly after, I ordered hummus and pita as an appetizer. My mother and I decided on our entree, so we are ready to order, but our waitress has disappeared for a long time to cavort with other staff. I see this as I look in the kitchen area. We are patiently waiting for her to return. Nothing. She walks over to another table, then another. Finally, I grab her attention and ask if we can please order. Now, my last visit, I took issue with the lack of condiments other than mustard and ketchup. Nothing much has changed. The waitress notes that they have garlic and barbecue sauce. Vegan mayo or avocado spreads must be really expensive to stock. I go wash my hands. The soap dispenser is broken. Hmmm...looking for the ""Employees Must Wash Hands"" sign. I unscrewed the pump to pour out soap. I really should've cancelled our food order after exiting the ladies room.Our hummus and pita arrive and is placed on the table, with no serving spoon or plates. I had to ask for napkins. She brings napkins and I assumed plates and a serving spoon would be with the napkins. Nothing. I'm thinking...""WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS PLACE??"" The waitress has walked away at this point. Having to constantly ask for items that should automatically be given during your dining experience leaves a very bad taste in my mouth and oddly, annoys the waitstaff! I get up from our table and ask another young lady behind the counter for two plates and a spoon. Not providing a serving spoon and plates for the hummus was unacceptable. I have been to numerous Mediterranean restaurants and have never been brought hummus without a serving spoon or plates.At this point, the heat is getting to me and I'm out of water, as is my mother. Yet, absolutely NO refill from the waitress. That water must've been alkaline and from Whole Foods. The waitress did however, walk past our table with two pitchers of ice cold water for a group that sat across from our table. I asked my mother if I should ask them for a bit of their water. She asked the waitress for ice, which was brought to her and still no water, for either of us. I have never seen anything like this before! I assume that we should've repeatedly asked for water refills, regardless of the fact that properly trained waitstaff always watch out for glasses that need refilling, whether it's water, soda or any other beverage.  As my mother and I sat at our table, parched and dehydrated in 80-degree heat, I see a young girl who was at another table get up and grab two sets of flatware from an empty table. We decided that we had enough and asked to have our food prepared to go. This was the most unpleasant dining experience that I can think of ever having. Dining in 80-degree heat (indoors) and inattentive waitstaff with absolutely no training, is not how I wanted to spend my post-birthday outing with my mother. My attempt at trying Majani's again was a complete bust. My mother asked why our food took so long to prepare and be delivered to us, and the waitress replied that they were ""really busy"". I had a chickpea burger and she ordered red beans and rice. Two tables already had their food and a party of ten had yet to order. I know this, because I watched their table wondering if their experience would be as awful as ours. Lastly, when I noted that my mother needed the itemized receipt, the waitress snapped, ""Its right there"", pointing to a receipt in my mothers hand and walked away. How rude..Majani might have customers and they might even be loyal. But, I cannot imagine anyone that dines at a variety of restaurants would say what my mother and I experienced, is to be expected and even worthy of repeat business, because it is not, at least not my business. A broken HVAC cannot be avoided, but improperly trained employees and broken soap dispensers can."
1/15/2018,2 star rating,"This place has a nice ambience and the staff were welcoming upon our arrival. However, patrons should be allowed to add their own condiments to sandwiches and burgers. Additionally, mustard and ketchup does not belong on avocado. It just doesn't...and it's disgusting.There are other condiments besides ketchup and mustard that are pleasing to a vegan/vegetarians palate, such as vegan mayo, regular or flavored hummus, or avocado spread. Ketchup and mustard are unoriginal and unappetizing on a vegan/plant based burger or sandwich, and again, allow customers to add their own condiments. Also, when we asked for the check, the waitress verbally stated what was due. That was odd. Then, no receipt was given after payment."
12/5/2020,5 star rating,Great food. You would not evening know that it's not meat. I bet on them for my moments when I'm not eating meat. You will not be mad or disappointed.
10/15/2019,4 star rating,"I stopped by Majani with a friend for a late lunch this past weekend. It's a really cute and modern spot in the south shore area. The restaurant is small so if you plan to dine in during peak meal times I suggest arriving early to grab a spot. Appetizers: we ordered the bbq cauliflower and fried okra. BBQ cauliflower was delicious! I typically don't like bbq flavored food but this was absolutely one of my favorite items on the menu. I would go back to this place for the bbq cauliflower alone. The fried okra was fried hard how I like it but lacked a bit of flavor. Entrees: I ordered the lentil burger which came with a side of large chopped sweet potato fries. The burger was ok. I actually enjoyed it more the next day once the seasonings kicked in. I might've enjoyed more if it was brought to me hot instead of luke warm. My friend ordered the gyro and she said the same. It was ok. However, she ordered a side of greens and they were AMAZING! Hands down some of the best greens I've ever had in my life! Service: Staff was super friendly but service was really slow. Apps took awhile to come out and I had to remind the staff to bring me my entree after my friend received hers way earlier than me (which is probably why it was a tad cold). Overall: bbq cauliflower and greens were standout items. They have a large menu that I would like to explore. Staff was pleasant but they need to work on service timing. I would definitely come back to try out some other food options."
8/19/2020,2 star rating,"I hate to give any business a low rating, especially black owned businesses but I also have to be honest and hopefully they'll do better and learn from their mistakes. We went to the new location on 111th St. by the expressway. In light of the fact of the whole Covid 19 thing, we choose carefully where to spend our dollars when dining out. We like the healthy options and went with hearty appetites and open wallets. The new location is larger than the original though they share with another restaurant. (A barbeque restaurant btw with no hint of smoke on the premises but that's a review for another day) We ordered 45.00 worth of food, falafel balls, sandwiches, barbequed cauliflower, fried okra. Everything was tasty but the fried okra was a fail and here's why. Clearly the cooks don't know the properties of okra which requires lots of cooking to become soft and edible. You cannot take fresh okra and deep fry it whole and expect it to be soft enough to enjoy without overcooking the coating. And the coating should have a bit of cornmeal in it so that it sticks to the vegetable. Mine was far from done, it was tough and chewy and the batter kept falling off. My suggestion from someone with 30 plus years cooking experience, boil it first and cut it up into smaller pieces or just buy it pre breaded. Wasted money for an inedible item. Now for the real problem: the staff is clueless about customer service! For all the food that we bought, they gave us ONE dipping sauce to go with TWO orders of falafel balls and the fried okra. When we asked for extras they insisted on CHARGING us 50 cents per sauce, along with some mild attitude. Right now, your business is depending on EVERY customer. We know things are tight for everyone. It goes to reason that one cup of 50 cent sauce could cost you return business. Teach your employees that. Also if you're only gonna have seating outside then get the umbrellas that go with the patio tables so that diners can have a shaded area. No one wants to catch sunstroke trying to patronize your business. Do better. Thanks."
7/4/2019,5 star rating,"I came here with a group of friends, straight from Midway. A friend who still lives in Chicago said it was a must. Considering I'm only back in town for a few days and have a number of long-beloved restaurants to check off my list, I was nervous to risk ""wasting"" one of my major meals on a new place I didn't know if I would love or not. I am so happy this was our first stop. The fried okra and fried cheezy grits were highlights, but all the food was so delicious. I ate well past being hungry. The vibe was nice, comfortable, and cozy. Majani is now on my list of mandatory go-tos whenever I'm back in Chicago."

I'm so glad I found this little jewel and can't wait to try more menu items. Whether you are vegan or not, this place is worth a visit!"
3/3/2020,5 star rating,"Everything we tried was good. BBQ cauliflower, jerk tofu tacos and the gyro. I've had many vegan gyros and this was the first one that was spiced well and it helped the tzatziki was spot on and fresh (for me the sauce is import). The cauliflower has a light batter on it, just enough to hold the sauce well. All the main entrees came with sweet potato wedges which were perfectly cooked. The portion sizes and price points work as well. They do have healthier options as well but I was seeking comfort food today."
10/21/2020,1 star rating,Overpriced and underwhelming. Not worth the money and the owner is an asshole! I could say so much more but I'll hold off for now.
12/1/2017,5 star rating,"This place is a gem to the South Shore area. The food is delicious and soulful. You will definitely get your fill on some healthy, comfort vegan food. I have been going here since it has opened. My favorite thing is the community. I have met facebook friends that i have never seen in person, i have ran into my neighbors and mets new friends who just so happens to be neighbors. My only critique is the service. Although everyone treats you like family it can get a bit chaotic and service sometimes lack. But nevertheless they do what they can to make sure you'll be back. My favorite items are the tacos, bbq cauliflower, soup, fried okra, sorrell and the cakes. Enjoy and come again!"
2/26/2018,4 star rating,"I'm so glad this tasty vegan spot is in my neighborhood! I've enjoyed nearly everything I've had here, and I love that they source their produce locally--like, really local! I also admire Chef Tsadakeeyah and Nasya's partnership, tenacity, and sense of commitment to culture/family, sustainability, and community.The space is lovely, the menu rotates (updates given on social media), and prices are fair. There are appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, lunch specials, and dinners available. I believe they also serve brunch on the weekend, now. I definitely want this gem to stay and flourish, so I try to spread the word and send or bring a different friend in to experience the Majani magic as much as possible.Head on over South Shore and experience some soulful vegan goodness. Are you still sitting there? C'mon, people! What are you waiting for?"
4/27/2018,4 star rating,"BYOB.  Trek-worthy. Comfort food. Readable and Understandable Menu.  1-star less as dishes need pre-cooking seasoning as it's on the bland side, and the BBQ is shady.  I hope my friend was joking when he said, ""you don't wanna know what's in the BBQ dish.""Hearty SALAD with beet dressing and sweet fresh perfectly ripened tomatoes.  Good balance of ingredients.Solid KALE, MAC N CHEESE, and crunchy CORN BREAD that needs salt.LEMONADE drink has ginger.SWEET POTATO COOKIE is a guilt-free dessert that is still good the next day when slightly heated.SERVICE was friendly.Small VENUE with 1/4 seating area, seats 30(?), with 75% kitchen."

5/10/2018,5 star rating,"I will have to call the health department on the kitchen staff because they put their FOOT in that food!From the nice vibe of the restaurant, to the impeccably friendly and attentive service to my meal, I absolutely enjoyed my experience at Majani. I ordered the BBQ cauliflower (an absolute must!), greens and cornbread. Every single item was flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The cauliflower had a hint of sweetness and the cornbread was unconventional but soooo good! I was most impressed with the greens. In my experience, vegan greens lack flavor but these kinda tasted like a turkey neck was in there! (I haven't had turkey in over a decade so I may be delusional)Definitely a highlight to my time in Chicago. Hopefully I can come back before going back home. Highly recommended!"
6/19/2021,1 star rating,"I've been to this restaurant on many many occasions, too many to count. I've received poor customer service maybe twice before ( unorganized, scrambling,etc) but today was the straw that broke the camels back. There's no professional management here. So today I order, wait 20 mins, get my food, get home... take the very first bite of my soul bowl and the ""Mac and cheese"" is literally elbow noodles and silken tofu then baked. No flavor gross texture, beige in color, candied yams were not candied and greens were tasteless. Again I've been to this restaurant time and time again and the food has always been good. It's been several months maybe even a year since I've been here last sooooo I'm definitely disappointed AND confused. (I've raved about them for years) I also got a side of fried grits that was seasoned perfectly that also let's me know it's not my taste buds. AND I forgot to mention the new containers... which wouldn't be an issue if the new serving size wasn't significantly smaller. One ice cream scoop of each item... for $16.  I call the restaurant and explain that my meal was unsatisfactory upon tasting and would like to exchange it...the girl who answered the phone had clearly not been trained should there be an issue with a customers order, ( not her fault, very nice just unprepared) I ask to speak to management she tells me to hold, I wait about 3 mins she comes back and says the manager said we can't exchange or refund your order. I again ask for the manager, I hold again and another cashier gets on the phone identifying as the ""trainer"" and repeats the same thing ""we can't exchange your order"" at this point I'm livid as I don't like for things to be repeated to me, I comprehend very well, also I paid $25 bucks total for one takeout meal... you mean to tell me you don't have a resolution???? They are always scrambling and don't know what to do so again at this point I'm pissed. my request was to speak to the Decision maker and provide them with a few tools to assist their future customers ( as I will no longer be one)  ok carrying on, the cashier at this point doesn't know what else to say so she gives me a phone number to ""commissary"" where I can reach the manager/ decision maker... ok cool. I call and the number rings indefinitely w/ no voicemail. I call back to get a different number and they tell me that's the only number and to try and call back later. Internally livid but holding my composure. No one showed any type of concern for a returning paying customer who politely expressed her disappointment with the UNUSUALLY BELOW AVERAGE MEAL. Honestly, you'd rather my last impression of your business be unsatisfactory? No problemo"
6/27/2020,5 star rating,Let me start by saying I wasn't surprised that it would be good but I am surprised that it was soooo good.  I had the fried mushroom sandwich... man that sucka was yummmie! Also you have to try the  Habanero jams/sauces.  I support black ownex businesses and will glad go back next time in in the Chi!
5/5/2019,4 star rating,"Excellent food- good portions; made fresh-to-order. The jerk tofu lunch came with: macaroni & cheese, greens, candied yams, and an organic side salad.  The orange lentil soup w/ hot water cornbread was delicious as well. The only thing disappointing was not being greeted upon entering the restaurant and having to seat myself.  Also, I was told to keep my salad fork to use for my meal, instead of getting another clean fork. Overall, I was pleased with the food and will most likely visit again when I return back to Chicago!"

11/1/2017,4 star rating,"Second Time Review: (Service Review) I came here last week forgetting it was Valentines Night, so of course the restaurant was packed. The only issue was that the person handling takeout orders began to take our orders so the actual server thought we had been taken care of; he later had to retake our order. With that being said, I know that this restaurant is still fairly new but they could really benefit from a food runner. Seeing the server take gloves off every time he walked over to a table is weird and he looked stressed out. Like I said before it could be the unexpected Valentines Day rush but that could be helpful. First Time Review:Had a wonderful dining experience at Majani's in South Shore. Having this establishment in the South Shore neighborhood that represents the residents is extremely important and beautiful to see. I am far from being a vegan but the food here will make you reevaluate your choices. I had the cauliflower wings,  black-eyed pea fritters, and the jerk tacos. All were amazing, properly seasons and gave a tasty flavor profile. I cooled down my palate with a refreshing ginger lemonade which was reminiscent of the ginger drinks from the Caribbean. Parking can be found on the street and the restaurant is few steps away from CTA and Metra rail. The establishment resides right at the corner and is hard to miss. The seating is a tad tight and can get pretty cozy for patrons and waitstaff around peak hours. They do offer carry-out and have a rang of vegan desserts along with their entrees. They also offer soy-free and gluten-free items. I am so glad this place is in SouthShore and represents a healthy and conscious dining experience."

9/7/2019,1 star rating,"I found out about this restaurant during the vegan fest in the earlier part of the summer. I was immediately fascinated with the BBQ cauliflower as I am a Chicago native and I love ""mild sauce."" It was the perfect taste. Craving something healthy with a little taste of the hood. I thought "" let me get the bbq cauliflower again."" I arrived there on a Saturday afternoon and asked for any suggestions for something else off the menu. The cashier suggested a lunch special and said it would be better to substitute the jerk tofu for my craving of the cauliflower. I receive my order and arrive home- ready to eat. To my surprise, my order is wrong. This plastic, unhealthy vegan option of ""tofu"" is sitting on my plate. I drive back up there and was not treated for my inconvenience . The representative did not want to give me a discount nor a refund. She kept offering ""desserts"" for the difference. I didn't come in there for sweets, I came for a nice vegan meal. I asked could I have a side of Mac and cheese considering my difference was 5+ dollars (after I ordered my original meal of cauliflower) and she said no. I said well I'll take a side of collards. I wait another 15 minutes get my order. The lady acts as if I irritated her. I'm spending my money in the community and to be treated so poorly is an example of why African Americans can not keep our dollar in our own community. The positive treatment and respect of the customer is not honored. And guess what- I get home to eat for the second time again, I am I have a plastic container of soggy cauliflower and cold collards. I am truly horrified by this experience. I will not be back."

They are topped with a chunky tomato sauce.To drink.. ginger lemonade and sorrel. The lemonade is hot, hot, hot.  The sorrel is sweet, yet tart. And last, but not least, desert...

The ""Crab"" cakes, the Taco salad, the Bbq cauliflower, the Orange lentil soup & the Fried grits (polenta) w/marinara sauce are all delish!If you try the Gyro, the tzatziki is a little disappointing for those that love gyros & sharpness of real greek yogurt...Oh, and how can I forget their cupcakes... the German chocolate & carrot cake are delicious!"

5/3/2019,5 star rating,"In town from Portland Maine to see my daughter who goes to College here and she recommended this incredible place.  Listen, the food was incredible!The best was the barbecue cauliflower, followed by jerked taco, with the perfect amount of heat and tang. When I left, I had to go for a walk to shred some pounds.  Excellent staff also! Very nice.  Definitely going back before I leave."
4/25/2019,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try them for some time now. I've flirted with veganism before. I must say I wish I'd found this gem earlier. I had to try their famous BBQ Cauliflower!!! I could eat this every day! For my entree I had the rice and curried chickpeas with collard greens. It also came with a side salad, I chose the cucumber vinaigrette. Everything was phenomenal. So fresh and bursting with flavor. You also must try their baked good! To go, I chose their lemon cake with strawberry filling and a sweet potato cookie with cream cheese frosting. Please give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"

11/1/2018,5 star rating,Since transitioning into the vegan lifestyle in May I have only found just a few restaurants I really love. After visiting Majani's today....I have now found my favorite vegan restaurant! OMG! The food was so good I had to fight myself too not eat with my hands. Lol! I had the BBQ cauliflower and the spaghetti/fried oyster mushrooms/greens combo. I also added in the carrot cake cupcake and yellow cupcake. I will definitely be back really soon.
6/25/2018,5 star rating,"Go! Go! Go! Delicious! We decided to make the trek from one end of the city to the other for Majani and we are so glad we did. The food was SO good! Their ginger lemonade was legit and delicious. We all split the BBQ cauliflower (SO GOOD), black eyed pea fritters with mango habanero sauce (perfect) & fried grits with the most delicious marinara ever. I had the gyro which was good. Their jerk tofu is out of this world with flavor and the perfect amount of heat! Another friend got their beans & rice with greens and cornbread and we all really, really loved that! My husband devoured his crab cake sandwich. We all split their pineapple upside down cake, carrot cake & sweet potato cookie. All were moist and delicious. We can't recommend this place enough! Our ONLY complaint was that our food came out at random times (my dinner came 10 minutes before anybody else's) but they were very busy and I can only imagine it takes time to work out kinks when you're making some delicious, fresh food. I'm sure they'll work this out the longer they're open. I'm definitely willing to wait it out! Only two vegans at our table of six, so while my husband and i were in vegan heaven our other friends were also incredibly happy and didn't miss animals in their food at all."
4/3/2018,1 star rating,"I had thee most HORRIBLE experience here. I had High hopes when rushing over to this place last Sunday after church. I support my community and having grown up in South Shore to see that a Vegan business (I believe is black owned) has opened in the heart of my community and with great reviews I was ALL IN. I picked up my great aunt who was excited to get out the house at her old age and to have brunch with me and my boys. I checked the app and this place was closing in 1 hour from the time we arrived which was fine. The restaurant has about 6 tables total and is Beth cluttered. I wouldn't mind in other circumstances (me not having a car seat and a infant with me trying to fit into the restaurant). We sat and waited and waited and waited, another person entered after us and was seated and she was immediately welcomed and brought out water and her order was taken. The person who took her order we signaled over to ask if someone would be helping us and she said she will find our server. I mean the place is the size of a matchbox so why do you have to ""find"" our server?  Once we got a server she was clueless, it took until 10 mins before closing for her to bring us water and to take our order only to tell us that they are out of almost all the items we ordered. We ordered the Sunday brunch to share which came with several items in which one was not available and we were asked if we wanted to substitute extra of something else so I said PANCAKES so my toddler could eat them and she agreed.We watched the lady who came after us who ordered the same thing, eat, pay and leave and we were still there will water. Now the doors are locked and we still are without food and or clueless server kept coming by saying ""How's everything"" and I would have to response by saying ""We have nothing but water, do you have a eta on the food"" she would act shocked like I haven't told her this 20 times and she goes to the kitchen and come back empty handed over and over. Finally we got our ginger lemonade that we ordered over a hour ago. It was yummy and the best part of the visit and best item. I ended up adding bbq cauliflower since we were starved and it as on the app menu. It came out and we started to it while still waiting. Now the other two parties were paying and leaving and we were still there waiting. The server brought out the platter less the pancakes. I reminded her that it came with pancakes and we ordered  extra due to them being out of an item. She said ooh Yes it's coming, the place is so small you can listen in to the convos in the kitchen and our clueless waitress gave the last order of pancakes to the people who checked out and asked for pancakes to go. The kitchen said they cleaned the stove and had no more batter. She comes over looking stupid and me having heard already waited to see what she would say and she said ""We are out of pancakes"". Mind you we order d a hour ago (it is not 1 hour post closing and we still  waiting), I responded ""you gave them away and I knew that would happen because you aren't paying attention"". I begin to pack up to leave as my toddler was starving and crying and to tell him he won't eat now was a bit much. The kitchen person plead with me to stay and she would make him some pancakes so I never replied I just kept packing up and whalla pancakes came in a to go container. A different server came and said ""we are giving you 20% off this is not our typical level of service"". I smiled and paid and LEFT. Never EVER again will I go here."
6/15/2018,1 star rating,"I am not rating food - I am rating customer service. I phoned to place an order for pick up. I was placed on hold before my order was taken - not a problem. The problem is that it took 15 min before she came back to the phone. I held the line on purpose in order to express that this was unacceptable. After 15 min I no longer had time to wait , then pick up an order ( lunch break) - so I could not order. She responded ""I'm sorry for your inconvenience"".  I understand that things can become busy but please get back to the phone so customers know they are not forgotten. Service is extremely important, appreciated and required."
9/4/2020,5 star rating,"I love this place. I've ordered from them a couple times and it's been delicious each time. My faves (so far) are the gyros and the BBQ cauliflower. If they expand their menu, they'll be well on their way to becoming the South Side's answer to the Chicago Diner! I'd love to dine in someday, when safe to do so."

9/26/2019,5 star rating,"In the nearby neighborhood for work, I stopped here for lunch. I ordered the jerk tofu wrap, and it was absolutely delicious. I actually had to do a double take when I took my first bite because it was so close to tasting like actual meat-I can't believe it's vegetarian!! How do they do it....whatever the magic is, I'm totally here for it and I would come back here 100% next time I'm in the area. Amazing fresh food + supporting local business/farms is fabulous!! I cannot wait to return and try more of their menu options"
8/8/2020,4 star rating,"It's a very good vegan restaurant. The food is always good and  the workers are friendly. It is a popular spot so sometimes the wait can be a little long, but 9/10 you're in and out! My fave items are the fried oyster mushrooms and the fried grits!"
5/12/2018,5 star rating,"We tried the BBQ cauliflower, fried okra, mushroom lentil burger (which came with sweet potato chunks) and the gyro. We ordered the carrot cake cupcake and vanilla frosted chocolate cupcake to go. This place is so cute inside. Our server was so sweet and friendly. My favorite food- which can be a meal by itself- the BBQ cauliflower appetizer! Wow! Sooooo good! Definitely a must try item. I will be back just for that.... and the cupcakes! I love carrot cake and this one was delicious!"

12/1/2019,5 star rating,"Moved nearby and wanted to try this place out since I'm a vegetarian.  Let me just say wow!! The food was delicious and so perfectly flavored! The employees were super nice also. Tried the sloppy joe, falafel fritters, and  jerk tofu sandwich. The sloppy joe with lentils was amazing and the tofu was some of the best I've had.  The fritters were so good can't wait to try the black eyed pea ones next time.  Those sweet potatoes though!  Will definitely being going back!"
3/7/2018,5 star rating,A top of the line vegan experience for a reasonable price.  Highly recommended.  I cannot say enough good things about this fabulous Black Owned vegan restaurant on the southside of CHicgo.
12/3/2017,3 star rating,"Food was great; however, service did NOT match up to the food! The ambiance was warm, soulful and inviting. I loved the decor. Will I go back, I will; however without the expectation of good service, unfortunately.

2/20/2018,5 star rating,"Oh my! Where do I begin..it was a gorgeous Saturday late afternoon and #veganmeandlenab decided to check out Majani. We pulled up and saw this super cute corner restaurant. So close to the lake, steps from the South Shore Cultural Center and right on the Metra tracks which I think makes it even more fun. When we went in there were several 2 and 4 tops but none available. The communal table was open so we sat there. We would have stayed but the setting sun was coming in  full force so although it was nice and warm it got a little hot. So we moved after we were served our lemon water. The menu is on the chalk boards and everything is vegan. It seems the menu changes and they have specials so I think there will always be something new to try. We finally chose the lasagna dinner that comes with roasted veggies, green beans, salad and garlic bread- all for $16! And also the seitan barbecue roast sandwich with carmelized onions and a side of chunky sweet potatoe slices.-$9 We also ordered the greens and cornbread. $6.50 Well this is one of those times when Lena and I just look at each other and say ""Oh my God!"" Sorry God but I know you would appreciate that we think of you when we find food this amazing that does harm the beautiful animals of your planet! From bite one we were just amazed and satisfied. We kept battling over the sandwich and lasagna. We thought when we ordered that we would need ""to go"" containers but sorry, none of that was happening! We even had room at the end to share a massive slice of homemade double layer carrot cake, $8, and when we took a bite of that the fork battle was on for the creamy frosting and nuts and cake. Our waiter was new and very attentive. It was so nice to meet Michael the brother of the owner. He pointed out all of the detail in the design of the Cafe. It has a really cool rustic, modern, ethnic look. P.S. Love the bathroom! I saw the owners and hope to meet them another time but they seemed busy. Can't wait to go back again!

1/4/2019,4 star rating,"First time coming to this restaurant was last week. Very nice spot in the South Shore area and I love the fact that it is black owned. It is a little bit of a small spot but when I came it wasn't crowded at all. If it was crowded I can see how cramped it might be. The music that was being played was awesome. I love the open kitchen feel. You can see the cooks whipping up some tasty food in the back. The waitress was nice. She did seem a little hesitant with giving recommendations but luckily for me I already did my research and knew what I wanted to try.The food was good with some not so great dishes. First things first, when I go to eat at a new restaurant, I love trying multiple things to get a feel of the food and boy did my friend and I get a lot of food. We tried the BBQ cauliflower which is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce (I love ranch...don't judge me) but that sauce was delicious. We also got the fried grits with tomato sauce. That sauce I could bathe in. I really wanted to lick the plate but was afraid to because I would come off as weird lol. Then we got the fried oyster mushrooms. Those were a big hit too. I paired it with a garlic sauce and the BBQ sauce. For our meals (I know we are greedy) we got the Gyro and I got the greens with cornbread. My friend wasn't a big fan of the Gyro and I believe it was the texture of the ""meat"" that threw her off but I didn't think it was terrible. I feel like if they add the BBQ sauce with the tzatziki sauce then it would be delicious. The greens...oh boy the salt level was on a thousand. I couldn't even eat the rest of it for fear of getting high blood pressure and the ""cornbread"" which I feel is more of a hot water ""cornbread"" type was so bland. I'm not the mix my greens and cornbread together type of girl but I had to try doing this to see if it would help but it really didn't. The greens definitely was the one star item out of everything we ordered.All in all, this was a good restaurant. I would definitely go back for the cauliflower and fried grits. Those were absolutely amazing!"
12/19/2018,5 star rating,I had the BBQ Roast and my boyfriend had the gyro. Both were good but the bbq roast sandwich was amazing. It tasted just like meat. Service was very friendly and timely. Random but the water was good too compared to what I've had here so far. We're in town from Louisiana and I will definitely be back before we go home.
12/12/2018,5 star rating,"Loved the atmosphere and the food. Easily a south side gem!!! I had the gyro, the fried grits, and BBQ cauliflower! All good! As I venture down the road to enjoy healthier foods, it's nice to know that I'm also able to support a community I grew up in."

My mom specifically requested no salt for her and my grandma's meals. The cashier even repeated our order back to us & my mom replied ""no salt right?"" The cashier replied right. Well sure enough there was salt on the stir fry and their other dinners. Was sad that they couldn't finish their meals"

Preparation and presentation are key and Majani's nailed both.

Amazing food, atmosphere, and service.....we can't wait to go back!"

Ordered 2# sides of cabbage & jerk tofu both were tasty however tofu was charged as an entree. I kindly expressed my dislike for the crabcakes  & she ask me did I want her to remove the dish. Please do, was never asked may I offer u anything else? After receiving my bill with the cost of the crabcakes too.  The waitress said there wasnt a chef there to make the decision to remove the item off the bill. Never, never again!"

7/10/2017,4 star rating,"I went there Sunday and had the Brunch Special. The pancakes and grits were amazing as were the lentil cakes. In an area surrounded by garbage food joints this place is a welcome paradise. I'm on my way to becoming a full fledged vegan mostly for health reasons and I typically head to north side for good vegan food. Now I can walk less than two blocks. Last point, the peach cobbler was simply off the chain with real fresh peaches. I will be a returning customer as I love supporting local businesses."
6/23/2018,4 star rating,"I ordered the burger. It was well-sized. It crumbled a bit, but I managed.The bun was a bit ""bready"" looking at first glance. It reminded me of a Kaiser bun. But the taste was of a freshly baked bun. It was light and quite tasty once you started eating. The burger fixings were paired well and overall this was a pleasant, not overly greasy entree.The accompanying sweet potato cubes/hash browns were EXQUISITE. They were perfectly prepared. They have mastered the art of cooking these. I will happily return to this restaurant. This is a ""quality"" place that deserves to be tried by healthy food connoisseurs."
6/25/2017,5 star rating,"I came here for the first time for the Sunday Brunch. The food is fantastic, the service is amazing. We had scrambled tofu, lentil sausage with tomato gravy atop cheesy grits, roasted potatoes, sauteed broccoli and delicious pancakes. I'll definitely return for this gem of a spot in South Shore."
7/22/2018,5 star rating,"The best vegan restaurant in Chicago, and probably the entire Midwest. Everything is always perfectly seasoned, fresh, and made with love. Even the service is great. Even better, it's all made ethically, with love for the South Side, people, the planet, and animals.The brunch is unbeatable. The lentil sausage is THE BEST I've ever had. The buckwheat pancakes are fluffy and soft. The collards are better than my grandmother's (and that's saying something). Majani is a must for anyone visiting Chicago, vegan or not, and for Chicagoans, too."
9/20/2019,5 star rating,First time here and I will be back every single time I am in Chicago. The sweet potato cookie was  so amazing and the lean green juice was amazing. I don't even know what to say besides amazing !!
1/6/2018,4 star rating,"Food is delicious and they obviously use fresh ingredients unlike 'Soul Vegetarian'. BUT they are a bit over priced with some of their dinners.  As an example, was quite hungry so went in for a dinner for takeout.  The dinner for that day was 'greens, plantains, rice, beans, corn bread.'  Food was good but this wasn't worth $16 + tax so almost $20.Unlike at Soul Vegetarian which each day there is something they actually hand made on the plate verses just steaming and frying some plantains.So, Soul Vegetarian you'll get some of the dinner options from a can, a hand made item and about $1-$3 less than Majani.  Majani you'll get fresh ingredients, some days no handmade item just steamed/fried veggies and they're about $1-$3 higher.  The dinner in question should have been about $10 at most.Good food though."
6/24/2017,5 star rating,"So so good! A friend told me about this place recently, so I decided to walk over for lunch since I live in the neighborhood. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and the staff was very friendly. Service was quick too! Food = AMAZING. I had the crab cake sandwich and sweet potatoes. Everything was super flavorful and a great portion. The sorrel is fantastic, too! I've been a vegan for a while now, and it's so nice to have a place within walking distance to grab a bite to eat when I don't feel like cooking or to take friends and family. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu and tell more people about this spot! They've definitely gained a regular customer!"
9/1/2019,4 star rating,"Excellent vegan food. The barbecue cauliflower is to die for. Greens good and not bitter but could be more highly seasoned. I also prefer softer cornbread. I shared these with a friend. We also ordered the mushroom and lentil wrap but portions so big that we each took home our half. Had it later. Very tasty. Too bad no Diet Coke, but I guess it's not healthy enough to be available. Staff friendly and helpful. Restroom clean."

7/31/2017,4 star rating,This was a nice little spot. I went into the city with my mother and decided to stop here after seeing them in FB. I really liked the barbecue cauliflower. It is definitely my favorite. The Mac n cheese was good n my 11 yr daughter n 2yr son really enjoyed it. My mother enjoyed the greens and sweet potatoes. I tasted them n it was good. None of us liked the cornbread. The infused water with lemon was definitely refreshing. If I'm in the city again I would come back to this place. Can't wait till there r more places like this in the far SW suburbs.

10/10/2017,4 star rating,"What a wonderful Vegan restaurant located on the south side of Chicago. There are so many great things to eat on the menu, but one has quickly become my favorite the fried grits are amazing along with the sweet potato fries. The jerk tacos are also tops on my list of favorites. The great thing about this place is you don't have too be vegan to enjoy the food the Chef's are making and trying to cover some of everything that makes your mouth water when your out to eat at any 4 or 5 star restaurant in Chicago. Some of the dinner foods are a little pricey but well worth it. I would recommend this restaurant for business lunch and dinner with family and friend's."

12/2/2017,3 star rating,"I am sure Majani has great food. Unfortunately There were some minor issues and I couldn't experience it the way I had hoped. I will say that their ambiance is incredible and much needed in the South Shore area.  But after looking online, I called to place an order to find out a certain item I wanted was seasonal- after changing my order to something else - I arrived only to find out they didn't have the second item I ordered.  Since I was in an Uber and had ordered 25 mins prior - I couldn't wait any longer and was disappointed because there aren't very many healthy let alone vegan options in the area :(UPDATE:  So I went back to give it another shot.  And unfortunately am not able to change my rating.   There are some incredible food items but then there are so items that are so sub par that it ruins the experience. I was happy that they serve sorrel (drink) which you can't find everywhere.  So here we go - the butternut squash soup is the absolute best in the city and has a kick to it ; the chocolate cupcake was dry- but the lemon cupcake was incredible with the most amazing flavor. I had brunch .. there wasn't any variety in the brunch menu and they basically used the same ingredients for each of the 3-4 brunch menu items so they should serve some items on the main menu until there is more variety. I had a pancake breakfast sandwich. The best thing about the brunch was the tofu scramble.  It was the most flavorful vegan eggs I have ever had and I wanted more!  Unfortunately the breakfast sausage was unbearable. It tasted like packed grits or cornbread flavored to be sausage. I'd rather they use seitan, tofu or no Meat at all.  The pancakes were mediocre and had no flavor. They could make a variety of colorful potato pancakes that would've been a hit. It's a fairly new eatery. Once they master the menu, add variety, and have consistency with food texture and taste - I see potential."

7/8/2017,5 star rating,"I came to Majani with a large group of friends, and had no idea until halfway through the meal that it was a vegan restaurant. We started out with a few appetizers, one of them being the fried grits that looked similar to mozzarella sticks but OH MY GOD were they delicious! The breaded grits were perfectly crispy on the outside and rich and full of flavor on the inside, and a chunky tomato sauce that was so fresh and bright that I am still dreaming about it. I had the eggplant ""Parmesan"" dinner, and eggplant was so perfectly breaded and flavorful that I was convinced I was eating real cheese! I ended my meal with the peach cobbler that was more like a cross between a peach cobbler and cinnamon crumble full of peaches, perfect sauce and a crumble top that was heaven! Not only was the food amazing, but the staff and service was stellar as well. They were welcoming and knowledgeable and made me feel like a part of the Majani family. This is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants and I highly recommend it!"
5/28/2019,3 star rating,Normally my experience is great and food amazing. The last 3 times I ordered from this restaurant my food was not that good. The burgers were extremely dry and they failed to include my extra bbq sauce so I didn't enjoy.

5/17/2019,4 star rating,"Great food as usual.  However was in the restaurant today and was disappointed not by the food or service, but the bathroom.  Toilet was stuffed with tissue and smelled of urine.  Apparently the toilet hasn't flushed for days.  The server says their solution to that was an ""out of order"" sign someone forgot to place on bathroom door.  Unacceptable. After a delicious meal, really hadn't expected that.  I hope this is addressed. Just call a handyman."
12/1/2018,5 star rating,"Great food, they play some awesome music.  Love the ginger lemonade ( has some bite to it but sweet) and BBQ cauliflower.  The jerk wrap was amazing.  Try the vegan desserts too.  One of my favorite south side spots!"
10/24/2020,1 star rating,"I love the food here, but my experience yesterday left a bad taste in my mouth. I called to place a phone order at about 730 (30 minutes before they closed). The young lady who answered the phone was extremely nice and personable; I didn't expect to have my order taken, but she happily obliged and assured me if I arrived a few minutes after 8, I could still pickup my order. Warning sign number 1 should've been that they didn't ask for payment over the phone, but nevertheless my order was taken. When I arrived 10 minutes after 8 the doors were locked (no surprise) so I called to notify them of my arrival for order pickup and the young woman who answered stated that my food was prepared, but the registers were closed down for the evening and that there was no way to accept payment. I said thank you and quickly hung up. Why would you take my order that late if you couldn't hold off on closing down your resister just a few minutes? Why wouldnt you notify the customer that the register is closing at x time and that order pickup must occur prior to the register being shutdown? Why didn't someone ask to take my payment information over the phone so I could just pickup my order and leave you all to head home? There are so many things that could've been done to prevent the staff from wasting resources making food and to prevent me making a wasted trip, but none of those measures were taken. I'll be back, as this is minor, but this could've been handled way better."

6/15/2018,1 star rating,"I am not rating food - I am rating customer service. I phoned to place an order for pick up. I was placed on hold before my order was taken - not a problem. The problem is that it took 15 min before she came back to the phone. I held the line on purpose in order to express that this was unacceptable. After 15 min I no longer had time to wait , then pick up an order ( lunch break) - so I could not order. She responded ""I'm sorry for your inconvenience"".  I understand that things can become busy but please get back to the phone so customers know they are not forgotten. Service is extremely important, appreciated and required."
6/15/2018,4 star rating,"Visited Majani for brunch on a perfect spring day a couple of weeks ago. The food was great - I had the breakfast tacos and my husband had the breakfast burrito. The food options are somewhat limited, but I think that's to be expected in such a small place making everything from scratch. Had a lovely time and will return if I'm in the area again."
6/14/2018,1 star rating,"Overrated. It's awesome to have a vegetarian spot in the hood but other than that...that's it. I've had the BBQ cauliflower, crab cake burger & greens w/ hot water cornbread. Cauliflower is good when it's hot & Fresh, greens are ok..crab cake burger & cornbread were unbearable. Also, even though there's no sign letting you know the rules, apparently you're not allowed to record them preparing your food or let alone anyone working in the establishment so forget sharing your entire experience with your family & friends. How do I know? The cashier politely let me know, but in addition to that the manager 5-10mins later took it upon himself to come 'check me' even though it was already understood with the cashier that I couldn't record, I thanked him. His (the managers) attitude was less than welcoming & he didn't seem to care whether I enjoyed my food or not but that didn't matter because I was ready to go & not come back anyway, :-) thanks for the experience!

We ordered an array of different things off of the menu I still remember how delicious the hummus was which even though it's very basic a lot of people mess it up! We also got the sampler platter with all of the different dips. Everything that we ordered was delicious and everyone in my party was very pleased, the service was also very good. They were very patient with us and catered to all of our needs which can be a difficult thing when there is such a big party like we had. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

5/26/2018,1 star rating,"This review is not pertaining to the food, my last few visits were actually pretty decent. This is regarding the level of customer service from what I believe was the or one of the owners. I visited a few moments ago and ordered the taco salad for myself and two desserts for my son and I ($22). We waited at an empty table for 17 minutes while the food was being prepared. After about 15 minutes a family of three came in, the owner approached myself and my son and said ""are you waiting for an order because they would like to sit down""...................this shocked me. While I understand that they were potential paying customers we had paid for our order as well. The appropriate thing for him to do would've been to check and see how long before my order was ready and brought it over to me. That way everyone is satisfied and you wouldn't have lost a repeat customer.....this level of service from an owner is unfathomable, that alone is the reason I will not be returning. After reading through some of the other reviews it seems to me that this attitude is commonplace from the owner........FYI great customer service (or in this case the lack of) trumps a decent dish any day. Do better PLEASE!"
5/21/2018,5 star rating,"Vegan soul food?! Locally sourced from community gardens, quick, friendly service, atmosphere that's cool yet cozy?! Delicious, affordable, and trueee. Majani is a new little gem of South Shore and their cauliflower wings are the best I've ever had. Make sure to stop by... but maybe for takeout... the size of a coffeeshop. My boyfriend and I split the chef's special for $16 and were not disappointed. Or hungry!"
5/20/2018,5 star rating,"I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm not vegan. I was there to support my mom who is 100% vegan lol. Anywhoo, I ordered the fried grits for appetizer, and crab cake sandwich as my entree. OMG so good! Our waiter told me they had a garlic sauce that I could drizzle on top of the fried grits and that took it over the top!! Our waiter was very attentive btw. (Sorry I forgot his name)The seating area is small, but nice. There are several areas available for large parties. Our food came out quickly as well. Napkins were plentiful as my 18 month old kept knocking things over lolAs a meat eater I 100% endorse this restaurant. I hope they prosper a long time in South Shore!"
7/3/2018,4 star rating,Let me just say ... OMG THE FRIED GRITS. Mmmm yummy. The marinara sauce is perfect. The oyster mushroom tacos and crab cakes are my top favs. I LOVE the Mac&Cheese. The space is small so ideal for take out or small groups. Oh... the gyro is good too. I do recommend this place and I'll keep coming back.
5/6/2018,4 star rating,"This place is exceptionally good! They make the food talk. I normally don't eat grits but one bite of their fried grits reoriented my life. The black eye pea burger was exquisite and the sweet potatoe tater tots were to write home about! Everyone including non-Vegans would enjoy this spot! I looked up Majani in Webster's it means ""Oh my goodness this is so good I can not believe it!!!!!!"

9/12/2019,4 star rating,"I've been here twice. 1st I had the BBQ calliflower, it is great. I also had the gyro sandwich and  was not impressed by the gyro..the seitan was like dry bread, and completely flavorless. My son got a piece of the lemon cake and I was blown away by how good it was. The waitress was polite and helpful, but the worse thing about the whole experience was the water..it taste like a plastic bucket..I was afraid for my kids to drink it.. the second visit was better. I got tofu tacos, they were good, but they should marinate their tofu so there is flavor throughout them, cause the sauce saved them. It was not the worst tofu I've ever had, but definitely the worst at a vegan resturant. And this time the water taste like chlorine so, we didn't drink that either but, the sorrel was good and the waitress was very nice and helpful. I'd like to come back to try some more things, cause I'm sure there are some other great choices."
11/4/2018,1 star rating,"My 1st time ever writing a negative review! ""majani's vegan restaurant"" the waitress was kind & knowledgable of the menu & beverages. Ordered 2# sides of cabbage & jerk tofu both were tasty however tofu was charged as an entree. I kindly expressed my dislike for the crabcakes  & she ask me did I want her to remove the dish. Please do, was never asked may I offer u anything else? After receiving my bill with the cost of the crabcakes too.  The waitress said there wasnt a chef there to make the decision to remove the item off the bill. Never, never again!"

4/17/2018,5 star rating,"The hour drive is worth it from west suburbs definitely! When I first  tasted their food my exact thoughts were "" what greatness is in the food"". I couldn't resist their different vegan items dishes and desserts it is highly delicious including the drinks too. Also the produce is local and fresh as well (big A+). I'm overjoyed to find Majani, the South Shore community is lucky to have Majani's near them.  My first time visted here I was impressed with the articulture work that the owners put together. I recognize beautiful art when I see it. The art designs speaks volume it spoken peaceful words,  positive vibes and I felt relaxed. I didn't want to leave even the working women in the kitchen brought memories of my grandma, mom and aunts used to cooked together but not anymore. I was glad to see that. The customer services was excellent yes even on a busy night, very worth it. I appreciated having my food cooked fresh and I know its  vegan. I ordered the gyro(perfect flavoring), sweet potatoes and dessert and had a sorrel drink it was GREAT,. I then understood why the greatness was in the food cause Majani heart is in the right place. I will be returning soon."

As people are becoming more conscious of food's impact on their health, he liked that the food being plant based was easily digested and tasted very good. Me being a particular vegan lol I loved that unlike almost all the vegan restaurants in Chicago, this place offered gluten free and soy free options. Its new and the food was very good and very affordable for a vegan or non vegan restaurant for the type of food they sell. I posted it on snapchat and many of my friends plan to try it out!!!!"

8/23/2018,5 star rating,"My first time trying vegan food was at Majani's in South Shore.  I had the greens and I hate to say this but they were better than my grandmothers'.  I highly recommend, especially if you're a vegan on the south side."
9/22/2018,5 star rating,"Majani is a small, cozy and casual vegan restaurant located in south shore. Our family recently went to Majani to treat my daughter for her 18th birthday. Our waitress Mariah was very nice. She gave us a great description of the foods that are offered and the presentation was simple yet sent with statement. We tried the fried black eye peas dipped in bbq sauce, the gyro, the lentil and black-eye pea burger with sweet potato fries, their natural juices and everything was delicious.  If you are looking for a Vegan restaurant, I would highly recommend that you go on a weekday when it's less crowded to get the most of your experience. Personally, I can't wait to visit again and try out their desserts."
11/9/2019,1 star rating,"I was at Manija today and by far it was the worst experience I've ever encountered here in my couple times I've eaten here. I'm not sure if it was due to a all female staff but the service was absolutely horrendous. I hear many say brown people support everyone else except brown owned businesses, with service this bad it's hard to do that. No professionalism what so ever, we waited 20 minutes and no one took our order I had to get up and go to the counter behind people who was being serviced that came in after us. Finally our order was taken 10 minutes after our order was finally taken salad and appetizer was served. Then 30 minutes went by just when I was about to ask what's going on I'm guess what was the manager came over with a tone and demeanor that was not pleasant as she asked what can I help y'all with? Huh? Excuse me we ordered almost 40 minutes ago now! Then she says oh I'm sorry  were out of lunch special.... What your kidding right? Would you like to order something else? Frustrated now then yeah okay, mind you at this point we're both doing a slow burn inside, looking over the menu for the second time the waitress then walks up with the a very small portion of the lunch special which was heated so hot it burned my tongue yet the tofu was cool. Finally 55 minutes later I received my cornbread disgusting and cold to the taste but as always the barbecue cauliflower was on point. Yet that wasn't the end the wait is on again as we waited for the bill and a togo container. No disrespectful words was said nor was attitude given by us to anyone there, a tip was left tho I really doubt they deserved one but it's the right thing to do. When I hear ones say that brown people don't support our own I'm going to now wonder and consider if it's because of the lack of professionalism that goes into most brown own businesses, as well as respect for brown women to women especially. Some women don't know how to take a step back and say I'm going to do whatever it takes to strive to make everyone comfortable no matter the color. If this offends someone my apologies because that's not my intention, yet I want to bring awareness to black owners PLEASE take the time to pay your employees to be trained on how you want your business to be respected and ran professionally protecting your investment."
9/8/2018,3 star rating,"Stopped in with my dad for his birthday today and it was a pretty good experience. We had the bbq cauliflower for an appetizer which was hands down delicious. I then asked the waitress what she suggested we try as this was our first time and we're not vegan. While she was very nice, she had no suggestions for us because she didn't ""know what are taste are like"". She could've let us know what the popular choice may be or even what dish was her favorite. That put me off slightly but I went ahead and asked if they had any mac and cheese or candied sweet potatoes to which she said that was the lunch special but she'd check to see if there was any mac and cheese left. She came back with mac and cheese for us but I was slightly shocked again as I wanted it with my meal. We taste it and it's not too bad but I certainly would rather have it with some greens, corn bread or something. We waited shortly for our dinner special to arrive which was potatoes au gratin, collard greens, fried corn and ""pot roast/roast beef"". The food was seasoned well but it was definitely different for someone like me who isn't vegan. I kept an open mind and pressed on. The owner/male came out and greeted us and suggested I try the strawberry cake for dessert. Now that cake was a hit!!!! Heaven on a fork!! I bought an additional slice to go as well as the lemon and chocolate cake which were delicious as well. On a side note, I had the ginger lemonade and I'm not sure why they don't serve beverages with ice unless asked however the lemonade was good but it is spicy. Nice ambience and I'll come back to at least try the black eye pea burger and get more cake!!"
12/18/2017,1 star rating,I also received a message from the server for this review. Completely unprofessional to write an entire soliloquy explaining yourself instead of just apologizing and moving on. I'm an assistant vice president of a major company in Chicago and I'd be very upset if my employees responded that way to a complaint. This is a sad trend amongst certain types of retail businesses where the customer service has a condescending undertone. Like if I knew anything about restaurant service I'd understand why he was unable to properly serve me and my husband while properly servicing the table next to us. All his message did is make me further disgusted by this restaurant.

Beautiful young woman was the ONLY good thing about this experience... too bad she wasn't our server. So we just watched her be amazing with everyone else :(. Our server was picky with who the decided to give stellar service too. A white trio came in after us and my husband and I were actually SHOCKED at his level of care for them. He politely introduced himself, went over specials, what sides come with the meal, and even asked if they preferred their water with ice or no ice. Meanwhile back our table he came over with glasses of water (with ice) and his first words were ""would you like an appetizer?)The food was left damn near untouched... the only thing good was the sorrell (a little too sweet) and the bbq cauliflower. When i asked him about the burgers he was comparing them to meat burgers... I'm a vegan..sooooooooo...  I had the jerk tofu tacos.. the corn tortilla was ridiculous and uncooked. U have to COOK corn tortillas. Even if it's a little. The tofu was tasty but it was way too much and eneded8up making me feel queasy. My husband had the lentil mushroom burger and it tasted like a bland cornbread sandwich. Ugh. He never came back to check on us, I had to ask the other server D for more water and napkin while our server gave amazing attention to his white patrons. I don't usually make an emphasis on race but it was so obvious and crazy. He ignored all his other guests. Smh the food was bad and the server sucked... won't be back."
11/9/2017,5 star rating,Wonderful hosts and deliciously healthy fare--along with a beautifully diverse community who frequent this southside vegan oasis.

After eating here, I'm thinking I may need to give it a shot! Everything I tried was delicious. The BBQ cauliflower was amazing and the crab cake sandwich (it was really tofu) had me licking my chops (no pun intended). Oh, my dad tried the lunch special that came with mac n cheese. I dipped my fork in to try and had to do a double take. Why? Because it tasted like it was soul food...the kind of mac n cheese your grandma might mac except there was no cheese!! BOMB AF. Great customer service and I love that it's black owned. I will def be returning to try more on the menu!!"
6/22/2018,3 star rating,This restaurant is now my least favorite restaurant and I am a vegan. I ordered to go at first and wanted to have my meal plated once I arrived and they acted as if they couldn't do that at all. The customer is always right regardless of what the standards are. There was a gentleman whom is a waiter that works there that managed to actually help with my issue and he was very mindful. I still don't appreciate the fact that it was an issue to have my to go order as a dine in. There was NOTHING BUT ROOM. I will never dine in again and for future reference I will get my orders to go.

7/26/2018,5 star rating,"This relatively new (just over a year old) restaurant is a gem in the South Shore neighborhood. The Chefs and wait staff are personable and accommodating. It's great if dining alone or in a large group. I celebrated my 30 year veggie-versary here this spring and Chef Tsadakeeyah graciously accommodates my large group. I've visited for Sunday brunch as well as lunch and dinner on other days. The food is delicious. They offer raw as well as cooked foods, including desserts, all vegan. I love the atmosphere there - patrons are kind and friendly as well as the staff. Very nice decor. This is one of my favorite restaurants. Street parking is usually easy to find within the block. For commuters it's right at a South Shore line train stop and about a block from the 71st and Yates bus stop."
10/26/2017,5 star rating,"SO GOOD. I love the bbq cauliflower and fried grits. The atmosphere is also really special. It's crowded and can be hard to get a table, but it's worth it. The desserts are more pricey at times, but worth it. Also, the soups are delicious. My husband loves their salad dressing. I highly recommend stopping by."
9/1/2017,4 star rating,"I love the location and vibe of this place! It is small, but the service is on point. The food is good, but could use more flavor with spices and things. I'll definitely be coming back to try more food because their menu changes daily according to the staff."
11/2/2017,4 star rating,Food is always delicious and delightful. It's always a great time to feel the energy of the place and all it's good vibes. Glad to see a wonderful addition to the south shore community
7/12/2017,5 star rating,"This is the food that has been missing from the Southside. The food was great. I had the tacos, BBQ cauliflower and the chocolate cake. They were all excellent. Can't wait to go again."
10/8/2017,4 star rating,"First time and I love this spot. I had the greens and the corn bread...it was very much on point. Followed up with the tofu tacos which were okay but maybe missing something(would still get it again). The cake was very good too, can't remember which one. The atmosphere was nice too, perfect for treating family or that special person in your life. Only thing is the space is Kinda small. Food is good,I will be back"
12/19/2018,5 star rating,I had the BBQ Roast and my boyfriend had the gyro. Both were good but the bbq roast sandwich was amazing. It tasted just like meat. Service was very friendly and timely. Random but the water was good too compared to what I've had here so far. We're in town from Louisiana and I will definitely be back before we go home.
11/25/2018,2 star rating,"We ordered take out for my grandma's 98th birthday since she's a vegetarian. The food was really good! Customer service seemed excellent until we returned home. My mom specifically requested no salt for her and my grandma's meals. The cashier even repeated our order back to us & my mom replied ""no salt right?"" The cashier replied right. Well sure enough there was salt on the stir fry and their other dinners. Was sad that they couldn't finish their meals"
5/21/2018,5 star rating,"Vegan soul food?! Locally sourced from community gardens, quick, friendly service, atmosphere that's cool yet cozy?! Delicious, affordable, and trueee. Majani is a new little gem of South Shore and their cauliflower wings are the best I've ever had. Make sure to stop by... but maybe for takeout... the size of a coffeeshop. My boyfriend and I split the chef's special for $16 and were not disappointed. Or hungry!"
11/17/2017,5 star rating,"I visited this place after being disappointed at the other vegan spot on the south side. The one good thing about that visit was talking to a woman who told me about Majani. When I arrived it was a cute little corner spot that stood out. The waiter was super friendly and the decor was perfect for the mission! But the food.... THE FOOD WAS GREAT! Ok, honestly, I only had the fried grits because I literally left one restaurant and came here ( Don't judge) but it's been on my mind since I left. The sorel was really good too. The patrons were friendly and one man even came from across the restaurant to get the door for me and my car seat! The chef came out to ask how we enjoyed the food and I love the fact they they are supporting local farmers! I would certainly recommend and will certainly be returning"

4/28/2018,5 star rating,"My first visit definitely will not be my last...I enjoyed the fried grits, greens and cornbread ( which reminds me of my grandmother hot water cornbread cakes) , yams and okra...the space is a little small with great service ( thanks for the picks Daniel)  but does the trick for a great soul food fix. I will be returning for the bbq cauliflower and the taco salad (it caught my eye on someone's plate)."
4/21/2018,5 star rating,"This place is great! I'm not a vegetarian and would recommend this restaurant to anyone. We had the lentil mushroom burger, jerk tofu, cauliflower corn soup, Mac and cheese, and pumpkin seed pate/sweet potato wrap.  It was all delicious.  The jerk tofu had some kick to it.Next time I go, I'm going to get the bbq cauliflower and fried cheese grits. The people next to us had them and they looked great.Great addition to the South Shore."
5/13/2019,4 star rating,"I didn't have the full experience of what they had . It was Easter morning brunch  after church  I thought we'd get breakfast brunch ,but we got  what was being prepared that morning ...burritos  and something else ,not sure because I was looking for a breakfast well anyway I should have asked before we came... The bbq cauliflower was the only thing I enjoyed ...i ordered a second ...i hope to return when I can get a full menu of everything. The service was great."

3/18/2018,4 star rating,"BBQ cauliflower and okra was superb and great. I had the lunch special and desserts. Yes, it tends to be a bit pricey ad too much for smaller items then other vegan places and sometimes hours have been shacky, but it is clean, cooked well, the chef takes his time to make the food good, it is well seasoned, and carefully prepared with the garden not too far for the place providing the majority of vegetables and it is a clean and cozy place. I recommend going there, but chef and his wife love the culture of the place and reflects the neighborhoods commitment to more of the same what they provide for healthy eating."
3/4/2018,4 star rating,Black bean burger a d sweet potatoes fries were a hit! Customer service is friendly but  it super speedy wouldn't recommend going if you are starving
10/16/2018,3 star rating,"Nice spot, espec for something a little healthier than the standard greasy, nonnutritive fast food that dominate the area. So they have a niche. I had the well-regarded barbecue cauliflower with no regrets. Leftovers even did not disappoint. I also had the black-eyes pea burger. Good fiber punch but bland. Fried okra were tasty but unlike the barbecued cauliflower, did NOT pass the leftover test. These are best eaten on arrival. The ginger beer was standard fare and the carrot cake was fresh and obviously made with healthy ingredients, eg, pineapple juice. My only complaint is that both this place and the bakery/coffee shop across the street (which I will hit up soon) seem to disregard a business opportunity. So unfortunate because they literally and figuratively share a corner in a very depressed market area: Majani's doesn't sell coffee (CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?) at alland the aforementioned bakery isn't open weekend mornings. D'oh!Having coffee on the menu doesn't make a restaurant a coffee shop. That's a surprisingly simple response. Alinea, for example, is still a restaurant and coffee is on the menu. The owner's response is indicative of the kind of thinking that has and will maintain such an unsustainable business model for SS."

2/13/2019,5 star rating,"I was SO IMPRESSED and blown away with Majani Restaurant! This is, by far, the best vegan food I've had! The food was so very flavorful! The bbq cauliflower is superb and the gyro was so tasty! And, not only was the food excellent, but this was the best service I've had in a while. Mariah was so personable, and she gave thoughtful recommendations about the food selections. She was also very attentive to our needs. Overall, I highly recommend Majani Restaurant!"
4/13/2019,2 star rating,"Not rating for food, because it's THE BOMB, this is about the CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have been a customer of this restaurant from before it came to this area. I thought it was weird that the kitchen takes up more than the eating area. The amount of disorganization in this establishment is ridiculous. The waitress that we had took 10 minutes just to acknowledge us and then after she took our order, she forgot to bring us or drinks and we waited for the food for about 40min. Honestly would only order to go because you start to get irritated after a while. But the food will forever and always be GREAT. PERIODTT"
2/8/2018,5 star rating,Love love love the BBQ califlower and the gyro! I'm hungry just thinking about it! I just moved to the neighborhood a few months ago and I'm so glad this gem is practically around the corner! Yummy (nothing else to say) Yum yum Yummy!
5/5/2018,4 star rating,"A wonderful marvelous bonus to Majani? When you call in your order it's ready when they say it'll be ready! The savory  Freshness and flavor of nearby garden vegetables delights your taste buds! The Carrot cake melts in your mouth! When you request another slice it's already gone until the next Cake baking day! I'm claustrophobic so I can't sit so closely to others especially for eating. For those who can take sitting and eating elbow to elbow go for it as i thoroughly enjoy Majani's food as a take out! This way it's good for all, EH?"
10/11/2018,5 star rating,"I have only had their kale salad and bar b q cauliflower so far and Loved loved loved it!  Going back and plan to work my way through their menu. Heard many good things about this place. Service was prompt as they could be and friendly. The order took longer than I anticipated but I think I came at a very busy time,they are making the food fresh as the orders come in and they move fast in that kitchen."
9/2/2017,5 star rating,"The food is excellent. I ordered the lasagna, cauliflower, broccoli, greens, tacos. Everything I ate I really enjoyed. They are working out the kinks so be patient. Staff is super friendly. This quality restaurant needs to be supported."
12/8/2017,5 star rating,"AMAZING! I throughly enjoyed this restaurant and I am not a vegan by any means. I called on the phone because I was having trouble ordering exactly what I wanted from Uber Eats and they not only answered all of my questions seamlessly, but fixed the problem and made a food suggestion that I absolutely loved.  I had the BBQ cauliflower bite, sorrel and sweet potato. I wouldn't order next time due to the fact that I would like to further explore their menu, but I'll be back FOR SURE!"
3/4/2018,5 star rating,"I absolutely LOVE Majani! The barbecued Cauliflower is my favorite dish and I never leave without an order of greens and cornbread. The fried grits with black bean chili is another favorite! If you're a salad lover, I strongly recommend the beet dressing. If you haven't eaten at Majani, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Vegetarian or not, you won't be disappointed!"
2/28/2019,3 star rating,"I have visited this restaurant 4 times for take out. The first 3 times I ordered the Garden Salad with greens and corn bread and last time I ordered the large salad. The vegetables are very fresh, the greens and cornbread were very good. My problem is inconsistency with portion sizes and the time in which I wait for an order. Most days when I come there I give myself 40minutes and I work across the street. I have waited 40 to 45 minutes for a salad and greens. Perhaps, I should order in advanced? In addition, I have noticed that there are 2 different sized containers for salads(a longer thin container and smaller container usually for desert) I have gotten salad in both. When I ordered my large salad I expected it to come in a much larger container, but to my surprise it was in one of the same containers I had been receiving. I have sent several of my co-workers to the restaurant and they have noticed the same. I don't like to be surprised every time I place an order."
1/31/2018,5 star rating,Love this Vegan restaurant. There is always enough customers to somehow make you feel like home instead of a restaurant. The food is spectacular. If you have not tried the Carrot Cake OMG non other in Chicago like it. A Must Keep Coming Back Kinda Place.
2/9/2019,5 star rating,"Wow. I was so pleased. The smell when entering was great, the food was great, the server was fabulous and caring. We discussed the dishes that might be too spicy, for my digestion. She was very helpful and informative. . I am trying to change my diet. I have always, wanted to cut down on my meat intake. But, I realize, the only way I could be satisfied , was if the food was seasoned well. I hear there is another restaurant opening, further south. I most definitely will be there. But, in the meantime, I will visit this one. It was also get to meet, several nice and friendly customers. I feel so blessed to have found  this place. An absolutely marvelous experience. Thank you ."
12/29/2017,4 star rating,"I really enjoy eating the food here. It's very well-prepared, healthy and delicious. So what more could you want? Within the last year they have become quite popular and a bit over-crowded for the seating and waiting area. Plus it's a bit loud. I hope that their success continues and they expand their facilities."
1/23/2019,3 star rating,"The food is good and the dine-in device is great. The barbecue roast wrap and the fried cauliflower are my faves. Too bad they are drenched in the same barbecue sauce because there's really no need to purchase two items that are flavored the same. And speaking of the cauliflower, the portion has been reduced so it's no longer worth $9. I mean hey, it's still cauliflower."
1/11/2019,5 star rating,"This place is wonderful! The dishes are tasty, the service is friendly and helpful, and the vibe is pleasant and welcoming. Great place to enjoy some soul food, whether you're veg or not! And the baked good are to die for, especially the carrot cake. :D"
1/13/2018,4 star rating,"What a gem! I live for southside establishments; this place is seriously full of light and love.  We came here for lunch on a sunny, yet cold Chicago afternoon.  The best way to describe the layout is ""intimate"". There is one large communal table and several smaller tables throughout.  Bases on past reviews we thought it best to order the BBQ Cauliflower.  It did not disappoint.  While I am not vegan, I can certainly appreciate any thing tasty, and this was certainly tasty.  I had the lentil soup, which was perfect.  My husband had special, mushroom tacos and he was over the moon with his choice. For dessert my kids, who had eaten prior to our coming here (they had soccer and I wasn't sure if I wanted to experiment with them on this day) had the lemon cupcake which they enjoyed so much they started licking the wrapper. My husband had the German chocolate cupcake, which he couldn't believe was vegan. I'm sooooo happy we finally visited this place! I can't wait to come back!"
5/26/2018,1 star rating,"This review is not pertaining to the food, my last few visits were actually pretty decent. This is regarding the level of customer service from what I believe was the or one of the owners. I visited a few moments ago and ordered the taco salad for myself and two desserts for my son and I ($22). We waited at an empty table for 17 minutes while the food was being prepared. After about 15 minutes a family of three came in, the owner approached myself and my son and said ""are you waiting for an order because they would like to sit down""...................this shocked me. While I understand that they were potential paying customers we had paid for our order as well. The appropriate thing for him to do would've been to check and see how long before my order was ready and brought it over to me. That way everyone is satisfied and you wouldn't have lost a repeat customer.....this level of service from an owner is unfathomable, that alone is the reason I will not be returning. After reading through some of the other reviews it seems to me that this attitude is commonplace from the owner........FYI great customer service (or in this case the lack of) trumps a decent dish any day. Do better PLEASE!"
8/7/2018,5 star rating,"You must eat here!! This place was absolutely amazing.  Already have plans to go back!

6/14/2018,1 star rating,"Overrated. It's awesome to have a vegetarian spot in the hood but other than that...that's it. I've had the BBQ cauliflower, crab cake burger & greens w/ hot water cornbread. Cauliflower is good when it's hot & Fresh, greens are ok..crab cake burger & cornbread were unbearable. Also, even though there's no sign letting you know the rules, apparently you're not allowed to record them preparing your food or let alone anyone working in the establishment so forget sharing your entire experience with your family & friends. How do I know? The cashier politely let me know, but in addition to that the manager 5-10mins later took it upon himself to come 'check me' even though it was already understood with the cashier that I couldn't record, I thanked him. His (the managers) attitude was less than welcoming & he didn't seem to care whether I enjoyed my food or not but that didn't matter because I was ready to go & not come back anyway, :-) thanks for the experience! Side note, I usually don't do reviews like this but I felt impelled to share!"

We ordered an array of different things off of the menu I still remember how delicious the hummus was which even though it's very basic a lot of people mess it up! We also got the sampler platter with all of the different dips. Everything that we ordered was delicious and everyone in my party was very pleased, the service was also very good. They were very patient with us and catered to all of our needs which can be a difficult thing when there is such a big party like we had. I highly recommend this restaurant!"

9/23/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing food, amazing service! We had the tofu jerk wrap and the BBQ wrap. For starters, we had the fried okra and the collard greens. It was one night of indulgence with no regrets. Just go there. Oh, we also got a slice of carrot cake to go.... it was possibly the best carrot cake I have ever eaten...and I have eaten a lot of carrot cake in my time."
4/15/2018,3 star rating,This place is definitely a hidden gem on the south side of Chicago. Everyone is very friendly and the customer service is great. I have to say the last time I was there I wasn't too crazy about the jerk tofu and Mac n cheese but the carrot cake is delectable. Hopefully the next time I visit I can find something tastier on the menu the next time around.
4/20/2017,5 star rating,Sampled food today for a promotion.  It is awesome.  I know you will have a turn away crowd.  This place brings a delicious tasting pleasure back to your palete.

I wish I could come here every day."
7/8/2017,3 star rating,"The place was busy and the service was slow but they were friendly and welcoming. It was way too hot in the restaurant and it was only in the 70s outside. The food was good but nothing mind blowing. The fried grits were the highlight of the meal. The crab cake didn't taste like crab at all; maybe just call it a Cajun patty or something.  The BBQ roast was all BBQ sauce which isn't entirely bad but wish there was some more ingenuity to break up the BBQ sauce. The Po boy was too salty. My son loved the roasted sweet potatoes that came with the food and the juice they serve. I wanted to really like this place and I'm happy there are some healthier options in this area of town, but it was pretty standard veggie fare."
7/11/2018,5 star rating,"This place is a gem. I love everything they have and the people who work there and dine there are always so pleasant. I am in love with the ginger lemon aid. The bbq cauliflower is amazing tastes like fried chicken. The black bean burger and sweet potato fries are sooo good. After I eat here I always feel energized and happy. It's clean and even though it's small, it serves a diverse community of people. The icing on the cake is that the owner will walk around and greet people. How cool! My family recommends this place!"
1/27/2018,4 star rating,Was pleasantly surprised by not only the food but with the professionalism. Small and very clean with a nice ambiance.

The roasted sweet potatoes are some of the best I ever had.  The service was just as great!

11/8/2017,5 star rating,"Really good food. A little issue with ventilation so ac didn't seem to be working when it actually is on. I guess not a big problem for the next 7 months in Chicago.  I had the seitan tacos. Delish. Nice that they have gluten free options, too."

12/2/2017,5 star rating,"After reading the rave reviews and seeing the mouth-watering pics, my husband and I decided to give Majani a try. Yelpers, y'all were not lying. The food is delicious! So far, my favs are the fried vegetables and the Gyros. The gluten free sweet potato cookies were scrumptious too!! Although vegan, meat eaters you will not be disappointed. The icing on the cake, all the veggies are from local farmers. My family loves this place!"
3/11/2018,1 star rating,"I came here today for a to go brunch meal. As I waited for my order, I took a seat at the nearest table. After 5 minutes a server asked me to move because there were new patrons that just arrived and needed a table. I totally get that. The waiter was correct for asking me to move. So I stood in the only space left in this tiny restaurant...off in a corner somewhere so I'd be out of everyone's way. But apparently I was still in the way because she kept asking me again to move because I was standing in front of something else. So at this point am I suppose to stand on the roof? Small restaurant with zero space to even breath. Anyway, if you enjoy playing musical chairs, this is the perfect place for you. As for me, I prefer B'Gabs Goodies in Hyde Park. This would have NEVER happened there, as there is ample space for anyone and they also have spoken word. It's just an all around cool place to hang out. Plus the food is MUCH better at B'Gabs. What a difference in customer service you get from Hyde Park to the southside. Now I know why I never go south of Hyde Park. #FixIt"
3/10/2018,5 star rating,"Loved the room (calming, not too loud, and friendly), the service (attentive but never intrusive), and the food (all of it worth coming back for). Fried cauliflower was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside; curry chickpea soup had the perfect amount of curry; hot water cornbread was uncanny (I still don't understand how vegan baked goods can be edible, much less delicious); greens were toothy, tender, and mild. Even the water--with lemon--was lovely. We finished with a sweet potato cookie to go, which was also wonderful, and we will definitely be back."

I ordered the barbecue califlower and the jerk tacos. Both of the dishes were amazing! I am in the midst of starting to eat healthy so this restaurant is a Godsend for me. I love the fact that they have a dining area where you can eat in. The bathroom is beautiful. I'm going to copy their sink when I redo my own bathroom. Wow! They did am great job with the restaurant! I am planning my next visit for brunch on Sunday!"

6/16/2017,5 star rating,I like the menu style. It's great for people like myself who normally don't eat at vegetarian restaurants.
6/4/2017,5 star rating,"Such a great addition to the South Shore community.  Delicious vegetarian food.   I had the black-eyed pea burger and sweet potato fries.  Usually, I do not like sweet potato fries because other establishments serve the frozen ones.  Majani'a makes their fries from scratch and they are seasoned appropriately.  I actually ate their sweet potato fries and wanted more. If you are not a vegetarian, no worries, the food is so good that you will not miss the meat.  Fresh and high quality food for all dishes.  The place is suitable for dining in as well, however, there is a small sitting area.  I suspect that the place will find itself needing to expand the sitting area very soon.  Definitely a food destination."
8/19/2017,3 star rating,"I have heard nothing but good things about the food at Majani Restaurant but nothing prepared me for my so called dining experience.  First let me say that healthy eating options are a plus in the South Shore area, that coupled with the good reviews is what brought us here on a Saturday night. It is a very small space without air conditioning (which didn't help my disposition), my dissatisfaction occurred when once we were seated, our waitress proceeded to take another tables order (acquaintances of the owner). After such an excessive wait to be seated, I was irritated to say the least and I let it be known. The waitress was apologetic but insincere because this was not just an oversight (in my opinion) it was favoritism. We checked in at 7:20 and we still have not been served dinner at 8:53 this is more than excessive. This is not the kind of restaurant where you have a long , leisurely dinner. Did I mention we ordered from carry out to expedite our order because the server was overwhelmed. I have waited tables in my life, she needs help. The entire operation needs a lesson in efficiency. At 9:00 we left in disgust but mainly because the server asked us if we ""were ready to settle up"". We had not been served, perhaps she was confused because we had invited an elderly lady and her daughter to join us at our four top.  They received food (from carry out) , this speaks to inattentiveness. I will not be returning ....my time is too valuable."
