I immediately was sat at the bar (Friday night it was pretty packed). I started with a vodka cocktail, wings and a flatbread pizza. Everything was GREAT!!! Service was attentive and quick. Came back for a Sunday brunch...Let me tell you...they did not disappoint. Food drinks and service. Music the first time was a live pianist next time was a DJ. Both held their own for the vive of the night. Check them out if you haven't."

So The Park came up I looked at the menu and I debated. Drive to the place and it looked like they were closed but I saw people entering. I looked at the menu once more and decided to go inside. From the moment I walked in I was greeted with such an amazing staff and atmosphere. The hostess asked if I had reservations (I recommend to do so if you want table dining). I was more interested in dining at the bar. Well, there was live music very low and the mood was AMAZING...no one was over talking each other because the music was loud. I didn't know what to expect upon arrival but they gave me everything I needed this night and more. Let's get on the food. It was my first time and everything sounded delicious. I ordered the mushroom flatbread, smoked Buffalo wings (sauce on the side) and some fries (I'm don't usually order fries but those were amazing). Wings such Smokey  taste and well seasoned I am happy I had the sauce on the side because you only need a slight dip (so flavorful). The flatbread super buttery and flavorful and light (if you just want to snack) I recommend adding tomatoes (I will next time). Yes I'm already planning my trip back. Drinks I usually have a Tito's and tonic as I don't like sweets. I tried the raspberry lemon drop....not overly sweet and tasty. What else can I say...THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. I hope the don't get tired of seeing my face. Thank you all for your great service and a great experience from start to finish. Even though I went out alone. I met so many new faces and I thank you again for a great time."

That probably was strike 1 as typically this group goes to a restaurant/bar for the ambience. The conference room was nice but it wasn't giving you brunch vibes. On the plus side you could hear the music from the next room. If I lived in the area, maybe would book room for an event if they could come through on prompt service. Regular bar and restaurant area is nicely decorated.On to the service. Our server was so sweet. Unfortunately she was overwhelmed. Strike 2, this place did not have adequate staff to work our event, also an AKA brunch happening in the same room plus their restaurant brunch hour. She did her best...food took an incredibly long time to come out. Some people in our group still didnt have food after 90 minutes. Definitely not a good reflection on the restaurant or group that selected this restaurant. Service 2 StarsAnyway the Brunch 2 hour $25 drink special was good. I mostly stuck to Mimosa. They use my favorite value Prosecco. It took awhile but eventually we got a bottle put on the table since multiple people were drinking this unlimited deal. Food: we grabbed shrimp appetizers. Very good served warm and had delicious garlic bread attached. For brunch I got fish and chips. My sister-in-law got the catfish. Both our dishes were good and warm. My French fries could of been crisper. I enjoyed the fried cod. The cole slaw on the side was also tasty. They could reduce the amount of smoked paprika but it was a good addition to the spice profile. Food 4 stars. Overall not great. However didn't get 3 strikes... Unsure if I would come back because I don't live close. For the price of gas, I need a more consistent service and food. Park around building as attached parking lot is for residents only.Black owned restaurant in a predominantly black neighborhood so I really hope they get together. The fish was fried very good."

Live music creates an awesome mood for a date night, girls night, sneaky link meet up ( comfy seats in the cut) or happy hour. So glad that the south side has this new gem ."

The restaurant was very clean, the service was GREAT (from Kiersten and Maurice) and the food was AMAZING! The DJ kept the chill vibe going the entire time but it was live enough for other people to get a little two step in. I strongly recommend this place!!!! Make sure you have the bottomless mimosas and the gumbo :) This is definitely a hidden gem the world needs to know about."
3/28/2022,5 star rating,The staff and service and ambiance is a treasure !!!! especially in the community! My 2nd visit and they didn't disappoint!! We will be back.
4/17/2022,1 star rating,"The location and DJ were a positive vibe and enjoyable; however, Mary Ann (the owner) was not. She was very condescending and sarcastic for no reason. She stated since I didn't enjoy my skirt steak (cooked medium and tough) I would have to make another choice I stated that's alright I'll make another choice. She insisted I make a choice ordering the Lobster Quiche, so I did (the order was on the house she stated). The quiche was over cooked and dry. She made me pay for the skirt steak (I didn't eat) and said it will be cheaper if I paid for the steak. I didn't appreciate her service and she was very rude. Will I be back, the answer is no and I will not recommend anyone via int either due to Mary Ann's attitude."
9/5/2021,5 star rating,"There is a good vibe in this space, such a good vibe. From the live music, open space and good food, this is a place you should check out. This place is a nice addition to the neighborhood. It is within walking distance of a lot.When you walk in, you're greeted with warmth. The service staff was attentive and friendly. The service was slightly slow (however they noted this, so it was expected). Our sever was on point. It appears that perhaps the kitchen is a little further away from the dining room, so that may be a slight issue. Now the food, delicious. We ordered the Cajun seafood pasta - it is spicy, but the good heat. It had a kick that set it and stopped for a little while and then moved on!!  Lol. Sometimes things are ""hot"" for no reason. This was a great balance of spice (heat). We had our sons with us and they ordered the sliders and the pasta. Both were as advertised. The butter noodles are just that, so not much you can do there. It was fine. The sliders were very good. It was a nice burger, elevated enough to make it work getting a burger at a nice spot. Very delicious and juicy too. Sometimes sliders can be dried out, these were not. Finally, I ordered the lamb - GREAT decision!  I tend to order my lamb at medium because sometimes lamb is either over cooked or too under for my taste. I ordered medium and slightly below. They came back medium and it was perfect. Very, delicious. Seasoned well and the cook was spot on!  I had to fight my son for the last one!!!  The mushroom risotto was very good as well. I was very pleased with my personal meal and then my family's choice as well. Now, the one knock...sorry y'all...the cupcake that we had for dessert was not to the level of the meal we had just expected more. It felt like it had been frozen and not completely thawed or heated. So, only knock. We will return and you should too. Oh, the drinks were good too!"
5/16/2021,5 star rating,"I went to the Park Supper Club for Mother's Day Brunch. It was amazing! It was a 5 course  meal prix fixed menu. Everything was delicious. The food was flavorful. The soup was a little spicy but hearty. I ordered the steak and it was slightly over cooked. They offered to correct it but it was not a huge deal. I had a yummy peach cobbler cupcake with delicious coffee. I had two raspberry lemon drop martinis and they were excellent. Also, they offered an unlimited mimosa option.They had a pianist who was playing and it really kinda had a romantic feel. The customer service was impeccable. Upon my exit, I was given a single rose. My entire experience was awesome. This is a Black owned business owned by the same owners as M Lounge and Persona.Make a reservation and enjoy this wonderful experience!"
4/30/2021,5 star rating,"I'm not the first to review but I'll take a hit for this one. This is from the owner's of M Lounge and Persona and this is upscale. I started out with the house made Hummus w/ Pita, Margherita Flatbread, the Salad and then ended off with the Burger w/ Fries. I thought the flatbread was overpriced but it was excellent along with the fries."
11/28/2021,5 star rating,Service was great and the food was excellent. This place has a nice ambiance and the crowd was nice. Enjoyed my visit and will definitely return. I left before live music started and I can't wait to hear their musicians perform.
10/1/2021,1 star rating,"We had a horrible experience here. Our reservations were at 7:30p. By 9pm we had no received any bread or the food we ordered. The wait staff kept making excuses and apologizing but they kept letting in more and more people, even though they couldn't serve the people that were there. No one checked on us. We had to keep flagging the wait staff down and no one had looked into our order. I would not recommend this place at all."

4/23/2021,5 star rating,"Went to the grand opening last night. What an incredible, much needed addition to the neighborhood. Really cool vibe. We had the crab cakes and Shrimp appetizer. They were fantastic. Lots of flavor. The shrimp was spicy, just the way I like it. I had the Brick Chicken  with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. It was cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu. The cajun shrimp pasta looked incredible! Well done!"
11/24/2021,3 star rating,"Great spot for happy hour or dinner.  Food is great, drinks good but pricey. Live music most times.  When there is a DJ, they are the best.  Highly recommended."
7/8/2021,5 star rating,Whoever the management is needs to give a master class on how they convey this atmosphere of warmth and ease.  Almost felt like I was at a family dinner.   I only had appetizers but will DEFINITELY be back for a meal based on what I experienced.
