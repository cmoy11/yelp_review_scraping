I just moved from LA on the 11th. Soulé is 5 minutes away I'll definitely be back. I'll be bringing friends and family for sure. Thanks!!!
6/2/2022,2 star rating,Hi I ordered from Uber eats because I wanted some soul food I ordered the shrimp and grits came with 5 shrimps tasted bland and overly greasy Mac and cheese was okay lacked flavor too much grease Sweet potatoes were the best dish not greasy not to sweet I definitely recommend the sweet potatoes from this placeI hated the banana pudding it wasn't sweet lacked bananas and banana flavor the nilla wafers was good supply I was charged extra for the Uber delivery it was worth it The soule punch can be skipped over because it tasted like Hawaiian Punch nothing special I'm not used to so much greasy food after eating here my stomach hurts
5/9/2022,4 star rating,"Small venue so please make a reservation. Paid street parking available. $10 cork fee so it is byob. Non alcoholic options were a sweet tea and punch. Sweet tea was delicious. Fried green tomatoes: super thinly sliced . It's as if I was enjoying the batter more than the tomato itself.Catfish: very flaky and came out hot! Would order it there instead of to go, feel like it wouldn't carry well.Greens: they were okay. Missing a smoky flavor. Mac and cheese: cheesy and creamy. Lamb chops: delicious. Very flavorful Cream corn: was the highlight of the meal."
3/20/2022,1 star rating,"We learned about the restaurant and visited their website. The restaurant appeared to be appealing. I called the reservation line, and the person who answered the phone was unfriendly and sounded as if I had woken her up from a nap. This place is a very small establishment which is why they require reservations.We tried fish and grits, shrimp and grits, lollipop lamb chops, mac & cheese, sweet potatoes, and drizzled chicken, all of which were served after an hour. The honey-drizzled fried chicken was tasty, but the Mac & cheese was bland. The sauce they use makes the macaroni clumpy and way too creamy. Sweet potatoes, on the other hand, were delicious.There are numerous reasons why I cannot give it a perfect 5 or even 4 stars. One of these reasons is the SERVICE, which was extremely slow and ineffective. The owner keeps telling customers to wear masks, which we understand is necessary. But why do the staff working here don't even wear masks or follow the COVID health protocols? This is some sort of joke. It was my first visit here, and I didn't expect to be so let down.Also, to avoid losing customers, I recommend they hire someone who sounds enthusiastic to book potential customers. The one on the phone is particularly vexing."
4/30/2022,5 star rating,"Highly recommend getting a reservation! They were very kind and sat us anyway, because there were a handful of open tables when we came in (mid-afternoon), but it filled up quickly.The food was all delicious. We had fried green tomatoes, New Orleans style bbq shrimp, fried chicken, shrimp and grits, and a bunch of different sides. EVERYTHING was delicious and comforting.The atmosphere in this place is awesome. Homey. Friendly. Great music and incredible art.Don't miss out on Soulé - you won't regret coming in."
1/24/2022,4 star rating,"Since moving to Chicago I've been looking for a good comfort/soul food spot and I think I found it! I checked out Soulé on a Saturday evening and they did not disappoint. The staff was super friendly and they were BUSY (good for them!)I had the fried catfish plate with mac&cheese and greens. My friend had the white meat chicken plate with sweet potatoes and asparagus. We also shared the jerk wings and the banana pudding!! The catfish was DELISH! I haven't had catfish this good since moving from New Orleans. And the sweet potatoes were to die for!The price for the amount of food was just right compared to some other souls food spots I've been too!I forgot to get pics of some of the food before we started eating, but that just tells you how good it was!I suggest making a reservation if you want to eat in as the space is not very large, but they also do carry out orders if you want to go that route!The only reason I did not give a 5 is because you knew the food was prepped ahead of time because it was served within a few minutes of ordering. Not a big deal, especially because of how busy they were but just a noticing!"
1/17/2022,5 star rating,"I don't know many soul food restaurants in Chicago, so I'm grateful to have come across Soule. The energy from the staff is great and keeps the energy up. All the food was amazing, including the veggies and all for a reasonable price! Their banana pudding is a must have to end the meal! It was delicious! I love the variety from the menu and it was perfect on a rainy day to eat! I wanted to try all the sides on the menu as they all intrigued me. I loved the fried green potatoes and creamy garlic shrimp! We almost ordered more because they were very good! We loved all our foods and it was still good as leftovers too!I can't wait to come back because the food was amazing and I want to eat it again but also try other items!"
3/20/2022,2 star rating,Food was salty I had greens salty Mac&cheese was dryLamb chops okFired green tomatoes tasteless Very $$$ for your portions
5/17/2022,1 star rating,"I ordered the lamb chops , greens & dirty rice ! All three where SALT LAKE CITYYY HUNNNY COULDNT even enjoy it not even a lil bit the greens was the saltiest like whewwww the dirty rice was salty tooo and the lamb chops was dry with a sweet barbecue but salty asl like what's going onnnn. ! The second thing I got was the macaroni , sweet potatoes and catfish for my son the sweet potatoes was good I guess cause you can't add salt to them ! The macaroni was dry but it was alright and the catfish was good not salty the banana pudding was good and my son said the peach cobbler was 10/10 bussin he can't stop eating it (he 7) but them greens was so damn salty I'm mad asl so was that dirty rice that  was unacceptable"
3/18/2022,5 star rating,"Okay so I'll start here. I always take food pics. This time I did not....You walk in and are met with a familiar smell and feeling, it's called family. We were quickly sat at our table and the service was great. Chanika (Girl, forgive me if I spelled it wrong) got us some cold water and my soul punch which was great. The music, 90's RnB sets the tone for what's to come.I got the blackened and fried catfish with grits. Baby, these other restaurants could NEVER! It literally transported me to being 10years old in my granny kitchen. My hubby had the blackened catfish with dirty rice. He ate everything including the silverware lol. Honestly this is the best soul food I've had since moving back north because; A. The meat is seasoned not just the batterB. The service is amazingC. It's like being a child again waiting for your plate.Customer for life or as long as I'm in Chicago!"
11/14/2021,4 star rating,"According to my friends, the food was pretty good! I would say that the portion size seemed to be reasonable for the amount of food received.Was able to order the food online and pick it up with no qualms at all.  The service was good in person but calling in with any questions was a struggle lol."
11/21/2021,4 star rating,Soulè was a nice experience! My friends & I went to celebrate my birthday weekend & the food was pretty good. It's a small place but it made it more fun because there was no way for it to be too crowded. The only thing I didn't much like  was that there is no option on how you want your lamb cooked so it was over cooked but outside of that it was good enough. If you're in town you should make reservations & stop in.
10/14/2021,4 star rating,"I was quite surprised by this place. Its a little tough to get in, but that usually means its good, right? Well, this place is pretty awesome and a gem of a find in West Town. The reservations and table setup are a little odd. We went last night and about half of the place was full at one time. They have two ""seatings"" which is a little weird, but we were flexible. I will give them credit for putting my friends all at one table instead of the two reservations we originally got. That was super appreciated. We all got most of the things on the menu so it would be too complicated to explain everything, but generally speaking, everybody enjoyed their food. I started with the BBQ Shrimp. It was the highlight of the meal for me. Excellent taste and pretty big shrimp! I went with the honey drizzled chicken which was very good, but I was expecting a little more. I should have asked for more hot honey. It comes with two generous sides which made the $20 well worth it. I really liked the dirty rice! For dessert, I had the banana pudding as it was recommended to me. That too was excellent and for $5, was a good deal. With the food and service, I really liked this place. Maybe I set the bar too high, but I wasn't floored by the food. Still, it was excellent and if I am ever in this area, I will be sure to check this place out! I would recommend it to anybody!"
11/6/2021,3 star rating,Alright the place looks nice but it's really small. The staff is alright I think service may be different when you actually sit down and eat. We just walked in but you got to make a reservation to eat inside. Also when you order be sure to check if your food is ready they didn't text us so our food wasn't really hot. Alright the food. We got the Greens and they were just okay. We also got the jerk chicken wings the regular ones they also got bbq ones anyways these were good. Last we got the catfish and this was better than the wings had a lot of flavor. Overall giving the place 3 stars since everything wasn't bussin or nun and they never texted us that our food was ready. This could've made our food better who knows. Also didn't get the best picture ate this on the bus lol!
3/24/2021,5 star rating,"I went to Soule with some friends last week for brunch on Sunday. It's a small space with lots of character. When we walked in we loved the music and the welcoming decor.This spot is byob, but if you're looking for a sweetNon-alcohol drink try the Soule Punch (Cherry Koolaid, Lemonade, and Sweet Tea). We loved the appetizers! I highly recommend the Jerk shrimp and the Fried Green Tomatoes. For my entree I got the shrimp & grits and I also went with a couple sides (greens and Mac & cheese). OMG the greens were so good! I don't get to eat greens often and I could of had a few sides of that they were so good.I was stuffed so I took some peach cobbler to go. I definitely plan on going back. I heard next time I need to try the lamb chops. They're supposedly a crowd favorite."
9/4/2021,3 star rating,"First, the restaurant is extremely small and the pics are a tad deceiving. I didn't like that the hostess stand/Togo area was very visible. You could see all of the Togo orders bagged and just sitting on the table when you walked in. The hostess didn't have a stand but instead s high top table which just seemed a bit thrown together.  The food was okay. The greens were good but definitely had a vinegary strong taste that you could easily not like. The fish is fried and seasoned to perfection! The mac was just okay, a kid would like it. Service was okay too but they kept messing up things. Literally both tables next to us had issues. Overall, I'd get the fish if I were in the area but I don't need a trip back"
8/20/2021,4 star rating,"A modern and casual spot in west town for soul food -- bring your friends!A few friends from grad school and I were craving comfort food and now that soulè has reservations   available online it was a no brainer. Each reservation lasts for two hours and we arrived at 2 PM. Just a note that there are only around four tables and no patio, so a reservation is highly recommended. We kicked off our stay with a few appetizers, including fried green tomatoes, creamy garlic shrimp (my favorite!), and jerk shrimp. We also each ordered an entree each -- I ordered the dark meat honey fried chicken meal with chicken spaghetti and sweet potatoes, which was a couple dollars more than the regular fried chicken meal. I personally wish there was more honey on the chicken -- it didn't make a noticeable difference to me, but the meal itself was very tasty and comforting. Soulè also offers BYOB, but doesn't serve any alcohol themselves -- the cork fee is $10. At the end, our bill was around $30 each."
8/31/2021,4 star rating,"This spot came highly recommended. I tried the fried green tomatoes & fried fish with Mac&Cheese and dirty rice. Hubby had the friend chicken, greens and creamed corn. All do the food was good, slightly salty but good. The service was good. Hubby loved it."
1/16/2022,5 star rating,"I love it when the hype actually matches the word of mouth! Soulé is EVERYTHING good that you've already heard about. It was a feast of flavor from beginning to end! First, reservations are a must because this place is very small. Second, we were greeted right at our reservation time and all COVID-19 protocols were followed. My party of four started with the fried green tomato and creamy garlic shrimp appetizers--so good! My only quibble is that they're a little stingy with the remoulade for the tomatoes. It was lip-smacking good & I wanted more! The shrimp appetizer could be a meal in itself. So expertly seasoned!For our entrees we had the lamb chops, catfish, chicken and blackened salmon pasta. Our sides were greens & mac & cheese and we had cornbread for the table. Bay-beh. When I tell you our entire table was quiet except for all the slurping and lip-smacking from this good food. There was not a single wrong note in anything we had. Everything was seasoned, grilled, fried, blackened etc to perfection and we were most pleased. The server was also very attentive to our needs and kept their entire operation running like clockwork. We were so stuffed we couldn't finish dessert but I had peach cobbler to go and it was divine! Soulé is a great, full dining experience. The space itself is also lovely & tasteful, designed to make patrons feel most comfortable, and we did. It's BYOB but we had the Soulé punch, which was very good. Highly recommend Soulé and would definitely return for takeout and also to dine in."
6/30/2021,5 star rating,"Ate here with the family today, and we loved it! We tried every side, half the entrees and every available desert. No fails, and most exceeded our expectations. It's hard to nail down our favorites. The Greens were loved by all, but so was the Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potatoes, Creamed Corn, Chicken Spaghetti, Green Beans and even the Asparagus. My favorite entree was the Lamb Chops, but the Catfish Po'Boy and Blackened Salmon Pasta were awesome. The Honey Glazed Fried Chicken was great too. Our group favorite desert was the home made banana pudding, followed by the Peach Cobbler and Chocolate Cake. We need to go back and try the last few things we missed or that they were out of. Awesome spot you have to try this place!"
4/14/2022,5 star rating,"Such a great restaurant. Love the food, the music and the service. Always a great time at Soule"
4/22/2022,4 star rating,"Visited for late lunch on a weekday. Beware that even though restaurant opens at 1pm, they don't start seating and serving for dine in until 2pm. No big deal, we just had to wait in the car for 15 minutes. Food was good: hot, fresh, well seasoned. Portions were of a decent size. Would consider returning occasionally."
5/25/2022,1 star rating,Food was good but the customer service was terrible! The waitress seem Irritated the time we walked through the food. She was rude & purposely ignored us when we tried to ask for missing items. The cashier wasn't friendly either. I won't be going back there again. I'll spend my money elsewhere
5/22/2021,3 star rating,"I've ordered from here many times now and I continue to come back only because their food is good. I also continue to believe that if they would improve their service, they would get 5 stars, easy.One improvement they did make was upgrading to online ordering only and not accepting phone orders. They couldn't keep up with the phone calls, it was hard to get anyone to answer, and the online process is much better, although they still don't accurately estimate how long your order will take. (The window is ridiculous so it's hard to know when to arrive, and in living 45 minutes away, it's not easy.) However, the biggest problem I had today was that I ordered the creamy garlic shrimp appetizer for $10. Since they don't offer it as an entree, I added additional shrimp for $6 to make it a larger portion for my dinner. Our order was ready while we were en route, but after we pressed the ""I'm Here"" button on the app as instructed, no one came out as I expecting. I went in and got our order and made sure all 3 dishes that we ordered were in the bag. We got all the way home and I then realized that I did not receive the extra shrimp that I paid for. Fortunately I had also ordered the Fried green tomatoes, so I was full with both dishes. I called and got credit for my missing shrimp, but I was again disappointed. My daughter had the salmon and shrimp over mashed potatoes with spinach and she loved it. (Only 2 shrimp in that dish though...and it's a $22 dish!) For their price points I hope for better service so we can keep coming."
8/8/2020,3 star rating,"I have wanted to try this place for a while so tonight we did. They are doing carry out only due to the pandemic, which is fine because that's all we're doing right now anyway. I called to place our order and was disappointed to learn that they were out of the lamb chops and the fried green tomatoes, both of which were at the top of my list to try. So I ordered two orders of the creamy garlic shrimp with sides of Mac & cheese and greens for my daughter and me, and because my husband loves fried chicken, I decided to surprise him, knowing that it would be good. That came with 3 pieces, two sides and your choice of white or dark meat. I told the lady on the phone that we were coming from Evanston so I needed at least 30 minutes. She said it would be 45 minutes to an hour, which was perfect. She said I would receive a text when it was ready. When we got there, there were so many people standing in front waiting for their orders. I noted 4 different workers coming to ask people's names, taking payments and bringing the food out. It was so crowded that I waited in the car, noticing that NONE of the workers had masks on! I wished I had pre-paid over the phone. An hour and a 1/2 had gone by and still no text. I waited til the crowd went down and went to the door. I asked and the guy said about 10 more minutes. The lady next to me said her order is never ready when they say, but the food is good. I finally paid, got my bags and we were were on our way. When we got home, we discovered that they gave my husband the fried catfish instead of chicken. That's not one of his favorites and I really wanted him to try the chicken. So I was NOT happy, to wait all that time and not get what we ordered. I will say that the shrimp and Mac & cheese were both excellent! The greens, even though they had big chunks of stems which I'm not crazy about, were very tasty! Among the best I've had! I called about the chicken and was given a credit, and I still plan to try the other dishes. If they can get my order right and provide more accurate wait times they'll be 5 stars easy."
11/13/2021,1 star rating,"I was so excited to give this place a try due to clout of celebrities visiting here. Plus pics looked good too. Butttt it didn't turn out the way it did. . I rode the bus from the other side of town. So yes a special trip for some good food. ,It was kind of hard to finding the sign for the place at night.  Didn't see the white print on the clear window. Til I looked online for someone to post on Google to see where the heck it is. Its right next to the liquor store. .When I first walked in and this place has a distinct smell not pleasant  maybe the spices they use from cooking . The girl in the front asked if I had reservation, I'm like no but only table for one. They say No seating was offered before 20 mins to 7pm so I'm like ok togo ? So they let me togo at least. I did see people come after 7 and sit down but they had reservation. Also they had multiple open tables so yea and it wasn't like busy busy for dine in... I'm like whatever... . Before ordering I was warned the prices isn't correct on the menu so look at the iPad to order which was nice to know. In my mind I'm confused ... like what?... but in my mind I told myself  I'm here and I don't know when I will be coming again anyways.... . Ordered the lamb chops with 2 sides. Lamb chops requested medium rare, it was burnt and well done. The meat was over cooked so it was tough and not tender. On the first bite of the meat, it was salty asf.  I should have Went back in and asked for a refund. As I'm eating it was a joke and im like it is Terrible..It wasn't worth 24 plus tax which came out  to 26 bucks. The Portion size was like a TV dinner size.  The scoop of rice was small and could be a little more hefty scoop. Sorry for 26 bucks it's not worth it, not for that overcooked and burnt salty lamb chops ... and the size of them lamb chops was small too. . Dirty rice - at least it tasted good. It was piping hot. In my opinion I would served a hefty scoop of it, it was just small portion. . Cream of corn was flavorful. It was creamy and soupy with lots of liquid. Presentation wise was no good. Cream of corn mixed well with the dirty rice. If the cream of corn was eaten alone it's bit salty. . Overall I ain't coming back for the quality of food I got. Also the price is high for that tv dinner portion. Plus I wasn't even full, not satisfy and had to walk 3 blocks over for some Ukrainian food..I was so Dissapointed with quality, portion, taste, and just not worth what was being charged. Thankqs for reading and have a yelptastic day!"
7/17/2021,5 star rating,"Close your eyes, open your mind and step into a time machine that takes you back with flavors from home and childhood. Casual atmosphere is paired with hearty home cooking. Started with jerk shrimp, fried green tomatoes and wings. Tried the sweet tea and punch (BYOB if you want something stronger, corkage is $10). Fried catfish and peach cobbler a la mode were my favorites but the Mac, green beans and greens were all nostalgic & good as well. Will be back to bring the whole fam."
11/19/2021,1 star rating,"Woke up to this wonderful day ready to make it better than the rest. My daughter and I didn't have to work today, so she suggested we go get brunch. I scroll through my self made Yelp category highlighting small independent restaurants and Soule catches my eye. My daughter excitedly says yes so off we go! But wait... we're on the Southside and there on the other side so let's take a look at their website and call them as not to waste time, gas or opportunity. Phone ring ring rings until the greeting gets started. Perusing the website reveals the menu and hours of operation. Says they open at 1pm. It's 12:30pm. Probably why no one answered the phone... We arrive at 12:57pm to a locked door. The gentleman unlocks the door, greets us and invites us in. The YOUNG lady says, ""What? Y'all want to order carryout or something?"" I respond we would like to dine-in if possible. She informs us they don't start dine-in until 2pm and that's by reservations ONLY...I bid them farewell and leave. Not a single thing on the website says reservations only OR dine-in doesn't start until 2pm. She didn't ask if we wanted to make reservations or inform us they didn't have any open reservations for today. It really felt like between her and us she really felt like someone shouldn't even be there. Oh well... I'll never try again. On to the next one. My wonderful day with my daughter awaits!"
5/25/2022,4 star rating,"Overall, food was pretty good. Ordered take out - blackened salmon pasta and several sides. My wife had the pasta and said it was delicious. The sweet potatoes were also phenomenal. However, the other sides weren't that great (greens, mac and cheese, and asparagus). I would also avoid ordering the asparagus in general - $5.50 for just 4 spears. Would still order from here again though."
2/26/2022,5 star rating,Neighborhood gem with outstanding food. Stopped in for a quick lunch and greatly enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff very accommodating. I ordered the creamy garlic shrimp appetizer - the taste was delicious - and ordered the fried chicken to go. The chicken was so juicy on the inside yet crispy on the outside. Among the best I've ever had. Definitely give it a try!
9/19/2021,1 star rating,"We were excited to try the food because the menu looks amazing. However, a 2+ HOUR WAIT for a carry out order (for 2 people) is insane. We ordered at 6:10p, the food was ready at 8:22p! The original estimated time we were given was over an hour. It seemed ridiculous but we still decided to wait because we thought it may be done before then. We checked on the order 3 times and the last time folks were told to wait outside by the owner. We live in the area so we went home and came back, hoping that the food would make the experience a little less frustrating. The staff issued no apologies for the wait, just carried on like a two hour wait is standard (LOL).Additionally, there are no real mask mandates here. Most of the staff were maskless or wore their masks below their noses. They desperately need to get their ticket times and customer service together. The food and portion sizes was subpar. I'm not sure if folks are being nice but the taste was well below my expectations. The fried fish and fried chicken were not seasoned well. The breading tasted dry. I ordered my fried chicken with the honey drizzle and the drizzle was nowhere to be found. The macaroni didn't have a particular taste. The sweet potatoes were good! The greens were okay but tasted like there was a hint of vinegar in them. If you have a couple hours to spare and still curious about this place, please order at your own risk."

Also didn't get the best picture ate this on the bus lol!
10/22/2021,5 star rating,"Our reservation was for 7:15 and when we walked in, we were seated immediately. Highly recommend making a reservation otherwise you might have to order takeout. There is a limited capacity due to the size of the restaurant in general, and of course COVID-19. We took a few minutes to look over the menu and decided on the fried chicken and lamb chops with green beans, cream corn, and macaroni & cheese. The lamb chops were so good that my boyfriend actually ordered more, the food came so fast he had them in 3 minutes max. The portions were a nice size and everything was reasonably priced. Great food, great customer service, great energy. My favorite part is that Soulé is Black Owned. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
10/22/2021,5 star rating,great food. great drinks. such a vibe. i recommend the cat fish or shrimp and grits. the punch is great as well. the music is good.

10/14/2021,4 star rating,"I was quite surprised by this place. Its a little tough to get in, but that usually means its good, right? Well, this place is pretty awesome and a gem of a find in West Town. The reservations and table setup are a little odd. We went last night and about half of the place was full at one time. They have two ""seatings"" which is a little weird, but we were flexible. I will give them credit for putting my friends all at one table instead of the two reservations we originally got. That was super appreciated. We all got most of the things on the menu so it would be too complicated to explain everything, but generally speaking, everybody enjoyed their food. I started with the BBQ Shrimp. It was the highlight of the meal for me. Excellent taste and pretty big shrimp! I went with the honey drizzled chicken which was very good, but I was expecting a little more. I should have asked for more hot honey. It comes with two generous sides which made the $20 well worth it. I really liked the dirty rice! For dessert, I had the banana pudding as it was recommended to me. That too was excellent and for $5, was a good deal. With the food and service, I really liked this place. Maybe I set the bar too high, but I wasn't floored by the food. Still, it was excellent and if I am ever in this area, I will be sure to check this place out! I would recommend it to anybody!"
10/9/2021,5 star rating,"A hidden GEM! I am not from around here but I'm e found this place on a whim!  It turned out we needed reservations, however the hostess was the sweetest and advised us a reservation was cancelled and she sat us right away. From the prices on the menu I thought we would get small portions. Baby!!! I was wrong! Nice size portions of food and very fresh and hot! The cook put his foot in this you hear me lol! I loved every bite of this! Our waitress was the best and very attentive. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting. Finger licking good !"
7/16/2021,5 star rating,Wow wow wow! This place blew my mind. Shaniqua provided excellence service. All the food came out both hot and fresh. My lamb chops were seasoned to perfection and my sides (greens & Mac n cheese) were great. Portion size was good. Additionally Shaniqua made sure we had peach cobbler to take home! Absolutely would recommend and so glad I was able to support a black owned business.
5/18/2021,1 star rating,"Arrived at restaurant wasn't greeted so I greeted them. Asked could she help us ,I stated dine in she stated reservation only which is strange it wasn't mentioned on Yelp . Was given a number called twice someone finally picked up and made reservations for 3:45 next available , on arrival it was only one couple that was around 3:10. I confirmed reservation and arrived back at 3:39 she stated they don't seat until 3:45 it wasn't a soul in the restaurant like it's name . I immediately called a Uber and got away from these entitled unprofessional people , I have never and will not spend my money where I'm not wanted. As I was leaving another couple showed up and poor things didn't have a reservation either . So they proceeded to get one and stand out in the drizzling rain like we did , before I realized honey these people don't need my Texas Bucks they good ."

Looked online- no reservations were available. I'm like we're already here,  can we just get a table in this COMPLETELY empty restaurant? The young lady says no, we fill up fast on Sunday. By this time it's like 1:15 and yup-still empty! Deuces yall, I ain't begging NOBODY to take my coins and I won't be back"
1/17/2022,2 star rating,We went for my guys birthday. The waitress on the video flicks was not the nicest at all. The Fried salmon pasta dish was delish. There was also a gnat flying around. In the cold weather. I'm not sure how. I left my dessert without trying it but still tipped the rude waitress. Step it up guys !
3/15/2021,1 star rating,Oh my!! For starters we placed our order and was told it would be a 45 min wait. We waited for an hour and a half for our food only for it to be cold and subpar. My brother had the shrimp and grits and it was absolutely disgusting. The sauce had a weird coating to it and it taste like cloves and spices (similar to a jerk rub). My son has the appetizer shrimp and it was a sad presentation. Little pieces of bread with some sauce and minced garlic poured on it. (We order bbq shrimp) again subpar. Additionally I ordered a side of Mac and cheese and literally we were given the bottom of the pan. The noodles were hard and literally had no cheese on it. I had the catfish which was the best thing and my Mac and cheese was decent. The sweet potatoes were harshly seasoned with nutmeg. My sister had the chicken with sweet potatoes and Mac and cheese and hers was edible. Would not recommend. Perhaps they were way too busy this day but our experience was not a pleasant one.
2/18/2022,1 star rating,"Food was extremely bland, nasty, and cold. Lamb chops were tiny. Macaroni tasted like it came out of the box. I was visiting from Atlanta and was extremely disappointed."
12/12/2021,5 star rating,Was looking to try something new close to the Ace Hotel. Glad I did. Great fried chicken + catfish. The punch was really tasty - reminded me of summer. Mac and cheese was ridiculously good. Took a banana pudding to go. I'm sure it will be equally delicious.
3/22/2022,2 star rating,Overrated Lamb chops are always burned food is only good and presentable if you dine in.  If you order through delivery service there's 100% chance you'll be disappointed.
1/2/2022,5 star rating,"Had a fantastic delivery experience with Soulé for a Sunday lunch! The food arrived in about 30 minutes, was neatly packaged, and great portion sizes. We had the blackened salmon pasta with shrimp, fried chicken, catfish, greens, creamed corn, mac and cheese, banana pudding, and peach cobbler. Everything was well-seasoned and the chicken and catfish were still crispy even with the delivery. The mac and cheese and catfish were standouts but everything was excellent!"
9/6/2019,2 star rating,"Soule is a small cute boutique restaurant. Chic Décor Enjoyable atmosphere, Laid Back, Great Energy, Nice Music PlaylistFriendly Staff. The food is ok and basic. I ordered the 2 Fried Catfish that came with two sides ( dirty rice and greens) and a glass of their Soule Punch. My dirty rice had a kick of spice and the greens were kind of bland. The Soule punch was watered down no flavor. The 2 rated stars are going towards the service of our server and the nice ambiance."
12/9/2021,2 star rating,"My husband and I had gone for date night. My husband had gone to the restroom and as I'm sitting there I could see in the kitchen. This guy is staring at me and twisting his HAIR! Yes!!! HIS HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!My first instinct was to leave. Someone closed the swing door, then I see him doing odd jobs and not handling any food.  Wheww!!!!My husband returns and without me saying a word, he says ""it should be some requirement for hairnets in food establishments"". Uhm Yeah message to owners and dude locking his twist!The FOOD: First let me say, Being a child of southern parents..I know a thing or two about good eating.The salmon/shrimp was delicious. I would definitely try it again.The Jerk/BBQ shrimp is a complete rip off.  The four medium-ish shrimp sitting on soggy bread for approx $12.00 was so not worth it.The fried green tomatoes were okay.  Sauce was good though.The asparagus was cooked just right, but no seasoning hit my palette.My husband had fried chicken. He stated it was seasoned really good, but the chicken was so dried out. He felt the mac & cheese was Kraft sproused up. And the dirty rice was spicy & flavorful.He said the corn bread was the best part of his meal. Bro...cornbread? Okay!SERVICE: Being such a small establishment, we didn't have to wait long for our food and our wait staff was visable at all times.Funny thing!! My salmon/shrimp entree came with mashed potatoes, but when my husband asked if he could have mashed potatoes as his side dish...he was told, it was not an option for sides outside of the entree.Not even an option to upcharge..just flat out NO and walked away!And last.. the waitress didn't ask if we wanted change back...Just straight Gee'd our $20.00.  Although we intended for her to have it...she didn't extend courtesy to inquire if we wanted change back."
9/29/2019,4 star rating,"Went with a group of friends after an exam and had a great time! This small but very cozy and well decorated restaurant pops out some delicious classic soul food. You'll find your staples liked fried chicken or fish, blackened salmon, etc. along with a couple interesting things like lamp chops. The place  seats mostly couples or groups of 4-6, so we had to wait a bit for enough space to free up for our 10-person group. It's BYO with a corkage fee, so I definitely recommend you bring some beer or wine to enjoy with your meal!Between all of us we got their fried chicken, fried fish, salmon, lamb chops, and also their fried green tomatoes and most of their sides. Service was fast and so polite, even with our larger than expected group, and food came out fresh and hot. All the fried items were fantastic, with what I think was a cornmeal-y crust that was just thin enough but super crispy and not oily at all. The blacked salmon was also juicy and well seasoned, although the rice could've been a bit more exciting. The collard greens, Mac n cheese, and green beans were all tasty and hit the spot. The only downside is I think the meat portions were a bit smaller than expected- maybe the size control helps keep all the fried chicken or fish equally juicy and crispy.Overall, great place for a small gathering or a date (we saw a bunch of tables of 2!) in a part of Chicago that could definitely use some more good soul food."
12/14/2019,4 star rating,"I try to support black owned businesses whenever I can. I've been hearing about this place for a while now. I came here on Saturday night around 7:30pm, it was definitely busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes or so for a table for two. They do give the option to leave and they text you when your table is ready. They do have a small waiting sitting area as well. It's not a big place as it is, about 10 full tables not holding more than 4 people. The food was good! The Soule Punch was good! I was surprised it wasn't too sweet, being tea, lemonade, and kool-aid mix. I had the catfish, yams and greens. The greens were a bit saltier than most, not sure if I'd get them again. But the yams were sweet and good. The fish were very crispy and they gave you two decent size fillets. I was very full off the entree but I did make room for desert, lol. We had the peach cobbler and ice cream, it wasn't sweet at all. But a nice ending to dinner. The service was great. Everybody was nice and the owner was serving plates and walking around to make sure everything was good, which was refreshing. I love the music here!!Overall, I'd definitely recommend and I will return again. I seen a lot on the menu I will try, so I look forward to coming back!"
8/19/2021,1 star rating,Went to soule today and ordered fried catfish. The girl said 30 minutes so I said ok. 30 minutes went by so I went inside and the girl says to me it'll be another 20 minutes so I said Cancel the order. Soule service sucks.
8/22/2021,3 star rating,First time trying Soule out and I will say the food was really good & portion size was to my liking. My bf ordered the Catfish & SHRIMP with yams. He said the sweet potatoes was really good. I ordered the Salmon & SHRIMP with asparagus. The asparagus was too salty. I was told to never order asparagus from a black restaurant because we as black ppl do not know how to cook them lol. So I changed to greens & they were indeed yummy. But you see how I capitalized SHRIMP because what was on our plate was TWO SMALL pieces of shrimp. We thought it may have been a mistake but nope. I suggest they let ppl know ahead of time & have the option to add shrimp to their order. Otherwise the place had a real nice ambiance and the staff was extremely nice.
1/12/2022,5 star rating,The fried chicken is divine!  The meal with Mac & cheese and dirty rice may be one of the best in the city. Don't hesitate on the jerk wings as well

6/14/2020,5 star rating,"O yay Soulé! Any restaurant that can make carryout soul food taste this delicious and fresh is either using witchcraft or food minions. Either way I'm happy with it and loved my meal! The chicken was crispy and flavorful, the mac n cheese was creamy and dreamy, and the chicken spaghetti was the perfect balance of flavors. And the sweet potatoes! The sweet potatoes will take you to a higher plane! Go here. Eat your weight in carbs. Thank me later!"
6/11/2020,4 star rating,"Good Day Yelpers!!I had the opportunity to hop over to Chicago Avenue to check out Soule' and I must say that I am VERY impressed!!  I initially had my set on the Catfish because that seem to get the most reviews along with the chicken spaghetti and green beans, but the lazy greedy gut in me also added the jerk wings and mac and cheese just to try a little of everything.  My disclaimer now before I describe the food is to always go with your first mind.  The food was amazing - ESPECIALLY the fish, spaghetti, and green beans. The fish was a thick cut of perfectly seasoned  filet goodness, and it was still crispy once I reached my home on the Southside!!  The green beans warmed my heart and I loved the fact that they added to a touch of smoked turkey just to tease my taste buds!!  And the chicken spaghetti?!?  OMG!!  It was amazing!!  Now on to my appetizer and sick kick mac n cheese.The jerk wings were good but the heat on those wings overtook the smokiness of it.  Not a good balance for me.  And the mac and cheese was just Meh, I wouldn't order it again!!  Maybe it would have made me say WOW had I not wolfed down the green beans and spaghetti first.  Maybe I'll get a double portion of green beans and a side of chicken spaghetti on my next trip, hmmm.  Naaaaah!!!  Gotta get that bomb fish again.  I'm so full right now I can't breathe and I still have one filet, 4 wings, spaghetti, and green beans left.  Dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  So my verdict on Soule'?: Itis WorthyIf you're a fan of super hot jerk wings then go for it, otherwise, put on your favorite sweat pants and comfy t-shirt, go get take-out from Soule', and get ready to smile!"

6/11/2020,4 star rating,"Open for carry-out during the pandemic! I found this place searching for black-owned restaurants to support and I'm glad I chose this spot! We had the fried chicken with greens, mac and cheese, blackened catfish with dirty rice and shrimp, and jerk wings. Wow, this was a lot of food and packed with a lot of flavor. My favorite was probably the regular fried chicken. The jerk wings are pretty spicy and it sneaks up on you. All the sides were equally good. The greens and dirty rice are heavily seasoned, a smidge salty for my taste, but perfect for leftovers since I can make it stretch! Can't go wrong with anything you choose!"
6/25/2021,5 star rating,"The food was really great. Only thing I didn't like was they used plastic forks, which was a little weird."
6/21/2021,3 star rating,"It was ok. Not great. Not bad. We came at opening time and they were gracious enough to give us a table although we didn't have reservations. The place is small, the people were friendly, the food was sub-par. The jerk shrimp was shrimp with jerk sauce dumped on them. The Mac n cheese was edible but not great. The catfish was ok. I would not wait two hours for a table. (Maybe later in the evening the food and presentation are better.)"
3/27/2021,1 star rating,If I could give it a ZERO I would!!!! The amount of food you get when ordering to-go is absolutely ridiculous!! I paid $62 for two dinners and this is what we got! No flavor or real seasoning! I'm so upset and disappointed!!! Why did I wait over an hour for this mediocre food!!! And they cut the phone off so I can't call to express my frustration! Do better people!!! It's not fair to customers who spend their hard earned money on something and it be such a disappointment! SMH
9/21/2021,5 star rating,"Wonderful black-owned spot. This restaurant plays R&B music. My husband and I had the ""Soule"" punch which was good and sweet. We had the jerk chicken wings as an appetizer, highly recommend. Then, I had the blackened salmon pasta as my entree with a side of greens and my husband had the honey drizzled chicken with asparagus and dirty rice. The food was sssoo good. The cook Rob did his thing with this meal."
9/19/2021,5 star rating,"Discovered this place on the Michelin guide and booked this reservation in advance to enjoy with some friends. We all decided to have the Salmon W/Shrimp. You have the option to have it jerk or regular for which we all opted to do jerk and wow....the portion size is insane yet I finished all of it. If you want a salmon meal that doesn't disappoint, this is the place to go. I don't know if I would have like it without the jerk sauce as I enjoy well seasoned foods! Not pictured is the banana Pudding and peach cobbler we all shared after. We got the original banana Pudding. I would say both are very good but if I were to choose just one, it would be the peach cobbler which is served with vanilla ice cream. Enjoy yall."

The reservation line is down and when I called the restaurant to ask if they could assist they said there was nothing they could do and that the ""line is probably down right now."" I also emailed them and haven't received any response. This is such a disappointment because my boyfriend and I really wanted to visit during our stay in Chicago! I don't give this one star for any reason but their lack of empathy and communication I received when asking the front desk at the restaurant to assist us!"

Two generous filets fried to perfection. The green beans and chicken spaghetti are my favorite sides along with that mouth-watery honey cornbread . I am not a fan of their Mac and cheese. Too hard."
8/19/2021,5 star rating,"Fried green tomatoes were crispy and tasty, the four slices went quickly! Shrimp and grits were fantastic, bright, and rich. When I ran out of shrimp, I mixed in some greens and it was even better. Had a bite of someone else's catfish with some hot sauce, which was also really good and seasoned well. Generous portions for the fried chicken, cat fish, and shrimp and grits; definitely had left overs for home."
1/30/2020,4 star rating,"So I dined here for the first time. Didn't know what to expect due to excessive hype so I'll jump right into it.I came in for their $13 fish special which I took advantage of because they usually open at 3pm and I am only in the vicinity of the restaurant during the lunch hour for work. I had the fish, chicken spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, creamy garlic shrimp, sweet potatoes and cornbread and a soule punch as a drink. Before I jump on the food, I'd like to commend how well put together the establishment is. It's a small cute space but well lit and after all the people have been there, to my surprise, the white seats are steak white. It felt very luxurious. I enjoyed watching the proprieter and her celeb friends on the slideshow behind the counter, I think it's a nice touch. The establishment was clean and welcoming. Audio was ambient but I think the space deserves an upgraded system, perhaps a white 1-2 Sonos speaker mounted to the ceilings instead of the loudspeaker behind counter.Service - top notch! I sat down with about 2-3 other parties in the restaurant. Upon being seated I was given water, silverware, time to look at menu and the server then greeted me and gave me great recommendations. Ariel was her name. She was polite and wore an contagious smile. She was attentive and food came out in the correct order and was correct. The other woman answering the phone was also very professional greeting people calling in! The other staff didn't spend too much time loitering or making small talk but remained busy and attentive! Ariel took good care of me, I left full. Only thing I wish was that they were open at 1pm more often during the week!Food - catfish was perfectly seasoned and fried! Perfect! Macaroni and cheese was underwhelming, it was warmed up after it sitting for a while after being made earlier I'm sure. It could've been hit out the park with a tad bit more flavor, perhaps some sharper cheddar cheeses to give it some more flavor. The macaroni was was made up with the sweet potatoes together. May sound ghetto but it's a perfect combination to me and it made both items, taste better together, to me!Creamy garlic shrimp was ""good"" not great"" I would've paid a few more for prawns or larger grilled shrimp but I think $10 is a happy medium. The sauce was also good but not great, puts me in mind of a garlic Alfredo sauce with just some sautéed shrimp. It was good enough for me to scrape the plate but I still thought it could be better, still a great item, next time I may try the jerk shrimp. Cornbread - some of the best cornbread ever! Soft, sweet warm (insert a that's what she said joke)Soulé punch - Red kool aid ‍ with probably a little something extra. Def no shade because it was good and my server definitely kept it coming and even gave me a to go cup (MVP)!! But nothing super crazy or special. Again, puts you in the mindset of a meal you'd eat on a Sunday afternoon after church at your grandmothers house!Let's keep this place in business! Go pay them a visit, very rare that businesses like these get it right the way they seemingly have it right, I heard they came a way! Very pleased! I def will be a regular!Great service and food!"
1/18/2020,4 star rating,"I've been hearing so much hype about this place and was so eager when I finally got to try this spot out. I believe this place is relatively new, so with this there are some things they can still work on. I've been here twice and the wait usually is quite long and there is a waiting time for your food as well. The place is tiny and again, a lot of hype, which explains the long wait. I definitely think through time they'll find a better system for seating people, but for right now it's just writing your name on notebook paper. The actual servers are quite nice, you can just tell it's stressful and they get super busy. Outside the servers, the bussers are definitely rude.I say all this to say-- the food is AMAZING and definitely worth all of this to me. I've gotten the salmon with shrimp both times and have been so impressed. The portion is huge and leaves you so full. You only get three shrimps, but they are jumbo sized and so fresh. The garlic spinach sauce to top off the salmon is so addicting, and this meal is perfect with a side of asparagus (which were also huge!). My friend who I've been with both times got the asparagus and pork chops, and he was very impressed too. We both noticed that the place can still use some work, which I believe will happen through time. What keeps us coming back is the amazing food!"
10/30/2020,4 star rating,"Stopped in for an early dinner. I had the lamb chops, Mac and cheese and asparagus. My wife had the fried catfish, Mac and cheese and sweet potatoes. The food was deliciously above average, which was a pleasant surprise. The glaze on the lamb chops were very flavorful and the peach cobbler was divine. We really appreciated all the COVID protocols, limited indoor seating, social distancing and mask wearing. There was only two slight drawbacks. There was confusion around our reservation and the lamb chops were cooked well instead of medium well, which is what I requested. Overall, the space,  the food and our server Jamel made for a enjoyable experience."

From the service to the food, you are in a for a pleasant experience. Service is always good when you are being served. This establishment has it down pack! Let's get to the food! For starters we ordered jerk wings. Simply amazing! We also tried the collard greens, Mac and cheese , salmon and shrimp, and bbq jerk wings. For dessert we tried  the strawberry banana pudding and peach cobbler! Everything was so damn good! You need to experience this place if you're ever in Chicago!

10/22/2021,5 star rating,"Our reservation was for 7:15 and when we walked in, we were seated immediately. Highly recommend making a reservation otherwise you might have to order takeout. There is a limited capacity due to the size of the restaurant in general, and of course COVID-19. We took a few minutes to look over the menu and decided on the fried chicken and lamb chops with green beans, cream corn, and macaroni & cheese. The lamb chops were so good that my boyfriend actually ordered more, the food came so fast he had them in 3 minutes max. The portions were a nice size and everything was reasonably priced. Great food, great customer service, great energy. My favorite part is that Soulé is Black Owned. Highly recommend this restaurant!"

5/27/2021,1 star rating,"This place has the absolute worse customer service ever. As a visitor, I tried calling before I got there & the phone line was busy after several failed attempts. Mind you, they open at 2pm & I arrived at 4:30pm to find out that they are only seating reserved tables & that I could only place a to-go order. As I proceeded to place my to-go order the hostess then let me know it would be a 1hour wait for the food. Horrible customer service & unprofessional. Y'all gotta do better"
8/22/2021,1 star rating,"What a waste  of time and money! This place takes reservations only, which is not stated on Yelp or their website. I get to the restaurant at 1:30pm and it's empty. I ask if it's open and the young lady says yes for takeout, WTF? I ask can I order and sit as another young lady was setting up the tables, she asks do you have a reservation and if so they don't start service until 2pm, this info is not on Yelp or their website! So, I've caught a cab all the way here to support this business and I can't even eat in the building... What made it worse was the young lady showed no sympathy, and was like oh well that's your problem! Maybe they cater to locals. Please update your website and Yelp to inform those of us whom don't know your business practice, it would go a long way!!"

Solid place to check and support, but nothing to rave about."

We walk in and it was pretty empty. Only about 3-4 tables were taken. The hostess with a very bad attitude asked us if we're placing an order. We told her we have a reservation and she like ""you have to wait until 3:45. Huh??? Half the place is empty. Then, who seemed to be the manager, comes over to tell us as well that we have to wait until our reservation time. So we had to wait outside in 90 degree heat and wait. While waiting 20 minutes, we watched 3 of the tables leave. So we asked again around 3:30 if we could be seated and he tells us that we still have to wait. INSANE!!!! So in 15 minutes your expecting to fill up the place before seating us? He tells us that it would be unfair and people would be upset if they came and we were seated first. WHAT??? IT'S EMPTY. Then proceeded to tell us that ""rules are rules"". Lol. That's when we walked down the street and went to McDonalds. They lost $150-200 because I'm not spending my money in an establishment that obviously does not know how to treat customers. RIDICULOUS!!!"
6/21/2021,1 star rating,"To the point: black businesses don't expect to be supported justBecause you are black owned. Waiting an extra 45 after being told 1 hour is ridiculous, are you guys doing your own fishing! Waited 1 45 minutes food is too salty, over salting doesn't mean tasty. It was not edible, just too much salt. Drove 20 min for pickup but didn't feel like driving back for an exchange. I believe the entree would have been tasty if it were not so salty. I'm willing to try one more time, ( when I have no additional plans)dine in of course so I can be specific about telling them to ease up on the sodium. Would suggest going during the week before 6pm."
8/25/2018,5 star rating,"Judging solely on food and service, I was between four and five stars, but Soule is such a great value that I had to go with five.As others have noted, it is a small restaurant so I wouldn't come with a group larger than four.  I came with one other person on Friday night around 7:30pm and we waited about 10 minutes.We started with the Soule punch (it's kool-aid-like) and the lemonade, which was confirmed as fresh squeezed.  The punch was fine though I didn't love it; I may have just outgrown kool-aid, lol.One of the more senior staff let us know that they are in the process of training new servers and asked for our patience.  I really appreciated that head's up so we could set appropriate expectations.  The newbies were sweet, but you could see the inexperience.  We ordered jerk wings that didn't make it out until just after our entrees, but they were very apologetic and removed the wings from our bill.  The owner also came by later to apologize again and to check in on everything; the personal touch is so appreciated.So, the fried chicken was just as juicy and flavorful as you'd want it.  I don't normally like catfish, but Soule's was delicious.  The greens were my favorite side followed by the mac and cheese, both were excellent.  The dirty rice was pretty good, though I didn't really care for the chicken spaghetti.  My friend loved it, so I guess it's just a personal preference.Last night's cake was chocolate but I was too full so I brought it home.  It was perfect: not too sweet, not too much frosting.  Though I was too full for my dessert, I made room to have several spoons of my friend's banana pudding and it was also excellent.Here's the thing: all of that food with tax and a 20% tip was less than $25 per person.  What?!?  Do yourself a favor and go!"
11/20/2018,4 star rating,"Really really really really good food! Unassuming entrance with taste bud excitement behind the door. Quite welcoming environment. Our wait staff was wonderful!So the food is delicious! I started with an Arnold Palmer. It's was perfect--the proper amount of tea and lemonade. Since I eat ""clean"" the grilled lamb chops were a no-brainer! I had it with sweet potatoes and greens with turkey. Them greens 'tho...  It was a great balance. And the finale, peach cobbler! Not too sweet, not too tart. Just right!Thanks Soule for the excellent dining experience!"
9/13/2021,5 star rating,"My friend and I lunch yesterday. We ordered fried tomato's which were excellent. The jerk chicken was outstanding! For entrees we ordered lollipop lamb chops, fried catfish and fried chicken.  Sides included Mack&cheese and greens. The entire meal was enjoyable. The appetizer was their double chocolate cake. Finally Robert, our server or owner was personable and professional. He made sure the environment was pleasant while adhering to Covid19 rules. We will return."
3/2/2021,3 star rating,Decided this year I wanted to support black owned restaurants for my birthday this year. Ask a few people for suggestions and Soule came up. Reservations was for 5:30. My party all together was 12. We were on time and seated by 5:32. Our 90 minutes began at 5:30. However they didn't allow us to sit because we were waiting on my daughter to get out her car. Any-who place our order by 5:45. Food took way to long to come out. By 6:40 our waitress comes over with my meal apologizing that they were waiting on mash potatoes. 6:55 the bill comes. 6:59 a guy comes over and say's we have to leave. Mind you were still waiting on 4 Togo meals that we placed with our initial meal. Overall the food was great. However they can improve on getting the food out a little bit faster. Didn't know it took 1 hour to cook Salmon and Potatoes.
10/19/2019,4 star rating,"Unimpressed!! I was very disappointed after finally having made my way there. Not sure if it was a bad day for the cook, but my food was simply not good.  It was bland period. The Mac and cheese was not hot, had no flavor and the fish seemed as if it had been cooked earlier and sat under a heating lamp. Which I'm sure it had because within a good 4 to 5 minutes the waitress was at my table with my order.  I thought it was just me, but my friend had the same experience with her food. Loved the decor and the staff was nice and attentive. My waitress was great. I hate giving these type of fee, but l must provide true reviews of my experiences. I know GOOD soul food, and this ain't it!!! Update: Well l guess 2nd time around was a charm!  I recently invited back to the establishment this past Thursday for dinner, and l must say l wasImpressed. I had the blackened catfish with dirty rice, and a side of greens. Everything, l mean everything was delicious. This was the good soul food I was expecting and looking for during my 1st visit."

8/24/2021,1 star rating,They take too long. Don't go here if you're super hungry and expect service right away. Food wasn't even warm. I ordered and waited 30 min and called and said it's about 15 more min. I come back in 15 and they told me they never put my order in and it's gonna be another 20 min. Honestly just terrible
7/2/2018,5 star rating,"I have been DYYYYIIINNNGGG to come here! But the business hours were the issue. Everytime I wanted to come in they were closed. Finally on Saturday we went at 3pm their opening time to beat the crowd, soon as we were seated the other patrons started pouring in. We were warmly greeted. Seating is wherever you'd like. They're also BYOB w/a corking fee of $10.00. We ordered various items. Me being miss piggy ordered the lamb chops dinner med rare chops & fried chicken dinner. Sides were dirty rice, chicken spaghetti, greens, & yams. My friend ordered a catfish filet dinner. It took our food only about 15mins to arrive. Upon arrival I noticed that my chops were baby lamb chops like lollipop chops and they were well done, I advised the server and he apologized saying they're prebaked, then grilled. Nobueono sir!!!! That's the only negative about the place. I got the jerk shrimp app to replace the lamb chops. The fried chicken was delicious. The yams, & greens were great. Dirty rice tasted premade and not good. Chicken spaghetti had cheese in it which I don't like cheese. Our service was very pleasant and I'd go back. The vibe of the restaurant was nice. Great music playing. And did I mention BYOB!!!!!!"
8/11/2021,2 star rating,Soule has always struggled with wait times and completing orders since the day they opened. Waited almost 3 hours for an uber eats order only to have it cancelled because they ran out of items and could not handle volume. Our driver also told us there was 13 ppl waiting for orders at 9:00pm which is the time they close. Just because they are black owned does not mean we have to support terrible customer service this always seems to be an issue with black owned soul food restaurants. After years of business Soule continuously misses the mark on customer service and wait times. Learn from your peers who don't have these issues!!!!!
7/1/2020,3 star rating,"I was really excited to try Soulé and support a Black-owned business. The good here is their food. We ordered the fried chicken with green beans and mac and cheese, the shrimp and grits and banana pudding for dessert. Everything was tasty, but the banana pudding in particular is definitely not to be missed!!!However, like some of the other reviews, there needs to be an improvement with customer service here. My interaction over the phone when placing my order was unpleasant. The woman who I spoke to sounded extremely annoyed (I don't know if she was having a bad day or what). I told her I wanted to put my order in so it would be ready at the time I'd get there by since I don't live nearby. She told me it would take 35 minutes, and I told her that was great because I lived 25 minutes away, so I put in my order. I was happy to wait for a bit upon arrival if that meant my food would stay hot. They were out of two things I wanted to order (buffalo chicken salad and fried green tomatoes) which was disappointing, but I get it. On my way to pick up the food, I got a text 15 minutes after I called saying my food was ready - 20 minutes before they said it would be. When I got there to pick it up, I opened the door to walk in only to be told to wait outside. Everything was handled outside, which was fine, but I think it would be helpful to have a sign on the door that said that so it's less confusing for the customer. Unfortunately, my food was pretty cold by the time I got home which I feel like could have been avoided if they had waited to put my order in if they knew it was only going to take 15 minutes. Hopefully, the staff at Soulé can make some improvements because this restaurant has a lot of potential!"
8/3/2020,3 star rating,"I visited the restaurant on July 22nd with a friend and wanted to suggest a few things regarding customer service. I understand that with Covid, business hours and management has changed, but we waited an hour and a half for our food. We thought that was extremely too long after being told by an employee the wait would only be 20-30 minutes long. I think it would be great if you all notified your customers of a wait that will take longer than 20-30 minutes on:1) Yelpor2) Online platforms (social media pages and restaurant website)Other than that, the food was delicious! I would love to visit again.."
1/3/2021,5 star rating,Even this the spot is super small the food is GREAT! The chicken is so crispy and seasoned. The Mac and cheese AMAZING! And lord the green beans man So good! Whenever you're in Chicago you should definitely go there ...the staff was great and super nice.
7/7/2019,4 star rating,"Terrible wait times. My husband and I were told 10 min wait for our to go order @640. @720 we were told our food was being boxed up. @745 the manager handed us bags with the wrong food in it. The manager blew us off stating ""We will fix it"" yet didn't seem apologetic. The owner came out and was super nice and apologetic, she stated she would fix our orders, which she did. The manager needs to go. He is rude.The owner was gracious enough to refund our money AND correct our order. THIS CATFISH HONEY.... It was worth the wait. The blackened catfish and shrimp was seasoned to perfection. Love that they do not use beef or pork products. The dirty rice was delicious, with the right amount of spice. I will definitely be back!! I need to try the fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, and a few other items."

11/4/2020,5 star rating,"My family spend a total of 7 days in Chicago and this was by far the best food we ate all week. It was so good that we went back the following day for more. Between 5 people, we literally tried the whole menu, except the salad or crab legs. The lamb was bomb...That sauce was everything! The catfish Po'Boy was amazing; my husband is from Louisiana and is a hard judge, but he loved it. Their fried chicken was juicy and flavorful and so were all the sides. The only improvement I'd say is I paid for extra shrimp (I believe $10 for 5) and my meal only had 8. My jerk shrimp only had 5 shrimps on a lettuce leaf as well. Other than that, I have no complaints. I'd still order the shrimp meals because of the flavors."
7/21/2021,2 star rating,"1-1.5 hours is already too long to have to wait for an online order, but to make me wait an extra 30 after that is just ridiculous. I don't even want the food anymore. Do better."
6/2/2019,5 star rating,"I'm a stickler for great customer service and the moment I walked into Soulé it felt like walking into my mother's kitchen. I was greeted by the hostess Tori who was friendly,upbeat and inviting. In comparison to some of the reviews I got lucky and scored a seat with no wait time on a Sunday evening. I ordered the Catfish, and for the sides I ordered the greens,macaroni and yams. The wait time wasn't long and the anticipation overwhelmed me as I sat and watched others dine. One bite into the catfish and I was hooked. The catfish has the perfect seasoning and breading and the greens for a second I thought my mother may have been in the kitchen. I like the fact that the place is small and intimate but I can see them growing out if this location soon in the near future due to the high demand. I wasn't able to finish all of my food so took the leftovers home and found myself in the kitchen at 4am warming up left overs. All in all great customer service, great food and great atmosphere. My only issue was the music being too loud for it to be a restaurant. Other than that keep doing what ya doing!Side note: As I type this review I am eating the catfish dinner with 3 sides from a local competitor ""Chicago Waffles"" located on Madison and chile they could NEVERRRRRRR make their food taste this good. If you want good Soul food, head over to Soulé so that you won't be disappointed."
1/18/2021,1 star rating,"My niece picked up our dinner on Friday. I was very dissappointed with the food. I had read so many reviews about Soule. I ordered the shrimp and grits;   the grits were grainy and tasteless. The five tiny shrimp was tasteless. My other meal included too sweet and spicy greens, bland fried catfish and mac & cheese that taste like someone had used the instant box version.  I was so disappointed and hungry. That was my first and last time ordering takeout at Soule Restaurant on west Chicago Ave. I don't know what the hipe was all about."

11/13/2020,1 star rating,This is extremely disappointing. I don't want to hear a thing about supporting black businesses. Especially when they continually failing with customer respect and service. I'm writing this after several attempts to contact this business for food. I've called now 11 times in a span of 45 mins and have yet to have my phone calls answered. This is not the first time they have done this either. This has been ongoing for the past 4 months with no improvement after discussing with management several times about this. The food is great but the availability and customer service terrible. Conclusion: don't go here stay home and make your own food.These  people don't haven't have the decency to put there hours of operation on the voicemail either when they are closed. Imagine driving  for 20 mins after seeing that they are open only to find out there are closed when you arrive. You have one website saying they close at 9pm and another saying 7pm. They could of put his info on the voicemail.  Sheesh
6/21/2020,3 star rating,"I want to start off by saying I have only experienced Soule one time prior to today and the food was excellent. Everyone enjoyed our order, so much so that we made plans to make the 35-minute trek a second time the following week. The second and third attempts (Saturday and Sunday) were unsuccessful as we were unable to get through to anyone on Saturday. Sunday, I finally got through but was asked to call back in 20 minutes. After an hour of constantly calling back to no avail, just busy signals, I gave up and decided to give it another try the following weekend. For the record, I was disappointed I was not able to get the deliciousness I was so looking forward to but also understanding. A busy phone line means business is booming and I really want the restaurant to do well. Fast forward to today. I began calling at 1pm and was able to get through within five or so minutes. Placed my order. Asked if they had cornbread as a side. The young lady on the other end informed me that the cost for cornbread is $1 per order. I happily ordered four. Fast forward to unpackaging my food and tasting. 1) The fish was as amazing as the first time I had it 2) The greens absolutely delicious3) Sweet potatoes not as good as the first time4) Macaroni was not as good as the first time5) Spaghetti was just that. Spaghetti. Not ONE piece of chicken to be found6) Cornbread. I would have laughed but for the fact I paid $4 dollars for the miniature sized pieces. UNREAL. I literally placed a Ritz cracker on top of the overcooked cornbread piece to illustrate the size. While in route to the restaurant a young lady phoned me to say they did not have cornbread after all. I arrived to find the charge on the bill and was told they did have the cornbread. Ok, fine. In retrospect this makes me wonder if the orders I received were actual serving sizes. I highly doubt it. Extremely disappointed. I purchased six additional sides including two orders of chicken spaghetti. I truly hope I am not disappointed with them. I'm not tripping on the $80 plus bucks I spent on the meal, nor do I expect anything more than someone who spends $18. Chicken spaghetti with no chicken (again, I have two additional sides and I'm hoping the first order was a fluke). If cornbread is a dollar, I do expect a serving that cannot be covered by a Ritz cracker. Note, the photos actually make the cornbread appear larger than the actual size."
3/5/2019,4 star rating,"Great food! Very small space~ be prepared to wait!!! No reservations accepted Friday through Sunday. Good service. However, the music was entirely too loud for such a small space. If you're seated by the door, know that waiting guests will be hovering over you while eating! However, those same people blocked the cold draft that came in each time the door opened! Lol I'm sure this spot will be expanding soon."

12/7/2017,4 star rating,"I would give a 3.5 for the food, a 3 for the service and a 4 for the experience. I love how they take sould food to another level with the presentation, but what is lacking is the flavor. The food would go to the next level if they would use just a little more seasoning especially in the fried chicken.The service can use some work! You're constantly reminding the staff to bring you condiments, napkins, silverware, etc. For some odd reason our fried green tomatoes appetizer took forever, but they were delicious and would have been over the top with some type of remoulade sauce. There is a $10 cork fee that's not listed on the menu, but she was nice enough to mention it before we popped the cork.I give a 4 for the experience because the music was off the chain and and was singin and dancing while I was eating lol! The space is a little tight and it's hard to squeeze in a party bigger than four. I have a family of five but not sure if we would be able to be seated without being squished by the patrons sitting next to us.The people were sexy and the vibe was just right. My husband said I made a good choice and he definitely would like to return again."

7/23/2019,4 star rating,"This place is a must try!!!! 4 stars because the service is blah. If I could separate service and food then service would be 2 stars and food would be 10 stars!!!! I came on a Tuesday right after work around 5:15p. Was immediately seated. Then a employee (I'm gonna guess it was just a bus girl and not a server) brought me a water. I told her I was ready to order and she said okay & that she'd go get my server. About 8 minutes later I still didn't have a server so I flagged another girl down and told her I didn't have a server yet & I was ready to order. She goes to the back and I guess tried to look for whoever was supposed to be my server, couldn't find anyone else so she decided to come back and take my order (she could have just done that from the get go but I digress). The food came surprisingly fast & It was absolutely delicious! The catfish was lightly fried just like I like it and I've actually never had chicken spaghetti before but it's now one of my favs. The greens were very good as well, but they were almost swimming in juice which I could have done without but still BOMB either way. I also wanted to try the banana pudding but they were out . All in all if you're looking for good service this isn't the place for you but if you want some delicious soul food, you've found it!"
2/16/2019,3 star rating,"Would you have given 5 stars overall  if not for the excessive wait and lackluster customer service. Food however, I'd give 5 stars all day, however two stars taken for service. First, the wait time was quoted at 45 minutes which was acceptable. However, we ended up waiting about an hour and 15 minutes which was unacceptable. Then, they sat a party that came and checked in on the list after we did a few minutes before us. Our server Tyannah, a young girl was ok. The restaurant itself is small with about 9 or 10 tables. This was our first time visiting Chicago and found this place on Yelp. I'd definitely recommend going as the food is good. Prices reasonable. Just maybe go on a weekday when not so busy."
5/23/2021,1 star rating,"Unfortunately I have to give this place only one star simply because of the manner we were greeted in upon walking in. First off, we were trying to call ahead to place a take out order and could never get through because the line kept saying it was busy and to try back later so we continued to drive over while calling every few minutes with no luck. Once we arrived and walked in the girl at the door told us they were only taking reservations and we told her we had been trying to call and the phone is busy and it seemed as though she could care less about anything we said because they were only taking reservations. My gripe here is this, in this day and age of technology and considering coming out of pandemic restrictions why why why would you not put this info of limitations to reservations only until a certain hour or whatnot or answer the damn phone instead of having customers drive the distance to find out they can't even dine in or order for take out??? The girl had no personality and didn't apologize for not being able to seat us nor did she encourage us to come back another time. Nope. Strictly just said they were only taking reservations and showed us to the door. We were looking forward to trying a new place because of the good reviews but after the treatment we received we most likely will never go back. I just wanted to share my negative experience about this place just walking in the door. I sincerely hope the staff will greet their customers with appreciation of going to that establishment while there are so many others to choose from in this great city."
11/1/2020,2 star rating,"First, when I called to place an order, they asked me if I could call back later, because they had too many orders. I had to call several times to even get through. But when I went in to pick up, the phone was ringing and ringing, and the guy was sitting right next to it, NOT answering it.The catfish was cooked well, but needed more seasoning. I've had much better catfish from many places. The sweet potatoes were nothing special, I did not taste any distinct seasonings and they needed more sweetness. The Mac & Cheese was good.My friend got the salmon and he said the portion size seemed smaller than when he had ordered it for dine in before. It definitely didn't look like a $24 meal to me. He said it still tasted good though.Then we ordered two peach cobblers. I was shocked when I opened the containers and saw that both were only half full. It looked as though they took one full order of peach cobbler and divided it into two containers, and the containers aren't even that big. To make it worse, they didn't give us any ice cream, despite the menu saying that the peach cobbler is served with ice cream. If they're not doing ice cream for carry out or whatever the case is, they definitely don't need to be charging $7.00 for that, especially when the container was only half full???!!! The peach cobbler was good though, I was just disappointed in the price for the portion size we were given, and the lack of ice cream.Overall, based on this being my first experience, I don't think I would come back here. I don't feel like we got our money's worth at all for the $75 we spent. Nothing about my meal blew me away. The best parts were the Mac & cheese and the peach cobbler, that's why I'm giving two stars. But I've had much better soul food from multiple places and for a fraction of this price, so I can't justify spending $75 here."
12/16/2018,4 star rating,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for Soule.  There were some really good points, but some items they need to work on that deterred from the experience.We got there early on Saturday night b/c they do not take reservations and it's a small place.  We had a 20 minute wait but that wasn't bad in our eyes.We started with the Jerk Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  We really enjoyed both dishes.  The jerk spice definitely had some kick and I really enjoyed the sauce with the tomatoes.  We almost got the wings, but a table down from us got them and they were covered with sauce.For entrees, we got the shrimp and grits and the fried chicken w/ mac and cheese and chicken spaghetti.  The shrimp and grits was quite good and the sauce with the grits was outstanding.  Very flavorable.  The chicken was also good - hot and moist.  Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty good.  And the bad - were the sides.  The mac and cheese was cold.  Not lukewarm, but downright cold.  Extremely disappointing.  I can't tell you how tired I am of getting food that is not hot.  The chicken spaghetti was lukewarm and while I liked the combination of ingredients (picture chicken tetrazzini), it was extremely rich and creamy.  Even if it had been hot, I'm not sure I could do more than a few bites.If I lived in the area, I would go back.  But I'm not sure it's worth the drive for the few great shrimp dishes."
1/23/2019,5 star rating,"Rob our server walked up to the table & said "" everything is good "" ... he was not lying! When i tell you this place is IT! AND it's BYOB!(10$ table fee) Good Food & Good Drink... Scratch that GREAT FOOD & Good Drink. DO NO SLEEP ON THIS PLACE! IT AINT NUMBER ONE FOR NO REASON!"
7/1/2021,2 star rating,"What a disappointment.  They describe themselves on their menu as ""boutique."" Hardly. My wife and I waited 35 minutes for food.  They did not have the fried green tomatoes on their menu or even the salad. The eating utensils were the cheapest, flimsiest plastic you can find (the knife couldn't even cut the chicken).  In this BYOB resto, I paid $10 for wine corkage, but had to open the bottle myself (some boutique).  Finally the food arrived.  Two of the three pieces of fried chicken, though tasty enough, had soggy crust.  The blackening spices on the catfish lacked any zip.  Mac 'n' cheese was okay. On the positive side, the greens were very good.  Prices are quite reasonable.  Our waiter, though harried, was courteous and attentive.  Overall, there are certainly better Southern/soul food restaurants in the city."
10/5/2019,2 star rating,"The ambience is nice; VERY NICE! It's small, but I like small and cozy places. The food was good; basic, but good. I had the Shrimp and Grits, which was a hearty serving. We weren't seated until   8:45ish on a Saturday night, and by this time many of the items were gone. My brothers wanted the wings and my Mom the blackened catfish, both were completely out. I suggest heading there earlier if you want them. The Soulé punch is terrible. It literally tastes like Fruit Punch Koolaid with a dash of lemon. NOT worth $3.50. The server was awesome. A 3.5 for the food and service (mainly service).However, the ONLY thing that is bothersome is the egregious gratuity charge. It was about 15% of our tab, which is fine; However, you're then expected to pay a tip (15-20%) on top of that (tip includes gratuity charge). When we asked one server, she said the gratuity and tip were separate. I'm sure it isn't and asked another server that said it was the same. She went to go clarify with a third person that said the gratuity is a ""service charge"", and not the tip. I think there needs to be some clarification on this because it feels like the restaurant is trying to get additional money. (FYI: NYC got in big trouble for this.) This def brought their rating down to a 2."

We had the honey fried chicken and salmon pasta both delicious. They don't have alcohol would recommend bringing your own bottle of wine!!! banana pudding also a must. Please go here !!!!!"
9/3/2018,5 star rating,"I tried this place with a group of friends and LOST MY MIND! I ended up ordering damn near every item on the menu (Face Palm). That's what happens when my taste buds hold my wallet hostage. I figured I'd try everything so I could leave a more detailed yelp review. Fried Chicken: Incredible!!!Let's start with the real star of the show, the Fried Chicken. Man! This was some good bomb ass fried chicken! It's chicken like this that makes me wonder how anyone ever eats at KFC (Yuck!). This place knows the secret to frying chicken. From the taste of it I can tell they have a sophisticated brining process. You just don't get meat as flavored and juicy throughout without it. Fried Green Tomatoes: Damned Delicious!!!I haven't had fried green tomatoes like this since that trip to Mississippi back in 2005. Crispy on the outside, yet warm and supple on the inside. They know how to fry a tomato at Soule. New Orleans BBQ Shrimp: Very Good!They seasoned the grilled shrimp perfectly, with just the right amount of spice to add a touch of heat without making you sweat.Jerk BBQ Wingz: Very Good!Now the Jerk BBQ wings aren't for the faint of heart. I love some good heat on my food. I've had the jerk chicken in Jamaica.... and this isn't that. But it's excellent by Chicago standards!Salmon w/Shrimp: Very Good!While the Fried Chicken was my favorite dish, this was tasty too. I enjoyed the bites of it that I had. My friends really enjoyed it. I was so full from the chicken I couldn't eat too much of it.Shrimp & Grits: SolidI wasn't the biggest fan of their shrimp and grits. A little too soupy for my tastes. It wasn't bad, just not as great as everything else. Sides (Mac n' Cheese / Greens / Yams / Dirty Rice): All of the sides were excellent. The Mac N' Cheese was that good southern mac n' cheese full of actual goey cheese deliciousness. The Greens were HITTIN! The yams were sweet and prepared perfectly as well. I enjoyed the dirty rice, granted it wasn't New Orleans dirty rice, but it was solid. (Pro Tip: If you're stuck trying to make a choice, grab the mac n' cheese and yams!). Only complaint I have was the wait time was slow. So this isn't the place for you if you're in a rush. If they can get the food out faster this place will become a Chicago institution before long!!! (Pro Tip: it's BYOB so bring your own drink!)."
8/13/2020,2 star rating,"I have been really excited to try Soule! I attempted many times prepandemic but the wait was always excessive so I figured the food must be amazing! I had been stalking Uber eats to find a time when it was actually available to order (they often turn it off when they are busy which is more often than not). I was so excited when I was able to order the salmon, Mac and cheese and yams but I am soooooo disappointed. The salmon was so salty that it was inedible and I had two shrimp included. The yams were ok but we got more syrup that actual yams and the portion of Mac and cheese was a forth of the container (4 bites max). I'm not sure if this was an off day for them but it was horrible!"
6/13/2021,1 star rating,Placed an order online came time it said would be ready then was told it would be two hours online not accurate they are so unprofessional it's ridiculous need more staff
9/13/2018,4 star rating,"The one bad thing I would say about this place is the wait, very long wait and at the end of the night (about 8:20, they close at 9) they ran out of the catfish, jerk wings, and pasta. So that was extremely disappointing. However, we received our New Orleans BBQ shrimp and we almost licked the plate. It was heavy garlic but absolutely amazing! Because there with few options left, we both got the fried chicken and it was good. The chicken was very fresh, hot out the grease. The mac and cheese was average, but the sweet potatoes were spot on!"
8/22/2019,3 star rating,"Been dying to try this place for awhile and went on a Saturday as soon as they opened. I wanted to dine in but after seeing the size of the restaurant and the seating arrangements, I knew it was no place for my toddler. It's pretty small inside so I can imagine the wait time gets pretty crazy during the busy hours. My family and I got a few dishes, see review below: Fried chicken- seasoned and fried to perfection. White meat wasn't dry.Jerk bbq wings- spicy but flavorful. Not for the weak tastebuds lol my chicken was over cooked- very crispy and toughLamb- the flavor was GREAT. But unfortunately mine were far over cooked. I believe they sell them well done but mine were so tough that it was hard to enjoy. I've seen photos of other customers who had a gravy and moist lamb, so maybe I caught them on a bad day.Greens- flavorful but salty Mac n cheese- great taste Candied yams- great flavor and cooked to perfectionOverall I enjoyed my meal and I will return and try the lamb again- maybe try eating in."
6/7/2020,1 star rating,"I make it a point to support Black owned businesses and was excited when this one opened. The food is good, well-seasoned, nice portions. The size of the restaurant is very small, but intimate and cute. My issue with Sole is that the quality has gone down since it's opening. Some issues I've experienced; current specials posted  on social media aren't accepted when you call your order in or go to place it in person, very long wait times, out of dishes advertised, horrible customer service, not being able to get through the phone or Uber Eats to place an order. Today, I experienced my last negative experience here for the last time."
1/1/2020,5 star rating,"Soule has got it right. As a southern guy, this is what I expect from a soul food joint. The decor is boutique style, small and intimate. There is a 90 min limit on eating which you won't need to eat all of your food. I had the fried fish. Very good. The Mac was okay but I never think Mac and cheese is the bomb. Her yams are ON POINT. Surprised they don't have cornbread (if reading this, make cornbread PLEASE!). All in all, this will be my go to when I don't feel like making soul food at home. Come. You won't be disappointed."

1/11/2019,5 star rating,"Simply put, amazing food! The seasoning is just right, so much flavor exploding in your mouth in every juicy bite! You might have to wait a little bit, but we'll worth the wait! My suggestion would be to get there before the crowd arrives when they first open. Otherwise there will be about an hour wait as the restaurant only seats about 30 (?). We ordered lamb chops and the salmon w/ shrimp. Side we ordered the chicken spaghetti, Mac n cheese, asparagus, and greens. I normally don't order lamb chops as it's too gamey for me, but Soule's was seasoned so well that I didn't taste the game at all. They were juicy, just the right amount of fatty, and very tender. Definitely order! The salmon w/ shrimp was also amazing. The cream sauce was creamy and complemented the salmon well. I love seafood and try to order it everywhere. Generous portion of salmon and large shrimps. Recommend! Sides were also tasty. Best was the chicken spaghetti! Greens were a little salty but I think it was just a miscalculation of seasoning. Try this spot before the whole city finds out about it!"
9/8/2019,5 star rating,We had an excellent experience here. The serving sizes were ample and the food was delicious. The seasonings were amazing. The Soule' punch was awesome. We shared the banana pudding for dessert and I wanted another one to go. We will definitely return.
8/10/2020,2 star rating,"First time trying here, great food for the price the portion size can be better, ordered blakened catfish and shrimp, i only got 2 small shrimp, other places I tried would of at least gave more shrimp or they could of at least been jumbo, the banana pudding had a horrible after taste and it came in a little tiny cup worth $5 this pudding is worth at least $3 I had better pudding at better places worth the money and price. Overall place was good but again portion sizes can be better for the price."
8/30/2018,5 star rating,"Here's the only bad thing I can say about Soule--that Soule Punch, the Kool-Aid with what tasted like extra, extra sugar?  Three of the four people in my group didn't even get past the second sip without adding a bunch of ice.Everything else here was solid.  We tried the shrimp & grits, the fried chicken (dark and white) and the fried catfish.  All of the entrees were great, and that chicken was served HOT.  The fry on the chicken was perfect for me and the chicken went down fast.  The grits in the shrimp bowl were maybe my favorite thing of the whole night, and that catfish was something else (another thing I need to let my dad try the next time he is in town).The sides were mostly great as well, starting with the chicken spaghetti, which I had never tried before.  We also tried the dirty rice, the mac and cheese, the green beans, the creamed corn, sweet potatoes, the greens and the asparagus.  The asparagus was the weak link at our meal, and half of us thought the greens were a bit too salty.  Everything else worked, but again, the chicken spaghetti was the winner on the sides front.Soule doesn't take reservations, so as a parent who had a sitter the night of my dinner, places that don't let me plan are hard to visit regularly.  But the space and the service were great, and the value prop for the amount of food you get (especially if you get heavier sides like the pasta or the creamed corn) is excellent.  Soul food in my hood!  I'll be sure to pass the word..."
11/24/2018,5 star rating,When I say I cried when I took the first bite of my catfish I mean it. This is by far the best restaurant for soul food I've ever eaten at. The flavors are exceptional and the service and music really set the mood. They have hotsauce in fancy containers on the tables. I'm truly in black heaven.
7/18/2019,5 star rating,"This place is the truth.Wife and I went here for date night. We eat early, so the usual issue with this place, of it being small and not being able to seat as many people who want to eat there, wasn't in play. BUT, we ordered some goodness. My wife had the salmon and shrimp, which comes in a. delicious corn-based sauce/crema and was a significant portion. The side of Mac and cheese was pretty good, too.I had the catfish, and it was tasty. I had the dirty rice (which surprised me with its kick) and the greens (COLLARDS, PEOPLE. LAWD). The Soule Punch is damned good Kool-Aid. Get that.So good.Good food is a great way to forgive other sins. And this food is damned good."
11/25/2019,5 star rating,"Need recipe for jerk shrimp!! My mouth is literally watering thinking about the jerk shrimp from last month. They were out of the jerk wings so I went jerk shrimp, the chk spaghetti helped with the heat and those greens, I'm in heaven. Atmosphere was adorable, sense of urgency was non existent especially on the host side of things(college ruled notebook, no rsvp  sat/sun) but the food itself was worth it, greens a little salty but that's just my preference. Would come again!"
6/12/2020,5 star rating,"I got takeout from here tonight and it was delicious! I would definitely order from here again. I ordered the fried chicken platter which came with two sides and a bottle of sweet tea. The chicken (you can choose if you would like dark or white meat) was tender and juicy. I loved the flavoring of the breading -- perfectly crispy without being too heavy. The Mac and cheese was thick and seasoned nicely with some extra spices without giving it too much of a kick. The sweet potatoes were so sweet, candied and seasoned with some cinnamon on top. The sweet tea was extremely sweet as well but makes for a refreshing drink and complements the food nicely. Great meal! Thank you!"
9/16/2020,4 star rating,"The food is damn good. Damn good. Did I say good? Yes, it's delicious.

12/10/2019,1 star rating,Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday after we saw it on Chicago Black Ink. Perhaps they should cancel the BYOB. This place is already tiny. The drunken tables around us were full of cheap liqour yelling & loud. Im sitting at our table now writing this review & it sounds like a high school lunch room. My head hurts. Now to the food: dont get the chicken spaghetti. The greens & mac n cheese were great. I love fried green tomatoes. Jerk barbq wings were blah. We left here needing a drink. A strong drink of TOP SHELF.  We shoulda just went back to The Licking. oh yea the Soule Punch was probably the best thing about here.

The young lady who was hosting tonight was on point, I even heard her tell guests who were debating about waiting ""It's Worth The Wait"". She was not lying, it's a BYOB restaurant with a reasonable cork fee. My husband and I had the fried green tomato appetizer, I had the blackened catfish with shrimp and dirty rice for my side. My husband had the lamb chops with Mac n cheese and greens. ""Amazing"" is the only work that comes to mind, we only waited for our food maybe 15 min tops, and it was piping hot. For dessert we had the peach cobbler and vanilla ice cream OMG!!!!! Was my grandmother in the kitchen? We are regulars from now on, even with it being our First time.The Daggett's"

7/11/2019,4 star rating,"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent concept. We started out with the fried green tomatoes and jerk shrimp. The tomatoes were excellent with the right amount of coating. The shrimp were o.k. The jerk sauce was nothing special. The  catfish was quite tasty and cooked to perfection. The sides were exceptional. I had the creamed corn and the Mac and Cheese. Both were bursting with flavor. My Wife had the greens and sweet potatoes. The greens to me were a little salty but flavorful. The dining area was small, but being that it was during the week the wait wasn't long. I also enjoyed that they employed young people who show great professionalism. Over all an excellent dining experience."

6/15/2019,1 star rating,Bad service.We made  reservations and when we got there the same girl who took our reservation told us they didn't have any seats. Mind you I have to place was empty what reserved seating signs on tables. We took a Uber across town to try Soule restaurant. And my girl was like well I'll see if I can put you on my list. Then she walked away It was the last time I saw her we waited 15 minutes before we realized she ain't coming back. I wish I could tell you how the food taste but when I looked at their plates portions were small so
5/26/2019,2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place and add it to my list of restaurants to frequent, but I doubt I'll go back again. I try not to be that person that comes up with cliche excuses about why they don't support black businesses, but after tonight I understand. I will still support them, but we truly need to do better. There was a wait, which I had already anticipated. The young lady at the door told us how long it would be, put us on the list and told us she would call when ready. Which she did. We were around the corner in the car waiting and we come back and the table still wasn't ready *blank stare*. So we take a seat in the back and wait for them to get the table ready. We're seated and the guy did come and take our orders in a timely fashion. It went downhill from there though. We didn't receive our appetizer. He never came back and checked up on us. The young lady clearing the tables was more attentive than he was. He finally comes back over and my fiancé tells him we didn't receive the appetizer. No concern on his part. Just ask if we still wanted it or to take it off the bill. Fiancé tells him to take it off the bill. So we finish eating and we're sitting there twiddling our thumbs literally while he's walking around oblivious to the fact there are patrons that need tending to. Finally get his attention for the bill. He brings it back and of course he hasn't taken the appetizer off the bill. So now we have to try to get his attention again to make the correction. There was no apology or anything. His whole demeanor was as if we were inconveniencing him by being there. We were there so long we were late to our next destination and not able to get in. So yeah also take that in to consideration. Don't come here if you're on time constraints because there's no sense of timeliness and urgency. The food was good, but not worth dealing with the bad customer service. Businesses of any color need to learn this will make or break them."

Well, we dined in and it still took 50 minutes for our food to come out(I still never got a straw)The salt container on table was empty. My food got cold while waiting 6 min for her to refill the salt container instead of just bringing out a new one.The inside only has 8 tables for 2 that are all too close to each other.

1/16/2020,5 star rating,Salmon shrimp. Soule punch. Best combo in and on Chicago. Would recommend going here going here if you crave authentic southern comfort food. Would not recommend making any big plans (especially that involve walking) after eating here.
1/5/2020,4 star rating,"The food was delicious! Everything came out seasoned well and on point. Plus the staff was really great.The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars is the amount of time that we waited. We waited 1 hr 20 mins to be seated. We were initially told the wait was 1 hr. We then waited another hr from the time we ordered until the food was served. If this place can figure out logistically how to get people in and out quickly, it would be awesome!"
1/5/2020,4 star rating,The restaurant has tasty lamb chops and chicken spaghetti. The wait was a little long but worth it. I really enjoyed the background music playing.... old school RnB. Loved it. The next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely visit this restaurant
1/5/2020,5 star rating,"So I went here last night, Saturday, I had the best time. Aside from the wait, which was expected because it's a small boutique type of restaurant, It was better than I expected. With every bite I was dancing in my seat. We did a few items and sampled off each one. So the Blacken Catfish was absolutely amazing. We also had the Fried Catfish and the Fried Chicken. Along with Mac N Cheese, Green Beans, and Sweet potatoes. All fire! If you could taste the pictures you'd know how good it was. I've already told a few friends about it so I will be back. The owner came over and greeted us and that's always a plus in my book. Thank you Soulé Chicago for an amazing experience."
1/4/2020,4 star rating,The food tastes delicious! The customer service was just ok. I wish the venue was bigger as you sometimes have to wait for a table.
1/4/2020,5 star rating,"Great place for a good southern home cooked meal! The place isn't as spacious as you would hope and when waiting there is the possibility of having to stand, but it would be worth it once you actually get your seat. Food is prepared very fast and at first i thought it was just pre-made and served to prevent waiting, but you can kinda taste that it's fresh (if you know you know). If you enjoy sugar diabetes like me, they got it! When i ordered the punch (don't remember the name) i expected regular juice but it tasted a lot better than i expected. Servers are down to earth people, it's not an overly fancy place so don't expect people in a shirt and tie."
1/1/2020,1 star rating,"Well, it's New Years Day and Disappointment is an understatement. I made my reservation for 7pm on Saturday in the excitement of my past experiences at Soule. Food has been great and service was amazing. I had a friend visiting from out of town and I have been raving about this restaurant. I get to the restaurant and there was NO reservation for me. The hostess told me he didn't see my name and I specifically remember speaking to him when i made the reservation. The reservation system is laughable. The line was out the door. Needless to say, I left the restaurant in pure disappointment. Soulè, i know this review won't mean much to you especially when you have lines out the door but you have lost me as a customer."

1/30/2021,5 star rating,"I finally tried Soule and I was very impressed. I ordered the fried chicken with the mac and cheese and chicken spaghetti side. Everything was so flavorful and the portions were very generous. The chicken spaghetti is very creamy and packed with flavor - I was so pleasantly surprised. The mac was just right, seasoned and creamy. I just topped a little hot sauce on everything and had enough food for two meals. My boyfriend got the fried cat fish and greens and said it was delicious as well. I personally felt the price was right for the amount of food it came with. I will definitely be going back and next time I will try their drinks and desserts."
3/31/2019,5 star rating,"The hubby and I decided to give this place a try yesterday while visiting Chicago. In short, it was amazing and we will absolutely make it a regular stop anytime we are back in Chicago. So if you are looking for a quick review, there it is. But for those that like a little more... ""Why, is this a must stop?""  you might ask. Well, allow me to explain.Let's start with the food. Have you ever read through a menu and thought to yourself, ""well, sounds pretty standard - candied yams, Mac 'N cheese, greens""? Yet you look at the pictures of the food and for some reason they exude a presence, a confidence that say ""don't sleep on me, I'm not your average Joe."" Exactly. They were standing in their rightfully earned glory of incredibleness. Those were my sides of choice, along with the entree of lollipop lamb chops. My hubby ordered chicken with greens, Mac, and dirty rice. He was enjoying his chicken so much I dared not steal a bite, even though he was more than happy to share in his delightful dining experience. I did however snag a taste of his dirty rice. It was delicious, but I was ready to dig into my own sides. Man oh man was I SATISFIED! Each item stood its own ground, not to be outdone by the next. The flavors were so distinct, yet so complementary to one another. With every bite of yams I could taste yet one distinct flavor, then the next. First it was omg, the flavor of real butter, clearly not some imitation something or another. Followed by my second bite which exuded a sultry vanilla presence, and then bite number three, nutmeg, definitely nutmeg... my fork danced around my plate doing the Cha Cha slide. My shoulders may have joined in. Speaking of shoulders dancing, that brings me to my second point... the atmosphere. Modern beats of R&B and family friendly hip hop are piping through the space, like a pre-game to the concert of the year. If there was a single downside, it was that we had to wait an hour before being seated. But ask me if that'll be what we remember when this visit is a distant memory. Not at all. We'll remember that although the space is on the smaller side, it felt cozy and welcoming. Brightly lit and beautifully decorated. After initially waiting in the car, we found a space with seating toward the back of the restaurant and soaked up the good vibes and melodic stream of memories piping through the sound system. Judging from the looks of contentment and dare I say pleasure of the patrons already seated, we knew we'd done well. And as you already know from my description of the food, done well was an understatement. My final point is on the service. My first observation was despite the growing line of expectant and hopeful patrons, the host never seemed overwhelmed or aggravated. He moved quickly and supported the wait staff overseeing food service along with seating guests. Our server was adorable, she gave us a big smile and made small talk with us on each trip back to our table. She answered our questions about the food and when checking on us, made it clear that our satisfaction was out of true concern not obligation. There's a difference and you can feel it. And she had her hands full, I mentioned this place was packed right, but similar to my first reference of calm and poise, she exuded the same. Or maybe it was simply she enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience. I can certainly say that we did. Definitely add this place to your list of stops whether you are just in town for a quick visit, or call Chicago home. You won't be disappointed."
3/17/2019,2 star rating,The wait is crazy....1-2 hour wait . The place is so small only fits about 10 small groups.  i ordered the crab legs which cost $20 comes with corn and mash potatoes the crab were so small and salty they also came out cold ... the Mac and cheese i ordered on the side was the best thing they had.  It's BYOB which is a plus.  I probably should have ordered the blackened catfish it's more bang for your buck. Good luck trying to find a park.

This is a new business but I see nothing but greatness. I ha e NO COMPLAINTS.  It is BYOB, which is wonderful. The owner is personable. I will definitely be back. I could eat the food from here everyday. I went with a group of 7 for my friends birthday. They did an excellent job with proactively splitting our bill and it was all accurate. Kudos to you Soule. Wishing you continued success. Please check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"
5/26/2018,4 star rating,Soule is a cute Cajun soul food spot. Good for a date or dinner with a friend or two. It's BYOB but there is a cork fee of $10. They will provide you with an bucket for your bottle as well. Our meals were good sizes. I thought the collard greens were a little on the salty side but they were still flavorful. I think next time I will go with a different vegetable. The fried greens were good as an appetizer. I requested a side of ranch for them. There is hot sauce on the table for your convenience with the salt and pepper. Our wait staff was attentive and the manager also checked on us. Overall it was a good experience and I would go again.
2/25/2019,5 star rating,"After hearing great things about Soule - I added it to the Wolf Pack dinner list and we drove during rush hour traffic on a Friday even to check it out. We arrived and were told the wait would be about an hour and half. So we bided time across the street at Root - despite that, our wait was closer to two and a half hours namely because we had a large group and the table was being held hostage by a birthday party group. During our wait - we made friends with other patrons, the staff and even the owner Bridgette who came out and greeted us. During that time she let us know that they were running out of catfish filets, but they had her favorite whole catfish - which I immediately claimed! One of the Wolf Pack Members even asked for a sample of greens, which she brought out a health taste portion which we all tried and knew in that moment that the wait was so going to be worth it. Finally, we were seated and introduced to Tamara our spunky, amazing server - who handled a table of 6 hungry men like a pro. Keeping us in line, in check and on task. We immediately started to place our order.1)      Whole Catfish with Macaroni and Cheese, Candied Yams Peach Cobbler - when the catfish was finished it was a Field Museum Fossil. The tail, fins and meat were perfectly seasoned and crispy. You could taste the hint of garlic in the Macaroni and Cheese and the Candied Yams were the perfect companion. The Peach Cobbler A La Mode was the perfect ending to this meal.2)      BBQ Shrimp (appetizer), Blackened Catfish with Greens, Yams and Banana Pudding - the shrimp were jumbo and perfectly cooked, not overdressed or over seasoned. The Blackened Catfish comes atop Dirty Rice and was just the best bit of New Orleans in the Chicagoland area. They brought out a nice serving of Banana Pudding and before the table could look up the cup was empty. Grandma might have taught Bridgette this recipe but she upgraded it.3)      Lamb Chops with Greens and Macaroni and Cheese - Whatever herbs and spices she put on these lamb chops can be sold nationwide in the store. They were perfectly cooked and absolutely amazing.4)      Jerk Shrimp, Fried Catfish Filet, with Greens and Yams - SPEECHLESS!5)      Shrimp and Grits - you think that you will leave still hungry so you order appetizer, then you have this big steaming bowl of God's Goodness and Mercy and see what happens when its pressed down, shaken together and running over. It was the best Shrimp and Grits we've had in Chicago.6)      Fried Chicken, with Greens, Green Beans and Creamed Corn - breaking into chicken breast, you can see the seasoning throughout and the moist flesh inside. The greens are made with healthy portions of turkey meat, with just the right amount of sweet heat. It's the type of greens that you can eat with a cast-iron skillet of cornbread, a healthy bowl of greens and some Soule Punch!This was by far one of the best meals that the Wolf Pack has had together since we've started going to restaurants throughout the Chicagoland area. It was worth the drive, it was worth the wait, it was worth it all. Thank you Chef Bridgette Flaggis, Tamara and the wonderful staff of Soule' for an amazing night. I can't wait to bring more family and friends to this amazing establishment."
2/15/2021,3 star rating,"I was introduced by someone on my IG account.  Looking at the pictures the food looked good.  So we decided to place an order for pick up.  I live in Tinley Park, IL so we had a ways to go, but if the food is good, its definitely worth it.  I placed the order over the phone.  Once I arrived and paid for the food, I was bit discouraged as the the bag  seemed a bit lite for two dinners and two extra sides ($40).  The portion size for the meat was good, but the sides portions were a bit to be desired.  The sweet potatoes were the best I've ever had, however, the other food was just simply ok.  Nothing worth going out of my way for.  As for Tanya who took my order over the phone, I wondered if she really wanted to be at work that day.  She came across as rushed and it was difficult to understand what she was saying.  In my opinion the food is not bad, trust me, I have had worst.  But it is NOT worth taking that 45-55 min drive from Tinley Park to the west side.  And I really wanted to love the food.  I've been trying to find a good soul food restaurant for a long time. I guess the search continues......."
5/13/2021,1 star rating,"I placed an order yesterday at 7:19pm. Order was due to be ready at latest by 8:08pm. I get there at 7:42pm, which was the earliest time for it to be ready and it wasn't. I didn't have an issue because there was time left for the order to be prepared. I go back into the restaurant around 8:10pm, I give the first hostess my name, she goes to the counter looks for it, can't find it and precedes to take someone else's order. Another hostess comes up, asks me if I'm waiting on an order and what's my name. She looks in the system see's the order and says it isn't ready yet. I show her the order on my phone which states the order should have been ready ten minutes ago. She states that's wrong your order would not have been done so quickly. She preceded to the kitchen to get status, she's comes back and says it won't be ready until 830pm. I question, can I at least get my dessert for free for the inconvenience and she precedes to tell me that they are behind because of the indoor dining. (My personal opinion: you shouldn't be excepting online orders if you can't handle it). I told her that people placed orders when I first got here and have already left with there orders, she looks at her tablet and says no they didn't. My order is finally ready at 8:35 pm and I'm charged full price, not discount for bad service or inconvenience. And to make matters even worse when I get my food home, the catfish is fried to hard and the grits were under cooked."
2/13/2021,5 star rating,"I don't usually write reviews, but this meal was so good! My family shared a bunch of dishes- would highly recommend the shrimp and grits, super tasty! The fried chicken was also delicious and the greens are mouthwatering- so happy to try this gem, will definitely be back!"
5/15/2019,4 star rating,Great food. Cute spot. Limited amount of sitting so not good for big groups. I love that you can BYOB perfect for a date or girls night out. Fried chicken was seasoned very well and the Mac was great!
2/8/2020,1 star rating,"We travel from Michigan and was told the wait would be an Hour and a half for a party of three. Waited for a hour and and a half and seen tables sat for parties of 4, and two that came in and waited for 10 mins. The coustomer service was terrible!! We was told we couldn't sit at the bar and wait and a party of two that  came in after us was able to sit at the bar,  order and was escorted to  a table before us. A party of four who was white was sat at a table before us they waited for 10 minutes, this was unbelievable and no okay service!"
9/25/2020,2 star rating,"It sucks to give a bad review to a black owned business but the service is just terrible. Guy at the door was rude when asking for my order. Person on the phone was rude taking my order. Received my chicken COLD. for takeout how? Mac and cheese and dirty rice were warm. Took about 45mins - 1 hour to receive my food. Several inside sitting down while there a line outside and got 1 person grabbing orders. Finally brought the girl to help and she told me ""I just clocked in and didn't take anyone's order so I don't know anything""! This was my first time coming here and it will be my last solely based on the customer service. DO BETTER! I'm only giving a 2 star because I actually received my food. The person who was with me ordered their food separately at the same time I did and no one would help him get his order. So bad that he had to go across the street and order from somewhere else because they never brought the order outside. Terrible customer service"
2/3/2020,5 star rating,"I visited this restaurant with my Goddaughter Tiaon Sat. To celebrate her birthday and I must say it was more than I'd expected. I ordered the blackened catfish that came with a dirty rice dish. She ordered fried catfish w/green beans & Mac and cheese. She enjoyed her dish as well as myself   However, I must add that I had never had spicy dirty rice before   And anyone that knows ME know that I don't do spicy. Because the fish was blackened I asked my server was the fish spicy he said no it come with dirty rice. Never did it come to mind that I should asked if the rice was spicy. Needless to say it was very spicy, so spicy that I drank damn near a gallon of their speciality drink. They gave my Goddaughter an order of sweet potatoes that she didn't request so I ate some to help with the heat from the dirty rice dish. All in all the meal was great and I will be back again; I just will not have the dirty rice."
1/14/2018,5 star rating,"This restaurant was so phenomenal! The staff and owner were so pleasant! The food was AMAZING! I had the shrimp and grits (so good I had to sit back and stare at the bowl in amazement!!), my sister had the lamb chops with Mac n cheese and green beans which was soooo flavorful and tender! I cannot wait to return to devour other dishes from the restaurant!!! The ambiance, staff and of course comfort of the food created a dining experience that was one of kind! Oh and it's a BYOB which is an added Bonus!!!"
2/15/2020,4 star rating,Very nice place. Food was pretty tasty. I just think I went on the wrong day. It was All Star Weekend and super crowded. I'm sure they were in a hurry to get food out to the patrons. Therefore my first order of lamb chops were cold. I sent them back and the second order was both undercooked and overcooked. I ended up getting a different entree all together. There was someone there who was kind enough to accommodate me at my next visit after I told her I would still come back.
12/15/2019,5 star rating,"Definitely give this place a try. Before we even talk about food, I have to say that the owner is the absolute nicest person. Very hands on and down to earth. The staff was kind. I pray she's blessed with more space or a second location--it's packed all the time (and rightfully so). I ordered the fried chicken. I felt that the food was reasonably price. The atmosphere was great. Now, the food... I can't say enough good things about the food. It was AMAZING! It's presented well and again--tastes AMAZING. Do yourself a big favor and try this place. It does not disappoint!"
8/25/2019,5 star rating,My girlfriends and I dined here for the first time tonight. Great choice! Food was absolutely delicious and came out super fast. Atmosphere and music was very sophisticated. Waitress was super friendly. Owner came out and greeted us as well. I will be back!
4/10/2019,4 star rating,Catfish was bomb. Fried chicken was average. Mac and cheese was pretty good. Sweet potatoes were also solid. Peach cobbler. FUEGO
3/2/2019,5 star rating,Everything I ate was good. All the veggies were fresh. The salmon on over mash potatoes were excellent.  The catfish was fried just right. I will definitely come back and visit the next time I am in the Chicago area. The vibe was right. The music was an old school mixed that had me reminiscing about the 90.
7/28/2019,3 star rating,"The Positive: enjoyed and loved the atmosphere, music, cultural art and presentation of the venue. The food was reasonably priced and hot upon being served. The Negative: we waited for over an hour to get food. We came about 15 minutes after it opened and was immediately seated as it was not crowded yet. The waitress came shortly after and took our orders. As we waited,  3 groups of people came in after us, were seated and served with their food after ordering. 2 of the three groups also used the same waitress as us. After an hour, the waitress finally came over and said sorry for the wait, your food should be coming out. It honestly felt as if she was ignoring us so she wouldn't have to give a statement about our wait time.  In that hour wait, she never came back to check on us, to see if we needed more water, etc. Even after our food was served, she never came back to check on us. We had to ask another waitress for  containers and our bill. The poor service and wait time killed the food experience for us, as at this point we were ready to go, especially seeing that we only had 90 minutes to be there (according to the website on weekends) and we had already been there 70 minutes by the time the food came. Overall the food was decent."
1/24/2020,1 star rating,Ok so this was my first time at soule' lol I arrived at 6:30 and I didn't get seated 7:30 and that's fine soon as we was seated our order was place 4 more people walks in get seated get greeted with hugs that's fine also 10 mins later her comes they food how and we been here before them we didn't  receive our food until 8:50 y they close at 9:00 so I guess you have to be a regular customer to get fast service ‍ and then my food was cold unbelievable I order  the blackened catfish over dirty rice y is my food cold I was so  piss first and last time
5/16/2019,5 star rating,"Great atmosphere and the food was so good. I had the fried chicken, Mac and cheese and greens.Def well worth the cost, and there wasn't much of a wait. Would surely recommend."
3/15/2019,4 star rating,"awesome ""soul food""! Only place with an old school appeal... loved everything.... apps, drinks, food, desserts! Definitely on the list to return"
1/5/2020,5 star rating,"So I went here last night, Saturday, I had the best time. Aside from the wait, which was expected because it's a small boutique type of restaurant, It was better than I expected. With every bite I was dancing in my seat. We did a few items and sampled off each one. So the Blacken Catfish was absolutely amazing. We also had the Fried Catfish and the Fried Chicken. Along with Mac N Cheese, Green Beans, and Sweet potatoes. All fire! If you could taste the pictures you'd know how good it was. I've already told a few friends about it so I will be back. The owner came over and greeted us and that's always a plus in my book. Thank you Soulé Chicago for an amazing experience."
6/15/2019,4 star rating,"First and foremost, the food was amazing! Everything tasted great I just wish I had more in the serving to price ratio. Was quite expensive for the actual food you get. I ordered the Salmon with ""shrimp"" and was disappointed that it only came with literally 2 (two) small....pieces of shrimp. Then there were a lot of side fees and cost that were unusual and unexpected. Not a bad experience overall though. Service was ok, but they definitely need a bigger venue! Worth the wait if you have nothing to do!"
10/30/2019,5 star rating,"Never knew what soul food was until this. Wow is Soule food amazing. Fried green tomatoes were great, chicken wings, were greater, and topped it off with some banana pudding(best I've ever had) on a side note my sides were chicken spaghetti(off the chain) and greens(first time eating greens and they were actually tasty and seasoned to perfection. Just go there."

8/24/2019,3 star rating,The food is delicious. I'm not here to be nit picky about that. Service definitely need improvement. Has a NYC eatery vibe without the experienced servers. Biggest issue: The charge gratuity on taxes. This is not ok. This practice is not standard at reputable restaurants. I had to talk to two people to get this adjusted. Embarrassing for a seasoned dinner like myself. Adjustment of gratuity should never be refused especially when it's an erroneous charge. Manager on duty said this was a request of the owner to charge what is essentially a tax on tax. I will hope the owner adjusts this ASAP. Feels wrong to take advantage of customers this way.
6/5/2019,1 star rating,"I had lamb chops Mac n cheese, and string beans. IT WAS TERRIBLE! Everything! I didn't like the sauce for the lamb chops, I asked for them to be well done and they were still red in the inside. The macaroni and cheese was the worst I've tasted. And the strings beans didn't have any seasoning. I left with a plate full of food and they didn't even off to take it off my tables bill when they asked me did I want a to go box I said NO. Then to top off the bad food I went on a Wednesday as soon as they opened (it wasn't crowded) and the waiter still kept forgetting about my table."
12/19/2018,4 star rating,"This was like a 3.5 star review because while the lamb was wonderfully cooked and seasoned, the sides were a miss. I believe Dirty Rice and asparagus came with this entree. The Dirty Rice was very salty which left me unable to eat it, (and I love salty food) and the asparagus was way over cooked, basically mush. However the lamb and the jerk shrimp were to die for! Please make sure to try those as they were really delicious! You couldn't substitute sides which a lot of restaurants do, so I did not inquire about sending the dish back. The service and atmosphere were all good, they even have a waitress that will sang if you catch the the right song on."
6/1/2019,5 star rating,"Worth the wait. Worth the wait. Worth the wait. Intimate setting, not too flashy not too dull, and very kind servers. The food was unbelievable. Seriously, though. Will come back again and again with all the people I know. Chicago foodies have another restaurant to add to their bucket list!!! :)"
11/5/2019,4 star rating,"Absolutely LOVE the food! Absolutely HATE the hassle of getting a table. It feels like trying to get into an exclusive club on a very popular Saturday night. If you're not there by 1:30pm on a Sunday to stand in line(they open at 2pm), you're likely to have a 2hr wait. I was told they don't do carry out on Sundays. Not sure how true that is since I saw people walking in and carrying out. ‍The space is tiny. Not intimate. Just tiny. The ""waiting area"" is maybe 2-3 chairs on the wall of the bathroom and about 6 inches from the furthest table. Which means while you're waiting, you're basically having dinner with the people at that table. And vice versa. Again LOVE the food! My favorites are the Salmon w/shrimp, fried catfish, blackened catfish, sweet potatoes, and cornbread (not on some physical menus). From the looks of it, the business has been extremely successful since it's launch! It's time for a larger space AND a second location."
1/5/2020,4 star rating,"The food was delicious! Everything came out seasoned well and on point. Plus the staff was really great.The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars is the amount of time that we waited. We waited 1 hr 20 mins to be seated. We were initially told the wait was 1 hr. We then waited another hr from the time we ordered until the food was served. If this place can figure out logistically how to get people in and out quickly, it would be awesome!"
1/5/2020,4 star rating,The restaurant has tasty lamb chops and chicken spaghetti. The wait was a little long but worth it. I really enjoyed the background music playing.... old school RnB. Loved it. The next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely visit this restaurant
5/18/2019,5 star rating,"Let me start off by saying this... 1. The ambiance was dope! 2. Second, it's BYOB friendly! 3. Third, the food was delicious! 4. The prices were cost-effective! 5. The customer service was excellent! 6. The salmon portion was big!I love going out to eat to places where the food is great and the prices are very affordable. There were 4 of us and we had a great time! When we first walked in, the speaker was playing great music to set the tone. Then, we ordered, and it was brought to the table within 10-15 minutes at the most, and prepared exactly how we asked. The catfish was fried hard to perfection, the sides were epic and the water was cold, lol. Between the four of us, we sampled. We ordered the fried catfish, macaroni, greens, yams/sweet potatoes, bbq jerk chicken wings, regular chicken wings, salmon with the garlic spinach cream sauce, jerk salmon, shrimp and mashed potatoes. Everything was on point! To top it off, we had so much fun and were so full, we forgot our leftovers on the table and the kind young lady ran outside to bring us our bags so we could enjoy later. That was the icing on the cake for me... I highly recommend this spot for any occasion. You won't be disappointed! Soule' for the win"
12/29/2019,3 star rating,Food was fantastic but the service needs sum attention. We sat down before two other couples and still did not get served until after we actually had to go and grab a server.
6/14/2019,2 star rating,"Well well I was so excited and looking forward for this experience since I have heard so many reviews about Soule. Where do I begin, when entering the small but elegant place I was greeted at the door great she sat us down right away so no wait time for our party of 3 great.Now were looking over the menu sounds like a ton of great things to choose from. The waiter was friendly upon taking our order I ask to have my sauce on the side just in case I didn't care for it (fried tomatoes) I also order the salmon wow okay sauce was on the tomatoes the waiter didn't bring out the food someone else did no one offer to take them back my salmon taste Gross like it was pre-cook then warmed in the microwave taste nasty horrible the presentation of the food looks really nice that's about all.. also chicken was order my family said it taste okay not the best. And the lamb chops which was over cooked. Now I flagged the waiter down to get the bill he took over 15 minutes no joke to bring me the bill then I took another 15 minutes for them to come back and get my check after flagging serval people down. The waiter had no care in the world only to take the order I guess that was his only job ugh I was very annoyed by this I hate I left a tip but that's not who I am as a person. The owner came through she appeared to be friendly to only people who would approach her and say something first. My overall experience was a big disappointment. I will not be going back here.."
1/16/2020,5 star rating,Salmon shrimp. Soule punch. Best combo in and on Chicago. Would recommend going here going here if you crave authentic southern comfort food. Would not recommend making any big plans (especially that involve walking) after eating here.
12/23/2019,5 star rating,"I ordered take-out. I needed to add items to my order, which was handled with no problem. I think the owner was actually helping me, and she was ON IT. Food was delicious. I will return."
8/2/2018,5 star rating,"Best food I've had in a restaurant in a loooooooong time.  Simple menu.  Well made dishes.  Perfectly seasoned food that wasn't salty.  Kind, engaging staff.  I will DEF return.  Thumbs waaayyyyy up.  Don't drive too fast, or you'll miss it.  It's small and quaint, but the ambiance is cute.  Can't wait to go back!"
9/19/2020,5 star rating,Amazing!!!!!  Fried chicken was crispy and juicy.  The blackened catfish was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp amazing.  The salmon was so good!  The wait staff are friendly and personable.
10/21/2018,5 star rating,Ohhhhhh my goodness!!!!!!!!! You ever eat something SO GOOD that you start thanking God WHILE eating?!This food so good that I'm praising God for all of the fish and sweet potatoes and greens that had to give their lives in sacrifice for me to enjoy this meal! My ONLY gripe has nothing to do with the food. It's the size of the venue. They need to expand ASAP because it's simply not big enough. Keep your party 4 and under. This is a good problem to have though.
9/29/2019,5 star rating,"Easily the best place to get Soul food in Chicago. The fried chicken and greens are amazing. The service is pretty good too -- we always get our food quickly. Lastly, it's black owned which I love. My one piece of feedback -- it's 2019, EVERY restaurant needs reservations. Even on Sunday. Or Yelp waitlist!"
9/8/2020,2 star rating,"First off, the attitudes of the hostesses are questionable. I'm not looking for fake smiles ear to ear, but communication skills are definitely lacking. The woman who gave me my food was accusatory and unfriendly. I ordered the fried chicken, greens, and sweet potatoes. The sweet potato was my favorite, probably because it was sweet and had the most flavor. My other items weren't bland, but they weren't flavorful either. The flavors are definitely subdued. If you've got a hankering for soul food, definitely check this place out, but it may not taste like home."
6/20/2020,5 star rating,"I had lamb chops, jerk wings, Mac & cheese, greens and banana pudding.  EVERYTHING was delicious.  Service during COVID was well explained and organized.  I will be back soon to try the other menu options!!!"
8/17/2018,5 star rating,"I think ""comfort food"" doesn't do this restaurant justice. The dishes were a bit more elegant than what I think of as comfort food. I had the shrimp and grits along with the green beans and smoked turkey. Both were extremely flavorful. My wife had the salmon and shrimp which was also excellent.I liked the fact that the restaurant is simple, understated. It has a limited menu and for that reason the food comes out really fast. The music and decor are very relaxing, unpretentious, yet enjoyable. Prices are very reasonable.I was surprised that there was no wait to get in but that means immediate seating for all who are interested!"
3/7/2020,5 star rating,"It's always a pleasure dining at Soule! It's a hassle on a busy night but believe me the wait is well worth it. If you want to dine here, plan to leave early to find a good park and get placed on the waitlist. The staff is nice and you get the feeling that you're right at home. They have great prices and even greater food."
8/12/2019,5 star rating,I went on a solo trip to Chicago with no real itinerary but I ran upon this black owned restaurant on my travels. It did not disappoint the food was not only good but hot and fresh. The menu pricing isn't too bad either. The staff was professional and very attentive. I would definitely recommend.
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"Yo what up Yelpers!!! Had to take some time for Soule!!! This is one place where the reviews already speak for themselves! I RARELY give a 5 star but this place was so good I did come back the very next day and for the fact that it's black owned I'm rooting for this place extra hard!!The owner was on site when I was there both times and she is super into her business and the happiness of her customers. Family staff and they actually seem like they're enjoying themselves especially when the music is playing. I got the catfish both times (fire and again that just means really good!) favorite sides for me: greens, Mac n Cheese, and the yams. Fried chicken from my friends and family that came with me is legit. Matter of fact the second time everyone got something different and everyone was pleased, which is hard to do with my circle. Do yourself a favor and check out Soule, the Soule Punch is off the chain especially if you can add some spirits ! And don't leave without getting some peach cobbler WITH ice cream for the $7 stop being cheap and do it! You won't regret it, probably the best thing on the menu! I'm not sure how long this place will stay somewhat low key but it's small an I'm worried it will get like Batter & Berries too much volume and long wait times which can ruin the experience. Hopefully they can expand, but the art work on the walls and the vibe all legit. Soule is staple in my book for now. Until next time, cheers!"
9/16/2020,5 star rating,"The fried chicken is SO good, as well as their mac and cheese. Better to call and order ahead since they've been very busy lately. Highly recommend!"
4/18/2018,2 star rating,"Me n my girlfriend went here on a Sunday afternoon, she ordered fried green tomatoes to start. There were 4 on the plate, they looked ok but she never said if they were yummy. I ordered the salmon and shrimp (with a garlic and spinach sauce) over mashed potatoes. There was 2 shrimp on the plate!!!! 2! Anyways, on to the flavor. It was a MISS for me. She had fried chicken, mac n cheese and greens. She said her chicken was bland. Then there was an issue when the girl rang up our food. Would I go back? NEVER! Would I recommend this place? If you go for decor, yes! Because it was pretty and inviting but if you go for good food, NO!"
7/18/2018,5 star rating,"We visited this place on a Friday night. It was during some type of festival at the time but we were able to be seated quickly. The place is pretty small but looks to be able to accommodate medium groups. We tasted the Bbq shrimp as an appetizer and it was amazing! For an entree I had the Fried Chicken and it was delicious, the mustard greens were seasoned well and the macaroni was delicious! The cornbread was moist and very good. They allow you to bring in your own bottle for a surcharge which was great! I wanted to try the pasta but it's no longer on the menu. They have a signature punch they make but I personally didn't care for it maybe being that I like something a little sweeter.  The owner was there and all the staff was very nice. I would definitely go back when back in town! Another plus is that this is a black owned business!! Definitely have to support my own!"
11/2/2019,4 star rating,"The food is really good, seasoned very well, everything has a different but good and unique taste. The atmosphere was not very large so if it happens to be very busy the day you go the wait may be very long. They told us the wait was going to be an hour but we were called in 10 minutes. Good music, friendly staff, bathrooms, no complaints about the food"
9/11/2018,4 star rating,"Good food from good people; found the staff to be overwhelmingly friendly and willing to offer suggestions.This, as it turns out, wasn't totally necessary as everything we tried was good. Our party basically got every side, for which the greens, green beans and dirty rice were standouts. Fried chicken, bbq shrimp and fried green tomatoes were great too; excited to come back and try the catfish."
10/4/2020,4 star rating,The wait for dine-in was a bit long even with having a reservation but the food was amazing and our server was great.( can't remember her name). We were the last reservations for the night and they ran out of a few things but she made it worth the wait and the peach cobbler was banging. Guess what their on Grubhub. My new favorite Sunday dinner spot.
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"I dine out frequently, and have never had a dining experience like this at a restaurant- it felt like we were at a big family gathering with lots of cousins and lots of great food. At one point, they turned up the music and staff/guests actually started dancing, singing along. Reminds me of a bedtime story my son loves called ""Full, Full, Full of Love."" Soule will warm your heart. And the food is delish. You will be glad you came. FYI: its byob with a bottle service fee ($10), street parking is plentiful, there will probably be a wait (for seating as well as service), and there's a 90 minute limit on your experience (reasonable, in my opinion, bc the atmosphere is so inviting, you might want to stay all day!)."
1/26/2020,4 star rating,The vibe won me first. The atmosphere is intimate and customer service on point. Food was good but it's the vibe that would keep me coming.

7/19/2019,2 star rating,"Slightly disappointed. I had been looking forward to a new soul food location, however, Soulé did not live up to the hype. The food was ok, being the fact I'm a vegetarian so the options are limited. I had greens, sweet potatoes, and friend green tomatoes. I ask if it was meat in the greens I was told no, until I bit into a bone. The fried green tomatoes should have the sauce on the side, and you should be informed of what kind of sauce they are putting on your food, and no it does not say on the menu. Sweet potatoes are a favorite of mine, but these are chewy and hard. The service was poor."
1/20/2019,5 star rating,Do your taste buds a favorite and get to Soule Restaurant!!! The wait is worth it. The first bite of  sweet potatoes  and fried catfish took me right back to my childhood memory of my grandmother kitchen. The decor is beautiful and the staff is professional. This Northside Soul Food gem is a must try spot
3/3/2018,4 star rating,"Very nice, intimate spot. Great for a date night or gather with no more than 4 people. Nice atmosphere and a friendly staff. The food was good! I had the fried catfish, mac and cheese, green beans, and sweet potatoes. Everything was flavorful and well seasoned. Good portion sizes too. The Soule punch is a really good drink. I'll definitely be back."

1/4/2020,5 star rating,"Great place for a good southern home cooked meal! The place isn't as spacious as you would hope and when waiting there is the possibility of having to stand, but it would be worth it once you actually get your seat. Food is prepared very fast and at first i thought it was just pre-made and served to prevent waiting, but you can kinda taste that it's fresh (if you know you know). If you enjoy sugar diabetes like me, they got it! When i ordered the punch (don't remember the name) i expected regular juice but it tasted a lot better than i expected. Servers are down to earth people, it's not an overly fancy place so don't expect people in a shirt and tie."
5/10/2020,5 star rating,"The service was amazing! Bridgette and her team did exceptional during the Covid -19 pandemic. I was able to get my order in a timely fashion even with the extensive line because of Mother's Day however, I believe the workers were moving as swiftly and efficiently as they could. I tried the lamb chops for the first time and they were seasoned properly and cooked well. Make sure y'all order first and come with time requested. Her team has made sure I was satisfied every time I visit. 5 stars for me."
12/30/2019,5 star rating,"The best restaurant you could ever eat at in Chicago hands down! Those high end ""5 stars"" don't even compete! The staff is as friendly and attentive as they come and just wow! Absolutely amazing!"
8/3/2018,4 star rating,"I came here on a Friday when they opened and was seated immediately. I ordered the cat fish, Mac and cheese and sweet corn- delicious! Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I only wish they included corn bread with the meal or even offered it as a side. Also, please turn the music down a bit, it's not a club, great music in the background with great food makes for a wonderful overall experience. Other than that, I will definitely return and tell my friend all about it."
8/7/2019,4 star rating,"Visited this fine establishment and overall had an ok experience. We arrived a few minutes after 9 , almost got turned away due to their 10pm closure until I spotted the empty bar area and asked if we could be seated there instead. We'd took a trip from the very far south side and was not leaving without trying this food. Waited to be seated about 5-10 min. Bar area is very small but doable. The menu options are typical southern comfort dishes with a slight twist( such as the salmon over mash potatoes). Went to order a recommended item off the menu but of course they were out for the night. I settled for the shrimp and grits with Mac and cheese: large serving size, nicely whipped but something about the taste didn't quite make it a hit(taste like vinegar is a ingredient) and the Mac and cheese definitely was lacking as it taste as if it sat in the refrigerator then microwaved. My date ordered the fried chicken, dirty rice and collard greens: the greens were the best of the meal. Overall customer service was great as well as the owner was very sweet and warm welcoming. The venue is very stylist with beautiful art pieces on the wall. Also the place is BYOB ( there is a Mariano's  down the street).I would definitely be back to try the items that were recommended: blackened catfish, salmon."
7/9/2018,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to come here since they first open. They didn't disappoint. I ended up getting the fried catfish, sweet potato, greens and the dirty rice. I wanted to make sure I tasted everything because I don't live in the city and its hard to get to. I was stuff trying to finish everything. The waiter with the locs had a lot of patiences and deserve the tip I left for him. That guy needs a raise! You know the food is good when people waited almost an hour for their table. The music choice was great too. They are going to need a bigger space soon."
9/8/2019,5 star rating,"The environment was very nice.  The music was awesome, as well as the service. Got in quickly and food was served just as fast. The food, catfish and shrimp was excellent.  The sides were extremely good. The dessert tasted  like being in my grandma's kitchen in South Carolina . EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE!!"
8/7/2019,5 star rating,The service and food were excellent. I very much would recommend. The place is small so seating is limited.
4/24/2018,3 star rating,"Small place food was ok waited about a hour order fish no fish so I had to go with chicken, fried to order very crispy needed a little seasoning on the meat."
12/12/2019,5 star rating,OMG this was my 1st time here at this place...it's was awesome. I had the salmon and shrimp...when I tell you that sauce touch my soul it touch my entire soul!!! Everyone here is vey nice and pleasant...definitely will be coming back and I had the pleasure to meet the Owner she's definitely cool.
12/10/2018,5 star rating,"Went here a couple days ago off the strength of a recommendation from a co-worker. Soule met and exceeded all expectations. There was a tiny bit of a wait but considering it was a packed house, they seated me and my two friends very fast. The service was welcoming and the food was perfectly cooked across the board. If you want quality Soul food and you want to support a black owned business, come to Soule. You won't regret it!"
7/3/2020,4 star rating,"Tried Soulé for their Juneteenth special this year and it was really great. My friend and I both got the catfish po'boy special, and a side of greens and Mac & cheese. The food was sooooo good, especially the greens!! Definitely the best greens I've had in Chicago. Will definitely return."
12/2/2017,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Hidden gem! My friends and I always love to try new places for dinner and this place did not disappoint. To start, it's a BYOB soul food restaurant that is intimate, yet lively and the music completes the ambiance!The food was nothing short of spectacular and the customer service was great! The staff were so nice and you can tell that they really care about their customers' satisfaction.  The food was so good that our whole table ordered something to take home for our hubby's to try. I will definitely be back!"
12/5/2019,5 star rating,Great food. One of my favorite restaurants to go to. Everything on the menu is great. I waited like a hour before. It was worth the wait. Food is always seasoned just right. The soulé punch is amazing. The food to go is even great.
9/28/2019,4 star rating,"Nice spot on Chicago ave. It was easy to make a reservation on a weekday for a party of 8 at the last minute. They are BYOB (Mariano's is less than 5 min walking)The fried catfish is probably the best bang for your $. 2 sides are included (sweet potatoes and yams were awesome!). Any dinner option that includes shrimp (I.e. blackened catfish with shrimp) means they place 2 shrimp to accent the plate. Fried green tomatoes were steaming hot (awesome!) and had a nice remoulade style sauce to accent it. Pros: BYOB, Great Service (Thanks Robert!), Food is Made when ordered and served hot, and very accommodating to large groups (5+), weekday wait time is minimal. Areas of Improvement: Gnats!, Portion Size"
10/31/2017,4 star rating,"This place has been in the news for quite some time prior to opening. The location is a small space but it works somehow. Staff are warm & the service (although slow but then again they literally just opened) was good. I heard the waitress describe the food as a fusion between soul & creole & one look over the menu will validate that statement. The one thing that was extremely disappointing was the dirty rice. I could swear that was Zatarain's right out of the box upon first taste. The ""fried green tomatoes (extremely thin) were good as were the jerk shrimp appetizers. The shrimp are a very good size might I add. The salmon & shrimp entree was decent. It's served over mashed potatoes & a sauce that lights but it's nice that it doesn't overpower the dish. Now the star of the show was the shrimp & grits!  It's slightly sweet but I would put this particular version of it against the best in the city."
11/30/2019,1 star rating,"Well, wish I had a review to give...called several times, different times of day, to ask a simple question..... no one ever answered the phone...after several attempts I emailed establishment with the email that was provided....that was on the 24th, to date still no reply....definitely NOT impressive."
6/18/2018,5 star rating,"Very amazing experience! From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt like royalty. And you think the service is the only thing impeccable? The food is phenomenal! I travel a lot and I've always said Atlanta has the best food. Well the owner of this restaurant officially SINGLE HANDEDLY put Chicago back on the map!!! We had the shrimp and grits, chicken, catfish, ribs, jerk shrimp, and jerk chicken!!! Every bite of food was seasoned to perfection and delicious!!! I will be back ..... A lot lol"
9/26/2019,5 star rating,"Speaks to your Soul! If your from down south, you can taste the originality from home! All the way down to the hot sauce we use down south! I don't know how else to say this is the best restaurant I have had in all of Chicago, Illinois! Of all types of food the Chi, Soule still is the best restaurant! Sincere quality food, lovely atmosphere and worth it all the way around!"
6/23/2018,5 star rating,This food was so good! Probably one of the best restaurants(taste wise) that I've been to in Chicago. I've lived in Chicago born and raised for 26 years. I'm a total foodie and love trying new places. I've never even wrote a Yelp review but this food was so good that I had to write one for this restaurant. omg so good.  10/10
11/12/2017,3 star rating,"Went for lunch about two weeks ago and it was just ok. The food was definitely tasty but the service was lacking. It took a while for our server to get us our appetizer and there was only one other table in there. It then took a while for her to come back and have us place our order. The shrimp and grits were good but the shrimp appetizer seemed a little underdone. The catfish was tasty but I wish it would come with more for the price, rather than just fish on a plate. The sweet tea was the most disappointing part; it tasted like a bad juice mix from the store, so that was a bummer. I would return for some grits, and to maybe try something else, but only if I had a good amount of time on my hands."
11/11/2017,5 star rating,Great food and good atmosphere.I had the catfish and sweet potatoes with dirty rice. I would have to say that they catfish is the best or one of the best I've ever had out. Sweet potatoes were on point as well.This spot was great and the spot is BYOB. Great date optionOwners are friendly as wellHighly recommend
4/8/2019,3 star rating,"Okay so you have to wait. The hostess may be new and doesn't know how to estimate the wait. She told us an hour. So we put our name down and they take your number. We then started walking around town because an hour is a while to wait when the restaurant is super tiny and if you don't want to hover over other people while they eat. We then called around 45 minutes just to see if we should head back. She then said it's going to be another hour. So we stay out. Less than 20 minutes later she says our table is ready and we have 5 minutes to get back. So we are rushing back with a newborn and everything. Already frazzled, we finally make it. The seats are strange. We had a combination of booth and seats. The booth sank so badly that looking across the table made you think you were on a ship. It had a terrible lean and it was hard to converse. They should get all chairs or add more cushion to the bench. And I'm a small girl and my husband is small as well. The menu is short and lacks detail. My friend is a pescatarian and you can't tell what has meat in it or is meat free. There are very little descriptions of anything so you don't know what type of meat is in the greens or dirty rice. And the food is spicy in general. I can't talk about flavors because everything was just hot in spice but not jam packed with flavor. I had the blackened catfish with dirty rice. The best part is the banana pudding. It's prepackaged and it's tasty. They also said they don't do takeout but they have the containers. My suggestion is that they take reservations on the weekend when they have the most business. That will ensure a better customer experience. They need to add details to the menu and maybe have a spice indicator on the menu. I gave it 3 stars because my sister who has a gluten allergy loves this place and has been 3 times so it may be worth it to some people. And my husband loved the shrimp. Also there is no changing room in either bathroom. It's not a restaurant for babies. Did I mention that we showed up in the first 30 minutes of them opening? There is no beating that wait."
7/7/2019,4 star rating,Not bad for a place like that.The New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was very good.
11/12/2017,4 star rating,"Upscale Soul Food, everything was simply tasty! Staff is on point & so is the music (Neo-Soul)Food was seasoned to perfection. FYI... chicken is cooked upon ordering ...very fresh. Love how the owner interact with customers. Strongly advise to open earlier on Sunday's for church goers. I left church and immediately headed to Soule but was disappointed they didn't open until 3. There was a line at 2:55pm. Parking is bad however that won't discourage me from patronizing again. Parking is free on Sunday's. I'm excited for this business, they're going to do great!"
6/14/2020,3 star rating,"I live 50 minutes away from the city but saw an advertisement via Instagram for this black-owned restaurant and wanted to give it a try one Sunday afternoon. Drove all the way to West Chicago and placed the order upon arriving. Had to wait 45 minutes in the car for the food to be prepared (understandable waiting in the car due to the pandemic but the time could've been more forgiving). Once the order was complete, we were texted to be informed that it was ready. To our demise, upon arriving back home, we realized that we were missing 3 of the orders which totaled $37! We called and the waitress advised us that we could return for the rest since the individual who gave us our food forgot the 2nd bag. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, we don't live right around the corner. Instead of crediting us for the complete order due to the inconvenience, we only received the $37 back. How unfortunate; I would have really liked to return as the food we did receive was tasty."
7/19/2018,5 star rating,"I came here on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Our waiter was super nice and accommodating. Answered all of our questions and was really friendly. I asked him what he recommended and he said honestly everything is really good. So I went for the shrimp and chicken pasta. Soooooo yummy!!! Sauce was super creamy, had a good amount of shrimp and chicken. The chicken and shrimp were both very succulent. I ordered the Soule punch to wash it down. Tasted just like koolaid with a twist, and I love kool-aid so I was here for it lol. Great service and a nice little gem in the west town neighborhood. Will def be back!"
8/22/2019,5 star rating,Oh man..... the food was BOMB!!! Everything was great we also had the lamb chops with two sides! The ppl was was great it's also BYOB.
2/16/2020,1 star rating,"Where do I begin. This place was a complete nightmare  honestly. When we walked in, it was an hour to hour and a half wait with no where to wait. They told us we can wait in the car. Being from out of town and having caught a cab- that was not an option for us. ONE lady was super nice and offered us water and menus to look at but otherwise we were crammed up all in the way for two hours!!! They kept giving us the run around and saying our wait time was an ""estimate"" and they never knew how much longer. Once we finally got a table, the service was subpar. Food came out quick and it was just mediocre and the salmon and shrimp was not seasoned well. Someone came by and asked if the food was worth the 2 hour wait and I said honestly- absolutely not. No manager ever apologized to us, no appetizers or desserts were comped off or anything. Then when we were ready to pay, they said they only take cash- which should've been communicated to us but apparently their system went down. They wouldn't let us split the check and requested we go to the ATM or pay with cash app. Then when we paid, they basically held us hostage and wouldn't return my friends' change until the rest of us paid the gratuity of $8. Very unprofessional!! They also added on gratuity for a party of 5 (usually 8 and up) which seemed completely ridiculous because no one in that establishment deserved our extra money. They were unapologetic for their mistakes and i just couldn't believe their service! It was my birthday and they ruined my celebratory dinner. The only reason we didn't go elsewhere was because at that point it had gotten late and we didn't think another restaurant would accommodate us. It was a complete joke."
5/31/2019,4 star rating,It was pretty decent. I had fried chicken. It was fried pretty hard but the sweet potatoes were delicious. I would return if in the area again. Nice waiters good atmosphere and a very diverse group of patrons attending the restaurant.
5/28/2019,5 star rating,"I came here with a friend after eyeing this place for the longest time and it definitely met all my expectations! We made reservations ahead of time so did not have a problem getting seated right when we got there. It was definitely crowded for a weekday and the space is on the smaller side so I recommend making reservations before coming. We ordered the lamb chops and the fried chicken and each came with 2 sides so we had the Mac and cheese, dirty rice, sweet potatoes and asparagus. I wasn't a fan of the asparagus but everything else was delicious! The lamb chops were soo good I just wish the portion was a little bigger for the price. I wanted to try their fried catfish and blackened catfish but that will have to wait til next time! We ended our meal with both their desserts-banana pudding and the peach cobbler and both were incredible. I can't wait to come back here again!"
3/23/2020,5 star rating,"Food was awesome and fresh. I will definitely be back, wife and kids loved the Lamb Chops and I loved the Salmon and Shrimp along with the Jerk Wings. I suggest everyone should try them then and you will not be disappointed..."

8/2/2018,5 star rating,Had dinner here with some friends .  I had never heard of Soule but so glad that it was suggested.  I had the catfish filet dinner with Mac n cheese and greens.  The food was delish and seasoned well. I love the fact that it is BYOB (w/a $10 cork fee).  I would suggest that you get there when they open because they are in a small space and it got fairly crowded after we were seated.  I've already told my husband that we will be back
10/4/2019,5 star rating,Went here with my husband and we absolutely loved it the food was amazing the service was amazing the staff were so nice. I can't think of her name but she's the owner sister she's so sweet and kind. We got our food so fast that made me very happy I will definitely be back
3/30/2018,5 star rating,"I came here for an early lunch date and was quite pleased with the experience. The owner was present and she stopped by the table to speak and ask about our dining experience, a plus for me. The decor and music were really great, I found myself singing while eating. The food was also really good - I ordered the lamb chops with greens and dirty rice. I also sampled the salmon and sweet potatoes. Everything was so flavorful! I am always cheering on black owned restaurants, so I hope this one sticks around for awhile."
2/4/2018,4 star rating,"My husband & I went to Soule last Saturday night.  We had a great experience & the food was really good!  We got the jerk shrimp appetizer, both of us got the fried chicken entree w/ sides of mac n cheese, dirty rice & greens.  I thought the portion sizes were really good & the food was delicious, except the greens were way too salty.  The place is BYOB (we are fans of BYOB!), with a $10 corkage fee.The people who work there were really nice.  I have a suggestion for management though - you need to bring the food out faster & turn the tables over quicker, or the restaurant may not make it, due to the small space & not having many tables.  We waited over an hour for our meal, and we observed other tables having about the same waiting time.  I understand the restaurant is new & hopefully this gets worked out over time.But overall, great addition to the neighborhood & we look forward to our next visit!"
3/17/2018,4 star rating,"Okay, whoa. I found this place on Yelp and was skeptical that the food was going to be as good as the reviews said it was, but it was. It has a great atmosphere and the service was good. We just happened to go there on a night when they were busy and understaffed, so it could've been better, but our server was very sweet and open about the situation, so we all worked together and made the experience an excellent one. Get the shrimp & grits and the fried chicken along with fried green tomatoes and mac & cheese. The food and the people at Soule will leave you with a smile on your face!"
10/30/2020,1 star rating,"This whole experience has been unbelievably disappointing. I tried to patronize this black owned business for my birthday weekend and was completely let down. We visited here on Oct 25th. I called ahead to place my order but the phones were very busy. I called over 20 times and the phone was busy each time so we decided to place our order to go at the restaurant. We came from the south side of Chicago to West Town. We placed the order to go at 5:15 pm and was told it would be a 30-45 min wait and when the food was ready, we would receive a text. By 6 pm, we still hadn't received a text so I called to check on our order, a girl answered and just said ""it wasn't done."" She didn't offer an estimated time or anything sooooo I asked how long it would be and she said give them 10-15 more mins. As we sat in the car, we saw several couples come in, eat and leave with to-go boxes. We ordered three Salmon dinners and I still can't figure out why it was taking so long to cook.  After 15 mins, still no text. My spouse went in the restaurant to check on the order and saw the owner. She was talking to the customers who were seated asking them about the food. Apparently, when he walked in the girls who were in the front didn't even address him so he asked the owner where our food was and told her we've been waiting over an hour and a half. She abruptly said ""Ask them"" pointing to the distracted waitresses/hosts and walked off. I guess priority is only given to customers who eat in. While my spouse was in the restaurant, I called for the last time. One of the girls put me on hold meanwhile my spouse overheard the two girls talking about my order and one said in a nasty tone, ""Tell her, its not done yet."" This was at 7 pm!  My spouse stormed out and we left. Guess what? We still NEVER got a text. Places like this make other black people reluctant to support black businesses however I wont. Their are plenty of other competent black owned restaurants in Chicago that I'm excited to try. I only hope they are better ran than this establishment."
7/19/2019,3 star rating,"3 stars because food is delish! Service needs help!  My husbands food (catfish & shrimp) came about 20 minutes before my jerk chicken salad. He was practically done with his food before I received mine. I had to ask for my drink twice - the first time, I asked the server who came to refill the water and her reply was ""who's your waiter"" and my drink still didn't get there until after my salad finally arrived - only because I asked for it a second time.  It's a hectic place and the workers are kinda doing their own thing for the most part - everything takes long. But the food is gooooooood!!!"

9/15/2019,5 star rating,"Wow! Wonderful FOOD and SERVICE! Excellent customer service began when we hit the door.  The hostess was attentive and let us know the approximate time we would have to wait.  She continuously came out and checked in us.  When it was time to be seated we were greeted by our awesome waitress, Tamara, who was very familiar with the menu (if she wasn't, we didn't know) and was very attentive.  The FOOD was delicious.  We are from Louisiana and it's usually hard to please us with food, but here they did. We didn't need to add salt, pepper, or any other spices or condiments. The owner even graced us with her presence and was very hospitable. The food was good as is!  I definitely recommend this restaurant to natives of Chicago and visitors."

6/22/2019,5 star rating,"Went here for the first time about six months ago. We heard about it from a good friend of ours. First time I ordered the lamb chops, Mac n cheese and greens. We ended up going back a few weeks later and ordered fried fish, greens and yams. I then took my mother & grandmother for food a few days after Mother's Day. I say that, to say....the food is delicious, the seating is very intimate and the music is on par with the dinning experience. I really do enjoy going and spreading the word about Soulé. I will continue to support everything about this business!!!!!"

6/19/2019,4 star rating,I have been waiting over a year to try this place after a good friend of mine told me about them. When we got there we were seated immediately. After we were seated it took a while to get any assistance at our table for even a drink order. After we finally placed our order the food came very quickly. The chicken was delicious and flavorful. The macaroni was okay but the chicken spaghetti was amazing! I got some peach cobbler to go and when I got home an hour and a half later it was still warm. It was delicious! I will be returning to try something new.

3/14/2019,2 star rating,"I & 2 friends arrived on a Wednesday as the doors opened, immediately seated. Nice place but quite small. R & B music playing, Rob was our server, nice fella. Informed us the wait on the Lamb Chops would be about an hour(thinking to myself, Why, when the doors just opened at 3pm & what about all the time you had for meal prepping? Besides. Lamb Chops cook rather quickly!! But ok) I ordered the 3 piece fried chicken, mac & cheese & greens, 1 friend ordered blackened catfish w/dirty rice the other ordered the jerk chicken wings appetizer and 3 sides, dirty rice, green beans & candied yams. The best thing was the blackened catfish. The jerk wings tasted nothing like Jerk & were soooo small, they literally were skin & bones(4). The yams lacked flavor, green beans from a can, mac & cheese is melted cheese sauce over noodles. Dirty rice was moist but reminded me of the packaged Lipton Rice. The Greens were flavorful but I had more pot liquor than greens, and the sides were $3.50 each & small portions. Soule Punch tasted like a mix of Cherry Kool aid & Lemonade, I enjoyed it quite a bit but not for $3.50. My friend had the Iced Tea, she said it tasted like a powdered mix not brewed tea, highly disappointed. Overall, I felt this place is overrated & lacked a bit of flavor. Wanted so desperately to like it but I really didn't. Won't be back-"

2/16/2019,1 star rating,"The food was good. The service was excellent. The reason I gave one star is because of the manager, owner, whoever he is (the taller gentleman with locs). He lied to my mother and I when he said they were not doing to-go orders today (I literally just walked out of the restaurant as I'm typing this). On our way out I see him bringing an to-go order out for the lady at the table next to my mother and I. DO NOT SAY YOU DON'T DO TO-GO ORDERS THEN TURN AROUND AND PROVIDE SOMEONE WITH A TO-GO ORDER! This was my first AND last time coming to this restaurant just off this one experience."
2/8/2020,1 star rating,"Horrible customer service. A party of 3 waited an hr and a half to be seated, while they sat several parties of 2  that barely waited 10 mins. They refused to push the tables together stating they only push tables of 4 or more together. So not only did people who only had 2 parties was sat before us. Parties of 4 or more got sat before us too. Asked for a manager and her response was that the average wait time. We basically got screwed for mediocre  food. Dont waste your time."

I believe if the music was coming over ceiling or wall speakers it wouldn't be so overpowering. The boom box at the register sort of over powers dining conversation experience.Invest in Surround sound!"
3/3/2018,4 star rating,"Small but good, don't come here with a large group of people. Place is best if your group is 2-4 people, we had a party of 9 and the wait was 1 1/2 hours. We stopped at the bar Cleao's next door for drinks while we waited. Parking is pretty good, parked right out front. Now to the real reason we came, food food food. The food was amazing from the county fried tomatoes to the homemade sides for dinner. Hence the 4 stars I gave them, only because of the food. I had the fried chicken, string beans, turkey spaghetti, Mac and cheese. For the appetizer we had jerk wings, bbq wings, fried green tomatoes, and fried shrimps(I don't eat seafood). Everything was amazing no complaints. Go check them out good food good music and good spot to Chile."
7/27/2019,5 star rating,Loved this restaurant. Best fried chicken ever and I am from the South originally. The salmon with shrimp over mashed potatoes was so tender tasty and melted in your mouth. The blackened catfish with shrimp was perfectly prepared. I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The staff could not be any nicer.
7/26/2019,3 star rating,"The decor is great, food is decent, service is alright, prices fair & music is a good blend. I guess the best thing is the location if you're looking to explore Westown.  Not a fan of the $10 corking fee & party of four gratuity add on. Definitely do an open table reservation, there's no waiting area & it's street parking. All in all definitely worth checking out, go support."
11/2/2017,5 star rating,"This is the absolute best food I've had in Chicago! It's so hard to choose what to try from the menu but if your first time definitely go for the buttermilk fried chicken. It's so fluffy flavorful. Besides the amazing food the ambiance of restaurant is awesome with beautiful paintings, marble tables, chandeliers and turfed sofas. You won't believe the meals are $15 on average! Won't be long before people are lined up down the block for this creole and soul food spot"
11/8/2018,5 star rating,So glad I didn't write a review on this place on my first visit because it was horrible. Decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. I had the New Orleans BBQ shrimp chicken spaghetti and asparagus and my honey had the fried chicken greens Mac and cheese and yams. Only way to describe it is mouth orgasm. On top of the food being top notch the service was impeccable. Jameil our server was absolutely a joy. Please give this black owned establishment a try you will not be disappointed.
11/20/2019,4 star rating,"I used to live in the south where I ate creole and soul food regularly, and have missed it since I moved up to the Midwest. This place is legit. We had an early dinner here midweek. Fried green tomatoes had a light crunchy breading, fried chicken was impeccably fried (the skin was crisp and not greasy), the sides we had were solid and pretty classic renditions (Mac & cheese with a little bit of garlic and breadcrumbs I think, collard greens, asparagus). But for me, the best thing by far was the shrimp and grits. GOOD LORD. I order this dish whenever it's on a menu, so I know that many restaurants do a terrible job with it, with rubbery, bland, congealed grits and unseasoned shrimp. Not Soulé. I don't know what they do to it -- a stick of butter? Worcestershire sauce? Perfectly cooked grits and seasoned shrimp? Cheese? Anyway, I couldn't stop eating it, and the portion was huge. Service was prompt and friendly, prices were fair for what you got, food was served super hot, and ambience is cool. Corkage fee was a bit high but otherwise, glad to have this in the neighborhood!"
5/17/2019,2 star rating,"So... on Ig everything looks very good and it was but this restaurant is very small. My food had a lot of flavor to it but was served room temperature. My greens were chilled, Mac N cheese was also good but warm and my lamb chops were warm. I like my food hot. I was hungry so ate my food but I was disappointed to. The hype of the restaurant seems a little overrated. You also cannot make reservations over the weekend so you have to wait a while to be seated. This restaurant is very very small it was five of us and we had to wait a while then sit by the door with everybody standing waiting to be seated. People was walking in to where the cook put the food at talking to the cooks or whoever was in the back. So unprofessional. This restaurant needs to expand or carry out only. I gave two stars because the food was seasoned good it probably taste better if it was hot."
2/18/2019,1 star rating,"Me and a few friends are here a couple of days ago... I will never go back! Can anyone explain to me why my crab leg claws are this dark??? I think they either burnt them, reheated them, they're old OR all of the above! I ended up eating them because my friends convinced me that it was the juice that made them appear dark however after cracking them, i saw that the meat was hard and kind of dried out! Not only that, they were very salty! The mashed potatoes were good and the corn was okay but I could tell that it had been sitting in water! Also, one of my friends ordered the fried chicken and it was very dry and on the salty side. This restaurant is overrated and I'm so disappointed because I was all excited because of the consistently great reviews. Never again!!!"
6/18/2019,4 star rating,Ok food was very good but it took them 45 mins to clear some tables then 20 mins to seat and reseat us then 1 hour for them to bring us our food they could fix this like hire more cooks or something because we waited 2 hours and 5 mins but we are gonna go back so we will see if this will get the fifth star.
2/3/2019,5 star rating,Really nice restaurant. Ordered the salmon and shrimp and that was truly good. The setting is nice and the music they were playing was great too!
11/11/2018,3 star rating,"I visited this restaurant on a very busy Saturday night.  The wait was over an hour. There was no designated area to actually stand and wait ... customers were standing around hovering over patrons and their dishes. Which was a bit invasive to me. This is a relatively small space better suited for a coffee shop-- in my opinion. But the decor and ambiance is great. Local artists' paintings adorn the walls. And they are for sale too! I ordered the catfish, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potatoes. The catfish was fried and seasoned to perfection! The macaroni and cheese was not good it had a garlicky taste the sweet potatoes were okay. We got there around seven o'clock and the sides were already dried out from sitting throughout the day (my assumption.) I would more than likely try this place again but definitely at a time in the day when it is less crowded."
1/5/2019,1 star rating,"Wow I wanted to like this place..  I took a cab all the way from the other side of town to try their food, as I really had a taste for soul food and they had good reviews. However from the moment I walked in the service was a nightmare. The staff was incredibly nonchalant, disrespectfully so. I literally stood directly in front of three of them for at least ten minutes without one person ever asking if I'd like to be seated, if I'd like to order, if I needed anything at all. As if I wasn't even there. I finally asked about seating, ordering, wait time, and finally if I could just order a meal to go, to which they surprisingly said no. Okay. So I waited about half an hour and ordered to dine there, which was even worse. Not one time did they initiate any part of my dining experience. I had to ask multiple times to order a beverage, to order food, to get SILVERWARE once my food actually came, to get a to-go container once I'd eaten some of my food (because how long can anyone truly sit through all of this??), and then to get a to go bag for my to-go container! I was through. And again, so sad as I really wanted to support their business and paid for cabs in both directions in order to do so."
12/30/2018,5 star rating,"Went to Soulé Chicago last night and the food was delicious. I had the fried catfish (fried to perfection), yams, dirty rice, fried green tomatoes & string beans w/white potatoes. They had to roll me out of there. Pretty chill atmosphere and they played all classic R&B. Will definitely be returning."
12/19/2018,4 star rating,"This was like a 3.5 star review because while the lamb was wonderfully cooked and seasoned, the sides were a miss. I believe Dirty Rice and asparagus came with this entree. The Dirty Rice was very salty which left me unable to eat it, (and I love salty food) and the asparagus was way over cooked, basically mush. However the lamb and the jerk shrimp were to die for! Please make sure to try those as they were really delicious! You couldn't substitute sides which a lot of restaurants do, so I did not inquire about sending the dish back. The service and atmosphere were all good, they even have a waitress that will sang if you catch the the right song on."
12/16/2018,4 star rating,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for Soule.  There were some really good points, but some items they need to work on that deterred from the experience.We got there early on Saturday night b/c they do not take reservations and it's a small place.  We had a 20 minute wait but that wasn't bad in our eyes.We started with the Jerk Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  We really enjoyed both dishes.  The jerk spice definitely had some kick and I really enjoyed the sauce with the tomatoes.  We almost got the wings, but a table down from us got them and they were covered with sauce.For entrees, we got the shrimp and grits and the fried chicken w/ mac and cheese and chicken spaghetti.  The shrimp and grits was quite good and the sauce with the grits was outstanding.  Very flavorable.  The chicken was also good - hot and moist.  Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty good.  And the bad - were the sides.  The mac and cheese was cold.  Not lukewarm, but downright cold.  Extremely disappointing.  I can't tell you how tired I am of getting food that is not hot.  The chicken spaghetti was lukewarm and while I liked the combination of ingredients (picture chicken tetrazzini), it was extremely rich and creamy.  Even if it had been hot, I'm not sure I could do more than a few bites.If I lived in the area, I would go back.  But I'm not sure it's worth the drive for the few great shrimp dishes."
12/10/2018,5 star rating,"Went here a couple days ago off the strength of a recommendation from a co-worker. Soule met and exceeded all expectations. There was a tiny bit of a wait but considering it was a packed house, they seated me and my two friends very fast. The service was welcoming and the food was perfectly cooked across the board. If you want quality Soul food and you want to support a black owned business, come to Soule. You won't regret it!"
12/3/2018,5 star rating,"Soule is becoming one of Chicago's gems. Amazing food, intimate environment, and reasonably price. Not to mention, black-owned. What could be better?!"
11/24/2018,5 star rating,When I say I cried when I took the first bite of my catfish I mean it. This is by far the best restaurant for soul food I've ever eaten at. The flavors are exceptional and the service and music really set the mood. They have hotsauce in fancy containers on the tables. I'm truly in black heaven.
11/20/2018,4 star rating,"Really really really really good food! Unassuming entrance with taste bud excitement behind the door. Quite welcoming environment. Our wait staff was wonderful!So the food is delicious! I started with an Arnold Palmer. It's was perfect--the proper amount of tea and lemonade. Since I eat ""clean"" the grilled lamb chops were a no-brainer! I had it with sweet potatoes and greens with turkey. Them greens 'tho...  It was a great balance. And the finale, peach cobbler! Not too sweet, not too tart. Just right!Thanks Soule for the excellent dining experience!"

11/10/2018,5 star rating,"Small but elegant restaurant with white tables and white booths. The atmosphere felt more like a fancy family get-together with everyone laidback and friendly. Food was ridiculously mouthwatering. Hard to choose because everything looked so delicious. I picked the fried chicken (dark meat), seasoned lightly, fried perfectly. Greens were heavenly with just enough heat and Mac & Cheese just downright good. My friend chose the catfish which she loved and the sweet potatoes which she inhaled before I had a chance to sample. Even the drinks were special, Soule Punch and Sweet Tea were ours. Lovely, attentive staff and special kudos to Destiny who was our server. Prices were very reasonable. My friend and I both agreed that we will be back. BYOB for those interested."
8/24/2018,5 star rating,"From the time my sister and I walked in to the time we left we were satisfied. From the warm smiles and exquisite design to the tasty food and sweet good byes. I ordered the salmon over mashed potatoes with a flavorful cream sauce that sent me over the top. It was cooked to perfection and was a very helpful portion size. My sister ordered the catfish, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potato's. She was very satisfied and so was I, of course I had to taste hers too lol. Then following lunch they had a made from scratch chocolate cake with chocolate icing. It was so bomb. Now I live in the south and there's nothing here that can compare to Soule. I definitely will be back the next time I visit Chicago."
1/14/2018,5 star rating,"The food is CRAAAAAZY GOOD, and the service is TOP NOTCH!!!Thus is the FIRST restaurant I've ever been to where ALL the food was SO GOOD until it was hard for me to decide on what I was going to eat!ALL THUMBS WAY UP!!!"
12/13/2019,1 star rating,"I had high hopes for this place BUT SMH...The place is really small but cute. The food was not good at all, I love my food well seasoned but their catfish was way to salty and had a slimy fishy flavor, the chicken spaghetti was DROWNED in SAGE to the point whr it tasted like creamy Thanksgiving day dressing. Even the candy yams was over seasoned with far to much sugar and nutmeg, I don't think they used cinnamon at all, if so I couldn't taste it because of how overly sweet the yams whr and the yams was also smushed, it looked like baby food. The jerk chicken wings was a little dry. The fried green tomatoes was the best thing I had but they give u very little of whteva sauce they drizzle on top. I should've asked for more. And the waiters are young girls without much hospitality at all, I even seen one waitress get an attitude & rolled her eyes at a customer. And last but maybe least they have 2 bathrooms but both of them are unisex, I hate having to use a restroom behind men."
3/20/2020,5 star rating,"Always great food and friendly service! Ordered the catfish on Uber eats today and was nervous about the quality being delivered! Still crunchy and seasoned to perfection as always! Me and my friends can't get enough of this place! I'll be dining in as soon as things are backup and running! If you're looking for great vibes, even better food and friendly hands on ownership this is the place! It's also byob can't beat it"
8/5/2018,5 star rating,"Here's the deal. Came here on a Sunday evening and we waited a good hour to be seated BUT it was worth it. We started off with the  fried green tomatoes. DO NOT SKIP THE TOMATOES!!Jesus laid hands on the chef for real!!! I split them with a friend and our friendship may have been tested in that moment they were so good! For dinner, I ordered the lamb chops with greens and Mac and cheese. My friend had the shrimp n grits with the yams and greens. So these lamb chops right... I'd skip them honestly. You get 3 and they are super tiny. You'll feel like you are on a diet and didn't know it. I asked for medium but they came well done. I did send it back and they suggested I order something else. I chose the catfish and it came out so quickly I knew it was going to be horrible... NOPE! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, piping hot. The greens were pretty good, very peppery. The Mac and cheese was awesome. I tried my friend's shrimp and Grits, some of the best I've had in Chicago, Seriously!!! A little piece of heaven. Last but not least, the yams were pretty good too. Service was wonderful and management stopped by our table and asked us about the food which was overall spectacular! Definitely try this place out for some good soul food!"
3/18/2019,5 star rating,omg this food so amazing i make sure i visit at least three time a week this restaurant is a must try the owner an staff amazing nice small boutique restaurant.... i been supporting her for years before the restaurant if you visiting chicago stop by
11/8/2018,5 star rating,"This was my second time at Soule, and I can't wait to go back for more. I came with two friends on a Wednesday night expecting the wait to be short, but we ended up waiting for 30mins. I've gotta say it was worth the wait! We got the Fried Chicken, Lamb, and Shrimp and Grits - all were very good choices. The Mac at Soule is one of the best out there imo, rarely do I describe macaroni as 'decadent' but theirs really was! Their chocolate cake was good, reminded me kind of Portillo's. I've never had peach cobbler before but now I think I'm gonna start getting it because the one I had at Soule's was good - not too sweet and paired perfectly with vanilla ice cream. It's starting to get cold out in Chicago so if the line gets too long, people end up waiting outside. I think they have a check-in list where they can also get your phone number; that way they can call when your table is almost ready. I'm looking forward to dining here again. Such a great place!"
1/1/2020,1 star rating,"Well, it's New Years Day and Disappointment is an understatement. I made my reservation for 7pm on Saturday in the excitement of my past experiences at Soule. Food has been great and service was amazing. I had a friend visiting from out of town and I have been raving about this restaurant. I get to the restaurant and there was NO reservation for me. The hostess told me he didn't see my name and I specifically remember speaking to him when i made the reservation. The reservation system is laughable. The line was out the door. Needless to say, I left the restaurant in pure disappointment. Soulè, i know this review won't mean much to you especially when you have lines out the door but you have lost me as a customer."
3/4/2020,5 star rating,"I absolutely love the vibe of this restaurant. The art on the wall is captivating and the music definitely makes me feel at home. The servers were very hospitable as if I was down south getting pure southern hospitality. Robert was so welcoming and had an amazing energy. He definitely cared and put effort to ensure that we got everything we needed and enjoyed our experience. The food definitely matched the southern hospitality as well! The meals were beyond flavorful and full of love and passion. You can tell they care about each plate that is put out. I honestly had the BEST sweet potatoes I've ever had here. I had the blackened catfish and shrimp. It came with the dirty rice which was on point! They used turkey for the dirty rice and Robert explained to me that they don't have any pork or beef items which was very important for me. Also, the Soulé punch is a HIT honey. The bathrooms were super cute too and very clean! All in all I had an amazing experience here and will definitely be coming back. Quick tip: come early or on a weekday. Due to the cozy atmosphere it can fill up quickly. I came on a Sunday an hour after they opened and there was a two hour wait. Make a reservation if you can!"
11/2/2018,4 star rating,"Great vibe, and amazing service. Fried green tomatoes and jerk shrimp was my favorite. I don't know what they put in the greens, but I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY PUT IN THE GREENS!!! I swear they took me back to my childhood. Haven't had soul food that good since I lived at home. Keep up the good work guys, you're on to something huge! We will be back"
6/18/2018,5 star rating,"From the appetizer , to the lovely owner , to the bbq ribs , to the fried chicken and even the scraps of cornbread we sampled ... this place is a true Chicago Gem! I love small intimate restaurants like this one ! I cannot say anything bad about this place. Very clean , and well maintained. Bathrooms are clean and wait times are decent. On Father's Day, we dined in and took about 25 minutes for us to get seated. It's safe to say, THIS IS THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANTS IN CHICAGO.! I've been all around the US eating soul food and honestly, Chicago needs you Soulè! Nothing like it :)"
10/20/2018,2 star rating,"Let me start off by saying the food was great. The catfish was cooked perfectly, mac and cheese was great. The customer service on the other hand was lacking. Upon entering, I was directed to a bar to wait to be seated, and even thought it wasn't busy It took about 10 mins for me to be seated. The waitress wasn't exactly pleasant. She might've been having a bad day but she hardly said a word. When I received my food she never came back to check if I needed anything or if I was enjoying my meal. Its just certain things I expect from a server when I decide to dine-in at an establishment. I want to support this place but its hard when I feel like I wasn't valued as a customer. Ive had a discussion about Soulé with a few other people and they have had similar experiences, which sucks because the food is so good."
10/19/2018,5 star rating,Still sitting at the restaurant haven't paid my bill and my food was so good that I had to share it with someone immediately. First time customer had the salmon and shrimp over mashed potatoes with a side of asparagus for my entree and fried green tomatoes. Everything was perfectly cooked. My entree was an automatic favorite and I will definitely be back! The fried green tomatoes were so good I'm sitting considering order some to take with. Staff is extremely friendly. The menu has enough options that I'm sure I will be back to update this review. Not one negative thing I would say and I'm a very particular eater.
1/25/2020,3 star rating,It was an hour wait and the place is really small. They had a small waiting area in the back. And when seated was all tight together. The food wasn't the best. The chicken was good but their sides was not that great. This place was not better than Soul Shack.
12/23/2017,3 star rating,"Soule has a lot of potential!  Great location, nice and intimate space, friendly and cheerful staff are all incredibly positive attributes.  The food, unfortunately, is incredibly disappointing.  The mains that we had - fried chicken and lamb chops - were spot on, and delicious.  The sides that we had - sweet potatoes, mac-n-cheese, creamed corn, dirty rice and green beans - were all underwhelming and under-seasoned.  Mostly because they are, admittedly by the owner (or maybe she was the Manager), not freshly prepared.  I will bet anyone $1 that the dirty rice is Zatarain's out the box.  The most offensive side dish is the creamed corn.  It actually looked and tasted like creamed style corn from a can.  When asked for feedback about the meal, I suggested that the corn was canned and was told ""it's not all canned; we mix in frozen too"".  In response to my flabbergasted look, I was asked ""you don't think we're back there shucking corn, do you?""  Actually, I don't think you're back there shucking corn because corn is out of season.  My bad for even ordering it.  To say that I want to see Soule succeed would be an understatement.  It's really a nice place off the beaten path that is great for a date nite, grabbing dinner with a group of friends, or even a family celebration dinner.  Soule needs to re-evaluate its kitchen prep practices and strive to use fresh ingredients to make inventive sides to compliment the mains that are executed well.Hoping for the best; I will be back!"

1/6/2019,1 star rating,"Horrible! Lost for words! Where's gram-marly when I need it?Absolute waste of my time and money. It was like a Cirque du Soule' show called This has to be a Joke!Host station unwelcoming and a crowd of workers so busy co-mingling I had to ask to be seated.No desserts available Some sides unavailable.The atmosphere is literally watching all the servers co-mingle in the host areas appearing as guests. Some even eating in the dining room, setting food down and then proceeding to assist anyone other than guests.Watched one staff sweep and half clean a table for 2 guests while everyone was just stationary. No team work. Oh and the table was still dirty as one guest refused to sit.If your diabetic bring your own bottle. Pure Leaf Unsweetened Ice Tea Sams Club $14.99 a case. Oh BYOB! Left pretty much the entire meal on the table as I graciously paid and then finally they ask was something wrong. Yes me being here! The Wall that Trump wants. And did I mention me being here.I own a few successful businesses. I would have fired everyone in here if I had come in and witnessed this chaos. For the one who asked who has that cologne on it was me. Salvatore Ferragamo!Period!"

I found myself slamming the entire meal before I could leave my parking spot! And the prices are reasonable! However, I'm not a fan of them only doing take out orders during weekdays. They will see my face more often from now on!"

8/10/2018,2 star rating,"I have to say that I really had high hope for Soule...The decor was super cute and I love soul food. The service wasn't great, but OK.   The Soule punch tasted like watery Kool-Aid and if it wasn't for the hot sauce, the fried green tomatoes would have had no flavor. But the entrees were horrible!! The shrimp and grits was very soupy and like the greens, super vinegary!! And can you please tell me who puts cream of mushroom soup in mac & cheese?? Even with the soup, it was bland! The sweet potatoes were syrupy sweet and not in a good way. Again, save the hot sauce, the catfish would have had no flavor!  Anyone who has a mother, aunt, granny, etc...who made soul food for their family would be VERY disappointed! We REALLY wanted to like it, but neither me or my friend enjoyed dinner tonight..."
3/15/2018,5 star rating,My first time here and will definitely be back. The food was the best soul food I've had in quite some time. My husband and I ordered the jerk wings and fried green tomatoes for appetizers. The jerk wings had such a great smoky flavor and phenomenal heat. The fried green tomatoes were lightly breaded and very well executed. For our entrees I ordered the lamb chops with asparagus and sweet potatoes and my husband ordered the catfish with greens and mac and cheese. We were both so impressed with the interesting spin on flavor in such classic dishes. We took our desert home since we forgot that it was a BYOB and wanted to enjoy our cobbler and cake with a nice glass of wine. The chef and waiter were both so nice to put the icing on the cake. Hope you readers find your way to this true gem

Server was awesome and gave us free mac n cheese (which was beautiful beyond description) and the chicken spaghetti! We ordered the jerk shrimp and fried green tomatoes as an app. Fried green tomatoes were good but the jerk shrimp was AMAZING.

Once the waiter was there she didn't introduce herself she just took out order and left. She didn't even bring our food to us the waiter serving the table next to us did. Food was pretty basic and a little salty but nothing spectacular. Tried it, but I'm sure I won't be back."

The Greens makes you wanna slap yo mama. I love my momma but she can get it after these greens. The dirty rice made it feel like I was in the south on a hot ass day eating some fire with the whole city on my shoulder. The greens are the best I ever had and I know about dem green look ya boi up..  it's like what E40 said turn up like a vegetable talking about this vegetable I'm on this medical. I Came out here with my homey who is from the south and he said best greens in Chicago and that's on mommas and dem.
10/11/2019,1 star rating,Spent 30 minutes in the establishment with no one asked if we wanted to order. It was 15 before a girl with red hair slammed our water down. The servers  walked past us   not one made eye contact. A guy with a shaved side pony tail said that's why he likes to only serve white people. I'm confused because we would have spent money to support a black owner. I wish I could give negative stars. Like negative ten stars. I will never go back and tell who recommended the place to not go back
10/11/2019,1 star rating,"This was most definitely the worst establishment I've been to. The service was awful. We didn't even get our food. We sat there for over 20 mins and watched several people who came in after get waited on and served. Is there some sort of dress code or something? The staff refused to serve me and my friend. On top of that I hear one of the staff members say ""I don't serve those type of blacks."" What does that even mean? If I could give this place a Zero stars I would. The funny thing is I was going to spend a lot of money. So me and my friend just got up and left as soon as we walked out the door they immediately came to our table and got our drinks of water which confirmed they refused to serve us."
8/8/2019,1 star rating,"I would've loved to taste the food as I've heard it's really good. Unfortunately, I made the trip to try it on Saturday and was turned around because we were a party of six. I've never heard of such a policy. It was disappointing because there was no indication on the site or otherwise that I would be turned around at the door."
6/30/2019,1 star rating,"Came to this establishment 3 times and still have not been able to be seated. Drove 40 minutes. I was definitely looking forward to coming to eat at this restaurant because so many people say it's good. Everytime we come here, the wait it longer than 90 minutes and their hostess is not as nice as others. Their restaurant is LITERALLY smaller than my living room. They honestly need to expand it or relocate. They are losing customers by having such a long wait time and a small establishment. Do better Soule!"
8/3/2019,4 star rating,This was my first time at this place and I had a good experience. The food was really good. And they passed the sweet potato test which is my favorite souls food side. My only complaint were issues with gnats.
11/1/2017,5 star rating,Great service and food. We will back and spread the word to stop in to support black own restaurant.
6/23/2019,4 star rating,"Great food, great vibe.. the food gets 5 stars but I give it a 4  because the wait time was 1 1/2 hours. They need a bigger location.. I will be back though."
4/26/2019,1 star rating,"Although the service was five star, unfortunately the food was so salty it was inedible.  We had the Cajun BBQ shrimp, the jerk wings, the fried chicken white meat which was dry, mac and cheese which tasted like noodles and velveeta cheese, the greens omg the salt, and dirty rice which tasted like salty starchy reheated box rice. Everything was just so salty we couldn't eat anything. Not to mention they ran out of cornbread and  sweet potatoes at 7 pm on a Friday night.  It's a shame because it's a cute little place with great service.  Perhaps if the owner was there to supervise her cooks the food would have been better I don't know. But as it stands I wouldn't recommend Soulé to anyone."
1/7/2018,5 star rating,Came to feast on the scrumptous dinner last night and I was immersed with excellent food and ambience . Thanks for the care you showed to every detail ! Will be back !
9/23/2018,5 star rating,"The wait was 45 minutes, but worth it! I hope they open another location!! The food is fantastic and the place was packed to the max. Catfish was very good!!"
7/7/2019,1 star rating,"Whoever is looking to come here DONT. They took my order got my phone number and name, and then when I came 30mins later (which is the time they told me to come get the food) they told me they where OUT of lamb chops! So they did not place the order. All around it isn't a good place to go, they are extremely ghetto and loud. Im glad I spent my 50$ else where."
9/6/2019,3 star rating,"This restaurant has an amazing atmosphere, however, it is a little congested. The music was phenomenal and something that EVERYONE could enjoy. The crowd was very mixed, not just blacks, but everyone.  I ordered the Salmon and Shrimp with a side of Creamed Corn and Spaghetti w/ Chicken. I can say that the entrée was a bit dry and chewy. Not how I like my salmon AT ALL although the sauce was very flavorful. The sides that I ordered were phenomenal though. My friend or the chicken and his sides were yams and Mac and cheese. He stated that the chicken was sub par and nothing to really rave about. The yams were really good and the Mac and cheese was really dry. We boat chose the have the Soulé punch which was essentially kool aid. To finish off our meals for dessert we had the peach cobbler; this is a MUST try. Will I be back to visit. I'm pretty sure I will. I love a place with good vibes."
5/28/2019,1 star rating,Long wait for no reason. Try hard to support small businesses but this is why we don't
6/30/2018,4 star rating,"We feasted on the fried catfish, fried chicken, greens, mac n cheese, dirty rice, & green beans. The food was delish & seasoned to perfection! A must try!"
6/29/2019,2 star rating,Staff was nice but not attentive. I felt like we waited forever for a to go order. We watched ppl after us get their food. I'm not from Chicago so soul food here could be different but the food wasn't anything to brag about.
8/28/2019,5 star rating,In Chicago celebrating my sister's birthday went to Soule and the food was amazing. Everyone who works there is extremely friendly.  I ordered Salmon and Shrimp. There was so much food (which is a good thing) couldn't eat it all. The atmosphere is great.  The manager took time out of his busy day to talk to us and answer all of our questions.  I hope this business continues to do well.  If you're in Chicago you have to check this place out.  Plan to go back on my next visit.
11/11/2017,5 star rating,"Soule just opened and the food is INCREDIBLE!! It is hard to find good soul food. They definitely didnt just go through the motions to create this menu. Everything was made like real soul food should be. I had the catfish, fried green tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and greens. Plus, they were so accommodating for a large group, the music was on point, and so hospitable. Can't rave about them enough.."
8/27/2018,5 star rating,Soooo good..customer service was excellent as well. My second trip & I live in Evergreen Park...
6/24/2018,5 star rating,"What can I say. If you want good soul food in Chicago this is the place to go. Even with a small menu selection there are no bad options and the portions are great. I couldn't even finish my food and that's rare. The ambiance is nice, the staff is good, and the food is great. I will definitely be back here on a regular basis. It is BYOB, however there is a 10$ service charge. Black owned and operated and they will definitely be supported by me."
2/25/2018,4 star rating,"Beautiful quaint little restaurant with gorgeous art work and friendly staff! There was a wait but the owner and waiter kept us abreast of the status of our table which was appreciated. They have the best play list which added to the overall experience. I ordered the Soule punch, shrimp and grits, greens, Cajun rice and Mac and Cheese. The shrimp and grits were so good. My only recommendation would be to cut back on the gravy because it overpowers the texture of the grits and takes away from the creamy consistency. They can really save money by cutting the gravy in half and not compromise the flavor! The greens, punch and Mac and cheese were really good. I didn't care for the rice as it was too salty. I also had a piece of my friends chocolate cake that she ordered and it was very light and not overly sweet! It tasted like a brownie cake mixed with a cloud of heaven! I will definitely be back. Like one of the post mentioned, I think this place has a lot of potential and I really hope they consider some of the recommendations here cause they have something special! Next COME TO THE HYDE PARK AREA!!!!! The staff and owner really make this place. There pride, positive attitude and apparent desire to provide a quality experience would bring me back alone!"

6/23/2018,5 star rating,This food was so good! Probably one of the best restaurants(taste wise) that I've been to in Chicago. I've lived in Chicago born and raised for 26 years. I'm a total foodie and love trying new places. I've never even wrote a Yelp review but this food was so good that I had to write one for this restaurant. omg so good.  10/10
6/21/2018,1 star rating,"The food was good. I believe they charge too much for the portion sizes. I had the lamb chops which came with 3 but they are too small to be charging $18 just for the lamp chops! Not including the price of the sides. I had the Mac and cheese which were really good! The greens were way too salty for my liking, my friend didn't eat hers either. I was seated right away but we waited 30 min just to order and then another 30 min to receive our food. The table next to us came well after us and got their food before us. We didn't have a waiter. We had to constantly stop waiters and ask for certain things, even to order! They didnt refill our glasses like most restaurants do. Overall i was not happy with our first time experience. Not sure if it was just that day or what! the place is not big at all, so it's not like waiters were too busy to serve you. I probably won't be coming back."
6/18/2018,5 star rating,"From the appetizer , to the lovely owner , to the bbq ribs , to the fried chicken and even the scraps of cornbread we sampled ... this place is a true Chicago Gem! I love small intimate restaurants like this one ! I cannot say anything bad about this place. Very clean , and well maintained. Bathrooms are clean and wait times are decent. On Father's Day, we dined in and took about 25 minutes for us to get seated. It's safe to say, THIS IS THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANTS IN CHICAGO.! I've been all around the US eating soul food and honestly, Chicago needs you Soulè! Nothing like it :)"
6/18/2018,5 star rating,"Very amazing experience! From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt like royalty. And you think the service is the only thing impeccable? The food is phenomenal! I travel a lot and I've always said Atlanta has the best food. Well the owner of this restaurant officially SINGLE HANDEDLY put Chicago back on the map!!! We had the shrimp and grits, chicken, catfish, ribs, jerk shrimp, and jerk chicken!!! Every bite of food was seasoned to perfection and delicious!!! I will be back ..... A lot lol"
6/18/2018,4 star rating,"The hype is real. We went on a Sunday afternoon. Usually parking in the area is difficult but we found s spot around the corner and parking is free on Sundays. The place is tiny but very cute. They were understaffed that day and we had to wait about an hour before we were seated. However, the food was well worth the wait. We had the bbq shrimp appetizer which was delicious. For entrees we I had the fried catfish with greens and macaroni. They were having a special on bbq ribs and baked beans so that's what my partner ordered. Everything was extremely fresh. The food was piping hot when it was served to us. Piping hot and delicious. I also ordered peach cobbler to go and that didn't disappoint. I'd definitely visit again and again. I plan on recommending it to my friends. You should go too!! You may have to wait a little bit for a table but it's totally worth it."
6/10/2018,5 star rating,I took the family to Soule a few months ago. Excellent service and food. Reminded me of home. Sweet potatos were great.
6/2/2018,5 star rating,Amazing! It's been a long time since I've been to a dining establishment where EVERYTHING I ordered was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I kid you not!! Please make your way to Chicago Avenue and Damen and let Soule' make your day! Tell them Kim the food blogger sent you! #DivineDineFoodieTours #WillTravelforFood

7/19/2019,5 star rating,I was extremely upset I couldn't shake all the cooks and the owners hand. My mf food was good. I haven't been this satisfied in a while. #DetroitVisitor #226365
7/15/2019,5 star rating,My friends and I revisited Soule restaurant and this time around the service was great. Rob took care of us and he was kind and professional. Food was great as well. We had the salmon and shrimp along with the fried chicken with multiple sides and everything was great! We definitely plan on returning and I recommend this restaurant to everyone. Can't wait to go back!
7/5/2019,1 star rating,"My husband, myself, and our friends recently had an unfortunate experience with Soule. We arrived around 8:50 pm and was informed that it would be a 45 minute wait, which was expected. However, we ended up waiting a little longer than 45 minutes (total of 1 hour and 10 minutes) which we weren't excited about, but nevertheless we still wanted to stay and enjoy our meal. After waiting over an hour and being seated we were informed that there was no more greens, sweet potatoes, salmon and shrimp, shrimp and grits, dirty rice, blackened fish, or desserts. Of course, we were completely shocked; despite this, we still wanted to stay and eat. We began placing our ordering, but while placing our order the waitress stops and starts having a full blown conversation and laughing with another employee. This was very unprofessional, but we realized that majority of the waitresses/staff were young so we just brushed it off. Once the waitress was done with her conversation, we placed our order, but then waitress comes back and informs us there was no more macaroni and cheese.  Even though there was practically nothing left, we STILL wanted to give the restaurant a try, but then while we were debating about what else we could order, we were informed by the waitress that we needed to arrive earlier if we wanted food as this (Soule restaurant) is a boutique restaurant and due to it being a boutique restaurant they run out of food often.Now, this is when we were completely done with this place. We couldn't understand how someone can tell you what time you should come and eat. If this is a restaurant that doesn't close until 10:00 pm then one would think that there would be enough food until closing time. In addition, when the waitresses were informed that they were running low on food it would have been nice, as a courtesy, to inform the people who had been waiting for over an hour that the food quantity was limited versus allowing us to wait. As mentioned above, majority of the staff were young which contributed to our unfortunate experience.  Not knowing how to provide professional customer service is a problem. We were really disappointed with our first experience with this restaurant and was looking forward to enjoying our dinner with our friends. After this experience I'm not sure that we would ever go back again."
7/12/2018,5 star rating,"I have been looking for a great Soul food restaurant for a while now. I've found just that!!!! The food was amazing, the service was Great. I ordered the fried Catfish with Greens and Mac n Cheese, everything was seasoned to perfection. I invited four of my friends and my son. Everyone loved their food no complaints. Thank you so much, you just gained a loyal customer."
5/5/2019,2 star rating,"I agree with a previous reviewer this place is an oversized closet.That said the food isn't bad...it just not that good,its average,very average at best.The staff while nice were just not that experienced in the restaurant industry,they couldn't be,they appeared to be 17,18 years old.Theres nothing wrong with hiring your relatives but come on!Sooo if average tasting soul food is your thing this is your place.Oh yeah they dont accept weekend reservations so be prepared to feed the meter for a couple of hours,the end!"
7/7/2019,5 star rating,I don't usually write reviews but the service and food I received today was simply amazing! My boyfriend and I went here for brunch and were blown away at how quickly we were served. The food was hot and seasoned well. The staff was attentive and friendly!
5/3/2019,4 star rating,"Let me start with the food was great. I got catfish, greens, and cream corned. This help make up for the amount of time it took to get the food (over an hour). However, I will say the food came out piping hot and fresh.  This establishment is really small so it gets crowded very fast.  I would say that you should make reservations if possible. My waitress was very nice and the service was good. Unfortunately I saw too many employees walking around looking unhappy. The music was a bit loud but overall it was good."
11/3/2018,2 star rating,The food was not good. The fried green tomatoes was not all the way done the food left a after taste in my mouth and we smell like grease. The server jameil was not a good server we had to ask other servers for things. Jameil tried to use the kitchen as an excuse for his horrible service. I DID NOT leave a tip because we didn't get the proper service. They need a new hostess cause she does not smile. If her eyes was a knife the other customer would have been cut up.
6/30/2019,1 star rating,I was looking forward into coming to this restaurant because so many people was raving about how good it was so i decided to give it a try with my girls. Mind you i came to this restaurant about 3x and out of those 3x driving about 50 mins I still have NOT got a chance to eat here because of this so called extensive wait they have. The host or hostess lady is extremely rude anytime we come here which i feel like it's very unprofessional. This place needs to honestly expand or relocate. I drive down here 3x and i will not driving down here again they need to do better.
2/14/2019,5 star rating,"I just left the restaurant and the food was so good. I didn't have any expectations because I came across the restaurant after looking up another restaurant. I got the fried catfish, Mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. My first bite was like heaven. I haven't had good soul food since moving to Chicago. The space is limited and it takes a little while to be seated but the food is definitely worth the wait. Also it's great to see a black owned business thriving. All of the employees were friendly and I appreciated the owner being so hands on and taking the time to ask how my food was."
7/29/2018,5 star rating,Love this place. I'm fromLos Angeles and just moved here in chi and when i came here the vibes was so dope. The food was amazing and as well as the service. I'll be coming here again :)
1/20/2018,4 star rating,"Although it took some time for my food to come out, it was worth the wait. Everything was well seasoned and the peach cobbler was absolute fire. Family owned and run business sandwiched between random stuff on Chicago Ave. Definitely a place to check out. The ambiance is nice but it's super casual."
6/2/2019,4 star rating,"Great good! Amazing flavor and great size portions. We had the shrimp and grits and fried chicken. Both were great! Service was OK, the owner stopped by to say hello and she was lovely, I just wish they had changed their smoke detector battery, it was beeping during our entire meal. We live down the street so we'll be back!"
1/14/2018,5 star rating,"For starters awesome food! Had the fried catfish with sweet potatoes, green beans and banana pudding; and it was really good. Most of the staff was great, although one staffer must have been having a bad day. However, they don't offer pickup orders, I repeat pickup orders, on weekends because their too busy, but they accommodated me despite their unusual policy. All in all I'm glad they're in the neighborhood and I'll certainly return."
5/23/2019,5 star rating,Phenomenal food and phenomenal service! I felt like family and the food was amazingly delicious!
4/2/2018,4 star rating,"Very good food. Excellent customer service. Good choice in music which created a nice vibe while eating. Tried to go on a Saturday night, was very crowded with it being small in size. Other than that i have no complaints. I was well pleased."
4/21/2019,5 star rating,Rob is the bomb!!! Gr8 food n gr8 service. I absolutely love love love Soulé. Rob thanks for making us feel right at hm in the kitchen!!!
6/2/2018,5 star rating,"We took our Mom here for her birthday last night. When I say great food excellent service, good music. I want to say Thanks to the owner and her staff for such a great experience I had the collard greens catfish mac & cheese candid sweet potatoes, one of my nieces had lamb chops and she loved them, and it's tough to find good lamb at any restaurant. I heard my nephew say the chicken spaghetti was the bomb. Overall everyone's food was delicious  barbecue wings as well as the jerk wings were delicious also. You can't go wrong when eating here everything that we ordered was Delicious including the cornbread"
4/9/2019,5 star rating,I keep reading these reviews and people talking about the size of it. It's a shame you're so focused on that!! Well I  love the quaintness it feels more intimate and family oriented.  The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. Everytime I've come here or sent someone they have left full and pleased.  The owner makes sure she come out and meet and greet customers when able to. We are oh so quick to put down these black establishments but are understanding to non black establishments. To the owner and the staff continue to bask in the glory that is Soule!! I wish you nothing but abundant success.
1/10/2018,5 star rating,One of the best restaurants I've tried since moving to Chicago! Food and atmosphere is amazing. You will not be disappointed!!!
1/7/2018,5 star rating,Delicious food! Great hospitality and customer service! I forgot my credit card at this establishment and the owner personally delivered it to my hotel. Will definitely eat here again when I return to Chicago.
1/7/2018,5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING! The food was delicious and they have a extraordinary staff! Everyone were friendly, the food wait wasn't long. I went with two other people and we all had different things, so I had the opportunity i try little bit of other things and they all were great. Our waiter Robert was great and attentive even when the place started to get busy. Bebe was also great, the cooks were even friendly. I will be back to this place and suggest everyone to try it."
9/16/2018,1 star rating,"Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to eat here. The one star is a customer service issue and not a rating of the food. I'm here from Los Angeles and Soule was highly recommended.  They close at 9pm and I arrived there, from the south side of Chicago, around 7:50pm. Upon arriving several waitresses watched us as we were waiting to be seated. When a young lady finally approached us, she was nice if that helps; She informed us that the owner said not to take anyone else. We were turned away because our name wasn't on a list. I asked if takeout was offered, and was told not on weekend days. It is a really small establishment, I'm happy they seem to be doing well. However, if you are going to have these type of business practices then it should definitely be posted on the website. We close at 9, but we will not seat you or offer takeout after a certain time or certain days, or after certain hours."
11/25/2017,2 star rating,"A friend of mine recommended this place, and when we went for dinner there... Our experience had her regretting even telling me about it. The food was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the dirty rice we ordered, but the service we had from the server was what really turned me off. It took her a while to come and take our order because she was gossiping with another female worker by the bar. Its not too big of a restaurant to lose track of tables. Mind you, it wasn't busy that day either. I know it's a new location but I feel like it's more things that needed to be finished before actually rushing into opening it to customers."
2/25/2019,5 star rating,"I really wish I remembered my servers name it was a guy a couple times and one time it was a lady but  all the  times I've been there always very nice. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it all taste so good. Last time I was there a woman walked around asking everyone about there food which is always nice for the owner to socialize with guest. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but to be honest the foods so good idc. I'm pretty sure they'll get a bigger restaurant how good the food is. I would say my top pick is the blackened catfish over dirty rice, the chicken spaghetti and the greens well everything even the hot wings smh I choose."
11/12/2017,5 star rating,I went and was not disappointed. Everything I had was very very tasty!!! Check them out. My favorite is the macaroni and cheese!!!!
8/4/2018,5 star rating,"This place serves the best soul food I have ever eaten. The menu is limited so every dish is cooked to perfection. They let you take your time with the food and let me tell you it's worth the wait. My table got the crab legs, salmon, lamb chops, and shrimp and grits. Every person scraped their plate clean. Be prepared to spend the whole evening, but it's worth it. Great date place. Five stars and I will definitely be back! BYOB!"
12/3/2018,5 star rating,"Soule is becoming one of Chicago's gems. Amazing food, intimate environment, and reasonably price. Not to mention, black-owned. What could be better?!"
9/16/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome food, Awesome service!!! We will return. The catfish was on point and the chicken crisp to perfection.  The sides (mac, sweet potatoes, greens) were to die for!  They ran out of peach cobbler towards the end of the night but I will be back to try it..heard it was bomb!"
9/6/2018,4 star rating,This was nice intimate spot. I will go again and recommend to my friends. The catfish was seasoned well.  The greens were really good had a nice kick to them with turkey meat. I also got the chicken spaghetti which Was was not what I expected. It wasn't bad it was just different. Only thing is u will have to wait because it's not very big. The only other thing it was sooo hot in the restaurant I was sweating.
9/17/2018,3 star rating,We went to Soule on a Sunday...they do not take reservations on weekends. The wait was an hour then another 20 minutes for someone to take our order and another 45 minutes before the food arrived. Very nice decor however the sofa seems to be a bit worn which causes you to sink down as you're trying reach your food on the table. I had the fried chicken (dark meat) with yams & mac and cheese. I received a thigh and two legs. Chicken was right out of the grease...super hot just the way I like it. Very light seasoning so nothing to write home about. The legs were fine but the thigh had an odor as if it had been left to thaw too long out on a counter somewhere. My daughter had the same meal and the exact same thing. Her chicken legs were fine but the thighs smelled spoiled. Mac & cheese was ok but the yams were delicious. I did inform the waitress about the chicken but nothing was done about it. Mgr didn't come over...no apology or adjustment to the bill. My husband had the fried catfish and his was fine...nice and fresh.
11/16/2017,5 star rating,"Wow. Soule is such a great spot. The food is absolutely incredible. Seriously so delicious. We started with the fried green tomatoes that are sliced nice and thin and just lightly breaded; the breading has the perfect kick to it. Definitely among the best fried green tomatoes I've ever had...and I spend a good amount of time eating in the South. We also had a side of the chicken spaghetti as an appetizer. It was so creamy and flavorful. A perfect dish for a cold night. My boyfriend had the catfish with dirty rice and asparagus for his main course. I had shrimp and grits. Everything was outstanding and we both enjoyed everything on our plates. The grits were so so soooooo good. The portions were huge and we both were too full for dessert, but I'll definitely be back to try the peach cobbler. Aside from awesome, amazing food, what really sets Soule apart is the great service and overall vibe of the place. Everyone is really warm and personable. There's great art work on the walls and comfortable booths as well as great music (the Fugees when we were there!). The overall vibe combined with the comfort food makes you feel more like you're a guest for dinner in someone's home than eating at a restaurant...and that's a very good thing! Soule is an amazing addition to the West Town neighborhood and absolutely worth traveling to from other parts of the city. Definitely a new go to spot!"
10/5/2018,5 star rating,"This place was the bomb. Didn't meet Bridget but I love her. Good, service, value A+++"
11/4/2017,5 star rating,"We asked the waitress for a recommendation and she told us the BBQ Shrimp was life changing, so we went for it. We were NOT disappointed. It was this really light BBQ and they serve it over French bread so the bread is soggy on the inside and crispy and flaky on the outside. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Everything else we had was great, the service was amazing, and it's BYOB. A really amazing addition to the area!"
6/23/2018,5 star rating,Excellent!!! This spot is  shrimp and grits . Good customer service and appropriate pricing.
9/25/2018,5 star rating,"This place came highly recommended. At first the wait time completely turned me off... However the service and food makes up for it. The food is absolutely DELICIOUS   , savory and fulfilling. The staff was super friendly and professional. We even got to meet the chief who is just as wonderful as her cooking. I was in a group and sampled some of everything and NOTHING disappointed.  I'll be back, I don't mind waiting."
4/10/2018,5 star rating,"Tonight was my first time at Soule and I will definitely be back. I ordered fried green tomatoes for my appetizer, the fried chicken dinner (with mac & cheese and green beans as sides) and had the peach cobbler for dessert. Everything tasted amazing! The food was flavorful, cooked just right, and definitely made from scratch. I also loved the ambiance of the restaurant; the small dining area and R&B music playing made me feel like I was at home with family. I love that a Black owned restaurant is in this area, not far from my job. Everyone needs to come here for some good soul food."
9/6/2018,5 star rating,Love the food my husband and I will definitely be back. Yummy on my tummy!!! Support Chicagos very own. Its a small place so make a reservation to be on the safe side.

6/18/2018,4 star rating,"The hype is real. We went on a Sunday afternoon. Usually parking in the area is difficult but we found s spot around the corner and parking is free on Sundays. The place is tiny but very cute. They were understaffed that day and we had to wait about an hour before we were seated. However, the food was well worth the wait. We had the bbq shrimp appetizer which was delicious. For entrees we I had the fried catfish with greens and macaroni. They were having a special on bbq ribs and baked beans so that's what my partner ordered. Everything was extremely fresh. The food was piping hot when it was served to us. Piping hot and delicious. I also ordered peach cobbler to go and that didn't disappoint. I'd definitely visit again and again. I plan on recommending it to my friends. You should go too!! You may have to wait a little bit for a table but it's totally worth it."
8/20/2018,4 star rating,It was date night so we went on a Sunday about 4pm. We waited 30mins to be seated as it is a small place but the decor is nice and music is great.. I had the salmon and shrimp (2 shrimp) served under spinach and mash potatoes.. very Delicious my bf had the shrimp and grits it had cheese inside it also very tasty. We tried the greens  (good but a bit too salty) Mac and cheese ( not tasty to me kind of bland) jerk wings (good cooked right) .. it's a byob for $10 service but it was nice and I would go back
8/10/2018,3 star rating,I've been here twice now and the food is amazing. The flavor is great. However the service is always terrible. The servers have attitudes and they only allow two separate checks which is inconvenient for larger parties. Don't think the food is worth bad service.
8/9/2019,2 star rating,"We went to this restaurant on a Wednesday around 6:00, it seemed as if the hostess/ manager was discouraging us from being seated. At 1st we were told all members of our party had to be present to be seated. Then we were told it would be a 90min wait to receive our order. Agreeing with both stipulations wasn't a big deal since we had time to wait. The food however wasn't as depicted in the photos. The catfish was fried so hard and it was discolored as if the grease was old. Mac and cheese was dry, no signs of creaminess at all. The sweet potato's had more of the syrup than actual potatoes. Jerk wings were overly salted, and crab legs were displayed with corn cob stuck slap dab in the middle of the mash potatoes as if a child playing in his food. They had no corn bread only 3 hours after opening, no refills on fountain drinks $3.50 for a mason jar of coke. Overall, I'd be cautious to arrive at Soulé on an empty stomach."
6/1/2018,5 star rating,Thank you Q for the great service. We had my mother's 86 birthday dinner. The food was great and the owners was first and center. We had a party of twelve of and the prices were good. We were pleased with the food and the chocolate cake. Thank you!!
3/12/2018,4 star rating,"The shrimp and grits are heavenly. Mmm that sauce is out of the world! The fried green tomatoes were sliced thin, and delicately fried so they weren't mushy at all. The server was nice, but they may have been a bit understaffed as we sat without water or having our drinks order taken for quite awhile which was awkward.  The lemonade is tasty but super sweet, so next time I'll remember to bring wine!"
7/14/2018,5 star rating,Such great food! It was tasteful and prepared nicely. It was served hot and in a timely fashion. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was nice and smooth.
7/2/2018,3 star rating,"My first time visiting this restaurant and I was disappointed first of all, it took them forever to ask how many were in my party. Secondly, after standing for at least 15 minutes waiting someone came and asked were we dining in and how many. I told her 9 people. 5 adults and 4 children. Her response was we don't take groups larger than 6. Well your website should state that so I don't drive 45 minutes to be disappointed. Very small establishment. I guess the best thing to do is take out orders. thought I was going to try a new restaurant. So I can't rate them extremely low because I didn't taste food. Giving them benefit of doubt."
3/3/2018,4 star rating,Great concept. Great staff. Lots of cool artwork on the walls. I had the buttermilk fried chicken and it was v good though a tad dry. The place is still quite new and has a lot of potential.
1/27/2018,1 star rating,Me and some friends decided to try this spot and support black owned businesses but we had the worst experience. First we had to wait 2 hours to be seated when we were advised 1 hr. Then when we finally were seated they advised us what we wanted to order was all out. Once it was time to leave we saw an employee walk out with a plate of the dish we were informed that was all out. I never do reviews but I was appalled by what transpired.
1/5/2018,2 star rating,"The location is great, easy parking the staff is very friendly and attentive.  Went with a couple of girlfriends, the waitress recommended the fried green tomatoes and I will have to say those were great but overall we were not very impressed with the main dishes.  I had the salmon with shrimp and potatoes, it was okay not a lot of flavor and the green beans side were canned green beans. My friend had the dark meat chicken with sweet potatoes side and creamed corn, she was not thrilled with her dish either.  I think if you are looking for a friendly, staff, very inviting place and great location it has that to offer but the food was, unfortunately disappointing."
6/21/2018,1 star rating,"The food was good. I believe they charge too much for the portion sizes. I had the lamb chops which came with 3 but they are too small to be charging $18 just for the lamp chops! Not including the price of the sides. I had the Mac and cheese which were really good! The greens were way too salty for my liking, my friend didn't eat hers either. I was seated right away but we waited 30 min just to order and then another 30 min to receive our food. The table next to us came well after us and got their food before us. We didn't have a waiter. We had to constantly stop waiters and ask for certain things, even to order! They didnt refill our glasses like most restaurants do. Overall i was not happy with our first time experience. Not sure if it was just that day or what! the place is not big at all, so it's not like waiters were too busy to serve you. I probably won't be coming back."
3/26/2018,5 star rating,"I went to soule last night for the first time and boy o boy I enjoyed my food. My team and I came to celebrate hair competition we were in. When  I tell you the ambience was set, music was sweet , and the staff was amazing (sip the water slow) lol . We literally had everything on the menu.Plus I like to see the owner work just as hard as the employees. Great job you guys I will definitely be back tomorrow."
1/5/2019,1 star rating,"Wow I wanted to like this place..  I took a cab all the way from the other side of town to try their food, as I really had a taste for soul food and they had good reviews. However from the moment I walked in the service was a nightmare. The staff was incredibly nonchalant, disrespectfully so. I literally stood directly in front of three of them for at least ten minutes without one person ever asking if I'd like to be seated, if I'd like to order, if I needed anything at all. As if I wasn't even there. I finally asked about seating, ordering, wait time, and finally if I could just order a meal to go, to which they surprisingly said no. Okay. So I waited about half an hour and ordered to dine there, which was even worse. Not one time did they initiate any part of my dining experience. I had to ask multiple times to order a beverage, to order food, to get SILVERWARE once my food actually came, to get a to-go container once I'd eaten some of my food (because how long can anyone truly sit through all of this??), and then to get a to go bag for my to-go container! I was through. And again, so sad as I really wanted to support their business and paid for cabs in both directions in order to do so."
2/15/2018,5 star rating,Delicious food at this great new addition to West Town. The Shrimp and Grits were flavorful and the portion was large enough to take leftovers home.

4/25/2018,5 star rating,"Best soul food in town! Great atmosphere and service. So good we came back the following weekend to make sure it wasn't a fluke. The Sunday menu offers specials like ""spare ribs""..that are awesome. The Cat Fish and Salmon are also very good. Haven't tried the fried chicken yet. Each time the owner was there greeting the customers and that's a real plus for me. All the sides were seasoned well and the portions good. GOOD JOB SOULE!!!"

2/5/2018,5 star rating,Delicious food. Great ambience. Excellent staff. Comfortable neighborhood. Friendly owner. I love this place.
2/17/2019,4 star rating,"This is my second visit to Soule. I went last night w/ a friend. We were told a 45 min wait so we went to Roots for a drink. After an hour we walked back and waited another 1/2 hr standing by the door with 4-5 other people. Yes it's busy and small on a Saturday night but that wasn't the problem. There were multiple tables that had received their bills and ""to go boxes"" that were just sitting.. playing on their phones or talking. I understand having a leisurely, relaxing dinner but once you have paid and you see 8 people waiting to have the same experience you did you should be respectful and get up. And i do believe if tables are doing that management should step in and in a respectful way ask them to kindly get up so others can have dinner.  There are multiple sushi places in the neighborhood that tell you when you make a reservation that you have an hour and a half for dinner. Yes it is kind of annoying but making people wait 1.5 hrs for tables that are just sitting there is poor customer service.  Having said this....I love the food and vibe. Service was good. We got our food fast which was great b/c we were starving."
1/13/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food! I had dinner here tonight w/ a friend and we really loved this place. It's small but cute. The vibe is good. We waited ~ 20 mins for a table. It was packed. I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the lamb chops. We also had the sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, asparagus, and cream corn for sides. Tons of flavor. Service was great. Everyone was friendly. The owner stopped by tables to ask if everything was ok. Nice touch. Great addition to our neighborhood!!!"
