2/9/2022,4 star rating,"A solid South Loop destination for all your burger, fry & wing cravings (which I have often :) Located just below W 18th & State St, it was fairly easy to get via CTA bus. They are currently open for takeout orders & delivery only. I got the sampler (which comes with a classic 4 oz burger, 3 wings and handcut fries). It was decent sized meal for the price, and I enjoyed being able to taste both the burger and wings. Wish I would've gotten dipping sauce on the side for the wings, but appreciated the different variety of sauces + dry rub options. Burger point also has a lot of unique, curated burgers with fun toppings and sauces on their menu as well. Everything was fresh and the meat is grass fed. Much better than going to a fast food joint, and it's locally owned!"
2/20/2022,1 star rating,Ill just let the picture speak for itself.  Double patty with $2 extra for 5 year aged cheddar (let me know if you can see it cause I couldn't)
11/2/2011,2 star rating,"!!!PLEASE ADDRESS THE AWFUL SERVICE!!!The burger here was too good to be ruined by under par service. The place already has an open kitchen and it doesn't help that customers walk in to see a kitchen (already too small for the amount of workers back there) that looks like a carnival filled with kids who were just released from school after overdosing on sugar.    Overall, food was good.  I was extremely surprised to have carry out food so delicious.  Especially with them being burger and fries, which do not mesh well with the amount of time it has to sit in a car.  Burger joints in the city are becoming the new craze like sushi was 10 years ago.  If the service here does not improve I give this place 10 months before it becomes another statistic in the, already hard to succeed in, restaurant industry."
1/22/2022,4 star rating,"I got takeout from this place the other night, and I was really happy with my order. It's really nice to have found a local burger place to support that meets all of my burgery needs!Last night my partner and I each got a burger and a combo with a large fry - with tip, it was between 30-35 bucks. Not too bad to support local.I got the mushroom burger and added lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles on it because I do like the traditional toppings array. I wish I would have noticed that the burger didn't come with any condiments, but luckily I was eating it at home so I could add mustard and stuff. Just something to make sure to add next time! The burger was well cooked, a nice size for getting a single (6oz), and I was definitely full afterwards!The fries were also tasty, but I'm looking forward to crisping them up a bit more when we rewarm the leftovers :)Overall, solid burger place and I'm looking forward to trying something different when I return!"
11/30/2021,5 star rating,"One of Chicago's absolutely best burger places also has a great chicken sandwich? What more do you really need to know? I could tell you that there burger is award winning, but you should already know that. I could tell you're they're all grass fed, but come on, you should already be there let's be honestThe classicSoon to be famous buttermilk chicken sandwichInsta: @holi_ravi_oli"
6/1/2022,5 star rating,Awesome food!!!. I had the crispy chicken sandwich with bbq sauce. It was very delicious.the hand cut fries were to die for. Seasoned well. Definitely I will be back. Very much highly recommend this place.
1/15/2022,5 star rating,"If you ask my favorite Burger place for vegetarians in Chicago, this is going to be my recommendation without any second thought. I have been enjoying the burgers from the last 5 years and have not found a better place since then. Highly recommended"
11/10/2019,5 star rating,Always love this place just because their veggie burgers are the amazing. The best part is they can modify any burger into the veggie one so a lot of options for vegetarian people. Their truffle fries are good. Highly recommend their Hangover burger.
5/16/2022,2 star rating,"While the food itself may hit the spot, customer service is a ""HUGE"" key component to whether or not I return to your spot. I went in yesterday for the free burger that is offered when you sign up for the birthday club. The guy at the register was not the friendliest sort. Didn't make me feel welcomed, and was short and clipped. No pleasantries when I expressed it was my birthday (not that everyone cares about your birthday), however if people sign up to for your birthday acknowledgement and they come in and tell you its their birthday, I would think as a representative of the establishment, you would wish the birthday patron well. Nonetheless, the burger was good, however, unless customer service becomes more appealing, I won't be returning anytime soon."
10/7/2021,5 star rating,"Foto doesn't do it justice, single patty (can make it a double) burgers, Cooked to order and modify if you wish. Had the classic & dirty south with fries. All made fresh to order. Support local."
2/14/2021,5 star rating,"What an awesome find! Found through Chicago Burger Bible Instagram page. Also, exceptionally happy to know this is a Black Owned Business.Located South Loop - State street. Ordering process super easy through Yelp, all the options are listed; cheeses (holy balls so many cheeses!) meat patties (grass fed beef, chicken, Turkey, veggie), toppings and sauces (housemade ketchup!)We ordered, Gobfather (chipotle aioli has some kick!) Dirty Southside, fries and wings. Prices are awesome, portions are perfect, pickup service was really nice! Takeout presentation was decent (wish lettuce was served on the side).My husband did say his burger was a little dry, but he did order med well. He thinks if he ordered med next time, it would be juicier. There will be a next time for sure! Thank you for being open during a pandemic!"
10/5/2021,5 star rating,"I like everything about this place.  The 6 oz. burgers are thick, juicy, and done precisely as ordered.  Eating a ""double"" requires the ability to unhinge your jaw like a python. The fries are hand-cut, crispy, and served piping hot.  While you can build your own burger, their specialty burgers are thoughtfully constructed with my favorite being the Shroom Burger which comes with Swiss, Brie, and grilled mushrooms. I've been there probably 15-20 times, and the owner always recognizes me and is engaging and friendly. It's one of my go-to choices for out-of-towners who want to try a real Chicago burger."
1/20/2022,4 star rating,"Friendly people. Good burgers. Quality for the price. I don't know what else you want. If you're looking for gold flakes and foie gras or caviar on your burger, then this ain't it. But if you just want a good ole' burger and maybe a little jazz (egg, aioli, avocado, bacon, etc.) then here you go."
2/3/2021,4 star rating,"Sometimes you just need a burger. That was my situation last week, and thankfully burger point is not too far from me.  I placed an order online and went in for pickup 30 or so minutes later.I ordered a three-piece wing combo (bbq honey mustard sauce) and an Ashman burger that came with literally an entire bucket of fries. Okay, not a literal bucket but there were a lot of fries. The food was really good, so good that I did not take any pictures. As others have noted, everything was also well packaged so it didn't get sloppy on my way home."
12/27/2020,4 star rating,"Definitely a tasty burger. I did the build your own and forgot to ask for lettuce tomatoes and mayo, but got grilled onions, avocado, and American cheese. I should've asked for medium instead of medium well because it was a little dry. I also walked home with it so I'm sure the waiting dried it out some. The customer service was great, very nice staff and they even separated out the hot dog I bought for my dog and brought out the food to us outside.  Would come back for sure."
9/21/2021,5 star rating,"I decided to check this business out. I wanted to show love to a black owned business before I returned home. I'm glad I didn't let a comment dissuade me. The counter staff and the people preparing the food were all nice. It was pretty empty when I came in but a herd of youth came in and ordered food and brightened up the already positively vibed restaurant. I love mushrooms and the shroom burger was so tasty, it didn't need sauce. When I finished my food, Simba asked how was everything? It was really delicious. I'd definitely return here if I visit this city again. They are very welcoming."
2/13/2022,5 star rating,"Everyone knows about their burgers and wings, but we had a taste for chicken sandwiches. I figured I'd try theirs not expecting much - holy cow! They were were DELICIOUS - and HUGE! Wife loved her grilled and I thoroughly enjoyed my crispy. And don't miss out on their sweep potato fries with sea salt. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
5/17/2020,4 star rating,"Definitely good burgers! I had the New American Classic burger (substituting wasabi mayo for chipotle aioli) on pretzel bun.  Delicious! Fries were great too.   The burgers were individually boxed, which are ideal for keeping the tall burgers  in place. But, the best is the service that I saw in the manager A customer did not have a mask on for the safety of the customer himself and the others in the restaurant. So, the manager kindly offered a disposable mask to the customer at no additional cost.  The manager pulled out a bag of masks and offered one to the customer.  COVID- shelter in place had affected us in so many ways. It was a good deed to see good customer service.  Highly recommended for delicious food and good service!"
2/4/2022,3 star rating,Great food but got delivered 2 hours after I ordered online. Kinda defeats the purpose of delivery
6/23/2021,5 star rating,"Fantastic service and good food! First time in the city and I wanted to try a ""Chicago Style Hot Dog."" It was worth the 12-15 minute walk from my hotel. I was also able to support a Black business!"
9/24/2021,5 star rating,"The food is great quality and delicious ! The Manager, Mikal is awesome !  Always there working hard and always friendly and accommodating ! I am so glad he works there. Always great to see him !I hope all of their customers coming in respect them and wear masks so that the workers stay safe. We need this awesome restaurant !"
3/13/2022,5 star rating,The wings are amazing!!!! We ordered for the first time and they sent out the wrong order however they made sure to take care of us for their mistake. We got our correct order plus they gave us back our money. I will definitely order again because they are that good! Ohh the fries are also super good!!!
9/13/2021,1 star rating,Went there last night (9/12/21) and there was a hand written sign on the door saying they were closed until further notice.
10/3/2018,1 star rating,"The burgers are great, but the ownership has decided to be like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  If you want to order, you need to do that online.  THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER THE PHONE!!!  So no more telephone ordering.  Running the business their way is more important that customer service.  We used to order 2-3 times per month.  Apparently they don't want/need my business anymore. It's their way or the highway.  We chose the highway, and went elsewhere.  They lost my business."
9/8/2021,5 star rating,I decided to give this place another try and I did not regret it. The service and the food were great. Maybe they just had a bad day last visit.
1/25/2019,2 star rating,The quality at this place has really gone down since its opening. I think they even use Jennie-O turkey bacon. YUCK! A dog shouldn't even be served Jennie-O. The food was bland and subpar before but now its barely edible. Disappointed
8/8/2021,5 star rating,"I'm a long time Lakeview Resident and  though I have friends and family on the South Side my most frequent reason for traversing the distance is going to the Burger Point at 1900 South State Street( parking in the rear), the food is spectacular  for real.  Today, I traversed traffic, tourist and dangerous heat for the ""Classic Burger and beyond delicous hand cut fries "", the beef is raised antibiotic free and never frozen and you can tell the difference, the beef is cooked to perfection (whatever that is for you) and the toppings fresh made every day but  the hand cut fries cooked to order are also perfect, I had eaten the fries before I reached home, each fry was crisp,hot with a creamy center, just enough salt with a hint of pepper though ""Mike"" the Owner of the Burger Points insist that there is no pepper on the fries, Mike is a Great Guy and Business Man, he is always at the Burger Point and checks in if you're eating in (there is now limited seating) though I've had many friends tell me that they're ordering and delivery is on point.    I had been there a few times rotating the burgers(there are 23 different burgers) with the chicken sandwich( the diameter of the  chicken filet far exceeds the bun) and the spicy special sauce that covers it is unbelievably good, today was Chicago style hotdog day and it never fails to take me back to late night visit to Maxwell street for a dog.    Go, try it out, you won't be sorry."
7/10/2021,5 star rating,"Stopped in for wings today.  The wings were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and well sauced.  The flavor was exactly what you would want from original hot Buffalo.   The owner was working the register, and he was friendly helpful and really seemed like a great guy. We didn't have a burger but saw several come out, and they looked amazing.  Everyone in the place seemed happy.  I hope they put in a couple of more tables.  I think they'll need them!"
6/24/2021,5 star rating,"The BEST BURGER I've had in years!!! I was on vacation from CA and before leaving Chicago I decided to stop at this place.

3/7/2021,4 star rating,Love supporting this business. The burger isn't too big or greasy. Great taste/portion and customer service. Please check them out!
3/6/2021,5 star rating,By far the best sweet potato fries in the city; they come with some sort of magic sauce. The other fries are excellent too. I've try a few different burgers and you can't go wrong with any of them.

2/4/2021,4 star rating,I was pleasantly surprised to hear of a black owned burger spot in the south loop. I was given great customer service. My gobbler burger was tasty and fresh. I also ordered 12 wings the hot garlic sauce wasn't as flavorful as I'm used to sauces being potent but I would definitely try this place again in the future.
1/10/2021,2 star rating,"I was looking forward a lot to trying out the Burger Point so I ordered for delivery. More than disappointed. My order arrived cold, the most was so damn dry and the fries all soggy."
6/9/2020,5 star rating,"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. This is a great place near Chinatown, where I live, and it's one of the few places that does a really great burger in this area! Even their veggie burger is delicious. Oh and I've also had their wings and the only thing that sucks about that is that they don't sell beer!  Oh and and and I ALWAYS get those fresh fries with everything. Those fries bring me back to my childhood!Yesterday, I got dinner there and when I arrived to pick up my food (no dine-in yet due to the pandemic) there was a sign on the door that said they were a black owned business. I've never felt happier to support a place that not only has amazing food but also has friendly and GREAT service (literally) every time!"

12/5/2020,1 star rating,"Place don't even listen to the customer I ordered my meal with no bacon and I asked specifically please no bacon and they told me the classic doesn't come with bacon so please the classic will be the best choice for you after I pick up my order and I got home and I found out my burger have bacon on it after I asked three times, then I call and there solution was  will refund your money we sorry, I waited 30 minutes and I pay for my dinner now I have no dinner to eat What refunding my money would do any good to me,"
8/12/2019,5 star rating,"Super friendly service, great atmosphere at a corner location easy walking distance from McCormick Place and hotels. Amazing burger menu with some creative ingredients and original housemade sauces. $7-13 is about right for the quality, flavors, and amount of food, wish I had one to eat at in Indiana! This is the best burger spot I've been to in the midwest - well this and Meatheads at a tie. Hard to split em, Meatheads has the value, more ingredient options, and those amazing shakes. But yeah, these guys here are on POINT."
2/4/2021,5 star rating,Seriously love their burgers here. I'm a big beef burger person and have tried them throughout the entire city. This is my new favorite spot. Also the service is always welcoming and nice! Order ahead if you're really hungry it can be a little wait but worth it!
12/5/2020,5 star rating,An absolute must stop! This is our favorite burger place the food is always cooked fresh. Never met a more friendly staff. I recommend to everyone. Order the truffle fries.
12/19/2020,5 star rating,"If you're looking for like burger kingdom, go to the burger point! Got the delicious blue cheese Frenchie burger with bacon and it was perfectly prepared from top to bottom, seasoned & ready hot on arrival! Every savory juicy bite reminded me of Paris even fancy spots like Le Bonaparte. Super friendly & professional staff makes this a press repeat place!"
7/20/2017,1 star rating,"For a restaurant to have the title ""burger""in it, I would have expected exceptional burgers, but unfortunately it fell far short of my expectation. I had the 6oz burger point burger and my friend had a 12 oz savage burger and we shared sweet potato fries. The size difference between the burgers was that larger one had two patties. The burgers were made on the spot which was respectable but there were just too many flaws:- The wait was long given that we were the first ones there and to order.- There burgers were also overdone and dry. I felt like I was just chewing meat, there was barely any seasoning.- The cheese on the burger had melted and condensed. There was no stringyness to it. - Burgers were a bit greasy and felt heavy afterwards- The sweet potato fries were also made fresh but were also very greasy. The only thing I really enjoyed was the spicy ketchup condiment to help mask the flavor of unseasoned meat."

12/18/2020,5 star rating,"Discovered this spot recently but it has quickly become my go-to burger fix. Hands down the best burgers I've had in Chicago. The ingredients are fresh and of high quality, the flavor combinations and sauces are amazing, and the burgers are huge! My favorites are the Dirty South and the Fried Chicken sandwich (try the ghost pepper sauce on the side)."
11/14/2018,5 star rating,"Holy damn, this place is great! Great service, great food, spicy wings, and sustainability front and center. The guy behind the counter was really friendly and helpful with the menu. My compliments to him first and foremost. I came with a coworker while in town for a conference. We had burgers, fries, and wings -- real comfort food for a super cold day. He loved his burger, and my buffalo chicken burger was excellent. The bread was fresh and tasty, the burger saucy, and the cheese/celery filler was complimentary to the rest of it. I really like food like this that is indulging flavors regardless of trendy presentation. Get the wings while you're here. They're big and juicy with delicious sauce. I recommend asking for an extra side of sauce, because they were not overly tossed. Lastly, my compliments on the fries! We split a large order of the Old Bay fries, and it was a little more than two guys wanted with two burgers and two dozen wings. He packed most of his wings to go, but not me. I obliterated the burger, 12 wings, and at least my share of the fries. I would have preferred a few more dashes of Old Bay, though."
3/6/2021,5 star rating,By far the best sweet potato fries in the city; they come with some sort of magic sauce. The other fries are excellent too. I've try a few different burgers and you can't go wrong with any of them.
11/15/2018,5 star rating,"The food here is amazing - absolutely wonderful. They really place an emphasis on quality ingredients and it pays off. I had their Chicago dog (being from out of town I had too) as well as their old bay fries and Asian chicken wings. The portions were huge and the price was reasonable. The sauce on the Asian wings is a perfect mix of sweet and spicy while the fries had the perfect amount of old bay seasoning.If you are staying near the McCormick Place convention center, this place is a must visit."
4/9/2019,5 star rating,Was in town at the convention center and looking for a good burger.  This place was outstanding.  Great burger and the fries were incredible.  I love the metal bowl they serve the fries in.  I would like to see some vinegar for the fries.A combo meal with drink and fries is going to run you ~$20 but it's a TON of food.   M it new favorite burger stop in chicago.
9/23/2020,5 star rating,"Best burgers and wings in the South Loop. A true neighborhood treasure. The orders can take a little longer, but that means they are doing it the right way. I'd recommend calling ahead, but you will not be disappointed in this food."
9/12/2020,5 star rating,"Burger Point is always consistent! I am a huge fan of the wings - which is odd because its a burger joint. I live for spicy food, so if you are like me, give the Three Mile Island a shot. Now, the burgers are fantastic, especially the Classic, which comes with bacon. Oh, I can't forget the fries with Sea Salt....perfection! You won't be disappointed and the service is friendly and fast (but, call in your order)."

10/14/2016,5 star rating,"I've been going here for quite sometime. I work around here so this is practically my go-to place for lunch.I will be honest though. I NEVER try their burger. I am not really a burger person. I just dont like burger. Period! Don't you dare judge me! My all time favorite is the chili. And yes, I eat the chili during summer too. Again, don't judge! Love love love the super fresh chili. I also ask them to put extra jalapeños in the chili just because I love spicy food.To accompany my lonely chili, I always order the fries. The fries is okay. I mean, it's fries. It's either okay or not okay.Once in a blue moon, I usually order the chicken wings. (Just like today!). Oo and I always ask them to put the sauce on the side because I can't stand messy stuff. Lol!One last thing, the owner is pretty awesome! Always friendly and ever since he's there, the food always comes out pretty fast. Keep up the awesomeness Burger Point!"
11/17/2018,5 star rating,"Went here for my first time last night. I will be back again for sure. The guy working the register/taking the orders was super cool and really nice. I think he may be the owner, but I'm not sure. Anyway, their burgers and fries are delicious. They have gluten free buns! Yum. Their menu is amazing- there were so many things I wanted to try. Once you order at the counter, have a seat at a table of your choice, and an employee will bring you your food. The owner (I believe) stopped by every table to ask how everything was. Pretty awesome for a fast food joint! Let it be known, however, based on the quality, this place is above and beyond your standard fast food establishment. If you haven't been there, GO!"
10/14/2019,5 star rating,"Came here while on vacation because of a friend's recommendation.  Me and my wife tried the cheeseburger cooked medium with several toppings, the fries with sea salt, the chili cheesedog and a special hotdog called the Spanish Revolution per recommendation of the owner Michael.  The burger with just cheese that was hanging off the bun was simply delicious on its own and gave me a chance to notice the high quality meat they use. The chili cheesedog  was tasty and huge.  Finally, let's get down to business and talk about the Spanish Revolution hotdog. Oh....my goodness.  Huge, hanging off the bun, wrapped in crispy bacon, and (the special part) topped with a jalapeño relish and a light ranch mayo/sauce.  These two toppings really make the hotdog.  We should have ordered two of these because I did not want to share lol.  The service here was noticeably impressive.  While we were sitting we noticed the owner was super friendly, talked to every table, and helped a guest try to remember what sauce she had on her burger during her previous visit because she couldn't describe it and only remembered the color.  We were laughing and so was the guest because he brought her out a sample of every sauce until she finally recalled the flavor she was looking for.  She really appreciated it. Will definitely come back the next time we are in town."

12/22/2017,5 star rating,Second time here and just love it. Don't know why we're not here more often. This time I had the habanero mustard wings
3/15/2017,4 star rating,"After seeing this place almost every day, I finally tried it out. It's actually a pretty hip place for the South Loop. A lot of the burgers are grass fed, which is great. The owner was extremely friendly. I had the chicken wings and my husband had a burger. We were both pleasantly surprised. I loved that their ketchup and mustard were HFCS free and all natural. That's actually one of my pet-peeves, ketchup with HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). I live practically across the street from the Burger Bar, but I plan to try to come here more often. My only teeny complaint was the celery that came with my wings were so wilted. I could hardly eat them. Other than that, it was a great experience."
9/12/2020,5 star rating,This was mine and my girlfriends first time here she is a very picky eater and as soon as we walked in the door they had great service and the food was absolutely amazing.

1/18/2020,5 star rating,Outstanding service!! I was very impressed with the owners hospitality! The burgers were delicious cooked well and had a variety of different toppings. the wings were some of the best I ever tasted. Tasted perfect and were nice and crispy. All the food was hot and the wait time was not long! Highly recommend this place if you want a nice juicy flavorful burger.
2/10/2021,5 star rating,Love it. I don't eat beef and I don't really like turkey burgers but somehow their turkey burgers are amazing. So are the wings.
3/23/2019,5 star rating,"This is my neighborhood wings spot and I stop in often. Get the Baltimore style (dry rub) and ask for sauce on the side. Favorite sauce is the Habañero Mustard -- good balance of spice and flavor -- but there's about a dozen options and they are all good. They'll even give you some Hawaiian rolls, free of charge, on the side if you ask. I usually get the sweet potato fries as well with cinnamon and sugar. The burgers are excellent too (hence the name of the place) but I usually stop in for the wings. BYOB"

5/12/2019,5 star rating,"Omg, The best food I had wile visiting Chicago. I had a a burger and hot wings. Wonderful! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Even come to our table and asked how everything was.. I wish we had it more then once wile in town."
10/18/2017,4 star rating,"Lovely little burger joint in Chicago. Prices are decent, you can customize your meal how you want it, and you can watch your food being made too. Well-decorated interior with enough space between tables to not feel stifling. PROS:-Love that you can customize your own burger. I'm not a huge ""gourmet, tons of toppings"" kind of person, and I like getting a regular, boring burger - without being charged an arm and a leg for it. This place does a fantastic job at that. Plus, with all of the patties being made to order, you can choose how you'd like your meat done as well. -Staff was super-duper friendly. Despite being consistently busy, the cashier checked in on us and made sure our food tasted like we expected. He even wished us a good day when we were walking out the door. Very friendly guy. -Spicy ketchup (with regular ketchup still available) is a nice touch. -All toppings tasted fresh. -Decent amount of interior seating with enough space between tables to not feel too crowded. There are also benches for waiting for to-go orders or waiting for the rest of your party to show up. Bathrooms are clean.-Pretty fast service. We were in and out within 30 minutes. CONS:-Not a huge fan of the shoestring fries. Fries are on the crunchier side."
12/12/2018,2 star rating,"I realllllllllly wanted to love this place and I just didn't. After the first time was a disaster I thought I would try it again after some comments I gave to the manager on duty. It just wasn't good. Perhaps it is hit and miss and I'm just missing? The burgers were over cooked horribly both times, fries were salted beyond belief and the sauce on the wings was beyond hot despite asking for mild. I wish they'd use lettuce. Heck at least offer lettuce. The LAX burger is supposed to mimic In n Out Burger but the weird spinach greens throw the whole thing off. How can a place whose claim to fame is burgers not manage to cook them to the desired temperature?"
2/28/2019,5 star rating,"Ordered the dirty south burger (aged cheddar, bbq sauce, bacon, on a pretzel bun) and it was SO flavorful! The bun was soft, the bbq sauce was savory with a little kick and lightly sweet, bacon was crisp, cheddar was sharp, and the burger was cooked exactly to my requested temperature. Would definitely come here again!"
9/6/2020,1 star rating,"I want to love this place. Not because of the burgers-- they are very hit or miss: when they're good they are great. When they're not - like today - they are awful. No, I want to love it, and have continued to drive out of my way to visit it, because it's a black-owned business and I want to help it succeed in yet another arena that is dominated by white people. But after today's meal I am having a hard time imagining that I'll go back. Last weekend I got a burger and fries. The burger was perfect! Medium just like I love it, nice cheddar cheese, perfect temperature, juicy, delicious. The fries were disgusting, but they are never the point. Today I got a double, not realizing that I was ordering a double. I thought I was just getting a bigger burger, or I wouldn't have done it. So that part is on me. I also skipped the fries because they were so bad last time. Walking in, I wanted to cancel my order. Nobody was wearing masks correctly, instead barely covering their mouths but not noses, or dangling on their chin.  Instead of cancelling, I just stood back uncomfortably and waited longer than ever for my burger. It was 100 degrees in there, but the fountain drinks are too expensive. When I got my burger I was excited both to eat it and just to get out of there. I should have cancelled. This was not medium, or even medium well. This thing was well done. As in your uncle's lousy burgers at the family cookout when he takes over grilling for 10 minutes before people pull him away. Absolutely disgusting. And since I ordered a double by mistake, there was twice as much overcooked rock. The pickles tasted funny as well so I pulled them off. And the worst part, I mean the WORST part is that today I decided to splurge on some crispy bacon. If they forgot to take my burger OFF the grill, they seemingly forgot to put my bacon ON it. It wasn't crispy. It was barely cooked!! I feel sick just thinking about it. I just can't justify driving 30 minutes each way and paying that much for a burger that might make my day... or might make me want to throw up."
11/10/2018,5 star rating,"This place is seriously good. I've ordered the wings with Hot Garlic sauce and Ghost of 3 Mile Island sauce twice and it has not disappointed. Their Ghost of 3 Mile Island is really hot and tasty. But for something more bearable, go for the Hot Garlic sauce. The food may take some time to prepare but it is cooked to order. If you prefer delivery, look for them on grubhub. This is my second favorite wings place in the Chicago Southside, though Burger Point is certainly known for other amazing food items... like their burgers! I am certainly planning on coming back here to try their burgers and truffle fries."
7/27/2019,5 star rating,"Solid food, great service, cool vibe. We got the gobfather (turkey burger) and buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and loved both. We will definitely be back!"
5/27/2020,5 star rating,"This is our ""go to"" burger place. I tell everyone about it. The owner manager is so great. He talks to all the costumers and make sure you love your experience. The burgers are so tasty. Really good ingredients. I just can't say enough good things about this place!"
12/21/2018,5 star rating,"First, i was immediately greeted as i walked in. I had a burger craving and yelp pointed me here and i was not disappointed. They offer plenty of burgers that you custom make! I got the Savage burger and it was delicious from first bite! The 'small' fries could easily pass as a large at any fast food place. Very warm and friendly environment. The manager even came to check on me and ask how the food was. I'm not from Chicago but i def recommend this place to those visiting"
2/25/2019,5 star rating,I've driven by this place dozen upon dozens of times and have never stopped. My family is always on the search for a good burger and fries. I ordered the lax burger on brioche bun with a side of bacon jam! That's right BACON JAM! Omg it just the icing on top! It really was a good burger and the jam was a bonus. I'm a fry girl as well and the fries were good. I wish they were a little more crispy but they were still on point. We will definitely be back. I have to try that fried chicken sandwich and the wings.
7/5/2020,1 star rating,"We ordered burgers for lunch to be delivered and was highly disappointed. The burgers were dry, no flavor or and we ordered fries and did not receive ketchup. Unfortunately we won't be ordering from here again."
9/25/2019,1 star rating,Don't know why they have four stars on yelp. We waited for 25 mins on a non busy day and ended up asking for a refund. Wasted time and parking money.
12/3/2017,3 star rating,"Our First Order:I had the create your own burger and shared an order of large truffle salt fries. My friend ordered the gluten free create your own burger. The Fries:I enjoyed my fries. I got a side of their spicy aioli to dip the truffle salt fries in. It's yummy and adds more to the fries. I would love those fries with a rosemary Parmesan topping, but that was just a random thought I had while devouring them. The Burger:We were told by the gentleman taking our order that the standard is ""Medium Well."" We went with that, but our burgers were both well done; there was no pink center at all. It was a bit in the dry side. A restaurant that is exclusively a burger joint can't mess up their burgers in my opinion. The thing that saved it was the condiments I ordered. Spicy aioli and mayo, I think is what I had. It had some banging flavor with the condiments, but would have been ""send this back"" dry without it. I'm hoping that was a fluke and not the norm. I am gonna give them another shot and I will follow up. I enjoyed my Pretzel Bun.  The GF bun will crumble in your hands. We were forewarned if this happen. So it was not a surprise, but it literally could not be eaten as a burger. You have to put it down and cut it because it will be in pieces. My friend with celiac said it tasted fine though. It needs work, but kudos for offering a GF option, even if it's a hot mess. The Staff:My favorite part of the experience was the owner, Michael. He was there assisting, helping, taking orders, delivering them, checking in on his customers, etc. I appreciate this type of hands-on approach to business, as it's my approach as well; he's a keeper. I saw him interact with all his customers, and they all seemed to love him or know him. He is gonna be a big reason people go back. The staff were all friendly. Huge fan of Michael and the service, and hoping for more the second trip back with the burgers. I'm sure I will update this review after round two. *********************UPDATE:  Round twoI went back to give them a second chance to get it right. The burger was cooked well done again. Sigh! I took pictures of it so you could see it was brown throughout...yet again. A burger joint should know that no one wants a well done burger, unless they ask for it. Additionally, if I order a medium well burger, they should know how to do that. They don't. :( Underwhelmed. Unimpressed. You basically need lots of condiments to add flavor and make it less dry. If they ever get this right, their rating would go up, but they earned a 3 as is."
2/14/2015,4 star rating,"During my first yelp-elite event last year, I overheard one of the elites' dissatisfaction on her experience at the Burger Point.  The was the reason why it took me this long to stop by and give it a fair chance.  I've been paying attention on the recent yelp reviews; there seems to be some improvements occurring.  I was on the way coming back to the north side.  With that being said, hubby was in South Carolina visiting my in-laws and he wouldn't be able to eat a beef burger anyway (he's a vegetarian...a very studious one).  Being out and about solo meant that I got to eat a burger...on my own...I didn't mind at all.  You can order off the menu.  There are about fifteen (15) kinds of pre-set ones.  Nevertheless, if you're one of those creative burger eaters, you can customize the way you want with the choice of bun, cheese, toppings, and other ingredients. I went for the #5: the all American Classic.  Why?  It has a fried egg and avocado.  Yes, having those things on a burger can really make my day.  Now you know how easy it is to make Rosa J. happy.  Feeding her a well-crafted burger will do the trick! This burger came with the pretzel rolls.  Thank you, because some other chain attempts to defy the science by holding an egg and other ingredients together with the sesame buns!!  Really?  However, the Burger Point folks understand the physics of a runny egg and how nutty this guy can be.  Thus, the use of pretzel rolls was a great call.  I had to sadly deduct one (1) stars for lackluster fries.  This may just be personal preference, but I like the steak-cut fries better than the ""old-fries"" style.  The flavoring and salinity of the fries were; nevertheless, adequate.  The combo, for $13.24, is pretty steep!  I will have to go there whenever I make a 100 on my test, which I'm no longer a student.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, the cooking-time wasn't delivering in a fast-food speed since everything was made-to-order.  If you want a speedy but ""no-love"" kind of service, White Castle is right around the corner on State and Cermak.  But who will go to a White Castle?  You tell me.  The CTA 29 (State) bus stop is located nearby.  Get off at Cullerton, walk a very short distance, and you will see the place on the ""point"" of State and Archer."
6/18/2020,5 star rating,"The best burgers I have ever tried, I really recommend this place, also the staff is so friendly, 5 stars and over!!!"
12/19/2020,2 star rating,I was referred here by a friend who said the food was awesome. So I told my husband I wanted to check it out. He had already been here years before and he said it was mediocre nothing to brag about. He still took me and I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and he had a double cheeseburger. After receiving my order I unwrap the chicken sandwich it was overly crispy and I could barely chew it. The fries were terrible tasted like they had cooked it in the same grease as the sweet potato fries. I had a piece of my husband burger and it was unseasoned and dry. The reviews definitely made me hyped but after trying it myself I have to agree with my husband it wasn't worth the money or raising a flag about.
8/29/2020,5 star rating,Run to this place.   Ive lived in the South Loop for many years and Im mad at myself that its taken me so long to try this place.  Really fantastic burgers.   The owner is fantastic and cares about his customers.  I ordered for delivery last night and my food was delicious.  Not something you can usually say about delivered food.   I ordered wings to try them out and they were delicious.  I also had a potato  spiral which are homemade chips.  Im hooked.  You must try this place.  You wont be sorry.  Keep up the good work.
12/30/2018,5 star rating,"When I ask for my burgers to be cooked medium rare, this place always delivers. Do be sure to try their amazing ""Da Bears Burger"" which is a double. The African-American gentleman owner is super nice and makes sure his customers are enjoying the food."
1/13/2018,5 star rating,"A great burger spot in the South Loop where they are made to order. We tried the 6 oz LAX burger which is similar to In-N-Out's burger. Mine was perfectly cooked medium rare - all light pink inside on a whole wheat bun. It was delicious!  We also loved their ""Hot Garlic"" wings which are mild hot with fresh diced garlic embedded in the sauce. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Do make sure to walk across the street for amazing beignets and New Orleans style coffee at Akhirah's Praline afterwards. The negative reviews are related to GrubHub's slow delivery which is not fair because this place is awesome."
11/6/2020,5 star rating,"I had the Ashman, an In-N-Out inspired burger. It was great and tasted more fresh than an In-N-Out burger. The french fries seemed like a more natural version of mcdonald's fries because they weren't bathed in salt."

3/2/2020,5 star rating,This is one of the best places for a veggie burger. They take 15-20 minutes to grill but the burger is worth the wait. The wide variety of toppings and the sides will make your meal much better
7/18/2018,4 star rating,"This small, unassuming place was way better than I expected. The burgers are big and most are topped with cheese, bacon, and an egg. They are dripping with juice, which makes them tasty, but probably not heart-smart.Plus, their truffle fries are really good."
6/8/2018,5 star rating,"I looooooovvvve this spot. The food taste fresh and they have all NATURAL beef. I love it that they have SWEET. Potato. Fries and wings and plenty of options for vegetarians as well , yes they have veggie burgers!! They have one of the BEST turkey burgers I have ever tasted from any establishment. The owner is extremely nice and they have baked pastries by the register that are delicious."
5/24/2016,3 star rating,"Is say I enjoyed my burger that I ""created"". I liked that they had an extensive menu of variety and creative burgers on the menu. However I did not see one that I would like for what I wanted. I made a turkey burgers, with avocado, lettuce, pickles, bbq sauce (boring I know) but very yummy!! I liked the old bay fries as well, but not the best fries I've ever had. My friends had burgers from the menu which I don't remember fully what it was. Classic or American or something like that. Thru had the regular fries, which were not good. I doc like that all of there ingredients were fresh and grass feed meat. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food. And the food was prepared rather quickly. It was pretty empty so no wait ."
10/3/2018,3 star rating,I was excited to come here after reading some of the reviews. Made our own burgers. They have all the toppings you could want. Fresh cut fries with sea salt or old Bay seasoning. Burger looked great when it arrived at our table. Only problem is that the meat didn't taste like much. Lacked flavor. I so wanted to love it but missed the mark. We both agreed that it could've used some flavor. It's an ok burger with a ton of options. That's about it.

The Burger Point did not disappoint! The burgers were perfectly cooked to order and the fries were crispy. The manager/owner made us feel so welcome the second we walked in, and made sure to stop by our table to see how we were doing. It was such a delightful experience! Recommendations: The Blue Harvest Burger with the bourbon bacon jam and salt and vinegar spiral potato stick"
3/11/2020,5 star rating,Any restaurant that has old bay fries is automatic 5 star in my book. Food was delicious!
8/4/2019,5 star rating,"First of all, the owner has the warmest smile and greeting of all of Chicago. He helped my husband and I pick what to order, since the menu describes everything deliciously. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and no joke- best chicken sandwich I've ever had. My husband ordered the Blue Harvest burger and that too was the best burger I've ever had. And I've had some amazing burgers in my time. We also ordered large fries and the spiral cut fries which are like homemade potato chips. I cannot wait to go back! It's worth it!"
7/25/2016,5 star rating,"We walked in and was greeted warmly with a hello by the owner. Since this was our first time here, the owner explained the menu and they also had TVs to show what the featured burgers looked like. There was enough seating for us and the place wasn't crowded. I got the Blue Burger, which was amazing and my guy made his own burger. The burgers were a bit pricey, $9 on average, but the 6oz. patty is all you need. The fries came separate, but the small was enough for the both of us. The owner walked around greeting customers to make sure they were enjoying their meal. Great ambience and tasty food. I will def be back here. #blackownedbusiness"
2/18/2019,5 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC.My only complaints about the place is that they have too many of my favorite things in the same place. The burgers are GREAT ( especially with their 5 year old aged cheddar cheese and a fried egg ), their chicken wings are RIDICULOUS ( the Baltimore rub is our family favorite), and while the french fries are excellent, I vote for the potato stick, which is a spiral potato fried to a perfect crisp and served on a long stick. The owner is extremely kind and likable. He usually is up front by the cash register making people feel welcome it is a small place, but I have never been there when I could not find a seat. Totally casual atmosphere with TVs usually showing Sports. You can't go wrong having lunch or dinner at the Burger Point. If you tell him that ""Mark"" sent you.....you won't get anything free because he probably has no idea who I am. ENJOY!!!"
6/26/2018,3 star rating,"We went to the burger point because a guest in town was craving a burger.  We decided to pass on 5 Guys and hit this new spot (to us).  We ordered 3 burgers, a salmon burger, truffle fries, and fries.Of the three: Staff, service, and food, the only thing saving this from a 2 star review was the staff.  They were friendly, thorough, and pleasant.We went on a Sunday and the spot was only  1/2 full.  Somehow, it literally took 25 mins to get our order.  We weren't outliers either.  Everyone in there was waiting a really long time to get the food.When it came, the truffle fries were lukewarm at best.  The large regular fries were cold and soggy.  There were some hot ones on the bottom.  One hamburger was cooked well done, although we ordered medium.  The salmon burger and the crunchy burger were both cold.  Frankly, the spicy ketchup was the only ""plus"" on the menu.  The burger patties themselves weren't all that great, but the cold food was the big issue.I got up to get something from the counter and saw 4 more burger staged for another table and they were just sitting there waiting to get dressed.  Of course, I'm sure that table's food was probably cold too.Too bad this spot wasn't what we hoped.  We won't be going back.  I can just stick to the spots I know."
8/3/2018,5 star rating,"We walked over here when my friend didn't like his food at the Thai restaurant next door. Made to order, fresh, quality burger. It was juicy and simply delicious! The owner is very nice and attentive, while he was out surveying the patrons he noticed they brought his burger out without bacon scoped it up and made it right. Please check them up."
4/16/2018,5 star rating,"Quick update: still love Burger Point! My favorite burger is the Spanish Revolution. I'm not one to try out different toppings (I'm typically a cheeseburger guy) but this burger has it all - great flavor profile and cooked to perfection. Further, my girlfriend loves the veggie burger with egg - highly recommend to all the vegetarians looking for a great alternative to tofu burgers.This place is truly a hidden gem that won't be hidden for much longer."
1/18/2018,5 star rating,"Quick Review:  Fantastic! Burgers are exceptional and only need one order of fries for two people. 78 Brand Ketchup is a must have. Expect a 10-15 min wait for food since they make things fresh.Long Review:I've been to Burger Point a few times in the last couple of months and this place never fails to disappoint. I was legitimately shocked to see an average of 3 stars total for this place because it is 5 stars all the way! After looking through some of the negative reviews it seems people have issues with the Grubhub delivery which isn't surprising since it takes Grubhub at least 30 minutes to get anywhere and your burger/fries will probably be cold by then. I guess order delivery at your own risk.Anyways, out of the few times I've been there, the owner is working the counter - he's a very nice guy and has great recommendations depending on your taste. I have been getting the Spanish Revolution while my girlfriend orders the Veggie 'build your own' burger. Since the burgers are made to order, it takes about 10-15 minutes to get your food, depending on how busy it is at the time. If you get an order of fries, I would only order one batch because you get more than enough for two hungry people to share.Finally, make sure to try the 78 Brand Ketchup. I can't decide whether I like the spicy or the regular ketchup more so I put a little of both on my plate."
2/9/2020,4 star rating,My wife love their fesh in house made Veggie Burger and sweet potato fries she says is the best she's ever had. I must say I enjoyed it  Also. One day I would like to try other burgers on the menu.

The place is cleaning, the staff is really professional and they know the menu. I was recommended the #2 meal is about 15 minutes or less it was ready just the way I like it ""medium"" literally the juices hit me. Not to mention the small cut french fries super good! I liked the fact that the food was prepared well, not greasy, not over done, just SIMPLE JUICY BURGER. Definitely worth coming out here!"
9/8/2018,5 star rating,Great place. Lots of burger options that can be customized. Fries were great with old bay. Wings were top notch and can get breaded or dry. Dry rub is my favorite and they had that too. Owner (I assume) was so nice and personable. If I lived here I'd come all the time. Easy to recommend.
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"I have passed this place 100 times, and always wanted to go in. Today, I am very happy I did. I experienced one of the best burgers I've ever had. That's not hyperbole, it's just fact. I went in, getting a quick serve/fast food vibe, and immediately thinking I was gonna get a Smash burger type burger. Or M Burger. Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular.The chalk board boasted an ""LAX""Burger. The description said simply ""Our version of an In & Out burger"". I didn't think, I just ordered. I got the double, and my wife got the single. When the food came, it was stacked high with hand packed beef patties. it was smothered with their animal sauce spread, and diced onions. it glistened with delight, and the clouds parted, and angels sang a hymn.One bite and I was convinced it was the closest thing to In & Out I have ever had, and I lived in SoCal for 5 years. My wife was born and raised in Cali and she loved it. Fries were crisp and hand cut. They were very good. This place is amazing. So many great looking unique burgers on the menu. It's got the DL top 5 burger in Chicago. Go indulge yourself!!"
10/27/2018,5 star rating,I ordered the savage and my friend ordered the jersey shore. Both were amazing! My burger and my friends burger was cooked to perfection. The Sea Salt Spiral Potato Stick was just enough as a side with these massive and fillling burgers! Will be back soon!
6/2/2018,5 star rating,This was a first time I've been to this place. I've live not too far from it and always pass by it. I didn't really look into their menu assume it's all beef since I'm pesco pollo vegetarian. My feeling got me to yelling this place because I've been craving for a good juicy burger and don't know any other place. Saw their menu I was drooling. They have unique burger and not all are beef their are turkey and chicken and a full vegetarian.  I was delightful and went in order myself a Saigon Jonny burger with truffle salt fries.

12/12/2015,4 star rating,"The burger point is on point!! They have so many varieties that it's impossible not to find something just for you. There are usually only 2-3 people working at a time, even during peak hours but don't be intimidated. They move quickly and food is cooked to perfection. All of the burger options (w/ fixings) can be made for the type of patty of your choosing (chicken, turkey, veggie, beef). I highly recommend trying the cranberry reduction and sweet potato fries. Just YUM!"

They have a lot choices of burger combinations including chicken, hot dogs, chili, and burger egg rolls (?). Or you can build your own! We got 3 different burgers and loved every one of them!!

1/26/2018,4 star rating,"Had  recently gone here to have the try the either the Original Burger point or Spanish Revolution but owner wanted me to try his new burger called ""The LAX"". He claims it is inspired by the famous ""In N Out Burger"" popular in the west coast if not better but in truth I would not call this burger ""The LAX"" . The new name that he did not like was a ""Glorified Mac"" which tasted fresher than McDonald's Big Mac but with non hormone beef. The sauce he used tasted similar to what is in Big Mac's . Any ways will still come back but personally I think he should change the name of his ""LAX"" burger to ""The Glorified Mac"". It was good since it tasted fresher."
6/13/2017,4 star rating,"2nd time coming here and had a better impression. I had the ""Burger Point"" burger and was spicy and delicious. I had the ""Tocino burger"" 1st time which did not woo me but now this burger point burger on the menu was much much better.:). Fries with bay was delicious too. Now I can jump up and down when I come here :)"
5/26/2017,3 star rating,"Again young coworkers were ranting and raving about this place next to ""Busy burger"" in the city and I have to say it's ""Good"" but NOT ""GREAT"". Ordered the ""Tocino burger"" for early supper after work and it's funny because you need the ""Bacon"" or ""Tocino"" to enhance the taste of the grass Fed burger which did not excite or delight me. I would come here maybe once in a full moon but this would not be my go to place to do ""Cartwheels"" for a burger. I have only had 1 burger that is the best but it's a person who now lives in Indiana. Some of these  young employees from CAD Department in ""Quantum Crossings"" have poor taste.  Equivalent to a ""Grain fed"" burger taste and quality at ""Meatheads"" up north by Lane tech which is also ""Good"" but NOT ""GREAT"".1"
4/13/2019,5 star rating,"BEST FOOD EXPERIENCE i've had here so far!I have very strict dietary restrictions and very high food expectations- not ones that are easily met. I am in town for an event at the convention center and I really needed something that wouldn't bother my stomach, and I already tried a coupleof places. The Burger Point hands down had the NICEST and most HELPFUL staff i have ever come across. My family and I have been there 3 times in 3 days and have not had one complaint...it actually only gets better! For those that care, the gluten free bun was actually awesome and they have a lot of accommodating menu options, all of which are absolutely as delicious as they are creative and plentiful. I will definitely be back before I leave chicago. Would recommend 10/10 times! Nothing beats fresh ingredients, extremely polite staff, and consistently GREAT BURGERS & FRIES (and my sister loved the hot dogs every time). There are also so many cool items i have yet to try. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome."

12/28/2019,5 star rating,Get the wings.  Lightly breaded. With the spicy garlic sauce.  You won't regret it.  Probably the best bone-in wings I've ever had.
12/27/2019,5 star rating,"Don't miss this opportunity for a fantastic burger and service. We stopped in after a full day of sight seeing and were extremely happy with the food. The hospitality is what sets this spot above the rest. The owner takes his time to talk to each guest, shakes their hands and makes the dining experience personal. That is something rare these days. Don't miss this spot! Fantastic!"
12/10/2019,5 star rating,"These burgers are so delicious I almost spent my last on them. Just the healthy look those gorgeous burgers have when their being delivered to you is so incredible. One bit and I Guaranteed to be hooked for your remainder of time your in this place might not want to leave. Heck might need another burger to go if so just say ""Anthony told me so."""

Plenty of on street pay to park available. You stand in a fast moving line, place your order, grab your fountain drink and select a table. I had the classic cheese burger (grass fed)on a potato bun, fries, and a ginger ale. My son had the The Dirty South Burger, fries and a coke. Fountain drink refills are free. Food is very fresh and tasty. Avg cost is $14 per person. Although we live 40 miles west of here, we'll be back!"

6/29/2020,3 star rating,Burgers were decent. Not the best but certainly not bad.. I would try again. I had turkey burger and he had the pepperoni burger . He said it was decent just needed a tad more seasoning and I agree with turkey burger/ the bbq wings were decent as well
7/21/2018,5 star rating,"I love burgers.  Whenever I travel I have to try at least one local hamburger joint.  We were staying at the Marriott Marques on the south side of downtown Chicago.  I yelped and saw theBurgerPoint. Glad I did.  The burger was great.  The party was hand formed, the vegetables were fresh, the bacon was crisp and the bun was fabulous.  Loved it.  Recommend this BURGER with all 5 stars."
6/17/2017,2 star rating,I've eaten here before and it was amazing that time.  So I thought I'd splurge after my cleanse and eat a yummy veggie burger. Yes the parking is available and free yeah.  I ordered the burger to go  since I live so close.  I got home and cut the burger in half and it was cold on the inside.   13$ for a cold veggie burger that I couldn't eat. YUCKKKK!! So I called them to let them know and the offer was to make me another burger..NO THANX
8/25/2019,5 star rating,"I don't eat red meat so it's tough to find a good turkey burger at times. Found this place thanks to Yelp and it was AMAZING. So many options for burgers! Fantastic staff. The gentleman at the register was super helpful. Everyone that worked there did a great job. The burger I had was phenomenal. The fries were stupendous, and  the wings..... BANANAS. Too fucking fire. Will definitely keep this place in rotation. One of my new favorite burger spots."
10/13/2019,5 star rating,I have been to many great burger joints across Chicago.  I would have to rank Burger Point as the best.  I had the Dirty South.  It was cooked to perfection and the flavors have you looking lustfully at the burger anticipating your next bite.  My lady friend was equally as pleased with the Burger Point Burger.  Excellent fries and amazing personal service.  Can't wait to try the chicken sandwich.  For this place not to be listed on the tribunes list of best burgers is a travesty.

6/6/2016,4 star rating,Got the savage burger but swapped mayo for siracha aoli and it was a good decision. My friend got the veggie one. Potato thing could have been cooked just a little less. We got the salt and vinegar one and the vinegar may have dried it out.
1/24/2018,5 star rating,The kind man at the register made my first time here seamless. He walked my dad and I through the whole menu so quickly and with much energy. Great guy. The food was great. Had the sampler. Will be back here again.
8/10/2017,3 star rating,"This particular review is long overdue. I'll start by stating they have a reward points incentive for frequent eaters. This particular location in the south loop is sort of genius because there's aren't many options in this area especially for burgers. They were featured on ""Chicago's Best"" for those who swear by the show. The menu is solid & highly customizable. My wife swears by their turkey burger & truffle (salt) fries (not pictured). My favorite dish happens to be the ""Burger rolls"". Basically it's a cheeseburger in an egg roll form. You can get them in quantities of 3 or 6 & the portion of 3 is enough to fill up even the hungriest of appetites. The roll is pretty standard however what makes the dish stand out is the special sauce served with it. It sort of has a sweet & tangy taste similar to ""thousand island"" but I think it's MORE special. The only dish in the city that can rival these burger rolls are the cheesesteak egg rolls at Del Frsico but when you want something quick these will surely suffice. The dining area has a couple of televisions as well so I'm sure this could also be an option for us dreaded Bears fans."
4/12/2015,3 star rating,"The food was absolutely amazing! The only bummer -about a 30 minute wait for the food (during our lunch hour). Everything is made fresh, to order. I think on this particular day, there was some sort of snafu and our ""to go"" order took extra long. However, the owner was super nice about it and very apologetic.I would totally be willing to go back for dinner when time is not of the essence.I brought back burgers for a few coworkers and we all agreed they were super de-lish! So just keep in mind the time factor when going."
9/7/2019,5 star rating,"This is the best burger place! If you're looking for fresh, organic, high quality ingredients that taste lip smacking good - this place is for you! I've tried many burger places in the city and this easily ranks among the best. Every time I go there, I'm warmly greeted and always receive consistent high quality customer service. They have 100's of options for buns, ingredients, toppings, etc. You can build your own burger or select one of the many menu options. The burgers are fresh and taste really good. Well-seasoned food and a variety of options for buns is what invited sold me, but the environment is what keeps me coming back. Aside from the burgers, my favorite side is their fresh cut sweet potato fries with sea salt. I can eat those as a meal. They also have wings with several different types of sauces. I highly recommend this place."
7/12/2019,5 star rating,The food here is so delicious. I was so impressed with the owner who came around to every single table to ask about the food and if anything was needed. This is the kind of business that becomes family to the community. Definitely don't think twice about eating here. You can not go wrong.

7/9/2019,5 star rating,"It's definitely a dive - in a good way. Very simple and to the point. The burgers were large and flavorful. Finally some place that knows what ""medium rare"" means.  Juicy burgers and crisp fries. Portions are great. The best part about this place is the staff. Genuinely concerned with your enjoyment of their food. Super nice people."
4/29/2019,5 star rating,"Love love Love Burger Point. I have been there several times over the years. I care to think i am a burger afficionado. They are always ""on point."" Aside from the food that never misses, the staff has always been attentive and helpful order and give new recommendations. Many burger places claim to have a great burger but this place is worth it!!"
1/29/2020,4 star rating,"Had the New American Classic after being recommended to this spot. Cashier that took the order was very helpful and courteous. The burger was awesome. Meat very tasty, toppings were delicious  and the pretzel bun rounded it out. Sometimes other places have pretzel buns that are too big, hard or don't taste good at all. Not here, this pretzel bun was excellent. Fries tasted good but came out cold. Only complaint."
6/28/2017,2 star rating,Food is good but there on line order is problematic. It changes ordered item and doesn't show all items. They have an answering machine that claims they're closed but aren't-they just have two lines which makes it impossible to correct a computer or phone order problem that was created by their system. Don't use online ordering alternative. Others expressed same annoyance
7/30/2017,5 star rating,Great place Juice Hamburgers If you're tired of Kuma's Corner and the lockdown this is the place where you can enjoy an amazing hamburger without those weird ingredients and super loud music
7/1/2017,5 star rating,"Great, friendly service and excellent burgers.  The burgers look picture-ready when they come out.  The owner (Michael) checked on us several times and made us feel quite welcome.  I built a burger and it was, um, on point .  The fries were tasty too.  I liked that they had spicy ketchup & mustard available on the tables, in addition to the regular varieties.  Nice looking restaurant, good atmosphere.  Would definitely eat here again!UPDATE: Went back and had a couple of the hot dogs (July special) and they were amazing too!  I wish we lived near this place."
6/29/2019,5 star rating,"The food is great ,service was excellent and I love the freshness of the veggies.  The turkey burger was perfectly seasoned along with the fresh cut fries (my favorite). It's a must try restaurant very clean and staff was extremely attentive."
4/10/2015,2 star rating,"Was so excited about the shroom burger and my added bourbon shrooms.  I'm so disappointed and because it was bought for me and my only lunch in a meeting I'm forced to eat this dry, tasteless, sorry for an excuse burger.We got delivery but delivery doesn't account for flavor lacking burgers and tasteless brie and swiss and shrooms.  And I would have expected my burger to be swimming in shrooms.  Instead they all fit nice and flat on the burger.For a place that specializes in burgers it seems like they did everything NOT to do when cooking a burger. So glad I didn't pay for this tasteless dry piece of meat."
8/17/2018,5 star rating,"By far my favorite restaurant ever!!!I eat out a lot and I've reviewed a lot of restaurants and I can honestly say this place is simply amazing! From the burgers that are absolutely unique and just flow with exceptional taste to the owner, Michael, who is the nicest, friendliest restaurant owner I have ever met, I recommend this place above any other restaurant, period!! I come her three or more times a week and always look forward to each bite of food. The fries are awesome and even though I haven't tried the wings or half a dozen other burgers, I know, and have heard, that everything is amazing. Michael is almost always there, so introduce yourself, he loves meeting people. Knowing that this restaurant is his baby and passion only makes coming her more enjoyable."
6/23/2019,5 star rating,If you want fantastic housemade wings this is the place to go. Low-key fun and BYOB. The owner is very sweet and chats with customers. He knows his regulars. My boyfriend had a burger and I had wings. Great flavor with that homemade feel. Will be back.

5/4/2019,5 star rating,"In this city, it's hard to have a go-to spot for too long. We have been coming to this place for the last few years and it's never disappointed us. Amazing quality burgers, fries, wings.... we've had it all. My usual order is actually their veggie burger. They call it the ""best veggie burger"" and it really is out of many I've tried. It's never dry and it's super flavorful. The owner and staff are also super nice and provide great service. Love this place!"
1/7/2015,2 star rating,"I used to come here a lot.  See the 49 check-ins?  Yeah, a lot!  And I didn't even check in every time I stepped through the door.  Do the math, ~ 75 visits times $13 per is a lot of frickin' money!But I stopped coming.  Mostly because of two things.  Their burgers, despite being cooked through, still maintained a juiciness about them.  For me, that's all that matters.  This all changed sometime in 2014 which left me rather grumpy.  Second, their fries used to be crunchy and tasty.  Again, something changed and I began receiving soggy, limp fries.  An off night happens but trends started to appear.I don't know if they read online reviews but I'd strongly encourage them to revisit their quality.  Cook the burgers a bit less even if customers don't ask.  I don't want a dry burger.  And ensure the fries are crispy.  Simple concept.  I don't need magic, just food worth craving.  Perhaps I'll visit again in time to see if they've improved upon their mistakes.  I miss this place.  But I miss what used to be."
10/27/2011,5 star rating,"Fabulous!I've been eagerly awaiting this place unsure of what delicious goodies I'd find within. Week after week I'd walk past only to see brown paper lined windows and feel inner disappointment. My burger belly was becoming restless and I was running out of ideas. With a website broadcasting a September opening, my October days passed every so slowly. Coming in from out of town this cold rainy evening, I couldn't be happier to notice bright lights shining from within. What a rush.Burgers. It's so easy to do a good burger. Make one that tastes like chain fast food and people bend over backwards praising your godliness. Luckily for me, The Burger Point does a GREAT burger. Mine was smothered in cheese, french onion dip, potato chips and tasted exactly like what a burger should be. It actually tasted fresh. The owner made clear to point out their use of top quality ingredients all of which are freshly ground and prepared onsite. The fries on the side had their skins on and were full of flavor. I went with the regular fries and was ecstatic with what I received. I was eating them so fast I nearly bit my fingers off.The place is small but they do a great job making use of the limited space. A cluster of tables topped with baskets of napkins and condiments are found along with plasma TVs near the dining area. It's a cool place with hip music playing within. I've found my home. Who said it wasn't cool to be in the sloop?"
5/30/2019,5 star rating,"Love this place. Let me just start by saying that the staff are absolutely phenomenal. My first time there, they took the time to explain the menu and show me all of my options and give me plenty of recommendations. The spiral potato chips were okay but the sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar are where it's at. They. Are. Amazing. And a large order is a LARGE order so I split it with a friend and have enough to eat before, during, and after my burger. Speaking of their burgers: what a deal. I (22 yo girl) get the smaller size (6 oz) and it's perfect. I love that I can customize whatever I want and even still go there on Fridays in lent #veggieburgers. Their staff is just the kindest, most friendly group of people ever. I go here all the time and would give this place 1000 stars if I could."
12/19/2016,4 star rating,"Back when Burger Point opened up some years ago, I went in there and ordered something. It was good, but not really anything to write home about. The service felt kinda abrupt, and I figured it'd just be something to go to if in the area, but nothing to really rush out and get. Then something happened about 2 weeks ago, probably a hangover and a lot of snow outside, and I somehow stumbled upon burger point on yelp or something. I'm not sure how I ended up there, but I ended up ordering a bowl of chili, a 12oz hangover burger (with bonus bourbon mushrooms), and maybe some fries. The quality of that burger surprised the hell out of me. It was well cooked, the flavors popped, and the serving size was pretty massive. it was everything I needed, and I promised myself I'd order again. So, I did order again, and it was just as good, and then I got the idea to explore the menu a little more, so I went for this Spanish Revolution burger. Unfortunately, the flavors of the spanish revolution burger weren't good. I'm not sure if it was the mix of american cheese and pepperjack, or maybe the mixture of the cheeses with the ranch mayo, or maybe the mixture of everything with the jalapeno relish. I really love spicy food, but this wasn't spicy or good. But hey, I'm just one guy, and there are probably a lot more people who love that burger. For me, it just wasn't there. However, I have really fallen in love with the hangover burger, and the cheeseburger eggroll thing is also good, as is the chili. Additionally, they charge a very fair $1.00/can fee for soda, which I always appreciate as I'm a caffeine addict, and a lot of businesses gouge customers, charging $1.25/can or more. Keep up the good work, burger pointers. You've got a fan in me."
2/18/2018,5 star rating,I was searching for a place where I could have a good burger in town.

The staff was helpful and friendly, and the food was excellent.

We will be back for the great food and exceptional service!"
8/13/2018,5 star rating,"I'm a sucker for a good burger and this place does not disappoint. In addition, they have amazing home cut fries that even delivered arrive hot. I think a good burger has to have a good bun and that means potato buns for me. Absolutely love the taste with a good homemade patty burger. They have excellent secret sauce that reminds me a lot of McDonald's. Really takes burger to next level."
6/3/2020,1 star rating,"Honestly, I was very disappointed. I ordered my burger medium rare (I normally wouldn't have specified at all, but their grub hub menu asks you to pick) and it came completely overcooked, dry and gray throughout. My egg and fries were also very well over cooked. They also completely ignored most of my add ons and alterations. I asked for lettuce tomato and onion on my burger, as well as subbing my cheese for a different kind. The only thing they did was give me lettuce. The only alteration they got right was not giving my girlfriend cheese, because she's allergic, which I specified. The fact they got that right, but not anything else means they obviously saw the notes and ignored them. There were also a handful of sweet potato fries mixed in with my normal fries, meaning they don't keep their food separated well. And to top it all off, not only was my burger over done and dry, but my girlfriends chicken sandwich was also overdone and dry. Incredibly disappointed as not one single thing we ordered was even close to average or even remotely worth the $30+ we spent for 2 sandwiches and fries. Definitely won't consider going back."
5/29/2020,5 star rating,"We live in the units above the restaurant. This place has fire wings and burgers. Get the wings Baltimore dry rub with sauce on the side. The burgers and fries are good too. You can get just a regular burger or one of their specialties. Customer service is also always on point whether on the phone or carry out. The price is a little higher, but this ain't McDonalds."

I can totally appreciate their fresh ingredients. Grass fed, delicious beef with amazing toppings. They have a HUGE menu.. I ordered the #18.. Double bacon, cheddar and Canadian bacon.. I wasn't a fan of the honey mustard.. Overall just ok.  Boyfriend ordered the Spanish revolution .. That was tasty, topped with jalapeños. We also got an order or their hot wings .. Good.. But breaded .. I'm not a fan of breaded wings .. MEH. Overall a good experience .. Wasn't amazing ... But good..Might have to try it again."

He gave me points for my order, he helped me find the burger I wanted and he was so so nice when I later changed my order from ""to eat here"" to ""to go"". He didn't look annoyed or anything. On the contrary he kept apologizing which I felt bad about because I was just leaving due to a last-minute personal issue and NOT because they were taking long. The wait was not bad at all. The quality of the burgers is worth it and understandable!! The food is amazing and I hope that man gets recognition for his kindness and patience!"

10/8/2018,5 star rating,"We had an amazing time. We we're in town for a convention. Other places were packed and we needed to find a place to take our large group. I looked on Yelp for other close places. I stumbled upon The Burger Point. I saw 4stars, 2$$ and went for it. This place was AMAZING. The food was delish, they handled our group of 12 ladies who were famished, with smiles and sincere gratitude. From the initial phone call checking on the wait, to the food delivery and our exit this was by far the best 'quick food' experience I have ever had. From the owner to his son and the staff, THEY were awesome. Places these are hard to find. Side note, I particularly took interest in the fact that their ingredients are fresh, no antibiotic meat, good for you, right down to the ketchup in the table! In our wellness company that really spoke to me.  I highly recommend if you are in Chicago to check this gem out!"
12/28/2019,3 star rating,"I ordered the shroom and while it had a ton of mushrooms, It couldn't make up for the patty. The patty itself was nothing special. It was over cooked and dry, even through I asked for medium. The fries  are overly soggy. The only thing that was okay was the chili which was actually pretty good."
1/3/2018,4 star rating,"Really great quality food for a good price. Personally I loved the Lax burger being from California this burger got really close to the In & Out burger. They had great fresh cut fries as well my son ordered a burger and he eat the entire thing and that's saying a lot since he is a picky eater. My only complaint was it's a bit small in there so it got kinda drafty when they had  two doors on each side being opened quiet often bing that it's the dead of winter in Chicago you can see my point, but other then that it was a great experience and I will be returning for sure!!"
7/14/2016,5 star rating,I tried the burger point last year under a different management and the food was not good... I tried it again yesterday and it had dramatically improved... It improved so much I placed another order that totaled over $100 (group). We plan to order again and often. I'm so happy I tried them again because I love a good burger. My favorite so far is #11 the burger rolls... They will fill you up and satisfy any hunger pains6 for 12.25 is a deal. You won't be disappointed.
1/3/2017,4 star rating,"Good food, really nice selection of burgers, and a cool spot. Service wasn't super fast, but it's worth it knowing the food is cooked to order. It's a nice alternative to Burger Bar if that place is crowded or you want to try something similar. Some great ones to order: Dirty South (my favorite by far), Ashman & the shroom burger. Turkey burger was okay from what I remember, not great. Also the last time I ordered the truffle fries it came with some spray that wasn't super appetizing, but they may have changed that by now."
10/25/2018,4 star rating,Long overdue review. Let me start by saying I love this place. Unfortunately I had a terrible experience with their delivery a few weeks ago.I waited 1.5 hours for one veggie burger and fries. My food arrived cold and I was not happy. The owner immediately fixed the situation once he found out via my review on yelp. He went as far as giving me a credit for my order. This was not expected and very generous. I will continue to support this place but probably won't use their delivery again. Food has always been amazing here otherwise!

I got a small order of Sweet Potato Fries, and I swear to GOD they must have laced them with something addictive because I couldn't put them down!! The cinnamon and sugar along with the crispy outside and warm sweet inside was freaking heaven!... not to mention the gentleman behind the counter was so amazingly nice. This was my first time here and I can't wait to go back and bring people with me."

10/18/2012,3 star rating,"Finally came around to trying Burger Point! Service can be a bit slow but it was no biggie. My friend and I each ordered a burger with an order of fries and drink; it came out to approximately $12 per person. It's not exactly cheap considering you can also get a burger at the nearby McD's for half the price. BUT, BP serves their burgers with grass-fed patties. That's quality for you health-conscience foodies out there! I had the six ounce gobbler. It may not sound like a lot but that food baby dragged me home and knocked me out cold on the couch for a good two hours. The burger was a pile of turkey patty, Philly cream cheese and cranberry reduction sitting atop a 100% whole wheat roll. It sounds oh-so-healthy as it slaps mounds of calories onto your diet. Mmm...waters my mouth as I recall the burger... Basically, if you enjoy Thanksgiving/turkey dinners, you would enjoy this burger. And while you're at it, it won't hurt anymore to get the combo with fries! Although I wish the fries wouldn't be so thin and stringy."
2/4/2019,5 star rating,This place is amazing the food is great as well as the service. I recommend this burger spot to everyone you will love the food it's hands down one of the best burger spots around.
12/19/2016,4 star rating,The place is awesome and the food even better. I like this Burger Point best because the staff is always very friendly and the food is on point. Because the food is top quality the time for waiting will take long and seating is first come first serve since there are only a few.
1/18/2019,5 star rating,Love this place. The burgers are made to order. Great variety. Fresh cut fries. The owner is super friendly. Great customer service!
11/25/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious food options and attentive staff. There are so many yummy burger options with a variety of toppings to choose from. I always stick with the fresh wings and my darling son opts for a burger with a side of fresh cut fries. Michael, the owner is attentive and friendly. He always walks over to each dine-in customer to ensure the food tastes good and the order is correct. The cook staff always greet me with a smile and say hello. There's plenty of side street parking and free customer parking in the back of the building. If you're not sure...just as the staff and they'll be more than happy to let you know where you can find the parking lot."
2/19/2019,5 star rating,"I just had the BEST turkey burger I've ever had! It was AMAZING, juicy, well seasoned, and fresh! The customer service was outstanding! The sweet potato fries were hot and cooked just right!  I have a new favorite spot & will most definitely be back!"
5/22/2018,5 star rating,"I'm mad that I just found out about this place. It's really good! I had a 6oz build your own, because I'm pretty simple in my requisite toppings. They cook it to your desired temp, so I'm not sure how people are saying they are overcooked. I cannot stand when the only option is well done, so I was happy to know I had options! If you're in the S. Loop, they are definitely worth a try."
4/20/2018,4 star rating,"I got a classic burger and it was great! The fries went super well with my burger. I want to go back and try the cheeseburger egg rolls as well! One of the main reasons I'm writing this review is the PASTRIES. I have been a few times and recently noticed that they started selling little bundt cakes. I tried the lemon flavor and OH MY GOD! It was the most moist and satisfying cake I have tasted in a VERY long time. The company is called A Slice of Hope Pastries, so if you ever want to get some BOMB CAKE head to Burger Point. This cake was definitely an AMAZING addition to the Burger Point menu."
4/17/2018,5 star rating,"The Buffalo.   This ground buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries was YUM!! It was SOOO GOOD! Great portions, great quality and awesome service!!!!#southloop #chicago #travelfood #local"
4/16/2018,5 star rating,"Quick update: still love Burger Point! My favorite burger is the Spanish Revolution. I'm not one to try out different toppings (I'm typically a cheeseburger guy) but this burger has it all - great flavor profile and cooked to perfection. Further, my girlfriend loves the veggie burger with egg - highly recommend to all the vegetarians looking for a great alternative to tofu burgers.This place is truly a hidden gem that won't be hidden for much longer."
1/18/2018,5 star rating,"Quick Review:  Fantastic! Burgers are exceptional and only need one order of fries for two people. 78 Brand Ketchup is a must have. Expect a 10-15 min wait for food since they make things fresh.Long Review:I've been to Burger Point a few times in the last couple of months and this place never fails to disappoint. I was legitimately shocked to see an average of 3 stars total for this place because it is 5 stars all the way! After looking through some of the negative reviews it seems people have issues with the Grubhub delivery which isn't surprising since it takes Grubhub at least 30 minutes to get anywhere and your burger/fries will probably be cold by then. I guess order delivery at your own risk.Anyways, out of the few times I've been there, the owner is working the counter - he's a very nice guy and has great recommendations depending on your taste. I have been getting the Spanish Revolution while my girlfriend orders the Veggie 'build your own' burger. Since the burgers are made to order, it takes about 10-15 minutes to get your food, depending on how busy it is at the time. If you get an order of fries, I would only order one batch because you get more than enough for two hungry people to share.Finally, make sure to try the 78 Brand Ketchup. I can't decide whether I like the spicy or the regular ketchup more so I put a little of both on my plate."
4/8/2018,5 star rating,"Every time I have a craving for a hamburger, the Burger Point delivers.  The hamburger is really lean and flavorful, and I love the pretzel roll.  The  sweet potato fries are AMAZING too!"
4/6/2018,5 star rating,"Located south of downtown. On my recent trip to Chicago I drove all the way down to The Burger Point twice! Their cheese burger is delicious and fresh. Perfect ratio of meat to cheese to bun. I also tried their All Beef hot dogs. I got one Chicago styled and one chili cheese dogs. Both were amazing. Also, the owner was very helpful. Definitely would come back!"
4/5/2018,5 star rating,"Burger point is indeed on point. Starting with their customer service, they great you when your first enter but it's not like a robot greeting. You truly feel welcomed and they help/accommodate with your order. I went with my friend and she's a vegan, she asked for specific requests and she was not disappointed. Always love introducing my friends and family to this place. For the three years that I've been coming here, I still haven't been let down."
3/31/2018,5 star rating,"Went for the first time today. Excellent! Built my own chicken burger and had the fries with sea salt. The burger was excellent, cooked perfectly. Toppings were fresh and tasty. Fries were perfect as well. Owner let me sample the sauce with the fries, made them even better! Service was great. Didn't have to wait long. I will surly be back!"
3/30/2018,5 star rating,"Great lunch spot! Staff was awesome and super-helpful, which was great as I was dining my my pre-teen and toddler. The burgers were awesome and their menu is great. Fries were good as well, and the spicy ketchup option was delicious!"
3/26/2018,5 star rating,"I'm trying to think of a burger place that trumps this one. I cannot. I've had the chicken sandwich and turkey burgers. Both are the best of the best in their categories. Also, the fries are plentiful and delicious."
11/2/2015,5 star rating,"I should've taken a picture because the burger was damn pretty. Like picture perfect out of a commercial pretty.My burger was ""ashman"" and it's just perfect. Nice char, crisp sour chopped up pickles, amazing sauce, some tomatoes and greens. The potato bun was perfect as well. I also got the potato spiral stick. I highly recommend getting 2. Trust me. I really dislike heavy buns and thick patties. Their buns are light and they do multiple patties to prevent that meatloaf texture of a patty. My burger was 2-3oz aka 6oz. I'm not sure why this place doesn't have more hype. Everything is absolutely fresh and made to order. Their kitchen is kind of open and you can see them prepping everything. Including fresh ground turkey for the turkey burgers! Their burgers are better than Au Cheval, Small Cheval, Owen & Engine, Kumas and etc. If you've ever thought of an ideal burger with endless topping ideas and bun pairings... Come here. This place has decent parking too!"
1/12/2019,4 star rating,Extremely great options for your burger needs.  Would strongly recommend if your visiting the area or would like to eat a decent burger. Many grass fed and turkey burger options available. Only trouble is picking the one you'd like from their jumbled menu.  Friendly staff and large serving of fries is also a benefit.
5/12/2016,3 star rating,"Their screen says allow 10 to 15 minutes to prepare because everything is cooked to order. I only had 35 minutes, but went ahead and ordered. 30 minutes later I got my food, which made me late for an appointment next-door.Burger itself was good and probably worthy of four stars. I told the young lady , and I was clearly annoyed. The manager came over and gave me a refund which was very nice and appreciated.But they get it 3 for being so late and taking so long to prepare."
10/6/2018,5 star rating,"5 stars for the incredible joy and kindness of the staff! Found out it was the owner and his son! Great menu, fresh ingredients, we had a great experience. It's rare to see such great, heartfelt service these days- it was so refreshing to feel like so much heart was put into our order and service!"
8/24/2016,2 star rating,"In one word: Overpriced. If they weren't nearby my house, I wouldn't eat there. I know they sell natural ingredients, etc. but doesn't make them any less of rip off."
4/14/2016,5 star rating,I enjoyed my burger at this restaurant. When you walk in the owner makes you feel welcomed. I asked him for the wifi password and he immediately shared it with me. They have pictures of all their burgers if you like to visualize what you may eat. I ordered 'The Hangover Burger' with sea salt fries. The restaurant was clean and tidy. The people provided service with a smile. I had a great experience and highly recommend it.
9/22/2018,5 star rating,The Da' bears burger is awsome.   The green chili is actual honest to goodness green chili and the service is wonderful!

8/2/2018,5 star rating,"This spot is excellent! The decor is cool and I like how modern it is with the menus on flat screens. I had a mushroom Swiss burger that was amazing. I couldn't decide on the bun I wanted, the owner was on the register (he was FINE) he helped me decide. All the employees were gracious and the food came out quickly. Definitely recommend this joint."
10/30/2018,5 star rating,I'm so I happy I found this restaurant!!! I maybe what you call a burger Connoisseur!!!! I know a good burger when I see one and trust me when tell you they have them here.  You can even Customize your own burger with all fresh ingredients. The one item they will get you hook is their burger egg rolls . They were so good I order some to go
7/27/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome service! I believe the man who took my order was the owner. He and the staff were very hospitable and attentive. The restaurant looked clean. The food was good, sweet potato fries were cooked and seasoned well. I ordered the All American burger, it was good, especially with that wasabi sauce, however the egg was luke warm to room temperature. Overall I will return. Good prices, for the location."
10/27/2019,5 star rating,"Great food and service. Burger, wings, fries were all cooked perfect with quick service. 10/10 would recommend"
10/18/2018,5 star rating,"This place has the best veggie burger I have ever had (no kidding). The owner is also extremely nice, and makes an effort to walk around the restaurant to ensure all the guests expectations are met. Not to mention, very quick service. Keep it up guys!"
8/27/2018,5 star rating,Great place to get good food. Burgers are very intriguing and they have wide variety to choose from as well as toppings. I'm on a no meat kick so I've been enjoying the sweet potato fries and veggie chili. One con is they aren't open late but they make good money so I'm sure they don't have to. Lol
7/13/2018,5 star rating,The owner is amazing! P.S. If you have an issue with your food instead of leaving a bad review talk to the guy and he'll make it right! I will be back again! Awesome service!
5/3/2015,4 star rating,"UPDATE: Burger Point's ownership has reached out to me and individuals who were there at the time of the incident. They apologized for our experience and took necessary action in response to this review.I applaud and acknowledge their customer service and find it admirable to see a restaurant go the distance to ensure their customers are treated equally and fairly. You do not see this kind of response and urgency often from a small business ever and so I give them points for this. Thank you Burger Point for the action that you have taken and will visit again.INITIAL REVIEW:I have been here a good number of times and think the burgers are pretty good. However, after today, I will never go again.A group of friends went and we were waiting for our orders. As we were waiting for our food, they called one of my friend's names to pick up his food, but they had difficulty pronouncing it. After a delayed response from my friend, one of the workers mumbled under his breath about ""Chinese"" as my friend walked away with his food.  Another one of my friends who was still in line and about to order, heard the mumbling and said ""actually, he's Korean.""  To this, the worker responded, ""Korean, Chinese, whatever"" and continued to mumble under his breath.  In response to the continued mumbling about ""Chinese people..."", my friend, thinking she heard the word ""chink"" asked the guy: ""did you just say chink?""  Instead of apologizing or denying his statement, the staff brushed it off and said, ""Whatever. Calm down darling. I'm just doing my job.""Other employees told this worker to ""shut up"" and tried to shove him to the back of the kitchen, but they didn't acknowledge or apologize for his behavior.  The guy refused to shut up and continued to shout over his co-workers and argue with my friend that he was just doing his job.  Being even more offended that the business wouldn't apologize or acknowledge what just happened, my friend proceeded to call them out saying, ""You do not call your Asian customers chinks!"" and marched out. The rest of us were waiting for our food and no one from management came to us to apologize or do anything to alleviate the situation. Although we paid for our food, we all marched out.So I would like to say, congratulations on taking our money and being very racist without any apologies or customer service. You guys lost a loyal customer. Good job!"
10/6/2018,4 star rating,One of the better burger spots you will find. You have the option of getting a 6 oz or 12 oz burger. I tried the 6 oz burger point with a large fry and a drink. It was pretty good. The burger was well done and you get more than enough fries to fill your belly. I will definitely be back to try another burger.
10/3/2017,2 star rating,"I ordered 3 burgers for delivery. Open the bag to only 2 burgers... but it 3 of us. Call to tell them about it. Sat on hold for 8 minutes, and after I spoke to the person on the other end he told me he only charged for two and act like it should be a problem because I wasn't charged and offered no apology. It's a BIG problem because it's 3 hungry people here. I would NEVER order from them again! And my friends said that every time they have ordered something always wrong on their order."
8/9/2019,5 star rating,"Being a long way from home, New Zealand, and looking for a burger we stumbled into this place. We couldnt be happier. The guy on the till was welcoming and helpful recommending us a burger based on our likes. Before to long a freshly made burger and some fries arrived at our table. Great burger. Would happily eat there again before we head to Nz."
9/22/2015,4 star rating,"Tasty! They have a ton of preset burger options to choose from OR you can build your own. BYO is always a nice option but for me, it's like being at a salad bar... everything might look good but it doesn't necessarily taste good together. I kept it simple and went with option 1 - The Burger Point burger. It had pepper jack cheese, bacon, a roasted chili pepper sauce of sorts a fried (over easy/medium) egg served on a soft pretzel roll. If I made that same burger as a ""build your own"" it very well could have been $15! --- no idea how much actually, but add-ons were mostly $1 extra each so I'm probably not too far off. I also like the fact that everything is made to order. I don't mind waiting for fresh food. I actually substituted the beef burger for turkey but don't worry I kept the full on pork bacon as-is. ;-)"

9/23/2018,5 star rating,"Picked up two classic burgers for my girlfriend and I. The burgers and the fries were really good. The food only took between 5-10 minutes to be bagged and ready for take out, which was really impressive. The burger was really messy, but luckily it stayed in one piece."
4/3/2016,5 star rating,"My team goes to this spot alot because of the good food, good prices, and close proximity to our workplace. The owner is usually there when we go during the weekdays at lunch time. He's a really nice guy & you can tell he cares alot about his food and his restaurant. He knows where all of his ingredients come from and has even switched vendors who have not maintained certain standards for food quality and freshness.Pro tip!!! when you go there make sure to try the spicy ketchup. It is baller!!!!!"
3/17/2017,5 star rating,"I visited the Burger Point for lunch and had the Blue Harvest Burger with sweet potato fries.  My God!!! The burger was very flavorful, well cooked and very hot. The sweet potato fries were simply amazing - cooked just right and not too sweet!  Most restaurants will serve your food luke warm at best - but not here.  When I asked if I could substitute the patty and get a turkey patty instead of beef, the owner (who took my order I may add), was more than happy to accommodate my request.  Not only was the food amazing, but the customer service was equally impressive.  The staff was very friendly and to see management walking around speaking to the guest, making sure that their meal/service was good, speaks volumes!!!  I wasn't a huge burger fan until I starting eating here... this place is HIGHLY recommended!!!! You wont be disappointed!"
7/23/2017,4 star rating,"Stay far far away from the veggie burger. I typically don't like vegan or vegetarian versions of food. There's was exceptionally weak and effortless. I don't know if they made the patty in house or not, but it's a no for me dog. I hate I wasted my hunger on it. I will say the regular burgers, turkey and chicken are all pretty good. The fries are as well. The potato buns are perfect. The service is excellent."
5/31/2015,1 star rating,Each time I have ordered delivery from them and I do mean each time...something is forgotten or left off the order. I waited a hour for cold food and no drink. And when I called in to tell them I was told flippantly that there is only one driver. You charge $5 fee on top of a tip so it seems you could afford another driver...or better yet an employee sans the smart ass mouth.  Contrary to your smart ass employee saying we are the only burger point ummmm well there is a burger bar not far...time I gave them a try. This place is not worth it.
9/12/2018,5 star rating,Large portions. Good customer service. I ordered the All American Burger with mushrooms and the wifey had the hangover burger with Turkey. Both were outstanding. Forgot to take a photo and now it's too late..lol

2/28/2019,5 star rating,"We come here so often that my 3 year old equates hamburgers, wings and fries with this place and turns his nose up at any fast food burgers. My in laws were totally thrown when he refused a happy meal and told them to take him to Burger Point.  Suffice to say I'm waiting for them to name a menu item after us... highly recommend the Italian Job, the Dirty South, ANY of the wings and for you fellow west coaster craving In N Out, the LAX. Tastes like home. #yum Also love the fact that it's grassfeed beef and the ingredients are high quality. My littles love the kids burger and the grilled cheese is fire! You know it's good when it's the first meal you request after delivering a baby. Staff is incredibly friendly and sweet to my children. It's hands down our favorite/go to place to eat out/order in."

5/24/2019,4 star rating,My 12 year old son and I ate lunch here on a weekday. Best burgers we have had in a long time. Good sized portion - didn't finish your burger in 3 bites. We went with a cheese and bacon beef burger and a blue cheese and bacon jam option. Both were delicious. Sweet potato fries could be crispier - mustard citrus dip was amazing though. I took extra home and used as a dressing on a salad that night. Definitely worth a visit.
3/3/2018,5 star rating,"The burger point is the best burger place in the city for people who really appreciate a real burger. I get the appeal of Au Chevalier (Kuma is overrated and flavorless), but for my time and money, I'll take a Burger Point burger any day. Amazing flavor; absolutely top-notch ingredients; plenty of options. The sides are also phenomenal. It makes no sense to me that this spot isn't 4.8+ stars. I'm from Texas and Arkansas, and I've been making and eating burgers for decades. Come support an amazing business and find your new favorite burger spot."

8/10/2017,3 star rating,"This particular review is long overdue. I'll start by stating they have a reward points incentive for frequent eaters. This particular location in the south loop is sort of genius because there's aren't many options in this area especially for burgers. They were featured on ""Chicago's Best"" for those who swear by the show. The menu is solid & highly customizable. My wife swears by their turkey burger & truffle (salt) fries (not pictured). My favorite dish happens to be the ""Burger rolls"". Basically it's a cheeseburger in an egg roll form. You can get them in quantities of 3 or 6 & the portion of 3 is enough to fill up even the hungriest of appetites. The roll is pretty standard however what makes the dish stand out is the special sauce served with it. It sort of has a sweet & tangy taste similar to ""thousand island"" but I think it's MORE special. The only dish in the city that can rival these burger rolls are the cheesesteak egg rolls at Del Frsico but when you want something quick these will surely suffice. The dining area has a couple of televisions as well so I'm sure this could also be an option for us dreaded Bears fans."

7/20/2017,1 star rating,"For a restaurant to have the title ""burger""in it, I would have expected exceptional burgers, but unfortunately it fell far short of my expectation. I had the 6oz burger point burger and my friend had a 12 oz savage burger and we shared sweet potato fries. The size difference between the burgers was that larger one had two patties. The burgers were made on the spot which was respectable but there were just too many flaws:- The wait was long given that we were the first ones there and to order.- There burgers were also overdone and dry. I felt like I was just chewing meat, there was barely any seasoning.- The cheese on the burger had melted and condensed. There was no stringyness to it. - Burgers were a bit greasy and felt heavy afterwards- The sweet potato fries were also made fresh but were also very greasy. The only thing I really enjoyed was the spicy ketchup condiment to help mask the flavor of unseasoned meat."

These are The best burgers in chicago !!  First of all they cater to EVERYONE, from the meat eater to the vegetarian to the healthconscious !

I came here for a quick birthday lunch and got more service than I was expecting and I loved every bit of it! By the way I never told them it was my birthday .... my sister is getting married Sunday and I'm in town for a week so I could have eaten anywhere but I ate here and I'm so glad I did. They even kept my food warm when I had to step out to help the bride (she was getting her makeup done down the street). I had the turkey burger and it was the best I've ever had and PACKED with flavor and not TOO seasoned. Love this place already! The owner is the friendliest guy you will ever meet!"

6/28/2017,2 star rating,Food is good but there on line order is problematic. It changes ordered item and doesn't show all items. They have an answering machine that claims they're closed but aren't-they just have two lines which makes it impossible to correct a computer or phone order problem that was created by their system. Don't use online ordering alternative. Others expressed same annoyance
6/28/2017,4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try out this burger place for quite a while, and recently we had a chance to have dinner on a late friday night (Probably one of the few places open till 11pm). The main reason I had wanted to go to this place is because they had a veggie burger on their menu. Being a vegetarian, it's a rare occasion that u get to eat veggie burgers. The food was very tasty and I would go again!"
6/20/2017,4 star rating,"A great burger. I have been here a few times, and while the price may seem a little high, it's a better burger than DMK for the price. I have eaten an American classic and the turkey burger, both spot on."

Yes the parking is available and free yeah.  I ordered the burger to go  since I live so close.  I got home and cut the burger in half and it was cold on the inside.   13$ for a cold veggie burger that I couldn't eat.

5/3/2017,5 star rating,"1st time posting, but the BURGERS here are probably the best in the city in my opinion. Grass fed beef, veggie and turkey burgers, something for everyone. It's  a great place to eat. The portions are excellent. I'm not a ketchup person, but the spicy ketchup is  great on the fries. Had an opportunity to speak with owner, who's a very personable gentleman.  BURGER POINT does a burger right. Can't wait til my college kids come home, so I can treat them to a real burger."
5/22/2018,5 star rating,"I'm mad that I just found out about this place. It's really good! I had a 6oz build your own, because I'm pretty simple in my requisite toppings. They cook it to your desired temp, so I'm not sure how people are saying they are overcooked. I cannot stand when the only option is well done, so I was happy to know I had options! If you're in the S. Loop, they are definitely worth a try."
4/27/2015,5 star rating,This vegetarian was very happy with the fare at The Burger Point. The veggie burger is made on site and it amazing.  Surprisingly they also offer a vegetarian chili for their chili fries complete with tofu.I can't speak for the burgers but my friends were more then happy with theirs. If I am ever back in Chicago I will be stopping by again.

1/14/2018,4 star rating,Finally tried burger point tonight and was not disappointed! I ordered online which was really simple unlike some of the other ordering systems I've seen. I arrived there a little early to pay for my pickup order and the owner seemed worried that I was waiting. I think that's really considerate  especially because I waited less than five minutes for my food. He seemed to really care about his customers. Now the meaty part... the burgers! I eat my burgers plain so I know a good burger when I see one and these were delicious! Big plus for having grass fed beef. The 6 oz. burger was plentiful enough to fill my always hungry boyfriend so double win! Overall I would come back again for the food and maybe eat in next time.
1/13/2018,5 star rating,"A cute little storefront place with grass fed beef burgers and lots of great toppings. The fries are great too. Not a fancy place, but a very good place for a burger."
4/20/2018,4 star rating,"I got a classic burger and it was great! The fries went super well with my burger. I want to go back and try the cheeseburger egg rolls as well! One of the main reasons I'm writing this review is the PASTRIES. I have been a few times and recently noticed that they started selling little bundt cakes. I tried the lemon flavor and OH MY GOD! It was the most moist and satisfying cake I have tasted in a VERY long time. The company is called A Slice of Hope Pastries, so if you ever want to get some BOMB CAKE head to Burger Point. This cake was definitely an AMAZING addition to the Burger Point menu."
8/13/2015,5 star rating,It is really healthyYou have several options to choose including veggie I love itI'll return for sure
2/21/2017,4 star rating,"This is now my favorite burger joint!  Their products are purchased locally, grass fed, meat is ground in house, burgers are fresh, never frozen!  Can you say FRESH!!!!  You can literally see them patting the burgers by hand!  I had the turkey burger and it was juicy and very flavorful.  Not only are the burgers good, the service was good as well.  The owner took the time to stop by our table to see if we were enjoying the food and engaged us in a little friendly small talk, it was really refreshing.  We will definitely be back."
3/17/2019,5 star rating,This place is no joke!! The burgers and fries are amazing! They go above and beyond to make the perfect burger for you. This place is going to be dangerous for me because I'm going to want to be there every week. Can't wait to be a regular. Seriously! This place is insanely good!
11/4/2011,4 star rating,"Lucky me that I've got a good friend that is literally so on top of the goings around town that she had us lunching at The Burger Point a week after they had opened their doors.  I was pretty excited and hungry for a burger by the time we had made the short drive to the South side, State and Archer.  The restaurant itself is brightly lit with ample seating all around and a few TVs on the walls.  We took a quick glance at the menus and placed our order up front, #1 Burger Point Burger, #3 Crunchy Burger, russet and sweet potato fries.  We grabbed a seat and caught up for a bit and about ten minutes later we were called and our order was up.  I'm not looking for an assembly line precooked Whammy burger, so I really liked that they were freshly done.  We tore right in to our burgers.  Mine had roasted chile peppers (jalapenos I think), fried egg, smoked bacon and pepperjack on a pretzel roll.  I really liked it.  It had a nice kick, a great bun and the bacon was fantastic.  While I'd prefer a burger medium rare, I had no problem with it being cooked through.  Sadly, the egg that I had much looked forward to was overdone with no runny yolk goodness to speak of.  That would have taken my breakfast burger to another level.  Still, it was a great burger.  Pretty sure that Red enjoyed her burger too.  The Crunchy had double American cheese, potato chips, french onion dip on a potato roll.  The fries were a letdown for us.  Shoestring style isn't my favorite.  They seemed to be undercooked.  I liked the salty russet fries to the sweet potato that had a heavy dusting of sugar and were served with honey mustard.  Everything is made fresh to order and that scored points with us.  They carefully choose where they source the meat from and keep an eye on environmental concerns at the same time.  I believe the actual Grand Opening is today, but they found some time to serve up some damn tasty burgers for us.  They would make a killing and have a line out the door for lunch if they were in the loop."
7/9/2017,5 star rating,Burgers were good but the customer service was exceptional. The guy at the cash register was super accommodating.
5/20/2014,5 star rating,"Burger Point makes you feel good ordering a burger. I personally have a lot of fun reading the menu because there is a lot of things to choose from! You can order signature burgers (which i personally like doing) or build your own. I also like how you can add so much other ingredients (avocado, fried egg...) What really hits the spot for me is the fries selection.  Come on, salt and vinegar flavor?! Man, that completes my meal and beyond :) I don't normal like to eat burgers, but if I do, it's a turkey burger (btw they make it very good) And when I do get those cravings, I take action and head to Burger Point."
11/5/2011,4 star rating,"I've given the Point two tries before writing this. The first time I sampled the #2 Blue Harvest. This was a burger packed with blue cheese, and bacon. While it is not much to look at, it was a tasty burger, but was not one of my favorites. The second time i tried the #3 which is the Crunchy Burger, and was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. Adding french onion dip to a burger will be a new standard for me. Overall this is a good place and a much need addition to the South Loop."
10/18/2017,5 star rating,Great food. Great Wi-Fi. The owner and staff are very friendly without being intrusive. I love the sweet potato fries.
10/27/2011,5 star rating,"The wait was worth it.We've all been waiting for The Burger Point to open for months now while eagerly staring at little paper signs taped to windows. Although they still aren't officially open, the Burger Point crew is off to a great start. We each had a different burger and split a large fry. $20 for full tummies and happy mouths. I wish I had grabbed a menu for the exact names but I had a burger with potato chips and chip dip and my wife had onions, lettuce, pickles and special sauce with two patties. They were excellent though we both preferred the potato chip sandwich. One of her patties was a bit red in the middle but the other two were perfectly medium well.The wings and chili are up next for our tasting but our hopes are high. A liquor license would be awesome. The food just begs for beer to go along with it.Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful.The Burger Point will undoubtedly become one of our go-to restaurants for friendly atmosphere and delicious food."

6/28/2017,4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try out this burger place for quite a while, and recently we had a chance to have dinner on a late friday night (Probably one of the few places open till 11pm). The main reason I had wanted to go to this place is because they had a veggie burger on their menu. Being a vegetarian, it's a rare occasion that u get to eat veggie burgers. The food was very tasty and I would go again!"
2/6/2015,4 star rating,"I went here with a co-worker to catch up. I noticed they added the Saigon Johnny to their menu. I love that burger, so I ordered for one. The patty is so juicy and that sweet sauce that goes with it is awesome. The Saigon Johnny is a burger's take on the Vietnamese Bahn Mi sandwich. I downed that burger so fast. Then I turned around and noticed their burger of the month. This month's burger is the salmon burger with aioli on it. I'm coming next week to try that."
1/31/2015,4 star rating,"This corner restaurant has one of the best burgers I've ever tried- the Bleu Harvest. I am a huge Bleu Cheese lover and Bacon lover. Throw them on top of a patty and you've already won me over. The warm, sticky bacon jam with the chunks in there is so yummy, and the tangy, salty Bleu cheese hits the spot.The place is medium-sized. However, it's never packed. Also, they are pretty fast with their orders. I've called them many times and it usually takes them 15 minutes. Then, I would run over and pick it up to-go. This place gets 4 stars because I have tried other burgers there and the rest, except for one (Saigon Johnny), wasn't to my taste. Others have liked it though. I'll just stick to my Bleu Harvest."
6/20/2017,4 star rating,"A great burger. I have been here a few times, and while the price may seem a little high, it's a better burger than DMK for the price. I have eaten an American classic and the turkey burger, both spot on."
1/9/2012,4 star rating,"I have to start with the fact that the burgers here are awesome. I would have given this place a 5 star, but the service in the beginning was a bit unpleasant. When we arrived, we went to the cash register to grab a menu and stood by the TV to get a glimpse of the different kinds of burgers from the slide show. We finally decided to order and went to the cash register. The person who took our order was a bit rude. When I placed my order, I asked for the Shroom burger and asked for havarti cheese instead of swiss. We were still in the middle of clarifying the order when he rudely interrupted me and said ""next..."" so my boyfriend proceeded to place the order. I was a bit turned off by his lack of customer service.. especially for first time customers. To top it off, there wasn't even a line or anything for him to be so rude.Now to the food, We ordered the the Shroom Burger and the New American Classic. The havarti and brie combo brought out a great taste in the beef. I would say that I feel like they skimped out on the mushrooms though. Would've liked for there to be more burgers. You can also see the amount of mushrooms from the picture that I posted. The burger meat is very tender and tastes earthly. It's probably the best burger meat that I've ever tasted! The all american classic was very good also. The pretzel bun seemed to hold together the egg well and was not soggy. The pieces of bacon!! (OMG, they are huge strips!!).We sweet potato fries came out very burnt. My boyfriend asked me to try it to confirm since they looked brown and we went back to the cash register to ask them for a new order. The funny part was when we brought it up to the cash register, the guy tasted it and then had the guy who made the fries taste it too to confirm that it was burnt. They brought us a new order to the table. I guess since the fries are so thin, frying it for too long could easily burn it. All in all, the burgers here are great... The service.. OK... Maybe the guy was having a bad day... hopefully the next time I go there, the experience will be better with the service."
12/9/2017,5 star rating,This place is awesomeness on a bun. The food is all made to order fresh can't beat it with stick. Definitely a big fan and will be back again and again!!!!

Kids burger was just the right size, and according to my daughter, delicious. The fries are to die for! Definitely recommend :)"
9/28/2016,4 star rating,I love this place. It sucks that they close early.. I had ordered through GH last night. I love the large varieties and fancy names on the menu.. u can build ur own burger or sub the patty and the size. I ordered the Saigon Jonny it was different but delicious with wasabi mayo on the side.. The prices are adequate.. u get a lot of what u pay for.. The delivery was on time too. I definitely want to try the BBQ wings or the Blue Harvest Burger next time since I'm a fan of bleu cheese mmmmm
8/17/2015,5 star rating,"Two years later and this place is still my favorite for burgers.  When people tell you Au Cheval has the best burger, they have obviously never been to Burger Point.My personal favorites are the New American Classic, which comes with avocado, fried egg and bacon, and the Blue Harvest, which has blue cheese, bourbon jam and bacon."
1/20/2013,5 star rating,"Best Burgers in Chicago, hands down.  From simple to fancy, they have what you want and the price will not break the bank. Any time I have someone visiting from out of town I bring them here.I will admit there is a wait, but this is not fast food restaurant.  They make your burger there and make the vast majority of their condiments from scratch.  Any wait is well worth it."
11/27/2017,5 star rating,Burger point is a hidden gem right near Chinatown. They make sure you are happy with your order and the owner makes sure he greets everyone. He remembers his frequent customers and does not hesitate to sit and chat with them. There are some people that can never be satisfied and those they are happy to refund money without issue. No place is perfect but they come close.
3/29/2015,4 star rating,"So my review is very different as I am a vegetarian. But I had to leave a review on how AMAZING their veggie burger is. It's easily the best one I've ever had and I've had my fair share. The quality is great, the variety of toppings you can get is almost overwhelming! The only reason I am giving it 4/5 stars is because of the fries. I'm kind of a French fry addict, and these are just mediocre. Little too soggy for my liking, but I can get over it because of how delicious the rest is."

8/7/2016,3 star rating,"Small, cute joint in the south loop .. Awesome service .. Friendly staff. Decent burgers just a bit overpriced. $8.99 for just a burger? Ahhh. I can totally appreciate their fresh ingredients. Grass fed, delicious beef with amazing toppings. They have a HUGE menu.. I ordered the #18.. Double bacon, cheddar and Canadian bacon.. I wasn't a fan of the honey mustard.. Overall just ok.  Boyfriend ordered the Spanish revolution .. That was tasty, topped with jalapeños. We also got an order or their hot wings .. Good.. But breaded .. I'm not a fan of breaded wings .. MEH. Overall a good experience .. Wasn't amazing ... But good..Might have to try it again."
7/25/2016,5 star rating,"We walked in and was greeted warmly with a hello by the owner. Since this was our first time here, the owner explained the menu and they also had TVs to show what the featured burgers looked like. There was enough seating for us and the place wasn't crowded. I got the Blue Burger, which was amazing and my guy made his own burger. The burgers were a bit pricey, $9 on average, but the 6oz. patty is all you need. The fries came separate, but the small was enough for the both of us. The owner walked around greeting customers to make sure they were enjoying their meal. Great ambience and tasty food. I will def be back here. #blackownedbusiness"

7/14/2016,5 star rating,I tried the burger point last year under a different management and the food was not good... I tried it again yesterday and it had dramatically improved... It improved so much I placed another order that totaled over $100 (group). We plan to order again and often. I'm so happy I tried them again because I love a good burger. My favorite so far is #11 the burger rolls... They will fill you up and satisfy any hunger pains6 for 12.25 is a deal. You won't be disappointed.
7/13/2016,4 star rating,"Pretty good place. You have countless options and combinations for your burger(s). I had a nice greasy huge bacon and cheese burger with peppers. It hit the spot. Definitely has a home made kind of taste to it. However, the fries aren't a good complement with the burger. Maybe they could use some spices to step it up."

5/9/2012,4 star rating,"Hot damn man, your burger rocks!I ordered the 12oz burger point burger which comes with roasted chile peppers, cage-free fried egg, double smoked bacon, pepperjack on a pretzel roll.  Let me tell you about them roasted chile, who would've thought it will match so well with the saltiness of the bacon, little heat from the cheese?  It's probably why I'm in the Navy and they are making the big bucks.  With fries and small drink, you are looking at around 15 dollars.  And I ate every thing!  And the price is totally worth it.  My co-worker ordered the blue harvest and sweet potato fries, not sure if the fries are supposed to be little soggy, but that's how he got it.  And honestly, they should really do something about that because it wasn't good at all.Decor is pretty simple, but it did get pretty crowded around noon, so you might want to try this place out during off peak hours.  They do accept credit cards."
12/21/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious! I was deciding between the ashman and the crunchy burger. The ashman is amazing. Although I would really really like to have tried the crunchy burger.

2/21/2016,5 star rating,"What started out as a slow experience with the staff member who was taking our order, turned into an ah-mazing one after I took my first bite of one of the best burgers I've ever had! I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo and I added a side of cheese fries to it. Although our wait time was lengthy and our ordering process was slightly frustrating, things started to take a turn for the better when the new owner made an appearance at our table and apologized for the wait. He even refunded a portion of our money back for the inconvenience (without me asking fToward the end of our meal, he came back to check on us and we engaged in a bit of conversation. During this convo, we discovered he's also from metro-Detroit, so that was an added bonus. He says he bought the restaurant about a month ago and is making some changes to give a better experience to their customers. I wish I wasn't leaving town tomorrow, otherwise, I would definitely be back! I strongly recommend this place and will be back on my next visit to Chicago!"
6/17/2017,5 star rating,We love this place! The burgers and truffle fries are delicious (I'm partial to the Ashman) and delivery is always so fast. The grass-fed/quality meat makes it even better and guilt free too :)
12/14/2013,1 star rating,"Super slow at all times of the day. The burgers are over cooked and chewy. Their iPad ordering thing is a gimmicky joke that errors out, does things like ask you what type of drink you want when you still have to get it yourself, and just prints a receipt you still have to wait in line and pay for. This place is all show, the White Castle nearby is better."

2/23/2014,1 star rating,"A bit on the pricey side to make a turd. Had Spanish revolution burger, which is supposed to be hot and/or spicy... not the slightest and the burgwr was not that good or tasty; the ketchup was spicier. Wings are double fried and was disappointed.  Also ordered hot bbq sauce again not spicy. Fries could be better although I prefer thick cut fries.The ketchup was interesting and surprised I've never had it before here. I'm not sure how this place stays in business with the prices and the product they put out but maybe single residents of the building don't cook. It would surprise me to see this place still open in a year. They don't really have a theme it's a bit confusing like they haven't a clear picture of what their brand is. Other burger places like Kuma's, Lockdown, or even Reggies down the block are much better choices and you get service. Those places have a concise theme/plan to their place of business. Needless to say, I shall not return to this place. I cannot recommend it to anyone because I place value and quality high on a good place to eat. This is not."

11/28/2015,4 star rating,"Went to the Burger Point for dinner with my family. We were greeted with a smile, and hello. Since, this was our first time here we asked for help ordering and the cashier broke the menu all the way down. I went with the sampler, my kids and their dad went with the build your own burger combos. The food is cooked to order and didn't take too long to get ready. My sampler was a 4oz burger with 3 honey bbq mustard flavored wings, fries and a drink (free refills). My food was great, burger juicy, wings nice and crispy and flavorful. I enjoyed the pile of fresh cut fries.  I also ordered a cup of chili, a little spicy but delicious. For the four of us we paid $70. So if you're looking to eat on a budget this is not the place for you to bring a whole family. However, if you are looking for a quality burger and price isn't an issue this is a excellent choice. They don't have a parking lot, so it's up to you to find meter parking and be careful that there isn't anything going on at Soldier Field because some of the parking is permit parking at those times. Enjoy!"

1/3/2017,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came into the city for a little holiday weekend getaway. Now, we are major foodies and always formulate a vacation plan by first figuring out where we want to eat; we do our research and try not to miss out on an amazing find. This was one of them! The fresh meat that was used and the quality of ingredients was impeccable. I ordered The Dirty South and it was mouthwatering. The fries were deep-fried golden and crispy with the perfect amount of seasoning. But what honestly topped off the experience was the man working the counter. He seemed to either be an owner or the manager, but he was one of the most kind individuals and was so welcoming to everyone that entered the restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed we'd be back on our next trip, and the excellent service was what made that decision. Well worth the trip down from River North!"

3/17/2017,4 star rating,"I LOVE their veggie burger-- it's definitely not a low carb choice, but the sauce they put on it is delicious, particularly with the avocado. They pride themselves in the quality of their ingredients, and it shows. It is also one of the quieter places with TVs in the area, if you want to watch a game while you eat. Service has always been good, too.Cons: The fries are pretty thin and dry, not my favorite, and the price is a bit high overall (but, again, that reflects their ingredient quality)."

7/15/2013,4 star rating,"Is there any way I can give 3.5? No? Alright, I'll be generous and round up to 4.There are many components to a good buger, but one of the most important is the beef itself. It should have a solid flavor all on its own with minimal seasoning instead of relying on crazy toppings and sauces (*COUGH Kuma's *COUGH). The best way to assure this is to start with quality, grass-fed beef, and it looks like this place got that memo. After that's taken care of, if you want to go crazy with the sauces, toppings, and cheeses, let your freak flag fly. And this place definitely knows how to cut loose.I enjoyed a crunchy burger, which consisted of potato chips and french onion sauce on top. A unique combination of flavors made it a burger to remember for next time.The location itself is well lit and clean, with ordering stations in addition to the counter. Plenty of parking in back as well as ample street parking.Bonus points for having sweet potato fries.Still got a few more spots to hit before I declare a best burger in town, but this place is in the running."

They definitely need to re vamp the fries for a better overall experience.For a decent burger I would say check it out, it just sucks that the fries are such a downer, it kinda messes up the meal."
10/16/2014,5 star rating,"Burger Point is by far the best burger place I've ever been to. They're a bit pricey, but the food is TO DIE FOR. I always get the veggie burger, and it lives up to its name as the Best Veggie Burger Ever!For meat eaters, they get their meat from a farm where the animals are treated humanely! This was a big plus for me!You're able to call with an order ahead of time and that will help cut your wait time in half!"
10/1/2016,5 star rating,"Delicious!!! Although a bit pricey, worth every penny. They use fresh meats, crisp veggies, freshly cut fries, everything was absolutely delicious. I decided to create my own burger; believe it or not, I'm not a huge beef eater. This place has an extensive menu with different burger choices. Everything from traditional beef, salmon, chicken, and veggie. I decided to create a chicken burger... oh my!!! Highly recommend this place! Service was fantastic, food delicious!"
6/28/2013,2 star rating,"I really wanted to say hey this place is great, but that didn't happen. The place inside is very well lit and open. I do like how they let you place your order using the iPad. I went for their crunch burger...the one w/ potato chips...w/ LTOP mayo and mushrooms on it w/ a small fry and drink.Was I impressed with the food...meh. My bun was completely soggy due to the grease from the burger, mayo and mustard. Word to the wise get the mustard and mayo on the side. My burger came to the table drenched in mayo and mustard. I mean like  globs and mounds of mayo and mustard. It was impossible to eat w/ your hands since it was nothing but mayo and mustard. Well at least the bathrooms were clean."
7/27/2013,3 star rating,"The burger I had was pretty good. It's called the blue harvest and comes with blue cheese, bacon and a bourbon jam. The flavors really complemented each other. I had sweet potato fries with the burger and they were just okay for me.  The staff was very nice and it has a nice vibe. I would like to see more drink options since I don't drink pop and many other beverages but other than that, it's a great spot."
12/2/2015,3 star rating,"Update! I was craving a burger and decided to give this place another chance. I got the Classic with a side of fries. The burger and fries were delicious! Was very happy with the juiciness and flavors, fries were perfect...The reason why I can't give them 5 stars is because it took them over 20 minutes to make my order, which to me is unacceptable for a quick service style burger place for lunch. They weren't even that busy... next time I'll order ahead of time and hope that it's ready by the time I head over. But happy that I have them another shot.Also I wish they had shakes on the menu!"
12/15/2014,1 star rating,"I wanted to like this place so badly because it's so close to home. Definitely not worth the money. I originally ordered the veggie burger--they said they didn't have any in stock. So I ordered buffalo chicken burger instead. Chicken was super dry. The ingredients/flavors on the burger were delicious, though, and the portion was massive. But the chicken was terrible. Epic burger has the juiciest chicken, which is what I was hoping for. Very disappointing. I only ate half of the burger and was planning on saving the other half for later, but that might not even be worth it.Ordered russet fries. They were all soggy and way over-salted--like to the point where it made me grimace. I make better fries at home.For over $12, I will not be going back. Go to Epic Burger or 5 guys instead. I thought I'd give these guys a second try but after reading reviews it looks like this was not just an off-day."
2/14/2014,3 star rating,I was a little disappointed in the way my burger looked (compared to the other's) but more importantly the way it tasted or was cooked. The center was tender but the edges were a little burnt and hard. I seen some really good pictures from others and I do want to come back and try others.
12/9/2016,5 star rating,"This was my first visit to The Burger Point. I went with the impression I would get a regular burger and some fries, simple enough right. Well they have over 20 different selections of various burgers to be made with beef, chicken or turkey or alternatives like the veggie or salmon.    I was apprehensive about trying the Gobfather (turkey burger with the works), I am particulary fond of ground turkey breast and not mixed turkey meat, the gentleman at the register convined me to try it, I did with no regrets, this was by far the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Extra kudos for the truffle salt fries."
8/17/2015,1 star rating,"This is my 4th time eating here. Because it's so close I figured I would give it another try, but the food is yet again terrible. They ALWAYS screw up my order. The fries are disgusting. The burgers are ok, but extremely expensive and def not worth it. Don't waste your money here."
3/19/2016,5 star rating,"This was so tasty!!! I got the #1, the burger joint. It was so good! A little bit of spice that creeps up on you, bacon, and pepper jack cheese. So tasty. The fries are a little weak, but they are fresh which is always appreciated, and with the spicy ketchup, so good. The service is very friendly as well. They work hard, but keep smiling. Very good experience"
7/6/2018,5 star rating,"I have been eating here for the past few months and i am NEVER disappointed. The food is amazing! The buffalo chicken burger on a pretzel bun is my absolute favorite. Now, I am hooked on the spicy garlic wings. The food is always hot, fresh, and delicious. The service is impeccable! Michael, the owner is so personable. He remembers your name and favorite orders. He is polite and checks on you throughout your stay. How refreshing is it to see a business owner actually IN the business tending to customers. The fact that he is so vested in his business is even more reason to love the Burger Point. Overall, they have delicious food, cooked/served in a timely manner, with five star service. Doesn't get any better! Oh, and the restroom is ALWAYS clean (huge plus!)"
4/18/2013,2 star rating,"I'll start by saying I don't eat burgers often, and didn't have one here.  The only other option on the menu is a chicken sandwich, veggie sandwich or chicken wings.  I got the wings with Baltimore sauce (really a rub, not a sauce) and buffalo sauce.  The chicken was cooked well and the buffalo sauce was delicious, although nothing special.  The Baltimore sauce was too salty, but the flavors were good, a mix of seasoning salt and something like old bay seasoning on them.  We had seen them on Chicago's Best and decided to check them out.  My parents had burgers and said they were just ok, nothing special.  There is a deal for a burger, 3 wings and french fries for $12.99.  None of us were blown away by anything, although the decor was nice.  The menu is too large and a bit confusing given the number of options available.  I couldn't figure out how to enter exactly what we wanted in the iPad order system, so we just went to the counter to give our order.  Given how expensive the burgers are, I don't think we'll be back."
6/23/2018,5 star rating,Excellent cooked-to-order burger.  Got the classic and it was delicious.  Also had some of the kid's ultimate grilled cheese - YUM!  Very friendly service and great atmosphere.  Will definitely return.

4/6/2018,5 star rating,"Located south of downtown. On my recent trip to Chicago I drove all the way down to The Burger Point twice! Their cheese burger is delicious and fresh. Perfect ratio of meat to cheese to bun. I also tried their All Beef hot dogs. I got one Chicago styled and one chili cheese dogs. Both were amazing. Also, the owner was very helpful. Definitely would come back!"
1/6/2013,2 star rating,"The burgers here are good.  The pick-up service, however, is horrible.  My both experiences here where I called ahead left me standing waiting for an extra 10 minutes when I arrived.My recent phone order experience was terrible and unprofessional on their part.  I called in my order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later to pay.  They had the burgers ready but not the chicken wings.  They already swiped my card and then told me it would be an extra couple minutes for the wings.  No sorry or anything.  As I stand there waiting for them to fire up my wings, the guy cooking things had to ask what type of wings I ordered twice to the guy who swiped my card.  Then, right when the wings were done being fried he asked another staff member again.  Really? And while he was waiting for the wings to be fried, he bust out his phone and talked on it.  When the wings were finally done, I was handed my order with no ""thank you"" or ""sorry about the wait"". They had one other party sitting down eating so it wasn't like it was busy.  Hard to imagine how it is to dine here if it was really busy."
1/17/2014,1 star rating,"On a run of the mill January weekday we ordered and waited. It took 50--fifty--minutes to get two burgers and one fry. Then the man said, ""sorry they're cold."" Yes, the burger was very good...fries were cold, but 50 minutes more than three times the advertised wait time. No offer of recompense, no have a cupcake. We were busy. This despite open seats in the cold restaurant. If you've children, avoid it. I can only imagine."
3/3/2013,2 star rating,"I've been to Burger Point once before when they first opened, and I went back today hoping that they'd worked out someof the kinks.  I ordered a turkey burger, again, and this time it had much more seasoning in it.  But it was overcooked. I got sweet potato fries, and my mom got regular fries, and both tasted like cardboard and were soggy.  Be prepared to wait. They make everything from scratch to order, so be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for your food.  You can see the chefs preparing the food as you wait, and they had absolutely no sense of urgency to get people's food to them quickly.  They were laughing, and chatting, while 3 groups waited for their food.  The worst part?  We paid $26 for two burgers and two small fries. I won't be going back."
1/9/2012,2 star rating,"To put it delicately, turkey burgers need to be seasoned. Mine was not. I really don't blame them, I think it's my fault.  Next time I will order one of their regular specialty burgers which looked amazing.  I also ordered the salt and vinegar chips... Also my mistake. Next time I will order the sweet potato fries.  On a positive note, everything was very fresh, which is not always the case at burger joints.   I will definitely give it another try."
5/29/2013,5 star rating,"I needed some sundries and accidentally found Burger Point right by the little grocery store I was at and thought I'd give it a try....and my life will never be the same :) I am actually in the Food Service industry and work with 100's of National Accounts and am a Hamburger Junkie. What Burger Point does with an item that has been sooooo abused is nothing but pure artistic cooking.Let's start with their ingredients....I challenge you to find another Casual Dine restaurant with such focus, attention and marketing of organic and fresh products. Just pinch a piece of the hamburger off by itself and that will speak for the quality alone.Selection = When you first step in, don't rush yourself. Grab a menu, sit down and really read it all the way through.Someone mentioned on here that the menu is kind of confusing. I can see at first glance where that my be thought, but you basically can build your own or try one of their dozen phenomenal creations.  I have never seen nor imagined combinations like they have developed. Wanna be your own Chef? Like I said you can build your own. Starting with 4 different types of meats including Veggi, 10 different types of cheeses and 5 different rolls. Then from there you can add a ton of extra's.Other items = Being from Texas I had to try the Chili and had my nose up in the air when they served it to me, that is until my first bite...No grease, pure beautiful flavor and just a little kick to it. I added cheeses and onions and was just bummed that I couldn't put this in a syringe and inject it straight into the blood stream.So if you've gotten this far reading I think you can tell how I feel about Burger Point. It's near McCormick which may be a bit of a challenge to you, but if I get with in 100 miles of S. State St. I will walk on fire to get there.Good luck to Burger Point...you got this Food Service guy excited! - Scott"

4/13/2013,3 star rating,"After seeing Burger Point on Chicago's Best and living just 5 blocks away, we walked down one Saturday night. Apparently lots of other people saw the show that night too because the little place was packed. There were several tables of people waiting for their food and nothing seemed to be coming out. People were getting ticked and some walked out. After almost 45 minutes, we finally got our food. Fries were okay. One order is enough for 2-3 people. Burgers were good. The grass fed beef really makes a difference. Pretzel bun was tasty. Partner opted for the grilled onions on his and commented there were way too many onions. The cheese on both of our burgers was pretty sparse. Chicago has a lot of great restaurants but I still haven't found an outstanding burger place. Drive the 90 miles north to Milwaukee and hit Elsa's on the Park, Distil, Sobelman''s or AJ Bombers to learn how to do a great burger."
10/13/2013,3 star rating,"The food was fine. I always judge a burger place by its BBQ-bacon-cheddar- grilled onions option or whatever comes closest, so that's what I tried.  I wasn't mad at it, but I'm not motivated to ever go back.So yeah."
4/18/2016,5 star rating,Burger point is my favorite burger place now! i love the variety of options in building my burger and the sweet potato fries!! the staff is always very nice when i am placing my order and the sit down area is always very clean.  I come here at least once a month and i refer people here often...now i just need them to deliver to my neighborhood and i will be most happy!
4/15/2014,2 star rating,"One day my BF and I were craving a big fat juicy burger and we yelped to see what was good around the area. We landed on this restaurant. Our first impression was ok the place is a bit small and reminded us more of hot dog joint then actual gourmet grass fed beef burgers. They have a great variety which will meet most tastes buds buuuuut here comes all the bad. The fries are limp and soggy and skinny.  The burgers although all different nothing in the taste seemed to set them apart. My boyfriend brought his daughter and the music was very inappropriate. Our bill for three burgers, fries and drinks was 56.00!!! So I guess overall it is no better then burgers at Red Robbin. At least at RR you can count on waiters to bring out food and refill your drinks."
8/31/2013,1 star rating,"We walked up with the pups a few Sunday afternoons ago, craving burgers.  Should have gone to 5 Guys :(My boyfriend had a beef burger, I thought the turkey burger would be healthier.  Turkey burgers aren't supposed to be dry, I've had plenty juicy turkey burgers, for example...The Grafton on Lincoln Ave...yummmm.  Anyways...Both our burgers were extremely dry, and the brioche bun, which we thought would be a great choice, made it even dryer.  Yuck!  The fries were thin and good, but so crispy to the point that they were all oil due to how thin and crispy they were.  And they forgot our cheese sauce!   How terrible is that!?!?!Oh well, good to figure these things out."
1/10/2018,5 star rating,"This place has never disapponted me. A gourmet burger, at a carry out price. Quality ingredients always impress someone who is hard to impress. Also just tried their wings, and tastes just like my homemade wings!"
9/17/2014,5 star rating,"The food was absolutely amazing. The burger I ordered was cooked to perfection. And incredibly tasty. Haven't even gotten to the sweet potato fries yet, but I had to write a review. The pretzel bun is awesome. Combo'ed with the perfect burger patty, you can't beat the taste.I will say that I ordered for delivery and that it took much longer than I anticipated, but the food is so good, I'm still giving it five stars."
1/6/2018,4 star rating,"Really delicious and good quality burgers. We ordered off the menu and built our own - All were amazing. Great price, too! Truffle salt fries were spot on. Minus one star for lack of milkshakes on the menu and the gross cheese powder on the spiral potatoes. Admittedly, we should have asked about the cheese, but still."

3/23/2014,2 star rating,"Burger was good, everything else...Prices are ridiculous. 15 dollars for a burger with bacon, small fry and small drink. Fries were horrible. Music loud."
9/19/2015,3 star rating,"I live in the neighborhood and have been eyeing this place for some time. With a plethora of burger joints in the city, you have to pace yourself.  Now to the review. I liked the fact that their marketing indicates the burgers are fresh ground daily. My wife and I both built our own burgers on a brioche bun. I noticed that the patties were the thicker style but I wasn't asked what temperature I wanted. In both cases, the burgers came out well done. The burger blend tasted fine but it had the potential to taste great if it wasn't overcooked.  The brioche bun was falling apart and dry. The fries are cooked in peanut oil and were tasty. All in all, I  think that there are better burgers in the neighborhood."
3/10/2018,5 star rating,I think one of the best burger places in the city. Great customer service and even greater food.
5/5/2015,5 star rating,Peter's initial bad review actually helped this place. We went undercovered yesterday for the first time. We provided Chinese names & ordered from the menu advised the guy that we are lactose intolerance. He actually went extra miles to ask the owner/chef about our needs. We are very pleased with this place. We enjoyed the good food without any incidence. They do catered to Asian customers with dietary restrictions. Thank you Sir!
10/19/2017,5 star rating,"Ok, I don't get the bad reviews.. This place is extremely good. NEVER had a burger I didn't like. The new owner, Mithrandir, Murtaugh, or Mike is it?   Great guy, the kind of owner that is just sweet as can be, not over the top or annoying. And again, the food is extremely good and fresh. The pricing is good too, considering the  number of upscale burger joints that have flooded the landscape...It's hard for me to get to regularly, but when I'm looking out the window at work, thinking about where to go today. and I get Burger Point in my head? I smile and say, 'F**** yea'... But Mike? Make mine with Wus-sabi sauce...ok?"

12/2/2012,4 star rating,"I just moved in upstairs from this place and I was excited to try it out. I was hoping that it was going to be good because this is about as convenient as it gets. Well, I'm happy to say that my ""Dirty South"" burger was amazing! I'm not usually big on making sure my beef is all natural, or organic, but I could definitely tell a difference and it was a good one. The bacon was really good too.I also got the sweet potato fries. They were good, but they tasted a little overcooked to me. I'll definitely try them again.I think the only problem that I'm going to have with this place is that I'm going to spend too much money here. It is a little steep on price, but it's worth it. I'm looking forward to becoming a regular here. Hopefully they have some lower calorie options, otherwise I'm going to balloon up like a beached whale."
9/22/2012,1 star rating,"We went here with high expectations. My fiancé had the Turkey Burger, my daughter's had the chicken wings, one had bbq and the other had mild. I had the BLT. We ordered both versions of fries including the sweet potato fries. Nothing blew our mind or even average. The turkey burger was dry and had little to no taste. The BLT was nothing special, so I would consider overpriced. The wings had too much sauce, and the fries lacked any amount of crisp. The iPad ordering system is ridiculous. It took us 5 minutes just to get an order in.I would not go back to The Burger Point. I would rather just go to Five Guys or Epic Burger."
9/20/2012,2 star rating,"I had high expectations.But then.But then, I couldn't figure out the ipad ordering.  One of them was broken, so I stood around until it was free.  I didn't realize it was optional.I ordered the BLT, which I thought was going to be BLT a burger.  I see on the menu on their website that this is NOT a burger, it's a BLT.  I don't think that was on the ipad description.  So I will give them one extra star in case this was my mistake.But then, when I got the BLT not-burger, I was disappointed.  The sandwich was sad looking in comparison to my husband's huge burger.  The bun was small.  And it wasn't toasted, it was squishy.  Since I had expected a BLT burger, very small with 2 pieces of bacon.I also ordered sweet potato fries.  I love sweet potato fries!  But then, I received one big pile of grease and oil.  Not one piece was crunchy.  Everything was limp.  Not one piece had salt on it (or it had dissolved into the pile of grease).  Totally gross.  I threw the whole thing away.My husband had a #2 and cheese fries.  They were awesome, tasty, and not soggy.I would normally split the difference at this point.But then.  But then, the manager asked us how our food was on the way out.  So we told him.  And he shrugged and we left.But then we never returned."

9/12/2014,1 star rating,This place has good food but horrible service. I will not got back because it is managed so poorly. White Castle delivers a more consistent experience. Be prepared to wait and be given excuses by the rude staff.
5/12/2016,5 star rating,"The burger point is now my favorite in town! I'm not really a burger person; and like to stay away from the greasy, heavy stuff that normally comes with it, but The Burger Point is a different story. It's succulent , juicy, fresh and close enough to be the gourmet burger place in town! I had the Capone burger, and the others created theirs and we were all blown away with the explosion of favors with every bite! I can still feel how tender the meat was! Service was just great, the owner Michael is around every table making sure everyone is happy and being served on time.. Just impeccable ! A definite must to all of you out there!"
12/17/2012,4 star rating,"Only been once but can report they make a very tasty burger.  The ordering process is cool too via touch screens that allow you to add or remove items like bacon, egg, lettuce, etc.One bad thing....the wings are not very good.  I am a big wing fan and the execution here fell short.  Skin was rubbery which is a big no-no..."
3/8/2015,1 star rating,"Let me make this easy for everyone thinking of going to eat here. Don't! Everyone acknowledges the service is terrible. The employees don't care about the customers, and it's easy to see why. When I complained to the owner about the service and food, (only via email because he is almost never there) he took me to task instead of apologizing. This person should not be running any type of business.Now on to the food. If you crave tasteless, dry, overcooked and overpriced burgers, this place is for you. Universally, everyone agrees the fries are terrible. If you enjoy good-tasting food - avoid this place like the plague.I can't figure out how anyone says they like the burgers here. My suggestion to those that do: Please do not review any other restaurants in the future.Unfortunately, Yelp does not allow no stars. I don't see how they stay in business. I wouldn't walk across the street for this place, and I live across the street.i"
5/10/2013,2 star rating,"I live close to this place and was SO excited to go. I got the Drunken Grandma (saw it on TV like many other Yelpers). I was absolutely disappointed. There was hardly a trace of cheese, and the burger was ABSOLUTELY OVERCOOKED. In their defense I did not specify how I wanted my burger cooked, but they didn't ask, so I assumed medium/ medium rare. I appreciate quality beef, and the way they cooked this burger was a travesty. Overall tasteless and dry.I also had to return my burger the first time since they put it on a potato roll instead of the pretzel bun it was supposed to come on.Also, for a stuffed burger and small fries it was $18...which for the quality was totally overpriced.I would consider returning due to the convenient location, but would definitely recommend another selection and specifying your burger not be charred to death."
4/8/2018,5 star rating,"Every time I have a craving for a hamburger, the Burger Point delivers.  The hamburger is really lean and flavorful, and I love the pretzel roll.  The  sweet potato fries are AMAZING too!"
10/6/2013,4 star rating,"This is my first time here. It had a modern look inside. There are a couple tv screens with the bears game playing, which gives the bar feel. It's bright inside which I like. I ordered the BLT, wings, and fries which were all good. You order at the counter ad they bring the food to you. Service was okay. For being a first timer I would have liked if they walked me through their menu. Overall it was fine and I would consider coming here again."
10/30/2012,4 star rating,"There's a few up and coming restaurants in South Loop but I must say that this place got me hooked!  ambiance - comfortable.  It's one of those, order your food, pay and wait for your name to be called.  They even have ipads that you can order in if you don't feel like socializing with their staff or just in a hurry.The Good - EVERYTHING! well.. everything that I have eaten here is great.  Their ""build a burger"" is great and it's always good to know that what you are getting are freshly made.The Bad - fries are a little too salty, and the kitchen is small. So, if you go there during lunch and dinner rush, expect to wait a long period of time.The Service - there's not much service to expect since you're ordering ahead and you clean up after yourself so I guess it depends on how you look at it.  They have the fountain drinks available if you want more drinks.Bottom Line - burgers are great, location is fantastic but try to avoid going during lunch or dinner rush unless you have crackers or something to hold you over while waiting.Tootles!"
5/19/2015,5 star rating,"Stopped here for some quick food after a trade show down the road, was amazed with the quality of the food. Easily one of the best veggie burgers I have had to date and the vegetarian chile was equally as fantastic. One thing I might mention is everything was a little on the spicy side even if it wasn't advertised that way -- for me that's great, but if you're not a fan of hot food I'd keep that in mind, especially in regards to the chile."

4/18/2012,4 star rating,"I went back to Burger Point yesterday and I think they've definitely made improvements, specifically their fries. Clearly they've been reading Yelp reviews.Sweet potato fries are now offered with a choice of cinnamon sugar or sea salt (before they were only offered with cinnamon sugar which made them wayyy too sweet) and burgers can be ordered as a single (6 oz.) or a double (12 oz.). Their burgers aren't thin, and they aren't thick - they're somewhere in between.Fries were cooked perfectly this time (both regular and sweet potato) and the burger was not overcooked. It was a juicy, sloppy, delicious mess.I'm glad to see them succeeding, making changes, and taking customers' suggestions.Speaking of suggestions, how about adding milkshakes to your menu?"
11/3/2011,4 star rating,"I like, no, love, a good burger, so when I saw this place on the front page, I scheduled a lunch outing here, post haste. I made a deal with my friend; if he plays ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (meaning he picks me up at my office and drops me off), I'll spring for lunch. It's win-win.It wasn't crowded at all when we went, but that's likely because it doesn't officially open until tomorrow. I fully expect long lines when word gets out.We looked over the menu and there's some interesting choices of toppings. I really just wanted a plain cheeseburger without all kinds of fancy toppings as that's how I judge a burger place on my initial visit, but that didn't seem to be an option, so instead I ordered the ""Crunchy Burger,"" which comes topped with double American cheese, homemade (at least I think they were) potato chips, and French onion dip. Of course, a burger isn't complete without fries, so we had to throw in an order. ""Oh, you have sweet potato fries too? We'll take an order of those as well.""After reading some reviews of esteemed Yelpers, I knew that their burgers were cooked more on the side of medium-well than medium, so I was prepared. I wouldn't dream of eating a steak cooked beyond medium rare, but it's not a deal breaker for me to eat a medium-well burger, as long as it's still juicy.It was a damn good burger; not as big as I was expecting, but still a generous size by anyone's standards. It was well-seasoned, the bun was just the right size and proportion to the patty, and it was moist and flavorful. And French onion dip on a burger  = genius. I inhaled my burger lickety split. My friend also enjoyed his burger very much, even though he remarked that his fried egg was overcooked. If you're going to put a fried egg on a burger, it demands that the yolk should be runny, no?Their fries are of the super thin, shoestring variety. Both the regular and sweet potato are hand cut, but sadly, both kinds were undercooked. The sweet potato fries come with a side of honey mustard dipping sauce (which made the already overly sweet potato fries borderline diabetic). I love sweet potato fries with nothing more than a generous sprinkling of salt, but these tasted like they dumped a spoonful of sugar on them. The sugar was caked onto the fries in clumps, rendering them virtually inedible (at least for me). I'll make sure and ask them to 86 the sugar next time.The service was perfunctory. No one asked if we enjoyed our food, or how we heard about them, and that's fine, I guess. I was there for a good burger, not conversation, and they certainly delivered on that score.I'll be back for sure. I can't get my mind off the French onion dip, but pretty please, can you cook the fries longer?"
11/2/2011,5 star rating,"Over the last three or four years or so, every little guy has decided to throw his hat into the ring and join the full-on, escalating, internecine burger wars, with the latest to jump into the meat grinder being The Burger Point.  Where will you find The Burger Point, figuratively?  Why, you'll find it tip top on the table of fast food burgers in the city.  That's right, welcome to the coronation.  Everyone else in the city, including Portillo's, needs to step aside and make way for the new King.Where will you find The Burger Point, literally?  It's located at State and Archer in an area of the South Loop which I still don't think is quite ""there.""  That's not to say that it's a bad neighborhood altogether, but Lincoln Park it is not.  Sadly, many North Siders never, ever venture south of Madison to the dreaded South Side and will miss out on the new fast food burger King of the city even though it is easily accessible from every direction by major thoroughfare.  If The Burger Point were plopped down in Lakeview, I guarantee the resulting hullabaloo would be off the charts in the area in general and on Yelp and it would be an instant gold mine.As for decor and atmosphere, well, let's just say that you won't be going to The Burger Point for these reasons.  It's not much different than your average chain burger joint, with the addition of some  televisions showing ESPN and a terrible sound track of some sort of techno or dance rubbish played entirely too loud.  Kudos though for the two Mies (Mies inspired?) high backed leather chairs.  Nice!  I'll get into why you'll need these chairs later.  Still, none of these things matters much because the burger is King.The most important thing to me about any restaurant is still the food, and The Burger Point knocks the food out of the park.  I got the Dirty South burger and fries for twelve bucks and change (more on this later).  I summarily canceled the rest of the season and crowned this bad boy instant champion at first bite.  For my taste, the burger was perfectly cooked at medium well, with a little char and the added sweetness of the BBQ sauce and thick cut bacon all held together by the impregnable pretzel bun.  I think the burger was a bit over salted, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.  As for the fries, they were absolutely delicious and are also being crowned King of fast food fries, if a bit too over salted and a bit greasy.  Now, there are likely to be at least a few problems with The Burger Point as to whether it succeeds, and they have nothing to do with the food.  First, it was a 20-minute wait for my burger.  Even though this was reported at the outset as being the case by the manager/owner who is so rightfully excited he's about to jump out of his boots, that's a long wait for a fast food, non sit down place.  Second, again, the location likely isn't going to do it any favors.  Third, the pricing is a bit high, especially for a fast food burger.  It's $8.25 for a burger, with fries being an additional two dollars.  Opt for a combo, and you're looking at 12 and change.  That's on the South Side and in this terrible economic environment.  And lastly, it appears that they cook their burgers to medium well.  To me, this is perfect, but to those who like their meat bloody, it could be a problem.Still, it's always all about the food for me, and the food here is a resounding five stars.  Taking into consideration the ambiance (lack thereof) and pricing, I'm calling it 4-1/2 stars.  I hope they make it.P.S. Kudos to Dusty for the tip."
10/30/2011,5 star rating,"I always love to see a new place open in the 'hood, especially when the experience is as great as we had today at The Burger Point!This is still the ""soft opening"" so the menu is more limited than it will be, but I thought the selections were great. I ordered the ""combo meal"", with the Burger Point burger -  green chilies, pepper jack cheese, bacon, and fried egg on a pretzel bun. The beef is grass-fed and freshly ground, what's not to love already? BF ordered two kinds of wings, asian and hot garlic.I assume it was one of the owners who took our order...he was very nice and informed us of the soft opening and the grass-fed beef and stuff I already knew from reading about the place. He told us it would take about 20 minutes for our order (maybe people complain that it's not fast enough?). I definitely expected to wait longer than I would at McDonald's for this quality meal.For what it's worth, BF was thrilled to see ginger ale as a fountain drink. Apparently that is pretty unusual. I'm a diet coke girl, so it's not something I would have noticed.The place is super clean, bright and well-decorated. I love the flowery mural, the comfy chairs by the register, the great window light, and the great bathroom!Our name was called and we picked up our beautifully presented order from the counter. I *love* the aluminum plates and the checkerboard paper liner...v. nice touch! The burger looked just perfect, as did the fries and nicely laid out wings (as opposed to being just thrown in a pile).The burger was DE-LI-CIOUS, so fresh and such a nice combination of quality ingredients. I loved the fries, especially the perfect sprinkle of sea salt. BF said the wings were very tasty and meaty.I thought everything was perfectly executed...from the (presently limited) menu, to the decor, to the service and the quality of the food.I see people mentioning the high price. Really? I mean, I spend more at Panera for a crappy panini. This place rivals Kuma's (actually, I prefer it to Kuma's ginormous burgers), and I reckon it will start popping up on ""Chicago's Best Burger"" lists.Thanks, and welcome to the 'hood, TBP!"
8/31/2013,1 star rating,"If you're trying to aspire for a gourmet burger place...then you really should ask your customers how they would like their burger cooked. The woman didnt ask and as predicted it came out well well done tasting burnt. BBQ sauce was sour and gross and everything was over cooked. Wing sauce was amazing but any place that charges for dipping sauce is a shame. We will NOT be going back again as we are sick the day after. Also...you NEED to sell 2 liters...you could easily sell them for $2, be cheaper than the grocery place down the street and still have a high profit margin....THey pride themselves on their yelp reviews so I hope it will be taken into consideration"
11/2/2011,4 star rating,"Is it possible to experience burger BLISSSS!!! I saw this place as I was leaving Athletico from my physical therapy session and it was bustling with people. I peeked in to see what this place was, and it was a burger joint. Perfect, just what I was craving after watching countless episodes of Man vs Food late at night. I was sick and jealous (mostly jealous) of watching Adam Richman scarf down ridiculous burgers across the country. Its about *bleeping* time I get my own. To be honest I did not know what to expect as all the chefs were dressed like they worked in much nicer kitchen than some fast food burger joint. I thought to myself, this burger is definitely too fancy to taste good. I always thought the best foods were served quick and dirty (in a good way). They had 2-3 chefs working the grill and another 2 people working a ""topping"" station. Going with the recommendation the guy taking my order gave me I went with the #1, Burger Point Burger with fries. I took it to go and got home in about 10 minutes. I undressed the top of the burger to see what was it was packing, and it was definitely packing. On top was roasted green jalepenos/peppers, followed by a over-medium egg, bacon, cheese, and hearty burger patty. I took one bite and it was euphoria (not exactly), but it was the best burger I have had for as long as I can remember. When you bite down, first you get the spiciness of the peppers, then the great aroma of the egg, followed by the crunchiness of the bacon, and lastly the decadent burger patty. All wrapped with some nice ass buns (no pun intended). Like many reviewers say, here is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. 1. The price - 12$ for burger with fries? Where am I - in France? Come on mang, its southside of Chicago! 2. The fries - shoe string fries are too thin and flimsy, and just doesn't fill me up (thats what she said, kidding). But I felt like a slightly thicker cut fry would go much better with the burger. Other than that, kudos to this new burger point/joint!"
6/11/2012,5 star rating,"I went back to Burger Point today to give the place another try.  What a difference another visit makes!The owner read my review from my last visit, thanked me for my feedback and notified me of the improvements it had made from my last visit. He stated they had fixed the gristle issues from last time and explained why the sweet potato fries were the way they were. Taking his improvements into consideration, I decided to stop by Burger Point again. This time I changed up my order and tried the Burger Point burger and cheese fries.  The Burger Point burger was full of flavor! Those peppers added so much flavor and spice that I did not have to dress my burger with any ketchup. Plus, there was NO gristle in my burger meat this time around.The cheese fries were also super good. I received a large helping of fries and the cheese dip was really cheesy and creamy. They also put some sort of spice on it that made it tasty. I liked the potato fries MUCH better than the sweet potato fries.Customer service was also much better this time around. The guy at the counter seemed so much more friendlier than the last guy. I highly suggest placing an order to go, that way when you get there the meal will be ready to eat.  I placed my order ahead of time and within 10 minutes it was ready for pick up. Love the speediness of the service!Burger Point has definitely redeemed themselves and I am much more likely to make another visit again knowing that there is another tasty burger waiting for me on my next visit. Thanks to the owner of Burger Point for taking my feedback into consideration to improve the overall quality of the food here! I wish more owners out there cared about their customers!"
5/25/2012,2 star rating,"Absolutely one of the worst burgers I have had.  I ordered the American Classic which came with cage-free fried egg, avocado, double smoked bacon, american cheese, wasabi mayo on a pretzel roll.  I also ordered the sweet potato fries with sugar and cinnamon.  It sounded so promising.The fries were terrible. They were limp and brown from being overcooked. Plus, I paid extra for the sugar and cinnamon but they never ended up on my fries.  I ended up with plain limp overcooked, bitter tasting fries.The burger was mediocre.  The avocado, bacon, cheese and egg were good.  However, the burger patty, that appeared handmade, was filled with gristle.  I was constantly picking the gristle out of my mouth.Service at the Burger Joint was also lacking. No one was friendly here and we did not feel welcomed when we walked in.Bad burger and bad fries = $12. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.I was really hoping for this place to be a great addition to the South Loop. I'm so sorely disappointed."
10/30/2011,5 star rating,"Not very often I get excited to write a review..I so wanted this place to be good since I live in the building...went down today with the fam and it didn't disappoint. I got the big south (think that was the name) it was pure bliss...perfectly cooked burger with bbq sauce and bacon. We also had a order of the sweet potato fries and regular fries.   Sweet potato fries are good, but a wee bit heavy on the sugar, so could be better. The regular fries were awesome.  This could be dangerous having this in my building, trying to shed the last few pounds, not gain them. Met Cameron, the GM, super nice dude. They are very willing and open for questions, constructive criticism, etc..  That is the sign of a smart businessman. definitely check out this welcome addition in the south loop. ps...one caveat....good place for kids, but they need a mini burger or something..sucks ass paying $8 for a 3 year olds burger."
12/18/2012,4 star rating,"Amazing burgers and the wings are good too.  We got the curly chip thing and it was just ok.  Would try the fries next time.  Love all the choices and being able to build your own.  Very casual atmosphere. Brought beer since it is BYOB, but felt weird taking it out of the bag.  Quality burgers though so would definitely go back for the food."
8/17/2015,5 star rating,Amazing burgers...so juicy and fresh. We had the mushroom burger and the southern...so good. The fries are fresh cut and good with cheese.
11/23/2011,3 star rating,"I'm sort of in the middle on this one, I'm a fan of medium rare burgers, but they don't serve them this way, so I get that, I also get and read their sign that they're not a fast food joint, burgers will take about 15 minutes, well okay I get that too. But when it turns out being closer to half an hour when you told me 15 minutes, something is wrong there on the timing, however I can even deal with that.However, what did bother me, as others have pointed out, the bun...really I took three big bites before hitting the beef. All I could think of was that little old lady, ""where's the beef?""The concept is cool, pick your meat, then your bun, then your toppings While this is a pretty standard way of doing it, their toppings and sauces aren't standard. Not sure if i care for having to give my name when ordering, I remember when Starbucks tried this getting to know you thing. For a second I debated giving them another name, but then I realized I might just ignore it being called when my order came up.This wouldn't be the first place I'd think of to get a burger, however it wouldn't be the last either. Although, I'd make sure I have more time, but again you've been warned and are warned with that sign when you enter. It's understandable, they're preparing a custom burger. For me to take this to five stars, fix the bun ratio flatter burger or smaller bun, easy. The other thing, the high quality grass fed beef would be really tasty done medium-rare."
10/28/2011,5 star rating,"I have found my favorite burger joint!  I got the #1: Burger Point Burger - roasted green chili (nice kick), bacon, pepper jack cheese, bacon, fried egg (gasp), and of course a thick, juicy, well-seasoned burger patty!  All of that yummy goodness on a pretzel roll!  Absolutely no condiments (ketchup, mayo, or mustard) necessary.I was full after eating only half the burger but I just couldn't stop eating.  It's so scrumptious that I'm considering going back to get me another burger for lunch tomorrow!  In summary:- #1 combo (w/ fries and can of soda) for $12.21 - so yes it's a little on the pricey side- a relatively long wait but well worth it cuz the burger will come out PERFECTLY! Hot and delicious!- the place was quite packed when I went there around 1:30pm.  This place is a MUST TRY.  I guarantee you won't regret it."

5/16/2013,3 star rating,"Burger point is a great addition to the South Loop area. The location itself is out of reach to many sightseers but locals should have no problem finding it. The venue itself is rather small and you are praying for a table to open up as you wait in line to order your burger. Speaking of burgers, well let's talk about them. They are pretty amazing, and better than then Sweet Waters down on Michigan Ave but no Kumas. They have plenty of toppings to choose from different sauces, vegetables and you can't forget the over easy egg. Also if you aren't a big red meat or a meat eater at all they have a chicken breast or veggie Patty option as well. Big bonus for me is the pretzel bun.  Also I recommend the tower fries as I call them which are season American chip style on a skewer."
10/31/2011,3 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were happy to try this new place out in the neighborhood and pleasantly surprised with the food.The decor was nicely done and the staff was really helpful and energetic about their food giving us a brief note about everything.Both of our burgers were a bit over cooked and the jalapeno salsa was a bit much on one of them.  However, the bacon and cheddar cheese on the other (and don't forget the pretzel roll!) made it a hit.The fries were tasty, but the sea salt seemed to have gotten on my burger  or something because everything tasted a bit too salty.The soft open menu was more full than I thought it would be.  We are looking forward to going back; it's a nice addition to the area."
11/1/2011,5 star rating,"So glad the BP is finally here! Even though it was the soft open it didn't disappoint! The staff was friendly, the place was bright and cool with great music and let's not forget the guest of honor- the food! We had to get a variety for the first time out and because I don't eat burgers, yes you heard me correctly, I got the veggie burger that was soooo good!!! I'm not a vegetarian just like GOOD veggie burgers with bacon on top, lol! They are made fresh daily on site with corn and black beans and all kinds of yumminess!My husband ordered the ""Dirty South"" burger which was just as generous in size with  2 pieces of thick smoked bacon, aged cheddar and BBQ sauce on a pretzel roll which is his favorite, he was in heaven! We also had his dad so we ordered wings with the original buffalo sauce, they were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of heat.  We finished it off with an order of the regular and sweet potato fries.  Needless to say we will be back again and again and again..."
3/12/2012,2 star rating,"Some friends and I were hungry for dinner but weren't feeling Rico's or Freddie's or Chinatown, so we decided to try this place out. I like the idea, the location, and the service. Their menu is extensive, with options to customize, and I love that there is a place dedicated to only burgers near my neighborhood. Unfortunately, the price and the quality of the food didn't really mesh, in my opinion. My boyfriend and I each got a burger, small fries, and a small drink and paid $24. I felt the burgers were small and the meat a bit overdone for that price. I don't necessarily want to compare it to a place like Kuma's because the concepts are a bit different, but I did pay less at Kuma's for a much bigger and better burger. I have also paid less at Flub a Dub Chubs for a much better burger and fries. If anyone were to suggest Burger Point again, I wouldn't be opposed to going. But for the money and the quality, I'll probably just stick with Rico's or Freddie's.*Edit*My apologies. I had said that Kuma's burgers are much bigger than Burger Point. But the owner stated that my burger facts were incorrect, and so I apologize for misleading anyone.I do, however, stand by my opinion that, for the quality, Burger Point is still pricey."
1/31/2012,3 star rating,"I'm glad to see a new gourmet burger place in the South Loop, but the Burger Point was just ok. I had higher expectations. The descriptions of the burgers sound great, but unfortunately the taste doesn't live up to the descriptions. They have a good copywriter, I must say.  I tried the ""Dirty South"" burger, and it had good flavor. I was surprised that they didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked. My burger was cooked well done - I would have preferred medium-well. I also expected a larger patty for this to be a gourmet burger establishment. In addition, the fries were way too small for my liking - I almost wanted to get a fork to eat them.The ambiance is just strange - there are flowers all over the place. I don't think flowers when I go to a burger place. Perhaps they were trying to highlight the all-natural, locally sourced meat. I appreciate that the meat is locally sourced and ground in the store, etc., but unfortunately this does not translate into an amazing tasting burger. I translates into an ok tasting burger.I would go back if I were in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."
2/20/2012,3 star rating,"Officially, I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars. If you are a burger enthusiast, it should be on your list.What you get:1/3 lb patty smashed on a griddle with basically any combination of roll and fixings, as well as meats including, and other than, beef.What I liked:Options. Tons of options. Maybe too many, but the roll options alone are worth it. I am sucker for a potato roll and was welcome to see them on the menu here. The crust on my burger was phenomenal, possibly the best I've had. It added a great texture and I love the unshaped edges of the patty. Also the grind size of the beef was nice and large and the beef itself had a clean taste to it.What I didn't like:The ""lettuce"" is actually a spring mix, better served in a salad than a burger. The tomatoes were sad (but it's February). The bun was very, very lightly toasted, but not buttered. Despite the beef's pedigree (there are signs about RainCrow farms beef everywhere) this burger did not have a lot of beefy flavor and was way under salted. The main taste I got was from the American cheese, which was nicely melted. Also, my burger was overcooked.Bottom line:A well intentioned burger, and you have so many options you are bound to find something you like. The overcooking killed it for me, however my girlfriend's was perfectly cooked as ordered. I think despite claims from the ranchers, every side of beef tastes different, especially from cows raised outside feedlots. It's possible a future visit here will yield a burger with better flavor.The fries were pretty bad, limp and soggy. Skip the fries and go with the potato stick, which is actually potato chips.."
2/15/2015,3 star rating,"a tasty burger to be sure and nice variety of toppings...however, I felt like the meat was a little overlooked and dry.  Stopped in here after auto show and burgers fries and drinks for two was 33 bucks.  I better see some red in the burger for that amount of money.  Get that right and this place will rock it."
9/2/2017,5 star rating,"This was some of the best food I've had while visiting Chicago! The menu is INSANE! I even went with just a plane cheeseburger and it was AMAZING! Be careful ordering the fries, they're HUGE! I got the truffle salt fries and I highly recommend them. The staff was extremely friendly and fast. The manager or owner was so friendly and helpful when deciding what to get, he was very interactive with the guests and made the atmosphere very comfortable. MUST GO TO!"
11/13/2011,5 star rating,"Uh- mazing! You would think with so many burger options in Chicago, you would think of this as another place, but the service and quality of food is rather high. I personally had the hangover buger and sweet potato fries. The burger was quite amazing! The jalapeños really brought out the flavor or the beef and velveeta cheese."
8/28/2013,4 star rating,"I eat at The Burger Point (South Loop) about once a week.  I love the grass fed beef ... it tastes like beef, and I like the options.  For example, I like a fried egg on my burger, bacon, tomato, lettuce, and spicy ketchup.  Awesome!   (The ketchup is made by a local company, and it is delicious.)  The restaurant itself is bright and clean, the bathrooms were also clean.  There are TV's if you want to watch the game or something too.  (And there is a Divvy bike station right across the street ... this is important for me because I Divvy everywhere.)I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't tried the wings or the chili yet.Enjoy!"

9/1/2012,4 star rating,"So I first heard about this place from my sister, who BTW, is a HUGE fan. We went there and I was astonished at the unique varieties of sandwiches and burgers they offered. It was a bit  overwhelming because I wanted to try EVERYTHING and could not decide.All of the meat they use is cruelty free and farm raised (which is important) and the price for everything is the same $8.50 which I think includes fries and a drink. They have a set up where you can place your order on a computer and make all the changes you want on the screen. It was a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will wish this system for all fast food places.The staff behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. They chat you up and make suggestions if you look confused. They also make great recommendations for the food as well. Trust them, they know what they are talking about. The food was delicious and well portioned.I definitely recommend this place to everyone."
3/13/2012,2 star rating,"Okay, this place has been open for over four months, and I figured that it's time to finally give it an honest review.First off, over four months in, they're still operating with hand-written order cards and a calculator.  Instead of focusing on the enormous computer screen and iPad with Belly app set up at the counter, I really hope they just get a simple cash register.  I see the stands in place for kiosk ordering, which would be great for expediting if they ever get set up, but until they speed up the ordering process, they alienate customers by making them wait so long in line for a single employee to take orders with a calculator.Next, I wish they would please be honest with how long it takes to get an order up.  I've been to Burger Point four times now.  Every time I'm there, I'm told that it'll be ""ten minutes,"" and not once has that time been met.  Just tonight I bought two burgers and one order of fries for me and my wife, and I had to wait twenty-two minutes for our food.  That's after waiting in line eight minutes just to put my order in because the point-of-sale is so horribly inefficient right now.It's my contention that this is a fast-food restaurant.  The website and menu claim otherwise.  If all a restaurant offers are burgers, fries, wings and chili, it's a fast food joint.  There's nothing wrong with that, but no matter what they want to be classified as, it should never take thirty minutes for a customer to get their food from the moment they walk in the door of a burger joint.Lastly, the food.  They do make some pretty tasty burgers.  They're on about the same level as Epic Burger, in my opinion.  The fries are okay.  The first three times we ate here, the fries were good.  Tonight, we received a bag full of cold, soggy, oily fries that looked like they had been sitting around way too long.  And the honey mustard dipping sauce has way too much vinegar.  Just the smell of it is off-putting.Overall, I think this place has a good outlook.  It's always busy, and people like their food.  But right now, the quality of the food does not come anywhere near being able to overcome their shortcomings in service and experience."
3/27/2015,5 star rating,"Called in for a pickup. Parking was easy. They don't cook the fries till you get there, solid commitment to quality. We ordered two burgers, one 6oz and one 12oz, small fry and large cheese fry. Damage was $28. The 6oz patties are like regular burgers, the 12oz is a double. Dude at the cash register signed me up for FiveStars super quick too, appreciate it. Will be back!"
11/22/2016,2 star rating,"I purchased the cheese fries with New American Burger. After making me wait 20 sth minutes for a takeout (which is fine w/ me atm - good food takes time), they messed up my order by serving me fries w/out cheese. I hate dry fries and couldn't eat that. Worse yet, their fries are pretty dry, hard, and over-fried even for people who eat dry fries - off to the trash bin. I left without the expectation that they'd mess up my order, but found out when I got home. I called them, and the employee who picked up is only willing to refund the one dollar difference between cheese fries and regular ones. No apologies. If they are apologetic for messing up my takeout order after a long wait, they should've just refund the 3.50 amount for the fries I paid, because they put sth I didn't want in my bag. Worse yet, the employee lied about refunding even the one dollar. I never received it even though he reassured me that he could refund me over the phone b/c of card record. After the lies and shitty service I got from my first time here. I'm actually being generous for giving them 2 stars -- after all, at least they do know how to make a decent burger.This is actually not far from my place. Too bad they bombed the experience. Never coming back."
5/24/2013,2 star rating,"I really want to like this place.  Let me be clear: the food is not the problem.  The problem a couple of things:1) The menu is kind of confusing.  Not that the food is, just that it takes a bit to understand what comes on the burger.  And there are a lot of things that can be on one burger that aren't on another one.  2) If you customize your burger, it's more expensive.  Which would be okay, except these burgers start out kind of pricey to begin with.  Everything is extra, including things like lettuce and tomato.  3) The portions are small.  And pretty expensive for what they are.  On average, I'd spend 13 bucks for a burger with a small fry and a can of soda.  My girlfriend said that it's ridiculous to spend that much on food and still be hungry.4) It takes a minute to get your food.  While I know they cook everything to order, it just seems ridiculous that it'll take 15 minutes to make a burger.  But that might be just me.5) It's tasty, but not overly so.  Maybe I haven't had the right food, but I've been there at least 5 times and everything is kind of blah to me.  I'm not the hardest person to please food wise, but I'm not a fan of this place.  But I'm glad it's there."
3/28/2012,4 star rating,Checked out the Burger Point in the South loop for lunch today.  Tried the Gobbler turkey burger w/ cranberry smear.  It was like thanksgiving at nannies.  Added the sweet potatoe fries and I was ready for some afternoon football and a nap.Great burger concept with some interesting choices.  Going into the rotation
9/27/2012,5 star rating,"These burgers are amazing.  My favorite is the Dirty South and I always get the double.  A cold burger from here is better that most other warm burgers.  I have tried all the fries and they are excellent for whatever mood you are in.  I always add the wasabi mayo as a side to my burger because the flavor sets off the sweetness of their BBQ sauce.  Another sauce that is amazing is the bourbon bacon jam, i would get that on any other burger if there is no bacon on it.  Also whatever sauce they give you that appears on your tray is for your fries.  This sauce is excellent try it.  I forgot what is in it but i have asked just about every time i go there because it is so good.    These burgers are a little pricey but are worth every bite."
3/10/2015,4 star rating,I love the burgers here! They taste so fresh. The service is awesome too. I would recommend calling ahead and placing an order because it is very busy- especially if you are ordering wings.
5/19/2012,4 star rating,Ok preface. Damn this place is expensive! Ok back to the review. Burger was great. Ordered a turkey burger on a pretzel roll. Delicious. Not a fan of the fries though. My daughter never really eats meat and she ate all of her burger. Had to be great. She's two.
11/1/2017,5 star rating,"My husband & I love Burger point! We travel from South Burbs to dine. Best grass fed burgers in Chicago land. The owner gives personal attention to every customer! Wings, & home cut fries. A+ it's a Winner!!"
3/2/2017,4 star rating,"Excellent, freshly made burger, served hot off the griddle. Above average neighborhood vibe, friendly service. Only small con is that it's a bit pricey."
4/29/2017,3 star rating,"I really loved this place when we found it. Unfortunately our last order wasn't that great at all. The chef must have changed the veggie patty and replaced it with a big chunk of potato with some rice and corn in it. It's just disgusting and a shame to call it a veggie patty. Although hubby's burger looked awesome, his fries were just soaked and not crispy at all."
10/20/2017,1 star rating,"Long story short, don't order online!A place that is called the burger point should put its focus on burgers, yes? Multiple times I have pre ordered a burger and fries online, for pickup. Their big thing is that they want the fries to be fresh, so they wait to deep fry the fries until you arrive. It's like ordering a pizza and when you show up they say....""let me melt this cheese for you hold on"".Today, I waited 16 minutes for the fries to be made. Meanwhile, my burger was already made and sitting under a heat lamp for 16 minutes. Is it the burger point or the fry point?!?! Walked about 1 minute home and the fries were already soggy! So the fresh fry theory is a thought, but in the end a huge waste of time. Burger was dry and cold! I questioned the manager about the issue and he blamed it on today being a Friday night and it was busy. What most businesses do is hire more people and prepare for it being busy so they can still get the food out in an acceptable manner. I was left feeling like it was my fault for expecting to get my order at the time that was given to me on the online ordering system. Sorry I expected that burger point."
12/22/2017,5 star rating,One of the best burgers I have ever had and I'm from southern California. The owner is a pleasure and everything was wonderful!
11/18/2014,5 star rating,"Following the Paleolithic Lifestyle, I need a place that has grass-fed cows on deck! I was dropping my dog off at ""Soggy Paws"" & I forgot my packed lunch at the house. Fortunately, this place was right around the corner. A bit pricey, but at that period of time. I did not care what kind of food I got, as long as it fits my regime. The cashier was great & I met the friend of the owner. Nice people! Fries were a little soggy (Ordered the sweet potato fries). Other than that, everything was on point!"
12/13/2017,4 star rating,"I made a bacon cheeseburger, and it was good, but could've been juicier. The fries were just ok. However, the buffalo wings were really good. Not sure what was so special about it, but it was just fried really well, and just lightly battered. Will come back just for the wings."
1/11/2012,4 star rating,"This is a new burger spot. The competition for a good burger in Chicago is really high, but i believe this new chain is up for the challenge. You literlly can add anything to your burger! Even Scrambled egg. Cajun Fries are also off the chain. My best take away from The Burger Point is the differnt options for buns. I had a pretzel bun, which is a new one in my book. Id like to thank the burger point for helping me expand my taste buds!"
12/22/2012,4 star rating,"Got the Ashman burger which was good, very fresh ingredients. The sweet potato fries were pretty soft. I prefer crispier fries.I'll probably go back and try a few more of the burgers though."
12/1/2015,5 star rating,First time trying The Burger Point and man was it worth every cent! The Spanish Revolution Burger was cooked perfectly and the homemade jalapeño relish was a great kick. The food is fresh and the owners are incredibly nice people. Would definitely eat here again!!
12/22/2011,3 star rating,"Finally had a chance to check out Burger Point the other night.  I had grabbed a menu last month when they opened but wasn't in the mood for a burger until recently.  There are several different signature burger options on the menu and I think you can build your own burger too.  It looks like they have 3 or 4 different roll types and at least 3 different patty types, including a veggie option.  We went with a Dirty South w/ avocado & Spanish Revolution w/ bacon.  I think the add on for each burger really made a difference between 3-Stars & 2-stars.A friend had mentioned that he thought the burgers were small for the price you pay.  I think the real issue is the buns are too big.  My burger felt like it was swallowed by bread.  The lady's felt similar although not as bad thanks to the avocado.  The burger size seemed perfect for me, not too big but not small either but with that size bun it made something fell off.  The fries were nice but could be crispier.  They seemed hot/fresh but lacked even a little crunchiness that would have made them great.  One burger was a combo meal w/ fries and soda & mine was just the burger and our total was around $20.  Not terrible but a bit pricier than another organic burger spot in the area.  I found it really odd that their soda machine didn't have water.  Staff was o.k., not looking for a best friend but as a new business it would seem beneficial to be a bit more personable.  We said, 'thank you' when we left and no one responded.  That had no impact on whether or not I would return but it would definitely bother some people and turning off customers for non-food related reasons isn't a good idea.  Convenience, i.e. parking lot in back, is probably the only thing that would draw me back over other options in the area.  I think they are definitely middle of the road and a good option if you want a burger and are in the area.  People who travel to check it out will probably be disappointed."
4/23/2012,4 star rating,"Grass fed burgers, creative extensive menu, option of single or double, sweet potatoe fries, and wings.  Hell -z yea!  Big fan ,especially south loop doesn't have too many options for a good gourmet burger.  You will be paying $12 for a double burger ( perfect for the typical guy) add on about $4-5 for fries, and you are paying close to $20 for the meal.  The # 1 ( which was my first try) comes with pretzel bun which was good enough to soak up the grease and add substance to the burger.  The burger takes about 5-10 min to make which i think could be improved.  It's better than waiting for a table at Kuma's..check it out and let me know what think."
1/19/2013,4 star rating,The Best Veggie Burger Ever really is the best veggie burger ever.  Also recommend the sweet potato fries with salt and the lemon aioli is comes with.  It's so close to work so it's pretty convenient for lunch.  The only qualm is sometimes how long you have to wait for your carryout order.
9/17/2015,5 star rating,"So I happened upon this place by accident. My buddy and I were looking for something simple and he didn't like Chinese food (Chinatown is a block away) so we saw burgers and went in. Wow! I'm not some organic health nut, but I do try to eat healthy when I have the option. This place uses all organic products and makes almost everything in-store. It was much healthier than any other burger place and one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I have been back several times now each time bringing friends with. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious burger and fries."

11/17/2011,4 star rating,"Here is why you could, but ultimately should NOT, compare this place to 5 Guys.You COULD make the comparison because both places: keep it simple and focus on burgers and fries, have you order at the counter, and have very distinct atmospheres.However, you ultimately should NOT make the comparison because Burger Point is way better. Their menu has 16 (!!) types of burgers on it, making it like Kuma's minus the 3 hour wait outside in the cold. Extra bonus is that they support family farms and everything is made to order. The service was quintessential Chicago: a little gritty, a little brash, but totally endearing.Take note, although you order at the counter it's not a standard fast-food burger joint. You'll wait 10-15 minutes for your order, but trust me, it's worth it (in my experience, especially if you order the Dirty South, which is topped with cheddar, smoked bacon, BBQ, and served on a pretzel bun.) Did I mention you can pick from pretzel buns, potato rolls, and brioche rolls? Yeah, not your typical burger place. Also, the fries are flavorful and crisp and are served on their own little plate, which I love because I'm OCD about keeping my foods separate so the sauces, etc. from one food don't drip onto the other. The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the house music they play. Kind of bizarre to be hearing club music during lunch hour, and it's not my favorite kind of music in the first place, but props to the owner for taking the risk and doing something different."
12/9/2011,3 star rating,"I think the burgers at this place are delicious. I havent made my own yet because I keep finding new pre-made ones that I love. Besides who wants to go to a restaurant and make their own combination, you're the cook...show me your skill..Why only 3 stars?  Well, after the first two times I went I kept asking for the spiral fry, which I thought was exactly that...spiral fries.  They were new and didn't have them, so I got the regular fries which were hot and crispy.This time we finaly were able to order the spiral fry. Little did we know there was no fry to be found...instead just a spiral potato chip on a stick.  for $3 they give you about 10 potato chips. The taste was great, but for $3 (and something labeled ""spiral fry"") I expect either frensh fries in a spiral shape or way more than 10 potato chips...Burgers are a good deal. Spiral fry is a rip off."
8/21/2015,5 star rating,"Delicious! Burger made to order, great menu, great variety!!! Amazing! We have one more week at our current  office and are planning a return trip! YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS PLACE!"
10/29/2011,4 star rating,"The  burgers were, as my 9yo put it, ""jammin"". I only gave them 4 stars becuase this is a soft opening and they are working out the kinks. We had the Down South Burger, The Blue Harvest and The Burger Point Burger. All were tasty. I wish they had a more substantial french fry but I am sooooo excited to have a great burger place in the neighborhood!"
2/10/2012,4 star rating,"I literally stumbled upon this spot. We were parked and just talking and I noticed the signage, so I went in. I noticed the ""grass fed"" beef and fresh cut fries sign on the glass and I was EXCITED, so in I went.Our first order was a turkey burger w/fried egg, havarti cheese lettuce and onions on wheat bun w/fresh cut fries. My girlfriend ordered:beef burger w/smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato on a pretzel bun with the condiments. When we got home and started there was SILENCE this was the best burger I have had in quite some time. The beef has alot of flavor, not to much seasonings with just the right amount of a char taste.The fries I know was fried but I had no grease on my fingertips and they were good, no JOOD!!! (jood = exceptional) and I consider myself a fry connoisseur.We have been back several times since our first visit and the last time we went we ordered the wings buffalo and BBQ. This was not such a smart thing for me to do because even the BBQ wings were hot as H-E-LL. If you like it spicy then you will love them. I tip and curtsey to Burger Point.."
2/16/2012,5 star rating,"I would never have came across it on my own but I was led there by a regular and I'm glad I know about it now! It's a great alternative to eating at McCormick Place if you are heading there for an event (which I was). For just over $21, I had the #3 Crunch Burger, but swapped for a pretzel bun instead of potato roll; my boyfriend had #12 The Hangover, and we split a large order of fries. Everything was AMAZING, I loved the kettle chips on my burger and LOVED the creamy french onion on it. It was a good size, almost too big for me but I don't usually do large portion meals. My boyfriend loved his chili-smothered hangover burger just as much, and he said he was happy with the amount of kick, although he is a fan of spicy. We couldn't finish all of the fries and I wish we would have ordered the spiral potato stick instead - that looks great and will definitely be in our plan for next time. The owner took our order and he was very personable. It's a small-ish interior but we had no problem finding a table at 6 on a Wednesday. Nice decorations, friendly atmosphere. I will be returning."
7/12/2012,4 star rating,"I'm not much of a burger person - it's probably the thing I'd choose off an eclectic menu, but a friend was craving cow and we were visiting the neighborhood, so we thought we'd give it a go. The menu is actually a bit overwhelming - there are so many options that you really need to figure out what sounds good and start to narrow it down. I ended up with the crunchy burger and it was a great choice. Decided on the pretzel bun, which was a great choice to sop up some of the wetness of the burger. Homemade potato chips, american cheese and a french dip sort of thing (which isn't really clear on the menu. Says French Onions, thought it might be the stuff you put on green bean casserole, but it's actually a white dip type thing with chunks of onion in it) on a grass fed burger and pretzel bun. It was delicious!Got the combo with cheese fries and soda, but there was no way to finish all that food. The location is small, the guys behind the counter are a little gruff and its a little pricier than I'd like to spend on lunch, but the food lives up to the price and it's burgers and fries, so I wasn't really expecting ambiance, you know? Owner or manager was walking around and directing the guys behind the counter to make sure that things were going smoothly. They had put my friend's food under the heat lamp waiting for their wings to be done, but the owner charged over to tell them to take the food out and bring the wings later. He seemed really concerned with giving folks the right experience, which says a lot about his commitment."

7/18/2012,4 star rating,"This is one of Chicago's best-kept secrets. Tucked away in a hidden (read: mildly sketchy) part of the South Loop, Burger Point makes delicious burgers. Well, maybe I should back up. The first time I went, which was soon after they opened and on a crowded Thursday night, I did not like the food AT ALL, the service was slow, and I vowed not to return. In particular, the sweet potato fries were scorched, so I sent them back, only to receive a second scorched batch. My burger was overcooked and underseasoned. The bacon on my burger was chewy and floppy. A couple of months later, when my husband had a burger craving (note: this happens weekly, which is why my Yelp reviews consist mostly of burger restaurants), we tried it again. I must say, I am very glad I gave it a second shot. I ordered the Classic (#15), and it was one of the best burgers I have had in Chicago. I requested a pretzel roll, which was deliciously chewy, and the burger was flavorful, tender, and filling. AND - the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly and were very tasty! I will definitely be back, and if you live in the neighborhood, you should try it, too."
4/19/2015,4 star rating,One of the coolest burger menus ever! Menu Presented in pictures so cool it's almost as if u could taste each one before u buy. But closed at 9am everyday is so early can't tell u how many times I made it to the locked door.

2/21/2012,5 star rating,This place is great. The guys who work the register are soooo nice and you can tell they want to please you and make sure you have a good experience.Their burgers are great. We are trying to ride the rail of burgers. I like the wings too. Try the fries with their ranch sauce. Yum!I would recommend this place to anyone!
5/28/2012,5 star rating,Very satisfied with this place. Everyone was so friendly here and the atmosphere was great! I saw 5yr aged cheddar on the menu and figured they were just saying that but when I got it they really weren't lying! It was amazing. The size of everything was well worth the cost and the flavors were amazing!!! It's a medium sized place but they are worth stopping at! Fries were great and season perfectly!!! Burger was perfect and large with just enough toppings and condiments to make everything and every flavor stand out! I would definitely go back again.
4/4/2015,3 star rating,"I'd give 3.5 stars! Just had the veggie burger it was pretty good! Really big. Offers various toppings. Small str8forward burger joint. My hubby got the classic beef burger he thought it was pretty good as well ""except it was too well done!""  I would return!"
1/3/2015,4 star rating,"If you like burgers, you will love this place!  Food is fresh and you can substitute veggie, chicken or turkey burgers instead of beef.  This place will not disappoint!  Try the sweet potato fries-yummy and they come with sweet/spicy sauce."
8/11/2012,2 star rating,"The restaurant is small and clean. Service is friendly bathrooms clean. The burgers are average and over priced. For 3 burgers, 3 fries, and 3 small drinks was $53. My husband and daughter are the burger experts and enjoyed their burgers. I had the turkey burger. It was good sized, moist, but under seasoned. I've had much better at Churkey's. Overall it was a decent experience. I don't know if I will revisit but the Hubby and daughter are planning what they will try on their next visit. The wait was long we got our burgers before our fries. Burgers were gone by then. Red Velvet cupcakes are very good."
3/28/2012,4 star rating,I like what this place is trying to do ... they have a very creative menu especially for a burger place. I had the Buffalo Burger - a chicken burger with buffalo sauce and blue cheese relish and i was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Being from Buffalo I constantly see places that can't even get chicken wings right let alone try to resemble what Buffalo is known for in a hamburger. The sauce was perfect & the blue cheese relish really did it for me. I definitely want to try more of the selection which means i will be back ...
3/9/2013,3 star rating,"Pros: The premium flavor of the beef tends to support the claim that it's the grass fed variety.  You can tell everything's fresh.  I love the iPad-driven concept to create your own order. The large variety of toppings OTHER than ketchup & mustard are a welcome treat. I sprung for the cranberry reduction which was a nice change.The Cons:  The burger's size reminded me of a fat sausage patty in the middle of a bun. While it was good, it might have been able fit on a biscuit. The fries were shoestring style and were good but, by volume, they were probably equivalent to a half order of small fries you'd get from a burger chain.  The toppings had reasonably hefty a-la-car prices to them, also. You can't mind paying a little extra for such premium beef & food but at $18+, it was a bit much."
3/5/2017,5 star rating,Food is delicious and all freshly made. The staff is unbelievably nice and accommodating!
7/15/2013,4 star rating,"Is there any way I can give 3.5? No? Alright, I'll be generous and round up to 4.There are many components to a good buger, but one of the most important is the beef itself. It should have a solid flavor all on its own with minimal seasoning instead of relying on crazy toppings and sauces (*COUGH Kuma's *COUGH). The best way to assure this is to start with quality, grass-fed beef, and it looks like this place got that memo. After that's taken care of, if you want to go crazy with the sauces, toppings, and cheeses, let your freak flag fly. And this place definitely knows how to cut loose.I enjoyed a crunchy burger, which consisted of potato chips and french onion sauce on top. A unique combination of flavors made it a burger to remember for next time.The location itself is well lit and clean, with ordering stations in addition to the counter. Plenty of parking in back as well as ample street parking.Bonus points for having sweet potato fries.Still got a few more spots to hit before I declare a best burger in town, but this place is in the running."
7/3/2013,5 star rating,"I visit here at least twice a week...it is right around the corner from my work.  I have yet to get a burger I don't like.  Still working my way down the menu.  I will for sure continue to visit, even though my office is moving to the North side...still feel it is worth the trip at least every few weeks."
6/28/2013,2 star rating,"I really wanted to say hey this place is great, but that didn't happen. The place inside is very well lit and open. I do like how they let you place your order using the iPad. I went for their crunch burger...the one w/ potato chips...w/ LTOP mayo and mushrooms on it w/ a small fry and drink.Was I impressed with the food...meh. My bun was completely soggy due to the grease from the burger, mayo and mustard. Word to the wise get the mustard and mayo on the side. My burger came to the table drenched in mayo and mustard. I mean like  globs and mounds of mayo and mustard. It was impossible to eat w/ your hands since it was nothing but mayo and mustard. Well at least the bathrooms were clean."
6/26/2013,1 star rating,"We went to Burger Point for the first time last night and we will never, ever be back.  It took 20 minutes to get our food (with nobody else in the place). When we finally got our burgers they were on the verge of burnt, dry and extremely salty.  The noise level was so high that I finally went outside to wait because the noise started to grate on my nerves.  To top it all off the burgers with fries and a drink cost over $25.00.  What a rip."
6/24/2013,4 star rating,Amazing burgers! Even the vegetarian one is amazing. And delicious fries. 4 stars instead of 5 because a little pricey and food takes a while to come out.

YUM!Burger Point is pricey, but definitely worth it."
5/29/2013,5 star rating,"I needed some sundries and accidentally found Burger Point right by the little grocery store I was at and thought I'd give it a try....and my life will never be the same :) I am actually in the Food Service industry and work with 100's of National Accounts and am a Hamburger Junkie. What Burger Point does with an item that has been sooooo abused is nothing but pure artistic cooking.Let's start with their ingredients....I challenge you to find another Casual Dine restaurant with such focus, attention and marketing of organic and fresh products. Just pinch a piece of the hamburger off by itself and that will speak for the quality alone.Selection = When you first step in, don't rush yourself. Grab a menu, sit down and really read it all the way through.Someone mentioned on here that the menu is kind of confusing. I can see at first glance where that my be thought, but you basically can build your own or try one of their dozen phenomenal creations.  I have never seen nor imagined combinations like they have developed. Wanna be your own Chef? Like I said you can build your own. Starting with 4 different types of meats including Veggi, 10 different types of cheeses and 5 different rolls. Then from there you can add a ton of extra's.Other items = Being from Texas I had to try the Chili and had my nose up in the air when they served it to me, that is until my first bite...No grease, pure beautiful flavor and just a little kick to it. I added cheeses and onions and was just bummed that I couldn't put this in a syringe and inject it straight into the blood stream.So if you've gotten this far reading I think you can tell how I feel about Burger Point. It's near McCormick which may be a bit of a challenge to you, but if I get with in 100 miles of S. State St. I will walk on fire to get there.Good luck to Burger Point...you got this Food Service guy excited! - Scott"
5/24/2013,2 star rating,"I really want to like this place.  Let me be clear: the food is not the problem.  The problem a couple of things:1) The menu is kind of confusing.  Not that the food is, just that it takes a bit to understand what comes on the burger.  And there are a lot of things that can be on one burger that aren't on another one.  2) If you customize your burger, it's more expensive.  Which would be okay, except these burgers start out kind of pricey to begin with.  Everything is extra, including things like lettuce and tomato.  3) The portions are small.  And pretty expensive for what they are.  On average, I'd spend 13 bucks for a burger with a small fry and a can of soda.  My girlfriend said that it's ridiculous to spend that much on food and still be hungry.4) It takes a minute to get your food.  While I know they cook everything to order, it just seems ridiculous that it'll take 15 minutes to make a burger.  But that might be just me.5) It's tasty, but not overly so.  Maybe I haven't had the right food, but I've been there at least 5 times and everything is kind of blah to me.  I'm not the hardest person to please food wise, but I'm not a fan of this place.  But I'm glad it's there."
5/18/2013,4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of the Gobbler at Burger Point!  I would never have imagined that I would go to a burger joint & order a turkey burger, but *gasp* the Burger Point has made me do that!The soggy fries & the fact that Burger Point always seems to be a little slow to get orders out keeps them from being 5 stars."
5/16/2013,3 star rating,"Burger point is a great addition to the South Loop area. The location itself is out of reach to many sightseers but locals should have no problem finding it. The venue itself is rather small and you are praying for a table to open up as you wait in line to order your burger. Speaking of burgers, well let's talk about them. They are pretty amazing, and better than then Sweet Waters down on Michigan Ave but no Kumas. They have plenty of toppings to choose from different sauces, vegetables and you can't forget the over easy egg. Also if you aren't a big red meat or a meat eater at all they have a chicken breast or veggie Patty option as well. Big bonus for me is the pretzel bun.  Also I recommend the tower fries as I call them which are season American chip style on a skewer."
5/10/2013,2 star rating,"I live close to this place and was SO excited to go. I got the Drunken Grandma (saw it on TV like many other Yelpers). I was absolutely disappointed. There was hardly a trace of cheese, and the burger was ABSOLUTELY OVERCOOKED. In their defense I did not specify how I wanted my burger cooked, but they didn't ask, so I assumed medium/ medium rare. I appreciate quality beef, and the way they cooked this burger was a travesty. Overall tasteless and dry.I also had to return my burger the first time since they put it on a potato roll instead of the pretzel bun it was supposed to come on.Also, for a stuffed burger and small fries it was $18...which for the quality was totally overpriced.I would consider returning due to the convenient location, but would definitely recommend another selection and specifying your burger not be charred to death."

I couldn't believe how small the burgers were. Fries were way to salty. I will go back to this place but only for a burger. There is no half star, otherwise I would have put 2.5 stars."
5/4/2013,1 star rating,"The worst customer service ever! I ordered four burgers with two burgers made incorrectly. The ""forgot"" two topping ( paid extra) for and didn't even get an apologize from the staff. They don't appreciate the customer or feel the need to care.You are paying the avg $15 burger not for the taste but for the tasteless customer service.You have been warned!!!!"
4/18/2013,2 star rating,"I'll start by saying I don't eat burgers often, and didn't have one here.  The only other option on the menu is a chicken sandwich, veggie sandwich or chicken wings.  I got the wings with Baltimore sauce (really a rub, not a sauce) and buffalo sauce.  The chicken was cooked well and the buffalo sauce was delicious, although nothing special.  The Baltimore sauce was too salty, but the flavors were good, a mix of seasoning salt and something like old bay seasoning on them.  We had seen them on Chicago's Best and decided to check them out.  My parents had burgers and said they were just ok, nothing special.  There is a deal for a burger, 3 wings and french fries for $12.99.  None of us were blown away by anything, although the decor was nice.  The menu is too large and a bit confusing given the number of options available.  I couldn't figure out how to enter exactly what we wanted in the iPad order system, so we just went to the counter to give our order.  Given how expensive the burgers are, I don't think we'll be back."
4/14/2013,2 star rating,"It's two stars purely for the fact on my classic burger I only got bacon on here...without the grassfed burger!!!!  Where's my actual burger??  It's good, but eat it there to double check your food.  Fries are meh.  Burger and wings are good.  I'm pretty PO'd right now cause I just drove home and I'm not driving back to wait another 30 minutes for my burger (Pretty busy and made to order...supposedly.)"
4/13/2013,3 star rating,"After seeing Burger Point on Chicago's Best and living just 5 blocks away, we walked down one Saturday night. Apparently lots of other people saw the show that night too because the little place was packed. There were several tables of people waiting for their food and nothing seemed to be coming out. People were getting ticked and some walked out. After almost 45 minutes, we finally got our food. Fries were okay. One order is enough for 2-3 people. Burgers were good. The grass fed beef really makes a difference. Pretzel bun was tasty. Partner opted for the grilled onions on his and commented there were way too many onions. The cheese on both of our burgers was pretty sparse. Chicago has a lot of great restaurants but I still haven't found an outstanding burger place. Drive the 90 miles north to Milwaukee and hit Elsa's on the Park, Distil, Sobelman''s or AJ Bombers to learn how to do a great burger."

Everything was so fresh and we loved that the beef is hormone free, free range, etc. I also must add that the veggie burger was phenomenal - by far the best I've ever had!!! The red velvet cupcake was also excellent! And as if it couldn't get any better, this place is BYOB! So nice to have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood - we'll definitely be back!!"
4/8/2013,4 star rating,"Grass fed is good. Tried ""The Capone"" based on watching piece on ""Chicago's Best"" last night. It is basically a caprese salad (sundried tomatoes, basil, mozzarella cheese with balsamic vinegar dressing) packed INSIDE two burger patties melded into one, then topped with fried basil leaves. Excellent idea and execution and nowhere near as messy as it sounds. Yes, it took a while to make, cook and serve and, yes, it wasn't cheap at $11.75 but quality costs and takes time. Veggie chili with tofu was OK. Didn't try the fries."

11/30/2016,5 star rating,"The ground chicken burger patty was pretty awesome, actually. Since I don't eat red meat, this was a big deal for me since I have rarely been to a burger joint that has such a comprehensive selection of burgers with all meat choices. Anyway, the Asian burger was a good (and different) try. :)"
1/17/2014,4 star rating,It's hard to find restaurants that serve grass fed meat and cage free/free range eggs. A bit pricey but I'd rather eat healthy!However the wait is TOO LONG! They should hire more workers during lunch hour.
11/16/2016,5 star rating,"They have gluten free buns!!!! I haven't been this happy since I discovered  Hessburger in Finland: no hormones, no antibiotics, real food. Yay!!"
2/25/2017,5 star rating,Their food is amazing and the staff is always really friendly! I rarely eat burgers but I love theirs.
2/23/2017,4 star rating,"The ""Dirty South Burger"" was a great combination of barbecue and cheese. The burger was well-cooked and the bun was very flavorful (unlike most fast food hamburger buns). I have also tried their chicken wings. The wings are good but sauce could be a little more spicy. Aside from that recommendation, it's a good place to grab a bite."
2/9/2014,4 star rating,Awesome burger spot. The Capone is unbeatable. It could have been a little faster but still awesome.
5/11/2014,4 star rating,"Tried this after hearing good things from new neighbors. Loved that they deliver. We had our order delivered. They arrived in about 45 mins. We loved their burgers (very good quality and done exactly as requested). The sides we had were decent, but not noteworthy. They are pricey, but as they're the best burger in the area we may try them again. Give them a shot"
6/11/2014,5 star rating,"Always worth the wait. Their chicken burger is the stuff of dreams. Their fries are (almost) always hot and fresh. The service could be friendlier, but I'm not there for them to stroke my ego: I want a good burger, and that's what they give. Love it. Cooked fresh to order, so don't go in expecting a burger two minutes after ordering. A little pricey but....it's worth it."
10/26/2014,5 star rating,Awesome burgers.  All ingredients from the ketchup to the beef are local and organic.  Very noms.
11/9/2011,4 star rating,"It was a very well done burger, a good balance, good flavor to the meat, and a very good size (not too big or too small).  The only real complaint I had was the wait, but with it being brand new, that is understandable.I appreciate the combinations offered, I had the #1 and really enjoyed the grilled hot peppers, added a nice spice without being over-powering.  The bacon, that was great (it IS bacon), great flavor, nice and crispy.  I had their normal fries, which were pretty good, not amazing, but better than most.  It was also nice to see they had ginger ale at the fountain.  The wait was about a half hour, but I didn't mind, the atmosphere was fine and had a couple friends with me.  Now, I want to give their wings and chili a try at some point.  To me, mustard habanero wings just sound really good...Overall, good quality, good flavors, good balance, but slower service (they're new).  I can certainly recommend it as long as you're not in a rush.Note: It isn't one of my top 5 burgers, but I have a pretty extensive burger list.  :-)"
3/11/2012,4 star rating,"I will be back!My girlfriend and I were hungry after going to the movies and decided to stop by on our way home.  We did not know what to expect.  Well, overall I was impressed.Cameron, the general manager, was the person at the register greeting us.  He helped us out with the menu, answered all of our annoying questions and made suggestions based on our wants.  I'm huge on service and Cameron made us feel welcomed and offered AWESOME customer service.  For the services alone, I will be back.Most importantly the food!!!!  My friend and I both had Dirty South Burgers....delicious!  This was the perfect burger.  I do agree that the pretzel bun was a bit big, but I have never had a small pretzel bun, lol!  My patty was perfectly match and I never had big chunks of bread with no meat.  I ordered the sweet potato fries, and they were just okay.  The sauce they give with them is AWESOME!  Next time, I am going to try regular fries.  My friend and I did get to try the spiral.  It is very good fresh potato chips, but I think I will stick with regular fries.I will be back to try the burger egg rolls...they look delicious!The only reason I did not give Burger Point a five star is because it can be on the pricey side.  It is not unreasonable at all, but if you are used to ordering off the dollar menu at McDonald's this is not the burger for you.  If you want a good quality burger with good service, Burger Point is definitely worth it."
4/2/2014,4 star rating,Good burgers. The sweet potato fries are great. A bit on the pricey side and a bit slow at times but well worth the wait. Food is very good.
4/3/2014,5 star rating,"We freaking love this place. Fun, interesting burgers made with real ingredients. The wait is a big longer than you might expect, but the burgers are so good I'm not even taking away a star."
2/11/2014,4 star rating,"pretty nice place to grab a quick bit. i like how they have the healthier choices, like grass fed beef and turkey burger. You can make your own burgers on their tablets adding ingrenients of your choice. the place is clean too, you can see all that goes on in the kitchen too."
9/10/2012,4 star rating,"This is one place you burger lovers have to check out. I was here on Friday  9-6-12 during     lunch hour.  This place is great if you're looking for the ultimate burger. They have so many to choose from & if that doesn't catch your attention then you can make your own however you like it. I chose from the menu ...""The New American Classic"".  That burger was so good, I loved that hint of wasabi mayo, it gave it a kick. It was delish ..and very filling, I could have saved half of it for later, but my greedy butt couldn't stop and wanted to savor every bit of it in one setting. There are some downfalls though ...it is a little pricey for my taste. A burger alone is going to cost you over $9. That's not including side and drink.  You can make it a combo which will cost you more than $12. So if you do come be prepared to spend a lil dough here."
12/26/2011,4 star rating,"I'm glad to have a place like this that I can walk to!  I chose the New American Classic (I think that's what it's called...) and it was oh so good.  I've wanted to have a burger with a fried egg on it since I went to Kuma's a couple years ago, and finally got my chance!  The avocado on the burger was a nice touch as well (and they weren't skimpy).  I only knocked off a star because the sweet potato fries were really soggy, but they were still delicious so I didn't mind that much.  The meat tasted great and they were pretty quick with grilling it.I'll definitely be back!  I wish them good luck."
1/27/2012,4 star rating,"Went with the wife and little girl.  The place was pretty packed for a Thursday night.  Not the biggest dining area so it was a bit awkward maneuvering around but I wouldn't count that as a negative.  Not sure if they could do a better job maximizing the seating area.  As far as the food is concerned, we ordered the new american classic sans bun, garlic chicken wings, and the chili.  The burger itself was pretty damn good and the presentation was great, considering there wasn't a bun on the burgers.  The wings were a little spicy for my liking, not sure if they mistakenly gave me the hot garlic ones instead.  The chili was just ok. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere was decent.  The televisions may have been too high considering how low the tables were, but whatever."
2/22/2012,4 star rating,"Although it's a little out of the way for a lunch if you work downtown, Burger Point is a pretty quick and delicious lunch spot.  Lots of options for toppings and buns, but I went with a burger on their specialty list.  My first and only burger thus far, The Burger Point Burger, was spicy and delish, but the potato chip spiral looked cooler than it actually tasted.  A little bland if you ask me.  Still, the food came hot and quick, and the wait ""little longer than you're used to"" is nothing to worry about.The service was super friendly, and helpful for picking out menu items, which can be a little overwhelming.  Definitely looking forward to checking out some of the other menu items."
1/14/2014,4 star rating,A bit pricy but always a good eat.   Sometimes the music is a bit loud but overall I like this place.
1/17/2013,4 star rating,"2012 was certainly the year of the burger in Chicago. Who knew that such a classic would turn into a trend? Being a non-beef eater, I still enjoy going to burger places and trying patties made up of various birds and/or vegetables. While I'll never knock a burger place for not catering to my preferences (because who goes to a burger spot and complains about beef?), I truly appreciate all those who keep the burger light on for all of us enjoy some sort of patties, NO special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions on a sesame seed bun?And since I just wrote a jingle from one burger powerhouse, allow me to borrow a trademark from another: I got it my way at the Burger Point. Rather than demand the customer bend to the will of preassigned recipes, Burger Point allows you to build your own burger. Choice: it's what's for dinner. Or, lunch. I opted for a turkey burger on a pretzel bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and pickle. Because my body's so bootylicious, I asked for an order of cheese fries to go along with the burger. Oh, and I wanted it 'to go.'The woman behind the counter told me that they make everything to order so it could take a minute. I assented. I liked the fact that a.) the product is fresh; b.) this and the wait time were both communicated; and c.) I was asked if this was alright. Little things to be sure, but in a landscape filled with imitators and competitors, little things make all the difference. After an appropriate amount of time, I was on my way with a sack full of delicious grub. I raced to my friends' house to eat it and I was pretty stoked that the food tasted as good as it smelled. The burger had a deep, smokey taste from the grill, the cheese was nicely melted and the veggies were cold and crisp. The texture of the bun had just the right amount of crunch and chewiness to add to every bite. My cheese fry order was large, in charge and doused with liquified cheese that was, at one point, in some sort of block and not created in a chemical lab. Burger Point isn't reinventing the wheel, but it's definitely making sure it goes round and round like a boss."
3/30/2014,4 star rating,"Awesome quick-serve burger spot. The meats and cheeses are high quality and these are some creative burgers. I recommend The Dirty South - grass fed hamburger, 5 year old aged cheddar, double smoked bacon and bbq sauce on a pretzel roll. You can get them with fresh made chips or fries - can't go wrong with either. If you chose to dine in, you will generally find seating and it's just a no frills atmosphere. You'll eat, talk, hang out for a bit and then leave. I'm going to stop writing before I talk myself into going down there. It's a good burger."
6/8/2014,3 star rating,I wasn't really blown away with the place. Burgers had kinda a bland taste. Fries were average. But they definitely do have a lot of options that let you customize your burger exactly how you want it.
5/27/2014,4 star rating,"This place is great. Good location, yummy food and all made to order. Their veggie burgers are excellent, too. It's a little slower than fast food but cheaper than most burger bars. Worth it."
4/29/2015,1 star rating,This place is such a rip off! The food is way to expensive and the wait is ridiculously long! The guy at the counter is arrogant and has no patience so I felt rushed and couldn't really ask questions!! Also when I got my food it was cold!!
10/1/2013,2 star rating,"Inconsistency in quality and service.  Great concept, just not a long term execution.  Now it just seems like it's trying too hard.  The more options you have, the higher the margin for error.  Sorry guys.  It was great while it lasted."

5/23/2012,4 star rating,"Awesome awesome awesome burgers.  Fantastic.  People behind the counter not so friendly but then again, neither am I sometimes.  I hope that this place is here for a long time and doesn't change a thing.  Fries are awesome either potato or sweet potato, they have orange crush in the pop dispenser, everything is fresh, grass fed, humanely handled and kick ass.  Some of the patrons are assholes, but they can't be held responsible for that now can they.  Highly recommend for dine in or immediate area take away - would be a shame to let any of that food get cold on the way home."
8/19/2016,5 star rating,"Awesome place, the burgers were great, and I like that there are veggie options."
1/9/2013,5 star rating,"The burgers are DE-LICIOUS and super juicy (My personal favorite is ""The Crunchy Burger""). I always order fries there and with a little extra salt it's AMAZING. This place also has the BEST grilled cheese sandwich that I've ever tasted. The Burger Point is always my favorite go-to place with friends whether its just to grab a bite, or study."
1/22/2016,4 star rating,"Pretty good burgers but, the wings with hot garlic sauce are what I like most. They fry them extra crispy like I like all my wings and they always withstand the car ride home when I get them to go. The fries are good too.  I love that they use fresh ingredients and make their sauces from scratch. Good food at an affordable price, you can't beat that!"

10/4/2013,2 star rating,"I was there last week, my turkey burger was dry, ordered wasabi mayo, that was nonexistent. The fries were cold, so I assume old as it was about 5min after we got them we were eating. On the bright side the wings were great- garlic and the guy at the counter was pleasant."
2/13/2013,5 star rating,"I came here yesterday with my guy friend. I've always wanted to try this since its not far from my house. I got the southwestern burger; I think thats what it was called. It had bacon, 5 yr aged sharp cheddar cheese, and barbecue sauce. It was amazing. The pretzel bun also makes it unique. My friend got the American burger. We woke up the next morning wanting another. A bit pricey but very worth it."
9/11/2015,4 star rating,"Freshly made burgers in a variety of interesting styles. Good attention to detail include fixings, a very nice bun, and skinny fries. Staff are pleasant. Clean and simple decor. Convenient location."
4/30/2016,4 star rating,"Great place, probably one of the best burgers in Chicago. The atmosphere is great, very friendly workers and customers. (one offered me to pay my change) The menu may look a little overwhelming but you can just look at the screen to see the pictures of the burgers, it'll definitely make you hungry. Close to Chinatown, where I work. Never been here till recently and it makes me want to go back. One reason this didnt get 5 stars is because my burger tasted bitter with avacado so Ill just make sure i wont include that anymore!"
4/30/2014,2 star rating,This place used to kick ass. The last visit wasn't great:1. 'Burgers are cooked medium' - please ask if you require something different. Medium would have been fine - unfortunately mine was charred black and VERY dry as a result. 2. When I asked for garlic wings (for the kids) it was pretty annoying to find that you'd given me buffalo (hot as hell)3. Fries were soggy. Honestly I don't like giving a bad review but this just wasn't good enough. I think I'll be going to Five Guys next time.
10/27/2014,1 star rating,The absolute worst service I have ever had. The two times I have ordered from Burger Point I waited a total of 60 mins. My most recent occurrence was when I placed an order for pick up at 6:45. Purposely showed up at 7:07 and was told it would be another few minutes. I am not one to show emotion but I completely called out the whole staff in front of other customers. I do not regret it. And what is even more appalling is there was no apology or remorse for their terrible service. I will never bring back my money to Burger Point and encourage others not to either.
5/30/2013,5 star rating,"Everything I've had here is just delish! I'm on the pickier side so I always create my own burgers. Fries are nothing special but I am in love with their potato spiral on a stick. I recently just tried their beef chili and it was perfect. Spicy and chunky. YUM!Burger Point is pricey, but definitely worth it."
10/15/2012,2 star rating,"High expectations, sadly disappointed.My boyfriend and I tried this place out over the weekend.  He loves good hamburgers and I was excited that I found a new place for us to try. Well first off, you order your food on a Ipad. I liked how you could see all the options and toppings to add to your burger. Well he didn't and got frustrated so I had to help him out. I thought it was cool that they offered Velvetta as a choice for cheese. They offered a lot of great toppings and additions. However the wait was extremely long and they weren't even crowded.  Then when our order was up the food wasn't even hot.  That's what ticked me off the most, if i'm waiting forever I expect piping hot food!!! We also tried the cheese fries, which were just ok. So 2 mediocre burgers, fries and sodas cost us $35. I would have much rather went to Smash burger and paid at least $10 less for much better hot food."
1/14/2015,2 star rating,"Something's changed here... And it's not for the positive, unfortunately.  We've been coming here since they opened but while I believe the quality is still there and they finally added vinegar on the tables for the fries (yay!), the burgers have lost their juicy quality. They have become super dry with little flavor and prepared with no toasted bun. In addition, their fries are average, almost limp. So now the overpriced Burger Pointe experience is no longer worth the money."
1/30/2015,1 star rating,The burgers are great but.... the delivery is just terrible!!! I ordered using the burger point app (ordersnap). The estimated delivery was about an hour. It took me two calls and burger point over two hours and 15 min. to delivery my burgers!!! Never again!!!!
8/31/2015,3 star rating,So so service.  We tried to ask to see what burgers were popular and the girl taking our order seemed annoyed.  Food came out pretty fast. Burger was pretty good.  Fries were amazing.
7/10/2012,1 star rating,"Wow. My boyfriend and I moved to the South Loop a few months ago and have loved trying out a the awesome spots for food around. We walked in the the Burger Point, and it looks like your average burger joint. We look at the menu, and it looks like it has a pretty good selection. We order 2 burger ""meals""...$30 for burgers and fries in a place without a whole lot of atmosphere? These have better be darn good burgers..grass fed beef or not.Well, the burgers came, and I was NOT impressed. To say the least. The fries were extremely thin cut and fried to the point of crusty oily mess. As I ate them, all I tasted was the grease, no potato flavor to be found. My burger...I got the Crunchy Burger. Why weren't the potato chips even crunchy? They were soggy by the time the burger was handed to us. You know what was crunchy? The 4 pieces of cartilage I found in my burger. They brag that they ground the meat each morning. My question is, what are they grounding? Whole chunks of animal with the bone and cartilage included? I can find the same quality at any other burger joint in Chicago for half the price, hold the cartilage. I guarantee they'd have better fries as well."
2/7/2012,1 star rating,"After re-experiencing burger point for a second time, I still was not impressed.  I was really disappointed by the quality of the fries...slightly soggy and needed lots of salt, and again, the price tag did not match the quality of the food we received.  Their burgers are good and the meat is yummy, but the $20 price tag for 2 also keeps me from going back."
10/28/2011,3 star rating,"Finally visited the long hyped Burger Point for take out dinner.  It was good, but I wasn't amazed.  The burgers were good, and a decent size, but came at a steep price tag.  Two burgers and fries were $20!!!  The burgers were good but I was not a fan of the skimpy, tiny fries.Like everyone else said, they still have a few kinks to work out...electronic ordering isn't up yet and there's no plain cheeseburger on the menu.  Their official opening is on the 4th."
12/8/2012,2 star rating,"I heard rumors that a great burger place was opening up at ""the point"" of State and Archer... and I had to check it out.  I thought to myself ""finally a burger place on the South Side of Chicago.""  Unfortunately, after trying the food... I realized we still DON'T have a great burger place on the south side.  Some of the menu items we tried were awful. In fact, they may be some of the all-time worst food decisions I have made.  From bland to oily, the food was never that impressive.  The ordering system seems like a great idea and somewhat ""futuristic"" but all I could observe was a congested counter with a longer line than necessary and an unused, confusing iPad system.  Overall, this barely made it to a 2 mile rating.  It was saved by a tasty chili and some decent wings.  I probably won't be back unless the restaurant can convince me to give it another try."
11/9/2013,4 star rating,"Make sure to read my previous review because I still think this place is awesome.  For the update I'm still giving them 4 stars, but I have to say the food here can get sloooooow at times.  How long can it possibly take to cook a medium rare 6oz burger?  We've been waiting so long now (over 30min) that you would think the burger would be a charcoal briquette at this point!"
10/22/2013,4 star rating,"I'm really surprised that this spot hasn't made it onto more of the ""burger"" lists in Chicago.  They use what is arguably the best meat in the city, a variety of great buns, and you can customize your burger almost any way you like.  The sides are also pretty good and the spicy ketchup and vinegar for the fries is a nice touch.  The only issue I've had here is the fact that they don't get the meat temperature right the first time.  I always order my burger medium-rare and half of the time it comes out medium well or even well.  The customer service is great though and they are always willing to re-make the burger so you are happy with it.  If it wasn't for that issue, it would be my favorite burger place in the city!My favorite is the ""Burger Point"" with a side of cheese fries.  Can't beat a great burger, bacon, a fried egg, and come chile peppers on a pretzel roll!"
4/27/2014,4 star rating,2nd time here. Ordered the 9oz burger last time going with the 6oz this trip on pretzel bun with 5yr aged cheddar and done cheese fries. Burgers are delicious and made fresh to order. Fry portions are big too. I'll come back again next time I'm craving a burger.
10/29/2011,2 star rating,"The burger was really good, the fries were just a touch too salty for perfection, but overall delicious. It was a little pricier than standard fast food, but on par with a burger botique - $13 for fries, a burger, and a drink. I would, however, recommend take-out... the ""hip music"" is obnoxious and loud. It's difficult to converse, much less hear yourself think - evidently being a burger joint isn't enough, they want to be the South Loop's trendy new club. A- for food, B for service, D+ for experience."
2/14/2016,5 star rating,"Thee best burger I have had in my life. I wish I had taken a picture to submit. I ordered the the sampler where I selected grass fed beef, original mild buffalo wings (you get 3) and the order came with fries and a drink all for $12.99. The burger was juicy, non greasy and flavorful, toppings were plenty and I did not get the grassy, gamey taste. Everything was fresh and ready in a short amount of time and the wings are delicious. I got to meet the president/co owner Michael Strotter who took our order and explained everything so patiently and clearly as this was my first time there. Do yourself a favor and Try this place out, you won't be disappointed! Check the rear for free parking spots before parking on the street."
4/8/2013,5 star rating,"This place is great! At first we thought the prices were a little steep, but once we got our food we knew why..and it was totally worth it! Everything was so fresh and we loved that the beef is hormone free, free range, etc. I also must add that the veggie burger was phenomenal - by far the best I've ever had!!! The red velvet cupcake was also excellent! And as if it couldn't get any better, this place is BYOB! So nice to have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood - we'll definitely be back!!"
4/2/2013,4 star rating,"When this place first opened up, I was super excited. I would rate their burgers similar to DMK.  Burger point is not really a bar setting. The best part about Burger Point is that it is BYOB! Holla!!!!! Great food, BYOB, what's not to like? I give this place 4 stars and not 5 because I wish they had outdoor seating."
5/10/2012,5 star rating,"The BEST veggie burger I've ever had, PERIOD!  You've got to get the way THEY make it!  I've been a vegetarian for years and this is a flavor that you cannot beat!  I live in the area and many businesses were in that spot, but THIS will be around forever!  Every friend/family member I bought there just loves it!  It ain't the cheapest burger out there, but it's the best!!"
2/19/2012,3 star rating,"I'm really not that adventurous when it comes to burgers seeing as though I don't eat beef.  So I opted for a standard turkey burger with swiss cheese and fries.  The place had just opened not long before I visited so I hope that was the reason the heat wasn't pumping in the place!  It's not that pleasant trying to eat your food while shivering in your seat but hey all in the name of food right??  Anyway, the burger and fries were tasty but not the best I've eaten in the city.  The fries could have been a little bit larger than shoestrings but that's not a deal breaker.  Overall, great little local burger joint or should I say burger point."
10/27/2011,4 star rating,"I have been waiting for some time now for this place to open and it was great! Still some kinks to work out, but other than that I was really surprised about how good everything was. The burger was delicious and you could tell they use high quality meat, not frozen. The bun may be a little to ""bready"" for my likings, but it was sturdy and held the entire thing together. I loved the fact that the thing was dressed with around 3 slices of cheese, but the only reason I could tell was because it wasn't fully melted onto the burger, but hey I'm sure they will work these things out as they go.I like to say I am a buffalo wing connoisseur, and I admit that I am picky about them. I also got the hot garlic and was blown away by the flavor. They were crispy just the way I like them, and the sauce was absolutely delicious. I am so happy this place opened so close to me, no more settling for tasteless wings and sub-par burgers at some other local places.I will definitely become a usual here and am really excited to try some of their other items. Great Job, keep up the good work!"
4/14/2013,2 star rating,"It's two stars purely for the fact on my classic burger I only got bacon on here...without the grassfed burger!!!!  Where's my actual burger??  It's good, but eat it there to double check your food.  Fries are meh.  Burger and wings are good.  I'm pretty PO'd right now cause I just drove home and I'm not driving back to wait another 30 minutes for my burger (Pretty busy and made to order...supposedly.)"
4/8/2013,4 star rating,"Grass fed is good. Tried ""The Capone"" based on watching piece on ""Chicago's Best"" last night. It is basically a caprese salad (sundried tomatoes, basil, mozzarella cheese with balsamic vinegar dressing) packed INSIDE two burger patties melded into one, then topped with fried basil leaves. Excellent idea and execution and nowhere near as messy as it sounds. Yes, it took a while to make, cook and serve and, yes, it wasn't cheap at $11.75 but quality costs and takes time. Veggie chili with tofu was OK. Didn't try the fries."
1/11/2014,1 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place- smelled sooo good when we came in. Sadly our burgers were soooo dry. What a waste of the grass fed beef- if you are going to over cook a burger, why use good beef? This was our first time there, so didn't know about the burger of the month- wish I did because I would have gone with the Saigon chicken burger :/ I didn't see or taste any sea salt on our fries. Now the wings- those were really good. The price point for dry over cooked burgers is outrageous! Might want to consider calling it The Wing Point because those blew the burgers away!"
10/18/2012,2 star rating,"Way over priced for what you get. Plain and simple. Horrible tasting? No, that's why I didn't give one star, but the price doesn't come close to what you get."
10/2/2012,5 star rating,"Best burger in chicago. Just went yesterday had the ashman burger and it was delicious. If you love animal style burgers at In and Out on the west coast you will love this one cause it's so much better. Meat and toppings were fresh, they are very generous with the cheese, bread was fresh. Overall much,much better than Five Guys, Epic, and M burger."
3/5/2014,4 star rating,"Great Burgers, I stumbled into this place after my car broke down and had to wait for AAA. My only complaint was that the fries to forever to the point where they arrived after I was already finishing my meal. It would also be better if this place expanded their delivery area as I would order pretty frequently."
1/5/2013,4 star rating,"I was very happy with my visit to ""The Burger Point."" I had the ""Blue Harvest"" burger. it was tasty, hot, and juicy. I also had an order of wings and a spiral potato stick. The wings were very good size and the sauce was ""original"" and had a bit of a bite. The Potato sticks were seasoned with sea salt and were very good. The atmosphere was a little cramped,  but no more than most places of this ilk. The restaurant was clean, the staff was prompt and friendly. It was  moderately priced for this type of food. It is definitely a place I will return to."
10/26/2011,5 star rating,"they are still at the soft opening stage and a bit disorganized behind the counter but the burger and fries I had today at lunch was really excellent, the staff was super friendly and the decor hip and casual. All in all a great addition to the South Loop"
5/12/2012,1 star rating,The website says open until 11 on Saturdays. I drove 25 minutes out of my way and got there before 10:30. Even though the place was packed with people they told me they were closed. The chairs were already up on the table...?? Location was crappy...there were open crates of jalapeños sitting on the flood... I wasted so much time trying to get to burger point... Way to mess up my night! There are so many other options for gourmet burgers in Chicago. Skip this one!
8/4/2012,2 star rating,"Every time I write a review, I look at all the Pros and the Cons.  I also take into consideration the price.  I went to get a burger and I was so excited until I saw the prices.  This might be the most I have ever spent on a burger before.  $15 for a burger, fries, and a drink, WOW.  I ordered #1, the Burger Pointe Burger and it was good, but thats about it.   I think it lacked a little flavor and would rather get the Poag Mahones gourmet burger instead. The fries were good as well, but I still can not get over the price.  Next time Ill save $6 and head over to Five Guys."
5/7/2013,3 star rating,"I went the next day after they appear on Chicago Best. I had order a #1 and thy gave me a #4. I waited for 35 minutes. So I didn't want to argue the mistake. I couldn't believe how small the burgers were. Fries were way to salty. I will go back to this place but only for a burger. There is no half star, otherwise I would have put 2.5 stars."
11/11/2011,4 star rating,"Although the wait for our food was a bit long for a burger joint, the wait was definitely worth it! The New American Burger is a great combination of flavor. Our table shared wings and fries - stick with the Russet fries and the BBQ wings are a better choice than their standard hot wings."
2/15/2012,5 star rating,"Finally a gourmet-ish burger place in the SoLo! We usually would roll up north to Kumas when we craved fancy burgers (the wait is definitely worth it), but it was always such a production. BP has a ton of options for burgers (cheddar burger with everything w/ a fried egg on top on a pretzel bun please), decent sides (those kettle chips are GOOD!), and decent wings as well. Definitely a huge plus for the neighborhood. Oh and its BYOB!"
1/15/2013,4 star rating,Lots of delicious choices to make. The free range/organic meat and vegetarian options sold it. Will definitely be going back!
2/7/2012,5 star rating,"Love the burgers and wings at Burger Point.  I live across the street, so I don't know anything about Kristen's complaint, except that her issue is something she should take up with the management of Pointe 1900 and the owner of Burger Point, rather than not-so-subtly implying on Yelp that there are sanitation issues with the business.  Burger Point is a welcome addition to the block."
7/3/2013,5 star rating,"I visit here at least twice a week...it is right around the corner from my work.  I have yet to get a burger I don't like.  Still working my way down the menu.  I will for sure continue to visit, even though my office is moving to the North side...still feel it is worth the trip at least every few weeks."
1/5/2013,2 star rating,"I'm not really sure what happened but me and my friends decided to stop here to grab take out before meeting others on New years eve. The set up was confusing for us as we were all first timers, they had ipads set up and I guess we didn't exactly read the directions and just ordered on the ipads. Assuming the ipad would transmit the order into the kitchen. Now I did hold the printed ticket and walked up to the counter but nobody came over to ask ""Can I help you"" so we proceeded to sit down and we waited... and we waited... and we waited... 25-30 minutes later a lady comes out from behind and says ""Okay ladies I have your food ready"" so we walk up and she starts listing all these things and we look at each other....""did you order that? I thought we only have 1 fry not 3"" Yeah that's not our order. Then the lady tells us our order didn't get placed with the kitchen yet, they needed our print out slips.. well why didn't anyone tell us for the last 30 minutes we were waiting here?!? okay well then we get that settled and we sit back down for another 10 minutes while they make our burgers and sweet potato fries. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries, I just love them. Seriously, I've never had someone mess up sweet potato fries so much,  not even Burger King. Our fries were not only burnt, all mushed up together, and soggy by the time we ate them which was only about 5-10 minutes later. Worst sweet potato fries ever. We waited for so long, I wouldn't have minded if they just made me wait a few minutes more since they completely burnt our batch of fries. The burger was okay.. but I think I would have preferred a burger king or McD burger over theirs. The new american I got, the bun was cold and hard. Patty was burnt and didn't have any flavoring to it."
3/27/2012,2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place because I live in the south loop. Unfortunatley the chicken burger I ordered, forget the name but it had a fried egg, avocado, bacon, and american cheese on it, was really bland. I feel like although they added a crap load of  ingredients to the burger, it lacked the kick and flavor it needed. My boyfriend got the veggie burger and it was very soft and almost mushy (ew). I may try this place again and just get a turkey burger the way I LIKE IT: PICKLES, ONIONS, AND RANCH!  minus the fancy stuff"
11/5/2011,3 star rating,"My boyfriend lives in this area, which has primarily asian restaurants (Chinatown is a block away).  We crave burgers fairly regularly so we were incredibly excited when we spotted this new burger place as we were driving by one night.  We decided today after work that tonight was the night to finally try out the Burger Point.  I was disappointed.I didn't really know what to expect of this restaurant when we drove by intially. Will it be your local burger joint with decent burgers but also decent prices? Or will it be one of those gourmet burget places with gourmet prices to match?  Well, the decor was that of your local burger joint on the corner - brightly lit, fairly simple decor, 2 flat screen tvs, and the kitchen in clear view.  (Think five guys-ish).  The prices, however, were that of a gourmet burger place.  I built my own burger and went with 1. Hamburger 2. Brie 3. Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo 4. Fried Egg and I think it came out to be about $9.  I know what you're thinking, $9 isn't that much, but let's get into the quality:- Meat was overcooked and not particularly flavorful.  I know hamburger meat in general are not supposed to be quality meat, per se, but usually for $9 you get better than the standard.- Brie (1.00) was a nice option, but there weren't very many pieces on the burger- Bun was nicely toasted and fresh, so no complaints thereOverall, the burger was really just ""ok"" and not worth the price that they are charging. A sidenote: we went around 7 PM on a Friday night and it took 40 minutes to get our burgers.  It is a brand new restaurant so I can't ding them for that (it was clear they were still training people and standardizing some of their processes), but thought I'd give fair warning that there may be a wait if you go during a busy time of the day."
12/2/2012,4 star rating,"This place is pretty swanky for a fast food establishment. It's clean and the food is fresh and delicious. The fact that they serve grass fed beef is even better. We had a burger, fries and hot wings all very good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the guy at the register wasn't very nice. He wasn't mean, but just didn't go out of his way to be nice either. I guess I am used to the sappy ppl at Starbucks and expect everyone to be overly cheery. Anywho, glad I found this place and will be back."
3/5/2015,2 star rating,"I like that the meat is local and grass-fed and the options they offer to put on the burger. But it ends there. The people and service are unfriendly and they need to do a better job of building loyal customers. They screwed up my pickup order and instead of trying to make it right when I called they told me the person who made the order wasn't there to verify if I was lying or not.  He said the best he could do was give me a $5 credit for a $10 burger that was inedible (it had bacon and I don't eat pork).  For a loyal customer, you'd think he'd just say sure and offered a free burger the next time I come in. But, as my husband pointed out the people who work there aren't very friendly in general so I shouldn't be too surprised, I suppose."
8/13/2012,3 star rating,"Ok first things first the burgers are good!! However they service sucks!! U can't have a fast food vibe and 1) be super slow.2) a bit pricey (this is for all the tail end of the loop, like 2 steps from Chinatown) 3) have your front end lacking PRAGMATICS!!! This dude had to have rode the short bus.. Total lacking social skills.  Only reason I keep coming back is because of the food.."
2/7/2012,4 star rating,The Burger Point is fantastic.  Really excited to have another great place to eat at in the South Loop!  Great food and super friendly staff.
2/7/2012,5 star rating,"The Burger Point is THEE place to go to if you want a delicious new twist to the usual burger! Plus, its a great atmosphere, the staff and everyone are soo welcoming! Theres no place like this in the city! Definitely 5 stars!!"
4/13/2012,5 star rating,Great burgers (both chicken and beef) and fries. I recommend The Buffalo - bleu cheese relish is ridiculous. Great service too.
2/20/2013,1 star rating,This place was disappointing after I was excited to try a new place in my neighborhood. First we walked in and there were a total of 3 customers in the restaurant and we stood there while we were ignored nobody that worked there said hello can I take your order. Weird vibe and the burger was not that good and the meat  had no seasoning and it was not cooked at the wellness I liked. Skip this place and spend your money else where.
12/3/2011,4 star rating,"Great burgers, fries too salty, they need to address this. Had the sweet potato fries on a second go round and these were an improvement. There is a bit of a wait (approx. 10 mins) as they cook to order but the wait is well worth it for the burger. Great addition though to the south loop."
10/30/2011,4 star rating,"Enjoyed my first experience at the Burger Point today. I have been waiting for this place to open for quite some time. Those who live south of Roosevelt know that there aren't a ton of quick food options. I gladly give this place a 4/5, with a strong possibility of upgrading in the future. My burger (#7) was tasty and a decent size for the price that we paid. However, the burger was not as good as what one gets when they go to Epic Burger.I agree with the other posters in my thoughts about the fries. Is there a skinny fry revolution that I'm not aware of? The thin fries lack taste and tend to be a little rubbery. Looking forward to my next visit."
11/29/2011,4 star rating,"Well, I decided to check out this new place and I loved it. I waited about 10 minutes and the place was pretty crowded. I ordered a burger with aged cheddar and mushrooms on the plain bun. My only complaint is that I had so much bun left over. I felt like I was eating this amazing burger and then without warning it was gone. They need to pump up the burger or cut down the bun to provide better burger/ bun balance. I'll go back."
4/4/2012,4 star rating,You can frequently find me here chomping away on the crunchy burger w French onion dip on a pretzel roll. They have plenty of options to satisfy the pickiest eater. Fries at first needed a little work but as a loyal customer who has last ate here yesterday their fries are on track so give em another try. As for the potato chip spiral you can't go wrong there and free refills.
7/23/2012,5 star rating,"Me gusta. Pretzel roll, check, great service, check, Ginger ale on the soda fountain, whaaaaat!!  Fries the way I prefer them, thin and crispy, burger always tastes great. When I pick up dog food at soggy paws, rarely can I resist stopping in."
11/24/2011,5 star rating,I love a good veggie burger but so many places just give you a pre-made frozen patty but not Burger Point! Their veggie burger is clearly hand made- with vegetables you can recognize. If their veggie burger is this good I can't wait to try a burger with meat!
3/3/2012,4 star rating,"so there we were ... looking for a burger place in the south loop and stumbled across the Burger Point.  It was delicious, the dirty south and shroom burgers were scrumptious and the freshly cut potatoes were perfectly thin.  We are definitely adding the Burger Point to our ""short"" list of places to grab a GREAT burger.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
3/10/2013,2 star rating,Have yet to get an order of sweet potato fries that weren't soggy and greasy. Not sure who wrote on here that they had a great vegi burger because mine was DISGUSTING. It was like potato hash in party form. Completely fell apart. Service is usually unfriendly bordering on rude. Go to epic burger instead.
10/20/2012,3 star rating,"Service was good; my girlfriend received her blue cheese burger very rare (asked for medium well) but the manager was quick to apologize and remake the burger.  I didn't particularly like the burgers but I may not be the best to listen to because I always think grass-fed burgers taste weird, like a little mushy and without near the flavor as traditional beef burgers.  The restaurant was cleverly designed and the decor was good, no complaints there.  I don't think I'll be back but if you're in to organic and grass-fed burgers then this seems to be a good place."
8/14/2012,3 star rating,"The burger at this place is interesting. Interesting flavor and combo combination. In addition, their pretzel bread is definitely different from most places. The following are what I had here:The Burger Point Signature burgerWingsPotato FriesSweet Potato friesI have to say. Overall, I am just ok with the burger as the signature burger's chili blew out my palate and I'm not feeling the pretzel bread. The wings are a bit on the dry side. The best thing I had is their potato fries, which I can taste the freshness of the potato. All in all. My experience is only ok. Perhaps I'll try another burger from there and hopefully I'll have a better experience."
12/8/2014,1 star rating,"I've given this place quite a few chances, and have been left disappointed each time. The prices are obscene. $12.99 for a double cheeseburger? Without fries and a drink? What a joke. And for that price, it better be the best burger I've ever had. Sadly, it's terrible. Dry, bland, and without proper arrangement. Who puts lettuce and tomato below the patty? Burger point! If you're in the mood for an expensive burger, 5 Guys does a much better job."
5/20/2012,4 star rating,"Burgers are delicious, fries not so much. The regular fries are fine, but avoid sweet potato fries! The place also seems like it might have an identity crisis. There's some sort of flower motif going on, and then there is techno music, sports on the TV, and this little area with chairs and magazines. Is it a diner? Is it a salon? Anyway, I had to bump up my rating to 4 stars because I recently tried the Ashman. I think they should change the name of this burger to ""Suck it, In-N-Out."" Enough said."
8/5/2012,1 star rating,We waited over 35 minutes for 2 burgers and two orders of fries. My burger was a hockey puck filled with gristle. I would have expected a grass fed burger joint to have better quality meat. Not planning on ever going back.
6/6/2015,4 star rating,Come here for the pretzel rolls and sweet potato fries. Fresh ingredients and great hamburgers.
3/30/2012,4 star rating,"I stopped in the Burger Joint today for lunch and WOW what an experience! I tried the classic burger it was the best burger I've had in years. It was very satisfying to the taste buds. Everything was fresh. The decor is neat, clean and eye-appealing.The service is exceptionally fast for made to order service. I will never eat another BK or McD's burger again. Once you have tasted a burger from Burger Point all other burger resturants are pointless! LOL"
11/21/2011,3 star rating,"Did you know? Burger Point is a brand new restaurant offering different mixes of burger toppings/sauces/breads.  We came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed... with people with no food!  I looked across the tables and saw that no one had anything on their tables besides their fountain drinks.  I hesitated, but still decided to order.  I wanted the curly fries, but they were all sold out.  So, alright, i picked something else, paid for my order, and the guy told me it was a 30 minute wait.  The time surprisingly went by quick since we went to grab drinks at another place.  However, when we returned, our orders were packed into to-go boxes and ready at the counter.  Seeing that there were no tables open, we went home to eat our food.  After opening up the boxes, we were quite disappointed.  My burger with bacon, avocado, and egg was enormous -- but poorly seasoned.  My friends' burgers were small (like the size of your fist) -- but also poorly seasoned.  They messed up my fry order with regular fries rather than sweet potato fries.  Everything was just blah.  Small, flavorless, and pricy.  I really wanted to like to this restaurant.  It's a great location, great idea, but poor execution.   It was edible, but I wont be back again."
12/4/2011,3 star rating,"I had ordered a hamburger with American Cheese, pretzel bun, bacon, and BBQ sauce.  Everything was satisfactory except the beef patty. Build your own burger places are cool, but when the beef patty is on the slim side, its enough to make you go, WHYYYYYYYY?  The fries are shoe string fries. I am not a fan of skinny soggy fries. I prefer my fries to have a good thickness and crispness to them."
11/8/2011,4 star rating,"A welcome addition to the neighborhood. It's so nice have  gourmet burger spot  around the corner from home....this could be dangerous! I was in a hurry and was in the mood for a normal burger so I made my own. The cheese and regular toppings combine with the pretzel roll made a great burger. The burger isn't huge but definitely isn't small, I think it's the perfect size. The only critic is that the sweet potato fries could be cooked a little bit longer, but still delicious!"
12/18/2011,4 star rating,"Lots of pros & a few cons to this burger joint in SoLo.  The place is crisp & clean with a hint of hipster.  The menu is simple but not typical.  After eating my burger all I could think about was coming back to try another flavor.  Expect to wait at least 15 min for your burger as they are prepared.  They claim farm to table, grass fed burgers which is appealing to me.  I would like my burger a little rarer than I got.  I'm not sure if it's available that way or if they cook them all that way.  Also the bun is a little beefier than the burger but still decent sized.  The staff was friendly & the burger was delish.  I ordered up a side of sweet potato fries & a drink for a grand total of about $11 bucks.  For a burger that definitely North of average it's worth a trip."
5/4/2015,2 star rating,"We are long time customers, the burgers are pretty good but we won't be going back. The last two visits I pre-ordered on line only to arrive and still experience a long wait time. This past visit they stated my order was coming right up but I still waited 25 minutes for a pre-order. During my long wait I observed how the gentleman treated customers in person and on the phone and their customer service is deplorable. He argues with customers, doesn't apologize when orders are wrong and the wait time is awful."
11/13/2011,4 star rating,I'm from the west coast and I have to say that The Ashman Burger at Burger Point is the closest thing to a double-double from In-n-Out. The quality is better here since its all grass-fed beef freshly ground on site and the bun was pillowy soft and fresh-baked. The fries were meh. Definitely will go back.
12/3/2011,4 star rating,"Ordered a meal to go:SPANISH REVOLUTION BURGER - with the jalapeno relish (not spicy), pepperjack and american cheese, and ranch mayo on a brioche roll.  Added a small fry and drink.  Burger was great...meat slightly overcooked and the bottom bun was soggy.  FRIES are great - skinny salty and yum - would enjoy a little crispier.  I wonder if my burger bun and fries were a little soggy just b/c we ordered it to go and it was in the closed container for about 10 minutes before eating it.Also had HOT GARLIC WINGS.  Big fatty juicy wings - flavor reminiscent of my all-time favorite BW3's spicy garlic wings, but these were bigger and a little less saucy.  Definitely enjoyed them and loved it!Not the best burgers, but certainly still very flavorful and awesome.  Will definitely go back here again to try another tasty burger with fries and the wings!"
12/28/2011,3 star rating,"I am following the business that come and go in this location.  I hope this one stays.  The burgers are very tasty, fresh and grass fed beef lean.  But you can put bacon and eggs and other not so healthy things on top.  Nice fries with sea salt and sweet potato fries too.  Free and tight parking in the back is a bonus.  Ambiance is plain and well lit.  Lastly, a bit costly but you are paying for a gourmet burger in the south loop."
1/18/2012,4 star rating,"Wow. Great burgers, great service and BYOB! Place serves high quality, grass fed burgers that they mold on site. Only takes about 10 min to get your food. We were there around 830 on a Tuesday and was not very busy at that time (they close at 9). They did not rush us at all and the guy that took our order was very nice and he came to see if we were enjoying our burger (he knew it was our first time). He was probably a regular employee but had the poise of a good manager. I thought burgers were very very good. My friend had the veggie burger which I usually stay away from. I tried it and it was awesome. We spent $26 for two burgers, 2 drinks, potato chips, and a delicious cupcake. I spent $22 at 5 guys the other day and no cupcake and burgers way better at The Burger Point. This is really a 4.5 star place. I don't give out 5 stars easily. Enjoy!"
5/20/2012,3 star rating,"How could a place with such good burgers have such terrible customer service? Specifically, the short, chubby African American woman who tries to talk like she's educated.  Went here for a bite to eat and the food was good, one of the better burgers I've had in a while.  Easily 4 stars had it not been for the lousy customer service."
10/17/2012,3 star rating,"Went here last night and have had carry out from here before.  While the burgers are fantastic, they are overpriced (understandable since they have to pay all that money for their fancy free range beef...don't care).  The only issue that I have is their iPad ordering system.  I work in the tech field and there are points that I feel that it's gotten too far.  One iPad wasn't working and the guy reset it, the other two would time out the second that we placed the order.  The guy at the counter seemed semi-miffed that he had to take our order by hand instead of the fancy iPad's.  That could be another reason that the burgers cost so much....gotta make up for the $1500 in their non-working ordering system.  Regardless, try the burgers (just call in instead), they're great."
1/29/2014,1 star rating,"Horrible service- not friendly at all, I will not come back to this place, food is way too expensive for what you get I would've enjoyed more a burger from Wendy's"
8/18/2012,4 star rating,"I overall like the place.  It does take a while to get your food, so if you're at a meter pay for at least an hour.  The ordering process was kind of confusing for first timers and I am pretty tech savy.  I ordered the turkey burger and it was ok.  It didn't have enough seasoning or something for me.  The fries were AWESOME! My boyfriend had a burger w/ an egg on it and his was pretty good.  So I will go back and try a beef burger which looked more appetizing to me as well.  If anything just go for the fries, and I will definitely try the wings next time too."
8/12/2012,5 star rating,"If you are looking for a great burger in the south loop and don't feel like the bar scene at Reggie's, this is the place - not sure where the 2 stars reviewers are coming from but they must not eat meat!  Burger Point burgers are handmade and worth the extra cost because they are healthier and more humane.  The toppings are superfresh and fries are handcut and hot and crispy.  I've never had a slow service experience, but we tend to go on off hours . . . a strategy that works well in almost any restaurant, i've found!"
2/11/2015,5 star rating,This is the best place I have found that serves farm fresh burgers in Chicago.  Creative burger choices cooked well.  Great fries too! Been here dozens of times and will continue to go!!
2/19/2012,5 star rating,"The world needs more places like The Burger Point, and I'm just happy it opened up near the south loop.  Happy and sustainable ingredients, supporting family farms, The Burger Point puts out unique, creative and absolutely yummy food -- and due to the fact that they don't support the horrific conditions happening in the industrial food machine -- you can taste the difference.  The burgers are amazing.  Best in the city.  I wanted to eat the little piece of paper wrapped around my ""Burger Point Burger"" (with fresh green chilies, bacon, fried egg topper), and then lick the box.  Can't wait to go back.  A must try for great food you can actually feel good about eating, free WiFi, and BYOB!!!!!"

1/16/2013,4 star rating,"The russet fries with sea salt are extremely mouthwatering. My fav is the Crunchy Burger (american cheese, fresh potato chips, french onion, potato roll) or the Dirty South (aged cheddar, bacon, bbq sauce, pretzel roll.) I think the quality of the food is wonderful. Their tasty creations can become addicting once you find your special burger. It's modern, comfortable, and satisfyyyyyying. They need delivery."
1/10/2013,5 star rating,"I come here all the time, and I'm never disappointed!!! All of their food is amazing. I've never had a burger that tasted so fresh and delicious. I love cheese fries and this is the best place to get them. Also the staff is SUPER NICE. The service towards the customers is phenomenal. I've tried many burger places and this is by far my FAVORITE!"
10/31/2013,2 star rating,"I had the ""Drunken Granny"" burger with the regular fries with sea salt.   This was quite possibly the driest beef that I have ever eaten.  I hate adding anything to a burger other than what comes on them from the kitchen, but I had to slather ketchup all over this one just to get half of it down. The fries were pretty good though.   Maybe it was just an off night. I'd probably still give them another chance."
8/30/2014,5 star rating,Stopped by today and had one of the best burgers ever! The meat was so fresh not those frozen patties some places sell. The fries with their ketchup were really good. I forgot to ask if they sell the ketchup. Oh well...guess I'll have to go back lol
11/22/2011,2 star rating,"I was so excited to try this place, but once I did, I was a little disappointed. The burgers were okay, but nothing that blew me away. The burgers were actually smaller than the bun and not that big considering how much they cost. The ""large"" fries weren't enough to share for two, even though the guy at the counter said it would be more than enough. We hoped for better, but felt ripped off for mediocre burgers/fries."
11/28/2011,5 star rating,"I was excited to find out that a burger joint was opening up by my apartment. I decided to check it out this weekend with my girlfriend. It was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised on the caliber of burger we got. I had an egg on mine, and it was cooked perfectly. The fries were also great. I  plan on coming back. I'm curious to find out how the wings and chili are next. Definitely go to the Burger Point."
2/6/2012,5 star rating,"I've been really pleased every time I've been to The Burger Point.  The people there are friendly and the restaurant is always nice and clean on the inside.  With a couple of flat panel TVs mounted, it's an easy place to grab a burger while catching part of a game.  The food is made with premium ingredients--grass fed beef, no preservatives, etc.--and it tastes fresh.  You have the ability to pick from at least a dozen tried-and-true combinations--my favorite has become the New American Burger, a cheeseburger with fried egg, avocado and wasabi mayo on a pretzel roll--or build your own exactly as you like it.  They have pretty good chili, wings and fries as well, along with good vegetarian options.  All in all a great addition to the South Loop."
2/8/2012,5 star rating,"I really wanted to like Kirsten A.'s review of Burger Point. It was OK, but after this, I will never take anything she writes seriously again. As a fellow Chicagoan, I have had the pleasure of experiencing the amazing, freshly-made burgers (and ketchup chips! and cheeseburger eggrolls! and wings! and fries!) that the Burger Point has to offer on a regular basis.And I appreciate not only the deliciousness that is each dish they serve, but the care and respect that they exhibit to each customer that walks through their doors. Boo, Kristen A. -find another hobby!Everyone else, come to Burger Point for amazing food! P.S. BURGER POINT = DEEEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3/1/2012,5 star rating,Ah-Ma-Zing burgers and fries. Had #5- New American. Super Tasty!
4/21/2012,4 star rating,"My wife and I really like this place since finding it earlier this year. Wait's not too bad, there's TVs, and the burgers are tasty and have good buns that actually hold together. Big fan of the fried egg on the cheeseburger, but don't order this one if it's really busy there since you run the risk of them overcooking it. Without the runny egg, it's not the same. My one piece of advice for them is actually my wife's suggestion: they should try to improve their sweet potato fries. They're soggy and probably need to be fried, allowed to sit, then fried again. At least, that's how we like them. It's been a few weeks since we went, so perhaps they've fixed their fries based on other Yelp reviews. If I had to guess, the quality goes down when they're busy. Catch them at their best when it's less busy."
9/14/2014,4 star rating,"Overall excellent. It's true they need a few more minutes to make your custom order but duh, totally worth it. Nice choices on the menu. They have this awesome spicy ketchup that is a real treat. If you like burgers you will be glad you tried it and you will go back."

3/6/2012,5 star rating,"So the south loop has a couple places that have the reputation for making a good burger (Hackney's and Epic).  Ya' all need to move a side for Burger Point.  I've had the turkey and the hamburger there.  FYI try the pretzel roll, if such a things interest you.  Great place."
11/9/2013,1 star rating,"I've been going to TBP ever since I saw them on Chicago's Best. My first few experiences were great from the food to the customer service. There was a beautiful lady (Asian Indian I think) who took our order. She walked us through the menu, gave recommendations and made it an all around great experience. But since the summer I've noticed TBP has taken a turn for the worse, with HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE by two grumpy guys and a different girl who all act like the Grinch who stole Christmas. And by God don't tell them that they got something wrong with your order!  While I NEVER see them address any of their customers with regard, they do seem to have the time to chase down kids from the Perspective Charter school across the street because they walked by and meshed their face to TBP window... The two guys suddenly got lively as they banded together and RUSHED outside to chase down the ""hoodlums.""And why do they not have a point of sales system YET? The calculator. Really?It grosses me out that the fries are prepped and left for public meddling when you enter through the back door. Moreover, I'm completely grossed out by the bald guy who openly changes his filthy shoes (placing them puppies on the counter) behind the counter in the food prep/service area and afterwards continues taking orders and cooking without washing his hands!!! WTH?  Why have I seen him do this a few times? No problem because this past visit was my final one! The food? I go for two things: the burger rolls and the original hot buffalo wings! But it's not worth it if it means having to transcend BAD employees. I loathe that a great burger joint like TBP can't get it together...  I think new management would fix all this because the current cats just aren't feeling it..."
7/22/2012,5 star rating,"Delicious burgers, cute & very clean place, a little pricey but worth it because the food is better quality, and fast service ! Very friendly employees as well ! AND they were selling Flirty Cupcakes [not sure if they always have them but they did this day] which are amazing cupcakes !The guy who took our order, I didn't get his name, was so friendly & cool. Nice, yummy place close to home."
11/13/2011,3 star rating,"A grass fed-beef burger joint has great potential, but there are some kinks to work out on.When I come in I was greeted warmly, we figured out the menu and sat down.  The speaker was too loud, bouncing off in the semi circular room and gave me a headache.  NOT everyone is in to hockey (or every other sport that you may show), this is not a sport bar.  The menu says they won't apologize for the music choice.  You are a business, don't try to play cool when it annoys your customer.When I got the burger, which consist of chili/jalapeno of some sort, it's a gulp of them in half of the burger, not the other half.  This mistake reflect how careless the burger is put together.The beef patty needs to be flatten so that it's spread out to the sides of the bread, it covered only 3/5 of the bread on mine.  Again, showing the put-together was careless.shoestring fries is forgetful, can you improve?  good burger has to come with good fries!the pop is flat, something needs to be done!Ok, I just discovered I had just mentioned cons on every edible items, but I am giving a 3 stars because this place just opened.  Hopefully someone's reading it and it will improve since I live so closet to here."

8/23/2012,2 star rating,"been eying this place for a while since i love places where they serve different combination toppings on burgers vs the typical lettuce,pickles, ketchup, onions, and mustard... the place is clean and the interior is pretty neat... the place can get pretty busy but luckily it started getting busy after i placed my order.. the service here kind of sucks and the food takes a good amount of time to come out..there is like 3 ipads on the side of the front counter for you order your food which is optional of course.. i used the ipad since I've never done that before haha.. there is tons of options on their menu.. your can even build your own burger which i like and of course each topping is extra besides the few basic ones and the sauce that's free.. after you complete your order, the machine will print out a receipt and you just bring it up to the register to pay ..i ordered #1 (burger point burger) and then i saw the option that let me customize it.. yes.. i indeed ended clicking that and added all these crazy toppings on it like mushrooms, bacon, avocado, etc .. i even added an extra patty for $3 haha.. made it into a meal with fries and drink too... next thing i know.. my burger w fries and drink cost me $20+ haha....the fries... it sucked... i ordered the sea salt fries.. their fries are like dam noodles! its so scrawny!.. it wasn't crispy at all.. in matter of fact it was soggy as hell! never again will i order fries from here again.. and I'm a big fan of fries...the burger... it was a little above average for me.. i feel like the beef patties is lacking a little on seasoning... the toppings and pretzel bun does taste fresh.. slow service, horrible fries, decent burger... hmmm.. I'll have to think twice before coming back here again.. for the price i paid.. i was expecting my meal to wow me but it didn't.. the good thing about this place is that they use grass fed beef and that's about it..."
6/24/2013,4 star rating,Amazing burgers! Even the vegetarian one is amazing. And delicious fries. 4 stars instead of 5 because a little pricey and food takes a while to come out.

10/19/2013,3 star rating,"Finally checked this place out since the bf has been wanting to try it.  Guess we were supposed to place our order on an iPad but since the only one free was broken we placed our order the old fashioned way.  We asked the girl for recos since it was our first time and she spouted off some of her faves.  We both went with the 6oz. burger point and an order of buffalo wings.  The burger was pretty good but the roasted chili peppers had my mouth burning midway through.  Glad we went with the smaller portion because it was quite filling!  The fries were cut thin and crispy, just the way I like it!  The wings were meaty with the usual buffalo zing.  It's not Kuma's but def a good burger spot!  We plan to go back soon!"
1/12/2014,2 star rating,"I've been here twice.  The 2nd time wanting it to be better.  There is a lot of variety on the menu and it looks like it should be a great place for burgers.  The first time, the burger just really had no flavor, so I figured I had to try it again, maybe just a bad day.  Second time....same thing.  Oh well, still on the lookout for a good burger joint.  But, I do have to say, despite the other reviews on here, my wife and I have always had good service."
1/8/2014,2 star rating,"I had high hope when I went there last night, and I was very disappointed. The burger was dry and over cook. Ginger Ale tasted like soda water, how hard to mix the powder really. It is totally not worth the high price that they charge you. Go somewhere else with your money."
11/10/2012,4 star rating,"I long ago decided that if I knew I was going to die tomorrow and could have one last meal, that meal would be a burger. Burger point came quite close to my death row version  of last meal heaven.  I've been their twice now and have had the chance to eat my way through a few of the menu items. Both the Dirty South and the New American Classic were amazing.  Oh the genius of putting a fried egg on a burger.....so delicious. I've also had the opportunity to sample (from the plate of my handsome dining companion) the veggie burger and Ashman. We have an agreement to never order the same things so we can effective work our way through the menu. So far so good, and I know I will be back for more. My only complaint is that the fries are hardly worth the effort, especially in comparison to the amazingness of the burgers. It can also be pricey, but I suppose that's the sacrifice that one must make for burger perfection."
10/17/2014,1 star rating,"I live just a couple blocks from this place and was excited by the other reviews. Unfortunately they were ""weighed, measured, and found wanting!""  Not only was it one of the most expensive burger meals I have had ($26.80 for two burger melas w fries and soda) but also the most disappointing!  The staff was as expected from other reviews, not overly friendly. But that doesn't bother me as much as the very poor food that is extremely overpriced. The burgers themselves were extremely overlooked and dry!  The taste was almost burnt and tough texture.  My daughter rarely leaves behind a burger but did in this case. The fries were worse!  Very undercooked (would love fries to be crunchy outside and soft inside...ok, perfection is asking a lot, I agree).  Theses were a greasy, limp pile of mush!  I could grab a handful and literally squeeze grease out of them!  I tossed both orders in the trash!  For what it's worth the diet Pepsi was ok (frankly a Coke person so even that is not saying much). Won't be back and can't recommend this place to anyone."
12/29/2012,2 star rating,"Just another upscale burger joint. If u like epic burger, ull like this place as well. Its all natural and grass fed beef. The burgers are fried, and have different fancy buns to choose from. Fancy lettuce, and different fresh toppings to choose from as well. The fries are fresh with the skin-on and sliced skinny. The size of this place sucked! I literally had a guy breathing on my neck from another table, gross! I ordered the classic burger. It was just average. Everythings made to order, and my food wasn't very hot despite the 24 minute wait. My burger was quite messy too, u go through tons of napkins. There were parts of the bacon that were inedible and fatty, so I took it off. My hubby had their turkey burger and he said that was average as well, and quite messy. He said epic burger is better. My little girl ordered the bbq wings and hated them! They were huge and fried and tossed in bbq sauce...very tough and tasted a little  undercooked. They needed some seasoning to the batter, but they looked pretty good. It was $28.00 for all of that, (2 burgers, 6 chicken wings sections, 3 regular fries, and 3 small sodas) but I actually felt robbed and cheated. I wasn't impressed and I think red robin is much better. Sorry, I won't be returning!"
10/24/2013,1 star rating,"If I could do No stars I would.  The worst burgers we have ever had.   My boyfriend eats plain burgers and the meat was burnt to a crisp and dried out beef.  I had their pointe burger and the egg was cooked well done.   The burgers were over cooked, dry, and burnt to a crisp.   If you like burnt dry hamburgers, this is your place.   I could understand if one burger came out overcooked but it appears to be this restaurant's signature mark.  From reading other reviews, others had the same experience.  Also, the ipad thing sucked.  A lady didn't know how it worked.   She put in her order and sat there waiting for her food.   Apparently she didn't go up to the cashier after ordering and was there forever."
12/23/2012,2 star rating,"Great burgers....don't get me wrong...great burgers.  That said, it was all the little things that made this place less than memorable.  Let's start with the iPad ordering system...tiny font, not the most user friendly prompts....so it took us 5 mins to place an order for 2 burgers w/ fries and drink.  I can see this being helpful if they have long lines to get orders in faster, but even with only 3 tables seated there tonight our burgers took a good long while....so I'm left to beg the question...what's the point with the iPads?  Service...not offensively slow..but slow.  Prices...offensively high.  My burger was good...and I didn't even know about the organic/grass-fed part til I read reviews afterward, which was great to hear...but I hardly agree that my burger and fries were worth $12...grass fed or not.  Overall, good burgers...just a lot of hassle to get to them...aka..not my favorite joint in the south loop.  I think this place would do well to nix the ipads and make their prices a little more reasonable (although...prices may be high to help pay off all the ipads).  :)"
12/9/2011,4 star rating,"Update from 2011.. I've been back many many times and absolutely love the burgers here, namely the Ashman and Classic. Fries are just ok but it's awesome to have such a quality burger joint in the area :)"
2/11/2012,2 star rating,"I am not a fan of burgers that are fried so I opted for the wings, they were good. My boyfriend had the bleu cheeseburger which he loved. The fries were cold and soggy as someone else mentioned but forgiveable. However, the service was terrible. I believe the guy who took our order name is Brian, from what I overheard what appeared to be a regular saying goodbye to him. I am a firm believer in giving my money to establishments that treat customers with respect and welcome them. Not that one reviewere will make or break Burger Point I personally will not go back. The food was not that fantastic to make me forget about the rude behavior I received. There are other great burger joints with quality burgers that I would rather give my money to"
11/4/2012,4 star rating,The place is just okay kind of pricey.   Stick with the 6oz burger and don't get pritzel bun.
2/3/2012,4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of this place.  I went for the first time last week and went back again within a few days.  I will be frequenting this place for sure. I got the Ashman both times with fries and a drink.  Nothing bad to say aside from the burger being enormous and somewhat messy.  Still cant get a complete meal in the south loop for under $10, but I'd say this place is worth it.  I like it better than the counter burger, actually."
5/1/2012,4 star rating,"This is exactly what the south loop is lacking. I ordered food to go and it was delicious. I had everything perfectly planned out to pick up at half time of the game and they were flooded with orders but had everything ready, on time, no mistakes to the order. The selection is unique with a variety of fresh ingredients. The fries were a little soggy so we threw them in the oven, but the man taking my order over the phone even warned me of this bc they cook fresh on the spot, not frozen, no additives. Five mins on 375 and they are perfect. In house I am sure they are fab. Love this place and will for sure be back."
12/3/2011,5 star rating,"Great good, friendly efficient service. The burgers and fries are top-notch. The veggie burger is made in-house and can be cooked in its own pan to keep it vegan (by request). Beef burgers are cooked perfectly and have deep flavor. Extensive choice of toppings, condiments, and burger rolls."

3/21/2013,5 star rating,I order from here all the time & I have to say it's right on point. Their wings are the best (BUFFALO) I also love their chicken burgers on the delicious pretzel bun.
6/26/2013,1 star rating,"We went to Burger Point for the first time last night and we will never, ever be back.  It took 20 minutes to get our food (with nobody else in the place). When we finally got our burgers they were on the verge of burnt, dry and extremely salty.  The noise level was so high that I finally went outside to wait because the noise started to grate on my nerves.  To top it all off the burgers with fries and a drink cost over $25.00.  What a rip."

2/15/2012,5 star rating,The Burger Point is AWESOME!!!! Finally a decent burger around south loop / Chinatown area! I had the dirty south burger it was delicious! The bacon was nice and crispy and the BBQ sauce was sweet and a little tangy. The place is very clean and has a nice atmosphere. We took our 2 year old who usually never sits still at reastaurants and he even enjoyed just sitting there watching the 3 large flat screens and the EL go by outside. We will be visiting again very very soon.

11/18/2011,4 star rating,"I had 20 minutes before I had to meet a client down the street, and was happy to see Burger Point was open for business.  I walked in and was looking at the monitors with the menu, not sure if that system is going to work out well for them.  What I'm assuming was the manager,  asked me if I would like to look at their printed menu.  He began to explain that their burgers were grass fed beef ground fresh everyday and made to order...  I like the fact that the menu offers different types of meat, and both their own combinations and a wide variety of build your own burger options, from bun options to gourmet toppings.  I opted for the mushroom burger with swiss and brie and went for the combo with a pop and fries.  I was a little disappointed that you couldn't order the burgers to temperature, but I guess I can excuse it being a ""fast food"" setup.  Best fast food burger still goes to Paradise Pup, but I really like the variety of options at The Burger Point.  The fries were good, I heard the manager talking to the fry guy about trying to tweak their method for the fries, so I assume they're still getting things down.  The one thing I did not like was the price.  I know it's price point is on par with their competitors, but 12+bucks for a burger fries and drink is a little steep.  I could go to Hot Chocolate in Bucktown and get IMO the best burger in the city for about the same price."
12/13/2012,5 star rating,"Not only are the burgers amazing here, but I love the creative spin they have with a variety of burgers... I always get their house-made jalapeno relish because it's the perfect amount of spice that I've never had anywhere! Every burger with a Fried Egg is AMAZING, or you can always build your own. Lastly, they have ginger ale served as a fountain drink and I normally don't find that at burger joints."

6/3/2012,2 star rating,"For the price, I would think I can select how cooked my burger can be but no. They allow for customization of toppings but that makes the service so slow not to mention their kitchen/packing can be very slow depending on who's back there.  Fries was a greasy mess.  I don't think I will go back.  The one good point is their dining area which is very, very clean and comfortable with multiple tv's."

11/7/2011,5 star rating,The Burger Point is a nice addition to the South Loop. I haven't had a burger that juicy and tasty in a while. It is worth the price and I think you will find the customer service to be great as well.
12/11/2011,5 star rating,"The Burger Point is hands down theeee best burger spot in the chicago and i am a huge foodie i have been to many burger joints in chicago being that im from chicago.  But anyway I had the Dirty South burger and it was juicy tender and absolutely amazing, the chili was also very very good.  My mother had went early while i was at work and saved me a piece of hers and i knew that if this burger was this good heated up it had to be amazing fresh...so i went right away got that dirty south and like i said it was amazing.  I thought Kumas up north burgers were the best in chicago but THE BURGER POINT on 18900 south state street has officially dethrowned Kumas and have theeee best burgers hands down that i have very eaten in my life...  I highly recommend The Burger Point, great burgers, great atmosphere, amazing staff ....so stor reading and hurrry up and get there...."
9/10/2012,4 star rating,"This has become a go to spot for burger for me.  I love their burger creations, I am working through the menu each time trying a new burger.  You can order on the ipad's or if your not into that just go order at the register.  My favorite burger unfortunately was just a monthly special, it was their greek burger.  That needs to go on the menu full time.  Only downside for me is I often take my food to go and their fries don't travel well.  If you eat them right way they are good and crispy, but a 10 minute walk home and they become soggy."
8/9/2012,5 star rating,"This review is long overdue.  I have eaten at Burger Point multiple times.  This place is great.  Better burgers then DMK or Epic Burger.  I often call in and pick up on the way home, but have also eaten in and never had to wait too long.  Love Burger Point!"
12/13/2011,3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I definitely like the concept and the cozy environment and the service was prompt and friendly.  The burgers are made with grass-fed beef and are pretty good, but I wish they were a little juicer.  The fries were WAY TOO SALTY, and this is coming from a person who usually adds salt to most meals.  Will consider giving this place another try if I am in the area."
2/13/2012,5 star rating,"Not to familiar with places to eat at the South Loop, but The Burger Point on State street was excellent.  My ""Ashman"" burger was crazy good.  You can't go wrong with the wings and chili as well.  For the price the quality was excellent and the service was professional.  We enjoyed watching a game and listening to some great music over the speakers.  I could eat here once a week.  Clean tables and fast service.  Nice!  Thank you Point, now I don't have to go to California or Vegas to grab a West Coast burger, just grab ""The Ashman""."
12/12/2011,5 star rating,"You can start by ordering half a dozen fat wings, the flavor was incredible.  The habanero wings as well as the spicy hot were the best we've had in a long time.  That West Coast burger with the tangy sauce was the bomb!  The burger was fresh, light, and tasty as well as the side of spicy chili with a dash of sour cream.  I like the fact you can grab your drink, sit anywhere you like and catch up on a little TV.  The staff is friendly, generous, and helpful when deciding what to order.  The Burger Point is a cool place to kill 30-45 min and enjoy a great meal.  We tried the spiral fries and have to say they were unsuspectingly delicious.  For the price, you get your money's worth."
5/27/2012,4 star rating,"Theres very few places (especially in the S. Loop) that both carnivore and vegan can get a burger but this hits the spot. The veggie burger sits on a tender whole wheat bun both are  made on site. The burger itself is a combo of potato, beans, celery, corn and other goodies. Thumbs up! My husband got a beef burger and said it is 'pretty good' but in comparison to Kumas taste and pricewise the rating would have to go way down.  The sweet potato fries were greasy and soggy so a complete thumbs down not even remotely close to Native Foods fries. But 4 stars for being able to walk here and we can both eat."
10/29/2011,4 star rating,"Yum!!! If I could give burger point an extra .5 I would, so delicious with just a little still to work out. This of course is to be expected since I am pretty sure their doors just opened yesterday. The burger-a perfect combination of flavors! I had the #1; which had one patty, green roasted chilies, thick cut crispy bacon, cheese and a fried egg. The combination of flavors was outstanding, heat, creaminess, meaty, yum! My only small comment was the bun, a pretzel roll, which was a little too dense for me, however, still very fresh and flavorful! The fries were pretty good and likely would have been better if I had eaten in versus taken out, maybe a little thicker cut would be nice but I love how they were clearly fresh cut with a nice balance of salt. Amazing job for a soft opening! Can't wait to go back! P.S. Give the workers a break on the timing, it may take a little longer but they just opened and need a little time to get their groove down!"
11/4/2011,1 star rating,"Where are these reviews coming from?  Dont learn your lesson like I did and believe them - I sat for 45 minutes with 10 people in the store and they hadnt started my burger - when I finally got it, it was cold, and barely took up half of the bun - Id guess 4 oz max - this place is an organizational nightmare - tere are 6 people on the grill - one puts the burger on the grill - one puts the cheese on, one puts the lettuce on etc - no joke - during my 45 minute wait 5 people sent their food back - I was about to leave when mine came out  and I was wholly unimpressed - I politely asked the hostess what was taking so long and she curtly responded that they do not apologize as everything is from scratch - whan I asked what takes longer for a ""from scratch"" burger, I was tols that I wouldnt understand - I let it go but screaming in my head was ""YOU ONLY MAKE BURGERS!"" the attitude spoke volumes - this place will be closed by new years if there isnt a complete 180"
6/14/2012,1 star rating,"I have been to Burger Point....maybe about 5 times. The first time I went I was excited about the food because it was something good that's not too far to get to. The burgers ALWAYS have some fat/gristle in them. I mean EVERY other bite I am pulling stuff out of my mouth. I would rather go to Five Guys. They are actually about to open a new Five Guys about 2 mins from Burger Point so they better step up their game. The burgers cost way too much for the issues that I have had there. I had the Spanish Revolution burger it was good because of the toppings, but that fat/gristle really pissed me off. The fries are always horrible/greasy. The last few times I asked them to make them crispy and they DID NOT!! I guess its due to the peanut oil they cook them in. I doubt I will go back to this place unless I see improved reviews. Don't waste your money for a burger filled with gristle thats cost between $7-8. I did have a turkey burger once & it did not have the gristle or fat issues."
