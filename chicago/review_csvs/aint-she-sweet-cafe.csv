7/5/2021,4 star rating,"Came here for the first time and the food was pretty good. I got a BLT on a croissant and my friend got the jerk chicken wrap she couldn't stop raving about.4 stars instead of 5 because customer service was lacking. Like I said it as my first time and the lady at the counter seemed annoyed when we asked questions (Like when I asked for a BLT she said ""so turkey bacon lettuce and tomato?"" I thought she meant did I want turkey lunchmeat on my BLT and I said ""no"". Then she just stared me down. Then I realized she must mean they only serve turkey bacon. I said my realization aloud and said ""Oh okay, that's fine"". But how hard would it be for her to have simply said ""We only serve turkey bacon, not pork bacon. Is that fine?"")Anyway, as I said the BLT I got was good-turkey bacon nice and crispy and veggies were fresh. I would go back for the food and nice prices but they could benefit from a warmer staff, especially when you're a small business and you have folks experiencing your place for the first time."
6/10/2021,5 star rating,"Andy is so great! Her pop up ""Andy's Sunflower Cafe"" is inside ain't she sweet in the Pullman/Beverly Hills/Oak Lawn area. It's women and black owned, Some of the best lattes/coffee hot and iced I've ever had. On a mission to try them all! They have punch cards now!"
11/27/2020,5 star rating,My order was placed via grub hub .. which may warrant a different experience if placed in person... grub hub estimated the wait time to be about 45 min during the 1230-130 lunch hour.Upon arrival there was a wait for the in store orders and pick up orders so I suggest planning ahead. Their online menu corresponded with what was available in store i ordered the garden veggie panini. I was on the fence about ordering the tomatoes soup only to be surprised that my sandwich came with a small portion which was perfect.  I was able to eat half of my sandwich & the soup and save the rest for a second meal This business is also black run i was happy to find it while in town
3/31/2022,5 star rating,I've been coming here for years and they never miss. The jerk wrap and bowl is amazing as well as the weight watchers smoothie. I love that they give you an option of chips or fruit with your warps and they have lots of other great menu items as well. I definitely recommend.
5/1/2021,5 star rating,"This is one of my fav spots on the Southside. Not only is the food fresh and delicious, but this place is a whole vibe. The owner is a Delta, still works the counter, and don't be thrown off if she doesn't greet you with a big smile, she appreciates your business, she's just probably tired lol. The conversation you'll undoubtly strike up with the many cool customers waiting will more than make up for that. There's Black Art on the walls. Everyone is happy. And the jerk salmon wrap on spinach is lit!"
8/24/2021,1 star rating,"My friend and I ordered the jerk chicken bowl with salmon, we were charged and extra $4 a piece, mind you we didn't check our food prior because we arrived as soon as they were closing, and didn't realize that we had gotten chicken instead of salmon (what we asked for and paid for), my friend said that this has happened to her several times before. So we were charged a total of $8 and didn't get what we asked for, so to everyone please check your food before leaving, because clearly they're not paying attention or trying to rip people off"
12/6/2020,5 star rating,"This was my first time trying this place out. I was very pleased with my food! They have a lot of options on the menu to give people a variety. Because of Covid, they are takeout only. You can walk in and order or call over the phone for pickup. The staff was quick and very nice. I waited around 5 minutes for my food to be done after I placed my order. I ordered the jerk salmon wrap. It was soooo good! I loved the spice level. It was had a kick, but it wasn't overwhelming. I could taste the flavor still. The salmon was moist and flaky. They give you options of tomato, flour, spinach, or wheat wrapping. I got the spinach and it was good! Overall, 10/10 experience. Definitely will be returning. Black owned!"
2/11/2022,5 star rating,Food is always great and fresh I would highly recommend this place. The jerk salmon wrap is the best along with the tomato soup
1/30/2020,4 star rating,"Chilllllee! I have drove past and heard about this place  for years now. I would always forget to go in. As a SAHM (Stay at Home Mom) and a full time student I don't always feel like cooking lunch so Grubhub was my friend yesterday and Ain't She Sweet cafe was my BFF!!!!!!! My order came within the time frame on the tracker. The lady who brought my food to my house was prompt, pleasant and courteous. When she handed me my bag and my smoothie I had a feeling that it was going to be delish!!I ordered the Da Steve (which was turkey ham, turkey bacon, oven roasted turkey, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, mayo and mustard on a buttery croissant for a $1.00 extra I added the soup of the day (you must call first to see what it is) I didn't because I wanted to be surprised. I was! Their tomato basil soup is sooo good!! I mean you could pour it on a leather shoe and have a great meal!! Loll!! It was that good! I also ordered a Tropical Breez. It had  a scoop of raspberry sherbert, blended with  peaches, pineapple, mangos and strawberries in it. Sooo goood. ****I only gave them four stars because I ordered a rum cake slice and was given a Lemon pound cake slice. It was nice and moist just not what I ordered. Check them out if you are in the Bronzeville area! They are worth it!!"

6/11/2021,4 star rating,Panini vegetables seasoned very well. Bread got a little soggy on the bottom because of the juice from the veggies. Very good sandwich!
2/11/2021,4 star rating,"First things first I've been patronizing this restaurant for over a decade, when they were originally located on Cottage Grove. The sandwiches were great then and have not changed. I have had Da Steve, Caribbean Jerk Chicken Wrap, Jerk Salmon Wrap, and all of the panini's- all very tasty and well put together. The smoothies are yummy too, although a bit pricey. My favorite is the Tropical Breezer. This time I decided to try the Buffalo chicken wrap. It is probably my least favorite ( it's missing something), but it was still well assembled which means so much to a ""sandwich person"" like myself. Lastly customer service could be warmer. After all they are small business in a community driven neighborhood."
3/10/2022,1 star rating,I waiting for almost an hr for a call in order. I literally watched people get their orders and they came in way after me. It was not busy. Terrible service.
2/25/2022,3 star rating,Great Wraps but they never answer the phone unfortunately and they take about 30 mins for call ins when I call in that is
10/17/2021,5 star rating,My fave place to do lunch during the week. My fave is Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wrap. There is ample seating and free street parking.
2/4/2022,4 star rating,"I was literally amazed with the customer service of this place. The staffs inside are all friendly and accommodating. They greeted me with big smiles when I was ordering in the counter and they were just basically so nice. It was my first time to visit the place and really like their customer service. The place is also clean and the ambiance feels great even if it is just a small place. They have a wide different option on their menu and the staffs also have good recommendations. I wanted a burrito and the staff suggested their buffalo chicken wrap and I agreed without any hesitation. Service is also fast and I felt like I did not wait at all. The burrito is seriously in a huge portion which I did not expect and it is very reasonable considering its price. When it comes to the taste and the flavor, it was just so good. I mean, it is not exactly the best but it was delicious and I could taste every flavor of everything that is in there and it was not bad and in fact I would like to have it again or better yet visit this place again."
7/13/2021,5 star rating,Nice spot for coffee and conversation in the morning. Friendly service and good food for the money.
9/29/2020,1 star rating,"This place has the worst customer service.  I went there this pass weekend and the light brown skinned lady with the glasses and a ponytail ( i had to give this description so you all will know exactly who I'm referring to) gave us such a nasty attitude and was very rude.  We had two separate orders.  The first order they over charged us for 2 smoothies.  We informed the lady that was described and she specifically stated that our total made sense when it didn't.  The small smoothie was 4.99 they charged us 9.98 for each.  Now please tell me how that makes sense.  However, instead of listening to us she snatched the receipt and was like the cashier put in two so that's correct.  So, I'm trying to help her count and explain that 4.99 x 2 doesn't equal 19.96.  So, then she came to her senses and gave us $10.00 in cash out the register and now explaining that the cashier was new and made a mistake. That's all we were trying to explain to her the whole time but she wouldn't listen.  Next, order.  I'm standing there waiting and still nothing.  Please who arrived after us had received their food but yet we haven't received our second order which was a small jerk and potato salad.  So then i had to asked the same lady if that order was ready.  She said with attitude I gave you everything.  So finally again I had to bring out my receipt to prove that point.  So, I saw her put  two small containers in the bag.  Why when I get home all that was in the was my jerk salad and crackers.Any other time I would've let it go especially being that it was like 2.50 or 3.00.  But I couldn't because they had made so many mistakes and the rudeness and attitude was just unbelievable so I wanted everything that I paid for.  So. I called up there and left and just as expected no one called back.  So, my sister works around the corner so I ask her to explain to her what happened and to ask if we could have the potato and the lady went off.  She start banging on the corner in rage and hit the tip jar. Moral of the story is that I always try to support black business because we need more support then most companies.  But I will say this...i will be telling and spreading my experience.  This is one place I'll never do business with again and it's sad because the food is really great.  It was my first and last time there. This is the one on the east side of the city.  I haven't been to the one on western."
3/10/2021,1 star rating,Foo is good customer service is bad I waited 24 min for a jerk wrap  it wasn't crowded 2 people ordered behind me with bigger orders and left out before me. And when you say something the old lady will say you want your money back? No apology. no I been waiting 24min I want my sandwich. I also paid for two sides that were pre made and I guess you have to eat them with your finger because they don't give you a spoon. Very bad customer service.
3/15/2021,4 star rating,The sandwiches are hearty and fulfilling . The tomato  and spinach  bisque is a must have! Would prefer real bacon  over turkey bacon on Da Steve . The sandwich would be  with fries if they served them.
9/2/2020,5 star rating,"This place was packed when I walked in , which should tell you something! They're cooking up some amazing things back there! My order was brought out on time and everything was delicious. I'm so happy to have a tasty yet healthy option close to my own neighborhood. Place your order online and you won't be disappointed! I will definitely be back."
8/26/2020,5 star rating,Service was so fast on my lunch break. Friendly older lady at the register. Food was great. I will go again.
12/27/2020,5 star rating,"AMAZING!!! i eat here soooo much, and just happen to be making a review for another place and wanted to give them one as well! they're in my neighborhood and its such a good option. i LOVEEEE the jerk chicken wrap!! i'm addicted actually. Everything I've had was good. the Jerk bowl is better than chipotle, so I go there when I want a ""bowl"". Plus they're black owned so a good plus! Only issue is theyre alwaysssssss busyyyy and sometimes its hard to place a phone order!! But the food is worth it."
12/12/2017,4 star rating,"Great spot in bronzeville. Not sure why I hadn't gone here before but after working in sip and savor all day I needed food. I walked next door and immediately was hit was a wonderful aroma. I had my mind set on a menu item I saw online but when I got in I saw additional options. I opted for the jerk salmon bowl. Two thumbs up!  The service was fast the atmosphere was lively and friendly and once I got back next door and devoured my food!  It was so good. Fresh, lots of seasoning and a great portion. The prices are a tad bit high but I will support something other than fast food I knew my Hood! Try this place you won't be disappointed."
3/12/2020,4 star rating,"When I'm looking for a healthy lighter choice I come here. The food is amazing and Black Owned. You can't beat that!! The salads, wraps and shakes are all bomb!! Just try it out for yourself. I usually decide on the jerk chicken bowl? Then add all the toppings"
12/29/2020,5 star rating,"Stopped for a quick takeout of the Jamaican jerk chicken salad wrap and it was delish! Really great flavor, definitely recommend. I did try to call to place the order in advance but the phone went to voicemail, but was able to just walk in and order."
6/7/2017,4 star rating,"Sweet Ain't She? Is the question to ask yourself and be answer will be YES...This place is one of my FaV places to stop by in the Bronzeville area when I'm home in Chicago. It's like Cheers in this small lovely cafe. Everyone stops in from children to school teachers to city workers to retired individuals, etc..Some people know one another like it's there regular place for lunch and there are always lots of smiles when you enter. I really enjoy the atmosphere and appreciate the location being in one of our urban areas. Right next door is a park built for the people by the people and it just warms my soul when in the midst of such positivity in my city where outsiders only see negativity.Back to Ain't she sweet.. The food is super yummy from the homemade soups to the wraps. My favorite is the Jerk Salmon wrap. There is also handmade ice cream and a vast variety of smoothie choices. All of which I've enjoyed and believe you can't go wrong. The food is made with Love and you can feel it as you digest.This is a must when in Chicago"
1/29/2021,3 star rating,Food is excellent. The problem is the service. THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE FOR CALL IN ORDERS. In the restaurant the employees look at the customers with such disgust makes you want to say u want your money back. Did i mention they never answer the calls and the phone goes right to voicemail? Good food though although u have to be ready to substitute because they run out of stuff. Lastly they don't answer the phone for call in orders.
1/7/2019,5 star rating,"For lunch today, I had a jerk salmon wrap on wheat w/ no cheese and chips. It's simple but done so well. I had rum pound cake because I'm sure science supports that dessert is necessary after every meal. Also, If I could marry the person that makes the cake, I would. The food is awesome. Service is efficient and friendly. I love this place."
1/6/2021,5 star rating,"Love the jerk wrap and a smoothie. It's important to order ahead if you don't want to wait. Customer service is great, I hope this business stays for years to come!"
6/11/2021,5 star rating,This was amazing. I had the salmon jerk wrap. I didn't think a wrap could be that good. I was surprised. I l will definitely be returning
7/30/2020,5 star rating,"I should start with my regrets-I did not get the Salmon wrap-even though it looked sooooo good and I have heard great things about it. Fortunately, I plan to return, so I will definitely grab wraps (and probably a salad too-lol) in the future. Now, here's what I did right on this visit: getting their ice cream. I brought my kid cousins here and they loved their ice cream. The portions were huge (which of course the kids loved) and it tasted fresh as well. Staff were friendly while also making sure that folks were wearing masks and social distancing (#covid). Definitely recommend this place!"
6/17/2019,1 star rating,"Allegedly a Jerk Chicken Salad?????? With minced chicken, barely any tomato, just two tomato slices, shredded carrots, no other veggies. This is basically a high priced bowl of romaine. There was no dressing or cutlery included in our $61 take out order for 3. And we were overcharged (the second time for me). This is not Sweet, I'm very bitter. From now on, no more redemption. Not right the first time I WON'T return! Should be ZERO stars!!!!!"
10/7/2020,5 star rating,The food was delicious! Service was fast and exceeding my expectations considering how busy it was. Location is small but they are very well run business
2/6/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome place for a lunch meeting/work/chill spot! Reminded me of restaurants in Austin where you can overhear patrons discussing their goals for the local community and how they plan to make it happen. Super inspiring place, no wonder #44 endorsed it himself!!!Food is fresh, delicious, and healthy! There's cucumber water for free should you not choose the abundance of good drinks and smoothies. I chose a fresh fruit smoothie with peach and pineapple; highly recommend! There's cakes, pies and ice cream too!The jerk salmon wrap is SO GOOD and you can have a wheat or spinach wrap to go with it; it comes with Lays classic chips. The tomato spinach bisque soup- DAMN GOOD! I had to order a bowl to-go and I just finished the bowl as I'm typing this, now I'm sad, I need more!One thing to keep in mind is it will be packed during the lunch hour with to-go and dine-in customers so it's good to get here early if you can! Can't wait to go back & try the rest of the deliciousness!"
6/26/2020,5 star rating,"The best wraps in Chicago! Salads are delicious too! Super friendly and helpful staff. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
6/15/2018,2 star rating,This is a very nice place that's warm and welcoming. I had the Caribbean jerk chicken wrap and it was tasty however not necessarily what I was expecting. The wrap was very fresh however the jerk marinade seemed like it had an abundance of one spice in it which tasted like cumin. I'm not familiar with any jerk marinade that uses cumin. If you like heavily spiced cumin food their jerk chicken wrap is for you.Perhaps I'll have a chance to try some of their other menu items on my next trip to Chicago.
8/2/2018,4 star rating,"Hidden gem. This place has the best jerk wraps, smoothies and sandwiches. Everything was fresh and prompt when I came in.  You can dine in or dip. Either is cool. They get pretty packed around lunch so phoning and order in might help. Also free cucumber water while you wait."
9/28/2019,5 star rating,So I warmed the soup which actually was tomato soup which they gave me by mistake and omg it's delicious. Yeah I have to retract my complaint...eating tomato  soup when you think it's broccoli  soup can confuse the palette!  But please please don't sleep on that tomato  soup  it's now my regular order.
6/18/2019,2 star rating,"Today I was quite disappointed. I ordered the blackened salmon bowl a cup of broccoli cheese soup and a muscle up. The blackened salmon was over cooked, tough and dry. The broccoli cheese soup was refrigerator cool and taste like cheesy tomato soup?  First worst experience. I tried something new...bad decision. Their chicken jerk salad on croissant is great."
8/1/2020,5 star rating,I finally had chance to try Caribbean chicken spinach wrap and it was HEAVEN! I will definitely try other times on the menu.
10/18/2017,4 star rating,"I tend to base my ratings on whether or not the food/experience was worth my tastebuds and wallet. I would give this a 3 if it was just on tastebuds/wallet since I felt like my tuscany panini ($~9) was just okay for the price. Bonus star for being a black owned and run business though. Great to see such a business thriving. Things to note:Call ahead for quicker pick up, there's always a consistent line!Lays Chips come with your entree - you can pick from original or BBQ! Original is default - I didn't know this but they let me trade for BBQ."
9/7/2019,5 star rating,"This is my favorite healthy option on the south side, or maybe even the city. This place has a family style vibe with extremely reasonable prices for very fresh and delicious food. Absolutely the best smoothies in Chicago hands down. I get the fresh fruit smoothie with pineapple and strawberries. The salad portions are huge, and there are so many options (rotating as well) and even more dressing options. The food is great to go, or to eat in as well. Even when busy they get the food to you very fast, and are accommodating if there's ever a reason for the wait time to be a little bit longer. I'd eaten inside and right outside I'd dropped my small smoothie, and with no problem I came back in and asked for another one and not only did they give me another one without charge but they gave me a bigger size and apologized for the wait! So sweet! They definitely live up to their name!"
12/6/2018,5 star rating,"Love this place went here because my coworker recommend me to try out their famous Caribbean  jerk chicken wrap. Decided to go there for dinner I order the wrap they came out pretty fast. The taste of the wrap was amazing and the amazing of each ingredient lettuce, jerk chicken, cheese and the wrap is prefect. The sauce was so good where it isn't dry at all. I would definitely come back to try out their jerk chicken bowl and other sandwich on the menu. Street parking and accept cards and cash...there are indoor sitting."
9/3/2019,5 star rating,I love this place sooo good. This raspberry sorbet is Devine!!!  I also ordered the Grilled Chicken Cheddar sandwich and some potatoe salad. Sooo good
5/19/2020,4 star rating,My go to for a jerk wrap and jerk salad. The smoothies are delicious too. I wish they stayed open later then 6. Theres not a lot of places that have healthy choices. They have a rewards system as well.
12/11/2018,5 star rating,"The name will throw you off as a bakery-especially since it's next to another black owned place Sip and Savor coffee shop- but it's a cafe with a deli style set up. I don't even know where to begin but I'll just call this place the Gem of Bronzeville. The decor of the place is inviting, bright and welcoming. Immediately coming in, I knew I just wanted to order to dine in. It was a few pieces of African Americans paintings on the wall with HBCU souvenirs (well it was only one paddle that had sorority Delta's Greek letter scribed on it) and even pics of the Obamas. I liked that a lot however, I need for more pieces to go up to create a African American montage. I always loved the chalkboards with creative specials scribbled all over it and this place had multiple chalkboards on display which immediately catches your eye.The counter is set up deli style with some one taking walk in orders on one side and the call in orders on the other. While it was a line for walk in orders, a guy in the back was yelling over the cashier ""NEXT"" for the patrons to yell back what they were ordering. This may have been a tactic to streamline making orders faster, but  it was just weird to repeat it twice and create more of a  chance to mess up an order. It was about 7-9 people preparing orders behind the counter. And once you ordered they would bring your food out to the table. I ordered a Garden Veggie panini and a slice of carrot cake. It took about 8-10 mins for my meal to be brought out. When I say that veggie panini was phenomenal to the tastebuds...  I mean it was a party in my mouth after each bite. The carrot cake was delicious as well. I am mad that I chose to go here and I'm not eating meat for the month of December .Just by being in the cafe, it was a heavy volume of traffic for a Tuesday... but then again it also was around lunch time . However, it was no long waits and the most popular item everyone was ordering was the jerk chicken wrap and smoothies. Unfortunately I have to wait to January to try the wrap however, if you read this review... grab a jerk chicken wrap and smoothie first. All and all this was a great experience of great tasting food and ambiance for lunch. If I have to be critical the order taking was a little much but over time you can get pass ordering being transactional. I only say that because it was only;""(Guy in the back) what you ordering?""""(Cashier) whats your order?"" ""Hit no tip then insert card..""""Here is your number...l""""(Guy in the back) NEXT"" Other than that... I will be back"
9/15/2018,1 star rating,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. Minority owned businesses are beautiful thing EXCEPT when the acumen lacks to provide people with decent (not even great) customer service to entice them to come back again. I write this review after standing in line directly in front of cashier who took not 1 but 2 and attempted to take a 3rd phone order instead of my order. In her defense it was explained to me that MGMT has directed them to answer the phone instead of taking the orders of the people standing directly in front of them (say what!!). Didn't receive a hello, do you mind waiting in fact she averted her eyes into the sunset to avoid making eye contact!!!!Kudos to the call in cashier who apologized for the behavior that those standing by whispered was rude. People work too hard for their money to want to spend it at an establishment that won't even acknowledge people standing in front of them. I wish I was extended the same courtesy as those on the phone..A'int she sweet? Actually she's just rude"
6/18/2017,4 star rating,"Cool spot in Bronzeville! I tried the jerk chicken bowl and the honey cream cheese sweet potato pie! Forewarning, do not spread the hot sauce on the chicken bowl. The hot sauce is super spicy - good but real spicy. Too spicy it took me a while to finish the chicken bowl. My favorite was the honey cream cheese sweet potato pie!! Omg it was like Thanksgiving in your mouth. I would definitely go back and order a whole pie for a family gathering."

1/20/2020,3 star rating,"I really enjoyed the vegan jerk chikin sandwich. It was very filling, the vegan chikin was tender and the vegan Jerk Sauce was delicious. Had it with a side of chips. I wish they had  more vegan items. They have a veggie sandwich and then salads.  Both times I was  there they said they often have vegan chili but both times they did not have it. It would be great if one of their soups  was plant based when they offer two. Had a delicious iced maple and cinnamon latte with soy milk from Andy's Sunflower Cafe in the same space. Was really good too! Like the free self service lemon water! Some people may be confused that you have to order from two separate locations for  the coffee  drinks and food but once  you do it once you are over it! Looking forward to going back  again. Thanks for having vegan options vegans!"
3/8/2017,1 star rating,"Today was their Grand Opening in Beverly, they were not ready for the opening, people were waiting 30-40 minutes for wraps, salads and shakes, their customers were going next door to Jansens to eat and buy their shakes.I had to locate the chicken in my jerk chicken salad, $9.00, I will be going back to Chipotle."
10/17/2014,4 star rating,"This place is a sweet gem on the South Side. Free parking is readily available right out front. I love that they have a lot of turkey options. The staff was really nice and the food was amazing!! I recommend calling ahead to place your order. It cuts down on the wait time, although I still stood in the long line before I could pay for my food--A bit of an inconvenience as I was in a hurry. I haven't dined in yet. It seems most people grab and go. The tables are always full because of the amount of people waiting. (Again, call ahead). The fruit smoothies are a must try!"

7/6/2018,4 star rating,It's my first time to Chicago and I found this place in my Yelp search.  I was looking for a quick bite to eat that would satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  My friends came here for lunch.  The staff was very friendly and our food came out quickly.  I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap....the sauce was amazing!!! I will definitely be back!!!
8/25/2018,4 star rating,"Jerk wrap. Jerk salad. Jerk bowl. Anything that has ""jerk"", buy it. It's just that good. I am also addicted to their tomato and spinach bisque! I hope they never take it off the menu. It's usually busy at this location during lunch time, so if you know what you want, call in your order."
9/4/2019,5 star rating,"I've been coming to this location for a few years now and I've never had a bad experience. The food is great! It's healthier options- wraps, salads, paninis... my go to is the turkey panini, light but very filling. The smoothies are also delicious. The prices may seem a little high to some, but for the quality of the food I think it's worth it. Parking isn't the easiest to find at this location so it may be better to call in your order if you plan on taking your food to go. One if my favorite things is the cucumber water that's available to the customers as they wait for their food. Overall great spot for lunch or a light dinner."

Everyone is nice and thorough and ALWAYS gets my order right. There's a cute seating area that can accommodate someone who just wants to eat or woke remotely. It's one of my Chicago faves!"
7/17/2019,1 star rating,"Food was decent. Not the friendliest service. No white bread or ketchup (kind of restaurant basics?) we came with kids and that's half of their requests lol-- half the restaurant looks empty (not a big deal) the food was very overpriced. We spent nearly $50 on 3 kids grilled cheese, a coke + couple bottles of water, soup and sandwich. Got charged extra for ""panini"" bread bc it was the closest thing to white bread. Not impressed."
4/4/2018,4 star rating,A coworker took me here for lunch and I actually liked my order. It was very busy. I recommend you call ahead of time. I heard their smoothies are really good.  Will go back to try that next time I'm in the area.
8/14/2020,5 star rating,Great food. I enjoyed the jerk salmon wrap. It has a delicious kick that doesn't overpower the flavor of the salmon.  Nicely done.
7/10/2019,5 star rating,This place is AMAZING!!! The food is always fresh and flavorful. The service is always top notch. I am a repeat offender.
5/4/2018,5 star rating,"This place was amazing. I ordered the Caribbean jerk chicken wrap and the food was incredible. The wrap is filling and chicken was fresh. I love it spicy and asked for extra sauce and they gave it to me without charge so they aren't the petty type. It comes with a pickle ( which tasted very fresh) and bag of potato chips. The restaurant was very clean and inviting. The customers seemed to enjoy themselves. Two separate lines for call ins and ordering. The wait to pay for your food took about five minutes but the chef asks you for your order soon as you step up so by the time you pay you have your food. This was PERFECT, cause I was on a quick lunch break! Overall in there for less than ten minutes. Staff was welcoming, patient( chef came around the counter to assist me in my order), polite, and all smiles. I will definitely be returning and bringing a friend!"
9/5/2020,5 star rating,Excellent Chicken wrap.  Ordered food for delivery after having visited the Beverly location.  Arrived on time and was just as delicious as the initial visit.  Definitely a Chicago go-to.
6/8/2018,5 star rating,"I love the fact that it's black owned, and there hasn't been a single item I didn't absolutely love off the menu. Buffalo wraps, chipotle wraps, and my favorite is the chicken breast crescent! They give you fresh veggies and quality protein, I crave the food from here. They give you a bag of chips and a pickle with every main item. The owner is hands on and they have delicious smoothies and everything seems healthy. One of my absolute favorite bronzeville lunch spots"
2/8/2019,5 star rating,"A great stop for lunch! I've had almost all of the wraps and all of them were delicious and well prepared. If you're looking for a sweet, tasty fruit smoothie, this is the place to stop. Reasonably priced and black owned"
1/23/2019,5 star rating,"The spinach tomato bisque is AH-MAY-ZING!!!  I have to order it each time. It leaves me wanting more every time.  I usually order the soup and the jerk chicken or salmon wrap.  It's good but let me be clear, the main reason for my visit is the soup.  The shakes and smoothies are great too."
10/29/2019,5 star rating,I ordered a garbage salad. I'm not sure if it's called the garbage salad because it has more of other things(meat and toppings) versus the actual green salad. It was really good. It has more meat than anything but I definitely would have preferred if it have a balance of meat and greens. The sweet potato pie with the whipped topping was good. I wasn't a big fan of it but my Dad didn't waste any time to eat it. I'm big on texture of foods and the pie just had a mushy texture idk not like the oh sweet potato pies. But both of these items came out to be $13 plus some. It is a little pricy but all the other mainstream places are too... I'll be returning.
8/7/2020,4 star rating,Always enjoy coming here. It's a quaint little restaurant with great wraps and paninis. The parking is plentiful and it's always a nice mix of people who eat there. They opened up a second location on 99th & Western.
7/25/2018,3 star rating,Cool place. My jerk chicken bowl was aight. My brother's jerk salmon salad was lackluster (his exact words) and it was most definitely frozen not fresh. The decor and employees were cool. I'd go back for a smoothie or something.
7/22/2017,3 star rating,The smell of the jerk season was so overwhelming once you walked in to the restaurant. I got the jerk salmon salad with spinach and it definitely had a spice to it. The staff was friendly. They have a variety of sandwiches and panini's.
3/17/2019,1 star rating,"I have eaten here for years. I had a credit with them because I ordered via grub hub and they left my shake. I came in to order and get my credit from the missed shake. They advised me I couldn't use the credit because I ordered to via Grubhub even though it's her restaurant. It's all about customer service. She called GrubHub to have them give me the 6.09 back instead of just giving me the shake. I then tried to order and the young lady at the register just looked at me, I asked to order she looked again and went and service someone else. Left hungry and dissatisfied"
3/14/2019,4 star rating,I call to order but they hang up on me and then call she was bit rude but I guess it's was busy and yes it was busy went I got there. She said it was going to be ready in 20min but got there in less then 5min pay and my order was ready. Got the jerk chicken wrap and was very good.
1/4/2016,5 star rating,"My family is consistently very happy with this cafe. The shakes are all delicious (and run the gamut from healthy to very indulgent), and all of the many sweet potato desserts are great too. Most dishes have meat in them, but the vegetable panini is a good vegetarian option. Service is prompt and good, and when we go, there's always somewhere to sit."
6/21/2017,5 star rating,"Great wraps and smoothies!  I had the turkey club and a pineapple smoothie, which were both very filling.  I'm also glad that this cafe is nearby my home, so it's good to know I don't have to go very far to get good eats."
7/21/2017,1 star rating,"So I've been going to Ain't She Sweet for years. Actually, I met up with my now wife there for our first meeting so I really love this spot. A couple of weeks ago, I was heading home and my wife said that she was calling in a order for us and wanted me to pick it up. As I'm pulling up, she calls to say she was never able to get thru because the line was busy about 20 mins or so. I went in to order and I asked if they were having phone issues, the cashier was walking around looking for the phone and couldn't find it. Just now,  I'm the one calling in the order and the young lady asked if Incan hold. After holding for 9:40s I hang up and call back. For the last 10 minutes, the line is busy. No Ain't She Sweet for me now. I'll think twice about going again. I can't ignore the fact that this is becoming a pattern."
6/20/2020,5 star rating,"I'm ashamed of myself. This place is not far from me on Western; however, this is only the second time I've been here. The food is divine! I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Wrap and my son has had the Chipotle Chicken Wrap and The Sweets Panini and they are just to die for! The food is fresh and prepared with love. A big plus is that it's Black Owned. I do wish they were open later than 6pm but it's not a showstopper. I will definitely go back because I want to try not only the tomato soup, but also the other sandwiches they offer."
3/31/2017,5 star rating,"I love this place. A little pricey for a sandwich but I don't mind paying the price because these are no ordinary sandwiches and they will not disappoint. I usually get ""Da Steve"" sandwich which is my favorite and takes me a while to eat. I'll eat half and save the other half for later. I just tried the tomato spinach bisque today which was pretty good as well. I love ""Sweet Dreams"" shake which I share because it's so big. Check them out and support!"
12/10/2018,5 star rating,Addicted to the blueberry shake here! They're quite busy at lunch so be prepared for a long wait at that time. Really nice people and good food and drinks! A+
7/6/2018,4 star rating,It's my first time to Chicago and I found this place in my Yelp search.  I was looking for a quick bite to eat that would satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  My friends came here for lunch.  The staff was very friendly and our food came out quickly.  I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap....the sauce was amazing!!! I will definitely be back!!!
6/17/2018,5 star rating,love this place.  the staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh and tasty.  and i always see familiar faces.  win.  win.  win.  took my dad to the location in beverly and he brought it up a week later saying how he really liked the restaurant.  keep rocking & rolling.
6/15/2018,2 star rating,This is a very nice place that's warm and welcoming. I had the Caribbean jerk chicken wrap and it was tasty however not necessarily what I was expecting. The wrap was very fresh however the jerk marinade seemed like it had an abundance of one spice in it which tasted like cumin. I'm not familiar with any jerk marinade that uses cumin. If you like heavily spiced cumin food their jerk chicken wrap is for you.Perhaps I'll have a chance to try some of their other menu items on my next trip to Chicago.

6/4/2018,1 star rating,"The Customer service was HORRIBLE. I was not pleased with an item that I purchased and when I asked to exchange it I was initially told NO without explanation. When I spoke to George the sandwich maker he told me that there had never been a complaint and that was why he could not give me exchange. I told him I simply did not like the item and wanted to even pay the difference for something else his response was ""will you like that item"". He created a very uncomfortable scene in front of the entire store. I then demanded a refund. So my advice is be very careful of returning an item that you may be displeased with because ""George"" will not be happy."

4/20/2018,1 star rating,I would not patronize this place at gunpoint. Definitely not a lunch time. I called in for pickup several times and 90% the order was wrong or not lost. It seems like they answer the phone without writing the orders down. I ordered a Jerk Salmon wrap once and ended up with Chicken. I have been a faithful patron since they were located on Cottage Grove. My loyalty and understanding is over.
4/5/2018,5 star rating,"I have officially made this place my favorite restaurant on the east side. I cannot say enough good things about it. I'd been hearing about how good ASHC is but never stopped in until recently. The first time, I had The Spartan Panini and tomato bisque soup. The second time, I had the jerk salmon wrap and tomato bisque soup. 1. It makes no sense for that soup to be that good. I was FEEning! 2. Both the panini and wrap were great but what type of crack sauce is that in the wrap?! Needless to say, I will be back and soon!"
4/4/2018,4 star rating,A coworker took me here for lunch and I actually liked my order. It was very busy. I recommend you call ahead of time. I heard their smoothies are really good.  Will go back to try that next time I'm in the area.
4/1/2018,4 star rating,"My first time visiting after hearing about the cafe so many times and I was very pleased with the offerings and the customer service. The prices were decent. After pulling up & parking I looked at the video of the cafe on ""Chicago Eats"" and I ordered the jerk chicken on a spinach wrap. It was featured in the video. I asked for everything on it & the sauce on the side. I also ordered the tropical smoothie. Plenty of chicken, just enough of everything else except for the red onions; too heavy. The chicken was not too spicy the ingredients were fresh and the sauce wasn't the jerk sauce I expected, but it was tasty! The wrap came with a bag of chips. But the smoothie! It was the best smoothie I've had in a long time! It had strawberries, peaches, mangos & raspberry sherbert! I think it's my new favorite treat! I'm definitely taking a trip there to try more of their menu..."

4/10/2019,5 star rating,I went in here twice last week all in the same day. The Caribbean jerk wrap was spectacular and the crunch cupcake ... don't get me started. I'm still savoring the beauty of it in the fridge lmaoo. I was never a fan of chicken salad but when I say they have the best jerk chicken salad. I'm officially addicted and will go here anytime
9/12/2017,4 star rating,"Great please for Wrap/Salad/Panini! Have daily soups, ice cream and smoothies too. Usually there is a line during lunch, would recommend calling in your order. Place has water with cucumbers as a refreshment for everyone. The service is great, they bring your order to you when you eat in. :-)"

5/29/2016,5 star rating,"I dined in at Ain't She Sweet yesterday afternoon after hearing from several people about how good it was. I was not disappointed. I ordered ""Da Steve"" and a Tropical Breeze smoothie. Both were delicious. The restaurant itself was tastefully decorated, clean, and had an overall pleasant atmosphere. The customer service was good. The food was good. I totally recommend Ain't She Sweet to anyone who is looking for a nice place to have lunch in Bronzeville. I'll definitely be back."

2/25/2014,5 star rating,"We went here today for lunch.  This was a recommendation from Facebook.First impressions are always best.  This is  a really cool spot that is very cozy. The decor was eclectic and hip.  Actually a very relaxed atmosphere.   We were greeted with a smiles.  The menu had a variety of options. From sandwiches, wraps, soups, and smoothies.  I picked the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Spinach wrap.  We sat and within a very short time.  Our wraps were out. Presentation was on point. The wrap was nice and hot.  The flavor had my tongue dancing. I'm a huge fan of spices. We were so very pleased with ambiance, service and the food.  We also had a chance to meet & chat with the owner (Margo).Extremely nice and friendly.  I noticed she greeted everyone and had small talk with them.  A very special touch.   Then a small piece of Carmel Cake was calling me. Very lite & moist. This foodie was indeed satisfied!Looking forward to the next time!"

7/2/2016,5 star rating,"Ain't She Sweet is always a hit. If you are ever in the Bronzeville or Hype park area it's a great place to go for lunch. I haven't had anything that I didn't like thus far! I've had the Jerk chicken bowl, jerk wrap, buffalo chicken wraps and I've been here many times. The shakes and smoothies are delicious. If I'm ever in the mood for cage food this is my go to place it's great! Beware if you go in around lunch time it maybe crowded! They have seating and the ambiance is really nice and laid back. The service is excellent."
3/26/2016,5 star rating,"Great customer service!! The turkey croissant sandwich could have a little more meat and a lot less mustard and mayonnaise (honestly mayonnaise is not my favorite ). The chicken panini with roasted tomatoes was amazing, the jerk chicken salad was tasty but the color is  a bit of a turn off. They have the  most amazing banana cake EVER!!!! I will definitely be back and would highly recommend you visit.Disclosure: I'm a very picky eater. Can't you tell? Lol"
3/20/2018,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places when I am in the Bronzeville area.  I stopped in after a Doctor's appointment and ordered food for my family to go.  My order was the tomato bisque soup, turkey sandwich, the jerk chicken bowl and a sandwich called the Steve. All I can say about The Steve is try it!  It is delish. Everything was so good and fresh!  I would definitely recommend the jerk chicken bowl if you like spice!  The turkey sandwich was perfect for my Mom who does not like spicy!  The place was packed but received my order in a timely manner.  There are so many options to choose from on the menu: salads, sandwiches, wraps, soups, cakes, pies and smoothies. I can't wait to go back and try something new!"

2/16/2018,1 star rating,Customer service is piss poor. They have the kind customer service that makes it hard to support black business. Working in this sort of field your main job when working the front end is to ensure the customer have an easy buying experience and not feel belittled when spending money at the establishment. Sad to say I had to take my business to lite house grill instead. I was ordering for a group of teacher who more than likely would've came back.

9/22/2017,1 star rating,The 1st time I came here was with a friend from work and we ordered the jerk wraps which were delicious....well I decided to order a milkshake and we had to wait 20 minutes for that shake which pissed me off because they cut into my time to be able to sit and eat. Well I just left there again going to get another shake because I was in the area and when I say I am beyond pissed I will NEVER return to this place....i had to wait 30 FUCKING minutes for a damn milkshake....never again!!!!

5/6/2015,5 star rating,"I'm so glad I found Ain't She Sweet Cafe! I am pregnant, and my baby was not in the mood for anything from my usual Bronzeville lunch spots. I jumped on yelp and found Ain't She Sweet. This place is fantastic. They have a wide selection of sandwiches, wraps, soups, and baked goods. The woman in front of me ordered a smoothie which sounded fabulous. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Wrap which I believe is one of their top sellers. I asked the woman behind the counter for an estimated wait time, and she informed me that everything was 5 minutes. Even though it was just before noon, the short weight time was accurate. I just inhaled my wrap, and my baby is very  happy. The ingredients were super fresh, flavorful, and I didn't feel guilty or feel like I was about to slip into a food coma. The interior is lovely. Cafe style tables and chairs. Tasteful wall art, and a television. Cucumber water while you wait was a nice touch. As I leaving, I was chatting with one of the workers.I told her I worked up the street at Phillips High School, and she informed me that on Mondays educators get $2 off sandwiches. Hooray! Another reason to return."
8/29/2015,4 star rating,"Having just moved to Chicago, This is my first review!!!Seems to be a local fav. Went during lunch hour on a Thursday and even with the city road work right outside along the whole storefront's street, it was bustling and the line grew quite quickly (glad i got there sooner rather than later).favorite seems to be the Jerk chicken in many forms (sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc). Theres a case of desserts too (Brownies and sweet potato pie/cake), and I also saw soups of the day on menu. The Tomato Basil was delicious! Brownies were decadent, almost as if it was fudge in the middle (def not the bread kind!).There's Wi-Fi, but too bad it wasnt clear if there was parking, there's a grassy area next to the store, but it was filled with cars and if you get stuck behind another car you coudlnt get out. Best to park in the neighborhood streets behind the store, esp with the construction. FYI - no coffee on menu i think."

12/17/2017,5 star rating,I absolutely love the tomato and spinach bisque and the jerk chicken wrap. I do wish the bisque was sold in a larger size because I always find myself coming back to order more. I've just about every sandwich and i love getting them on croissant. Every dessert has also been good. I'd recommend calling in your Oder for pick up because the line can be a bit long especially during lunch hours. If you're in Bronzeville this is definitely a place to stop and grab lunch.
9/12/2017,5 star rating,"The food on the menu here is consistently delicious and amazingly affordable. I started out ordering the Jerk Chicken bowl, and then branched out to the Jerk Chicken wrap. I've recently moved on to the grilled chicken cheddar sandwich and the jerk chicken salad. The jerk seasoning they use is moderately spicy, but they include a habenero sauce for those that need to feel the burn. The sandwiches are also loaded with so many flavorful toppings and the croissant is buttered so well, that the sandwich is often gone before I realize it. I always call ahead to make sure I don't have to wait, but during the lunch rush, there is inevitably a wait to check out. Overall I'm in love with the menu and I'm so glad to have this Cafe in bronzeville!"

12/21/2015,3 star rating,"The jerk chicken wrap is the best thing on the menu.  A few of my friends are always satisfied when they order ""The Steve"".I would definitely try to figure out why the lines are so long.  The ordering process can be upwards of 25 minutes.  This isn't good especially for people that have 30 min or even an hour lunch break.Overall, its a nice mom & pop shop.  People are generally nice if you catch them on a good day.  Let me be clear that they are't ""RUDE"" but they aren't that nice either.  You have to really lay on the charm for them sometimes to be met with a smile.I also think the prices are a little too high considering the area and what is being offered.  I normally pay a similar price at Jason's Deli for a better overall dining experience.I also don't like that they are closed on Sundays!  Huge bummer."

Pretty standard cafe with sandwiches, wraps, and salads, but everything is pretty well done. I have had a couple of the wraps such as the Chipotle Chicken and the Caribbean Jerk which were moist. The soup (tomato basil spinach bisque) was better than expected as well. Probably would have gave this place a solid four stars if they weren't so slow. Not sure if it's an issue with workflow or me coming in at the wrong times, but I have waited between 30-45 minutes for my food each time."

But if you want some good food, here is the place to be!"
3/28/2017,5 star rating,"This is my favorite sandwich shop! Love love ""Da Steve"" and the jerk wrap!! The smoothies are really good too!! Food is consistent and Margo is a sweetie!"
11/9/2016,4 star rating,I have had the jerk chicken wrap twice now and might I say they are fairly consistent across the board. Very delicious for lunch.
3/31/2017,1 star rating,"This is by far the most horrible experience I've ever had at any restaurant period. Very unprofessional and unorganized. Charged me $10 extra and then did not want to address the mistake they made. The person at the register was very rude and condescending. She charged me extra and basically said she can't do nothing about it when I asked why was my food $22 for 2 things. I would never go here again. This is why I have a hard time supporting black businesses because they really are unprofessional and they don't care. The food wasn't even all that great especially to be over charged and disrespected. Maybe I came on the wrong day, but it is what it is. I guarantee they won't get another dollar from me, hell they already owe me $10 that I was over charged. I wish I could them zero stars."
6/1/2015,4 star rating,Good and fast for sandwiches! I got the jerk chicken and it was tasty and a bit spicy. Also they make delicious smoothies. Their sandwiches range between $7-$10. The smoothies are $3.95 for small and $4-something for large.It is a small cafe inside with a TV and friendly workers.
8/1/2015,5 star rating,"I just tried this place this morning, I've passed by it before and finally decided to try it. This is a great hidden gem in a neighborhood that could use more cafes and other businesses in the area I hope more things come around! It's really nice on the inside too. I got a Jerk Chicken wrap and a Tropical Breeze smoothie, they were delicious! And all for $11 I will definitely be coming back here again!"
5/2/2008,5 star rating,"I think this cafe/sandwich shop/ice cream parlor is so cute.  You could easily drive right past and never notice this place, but it's definitely worth stopping in if your in the area.  I like to bike over to this cafe for lunch on the weekends.  Their salads are nice, fresh, and simple, just the way I like them!  The club sandwich is huge, and the wraps look so tasty (friends said they were good, but I haven't had one yet).  I also really like their smoothies because they are not yogurt based (they'll add it if you want).    The only bad thing is that the food does not come out instantly.  They have to prepare everything, so it takes a lot longer than fast food.  But I've discovered that you can easily call in advance, place an order, and pick it up!  If you are ever in the Bronzeville area you should check it out!"
1/26/2015,3 star rating,"This is great place for lunch. The food is very good and consistently fresh. The staff is generally friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. I would advise the owners to improve the ventilation. I went to pick-up lunch and smell like I have been working an 8 hour shift in the kitchen. In addition, they could be a bit more friendly to customers. They are not rude, per se, but not overly friendly.Update: I come here like once per week for lunch. The owner ""Margo"" is very unfriendly....that takes this place down notch."
3/3/2010,5 star rating,"I love this place.  What a wonderful addition to the community!  I eat lunch here probably once a week.  It's as diet-friendly as you want it to be.  The ingredients in the salads, sandwiches and smoothies are always fresh.   In these colder months, I especially enjoy the tomato spinach bisque.  If you find yourself in the neighborhood, definitely pop in for a treat!"
5/21/2017,4 star rating,The jerk chicken spinach  wrap is literally to die for! I literally have to travel from the north side of chicago  to the southside to eat this mouth watering wrap. I also tried the turkey club sandwich which was amazing! Everything is fresh made to order. The deserts are amazing!  I hope the owner opens a location in the northside! That's my recommendation..
8/16/2017,5 star rating,Delicious!!! Consistently fresh and flavorful! The jerk chicken wrap is off the chain in addition to their tomato spinach bisque soup! Their smoothies are fresh and have just the right amount of honey. Employees are always super friendly and professional. And they are fast!! Keep it up!
9/30/2016,5 star rating,"Very good food, fresh and excellent desert. They have a nice variety on the menu. Unfortunately they're closed on Sundays."
8/6/2016,5 star rating,"Generous portions, reasonable prices, a wide variety of choices, and very friendly service. A great gem in Bronzeville!"
7/27/2016,5 star rating,"A hole in the wall type GEM. This place is as delicious as it is cute, hospitable, and perfectly priced - which is 5/5 to me! It's a little loud, but that's merely  evidence of how full of life this place truly possesses!"
7/17/2016,5 star rating,"I've just found my new Bronzeville gem! Every time I go I get the Jerk wrap. Great light food alternative and still very filling.. They also have smoothies, milkshakes, bowls, salads, delectable desserts! All freshly made! I take a special trip just to come here!"
7/14/2016,5 star rating,"If I could give this place 10 STARS I would! I come here almost every day and the customer service is ALWAYS flawless... The food is EXCELLENT , and the desserts leave you in a tranquil place of sugar heaven!! The dining area is clean and the atmosphere is POSITIVE!! Love this place!"
7/2/2016,5 star rating,"Ain't She Sweet is always a hit. If you are ever in the Bronzeville or Hype park area it's a great place to go for lunch. I haven't had anything that I didn't like thus far! I've had the Jerk chicken bowl, jerk wrap, buffalo chicken wraps and I've been here many times. The shakes and smoothies are delicious. If I'm ever in the mood for cage food this is my go to place it's great! Beware if you go in around lunch time it maybe crowded! They have seating and the ambiance is really nice and laid back. The service is excellent."
6/30/2016,5 star rating,We were visiting from Canada and staying at an AirBNB around the corner and saw this place on Yelp. We came in our first day before we had a chance to do groceries and it was great. The wraps/sandwiches we had were incredible and the smoothies were sooo amazing. We ended up coming back on our last day just to get more smoothies because they were so good. I definitely suggest this place to anyone in the area. The staff are so nice in here.
6/7/2016,5 star rating,"Yum!!  Way to go Bronzeville! When my friend suggested heading here for lunch, I was scratched my head thinking I had been here once a LONG time ago before I actually lived in Chicago. Anyway, we walked in right before a huge rush... thankfully... and ordered. I wanted to try absolutely everything on the menu because it all looked good. I opted for the special of the day which was a jerk chicken bowl and it did not disappoint. I also had a peach mango smoothie which really hit the spot. As if that wasn't enough I also had... just kidding... that was it... then I went home and took a nap!"
5/29/2016,5 star rating,"I dined in at Ain't She Sweet yesterday afternoon after hearing from several people about how good it was. I was not disappointed. I ordered ""Da Steve"" and a Tropical Breeze smoothie. Both were delicious. The restaurant itself was tastefully decorated, clean, and had an overall pleasant atmosphere. The customer service was good. The food was good. I totally recommend Ain't She Sweet to anyone who is looking for a nice place to have lunch in Bronzeville. I'll definitely be back."
3/26/2016,5 star rating,"Great customer service!! The turkey croissant sandwich could have a little more meat and a lot less mustard and mayonnaise (honestly mayonnaise is not my favorite ). The chicken panini with roasted tomatoes was amazing, the jerk chicken salad was tasty but the color is  a bit of a turn off. They have the  most amazing banana cake EVER!!!! I will definitely be back and would highly recommend you visit.Disclosure: I'm a very picky eater. Can't you tell? Lol"
12/24/2016,4 star rating,Great place for good lunch! Love there salads and soups.. also I do enjoy the variety of smoothies they have also
3/16/2017,5 star rating,"I've fallen in love on my very first visit! First off, the customer service was on point. They were friendly, attentive and quite helpful with recommendations. Secondly, the food was amazing. After checking out the menu online, I knew I was going for the jerk chicken wrap. I was undecided on which type of smoothie I was going to have and the young lady recommended the tropical berry so I went with it. While our food was being prepared, my friend and I held a conversation with the owner, Margo, who was just down to earth, hence, the name AIN'T SHE SWEET! A perfect fit for that business and I definitely would recommend this spot if you're looking for a tasty sandwich and soup."
5/20/2017,4 star rating,Good food great customer service. My favorite is the jerk chicken wrap on spinach and the tropical breezer smoothie. Wait times can be very long during lunch time but they except call in orders which is a plus!
9/17/2018,5 star rating,"Really great customer service! First off, I'm a huuuge advocate for black businesses that provide good customer service. And this place was really up there. They took my order in a timely fashion. Brought my food out to me and thanked me for my business upon doing so. I've also seen a few employees get the door for customers as they were leaving when the employees were in the area. Apart from the customer service, the food was pretty solid as well. I got the jerk chicken wrap and it was good. If you want a nice lightly spicy/healthy mix, it's a good wrap choice. I also got a smoothie which was also good. I spent the day working out of the cafe on my laptop and just observed the business and its employees. I'm really happy to have a place like this that's nicely run in my community =)"
3/17/2018,1 star rating,"The food is good but this is my second time going there and the service was bad both times for ordering a beverage, I ordered a smoothie this time and as my previous time I didn't receive it and that's fine because I got a refund, but what was troubling is the owner was standing at the register and didn't bother to apologize or accommodate it's almost like she was pissed that I asked for a refund, neither did the young lady at the register apologize I will never go back there to support her business"
10/10/2014,4 star rating,"Ok. So I gave this place another try, and boy am I glad I did!Their jerk wrap is bangin'!! Really, it's really that good.My only complaint. The cooks seems to yell from their stations asking what you would like to order, and I was not sure about the different varieties of bread you could receive with your wrap, so when the cook asked me ""What were you having?"", I said "" I would like the jerk wrap,"" and she's like ""And on what?"". Ok..First you never assume a customer has been here before, and I also think that orders should just be left for the cashier to handle.But other than that I have been back numerous of times for that jerk wrap!"
3/4/2012,2 star rating,"Nice Store..Ok Sandwiches..A-OK salads. I purchased 3 groupons to this place, expecting to have some decent food, but what they gave me was just OK, nothing too fancy, or shall I say nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. And the time it took to get my food...Too long! I have one more Groupon to redeem, hopefully this one will atleast save this business on my ""tried, but not going back list."""
10/5/2016,5 star rating,"Very cute place.  Very good food.  I had the salad with the mandarin oranges and strawberries.  It is very very delicious! I love the interior of the place it is super cute.  I also love the sweets table, which I will have to check out next time.  Everything is made fresh and ready to order.  Try it out, you won't be disappointed."
9/6/2014,5 star rating,I like the food here that is what keeps me coming back but the customer service needs some work. I stood at the register waiting for someone to take my order while she was on the phone. I think it was the owner or manager. Customers come first in my opinion...she should have had them hold on...IJS
4/20/2018,1 star rating,I would not patronize this place at gunpoint. Definitely not a lunch time. I called in for pickup several times and 90% the order was wrong or not lost. It seems like they answer the phone without writing the orders down. I ordered a Jerk Salmon wrap once and ended up with Chicken. I have been a faithful patron since they were located on Cottage Grove. My loyalty and understanding is over.

I actually managed to spill my cucumber water within minutes of sitting down and they came over to help clean up without even the slightest fuss. This place isn't fancy, but yes they had cucumbers in the free water cooler :)Best panini ever. I would definitely go again."
3/4/2017,5 star rating,Aint She Sweet is the bomb! They have the best sandwiches and wraps! My favorite sandwich is Da Steve and my favorite wrap is Jerk Chicken Wrap. I been a fan of this cafe since it was on Cottage Grove. The icecream and smoothies are amazing!
12/7/2016,3 star rating,"First time I have ever ordered from this place, the woman who answered the phone was a little rude about not willing to exchange the wrap w another option...had to convince her that it should not be that difficult to make a sandwich instead of a wrap with the same ingredients. The jerk chicken was delicious, but was not happy w the da Steve and the potato salad."
2/22/2016,4 star rating,"YES SHE IS!!!!... I was VERY pleased!! I've been there TWICE. BOTH times I had a Sweet Dreams smoothie made from Orange Sherbert & Vanilla Ice Cream. OH YESSS!!!... I also had a Jerk Chicken Wrap...Very delicious and light!!!... I also had ""da Steve"" that was SOOO yummy....  a slice of Sweet Potato Pound Cake, and a slice of Sweet Potato Pie....('scuse me for a moment of silence...) OK, I'm back.  BOTH were THAT good!!!! OMG!!! It's not often that I hand out 5 stars...and I still won't. NOT because of anything THEY did. They can't help that they have lines!!!... I mean the food IS ...GREAT...Maybe, I'll call in my order in the future. Other than that..... YES!!!!"

10/11/2016,4 star rating,Just enjoyed a sandwich entitled Simply Panini. The sandwich was simply delicious. It was accompanied with a pickle and a bag of chips. I dined in during the lunch hour. Ain't She Sweet Cafe maintained a steady clientele of customers. Excellent service and venue.

5/15/2013,4 star rating,I had a free Belly Bite for this cute little cafe and decided to give it a try.I got the Veggie Delight sandwich but as a spinach wrap instead. Service was fast and friendly and the wrap was yummy! This is a cute little place with tons of free street parking right in front of the cafe.  Adorable inside as well and tons of seating!

2/11/2013,5 star rating,"I decided to patronize a business in the area and am VERY HAPPY I did! Highly recommend it!I wanted to get a well rounded experience, so tried multiple things. I had the Jerk Chicken wrap (toasted) which was AWESOME! I also had the tomato soup the man suggested. He gave me a sample and I was sold, very thick and tasty. And then, I tried a smoothie. I asked what type of orange juice they would use in it (as they have several with OJ as key ingredient) and It was Deans. Personally, that's a cheap/lower grade OJ that I wouldn't serve at home, so I was a little disappointed. The sand which and soup made up for the Deans though and it may be just a personal thing. lol I will definitely be back as that wrap and soup ROCKED. A couple other things, I got there right around opening and the man working was very friendly and working hard, but he was alone. So it got busy around 11:30 and a little backed up. Shortly after a lady (owner I think) showed up, which helped."
12/10/2012,5 star rating,"This is hands down my go-to spot for sandwiches, soups, smoothies and more!Paninis: The Reuben, The Spartan and The Tuscany are divine. Always fresh ingredients. Not subway fresh. Fresh, fresh.Smoothies: Tropical Breezer and Weight Watcher blended to heavenly perfection.Salads: Chicago and Bronzeville (need I write more?)"
7/10/2018,4 star rating,"Great place. I live having this welcoming spot in Bronzeville. The most helpful and sweet staff you could ever meet. The pace with Welch the staff work in this eatery is so harmonious.  It's the perfect partner of its neighbor, Sip and Savor. I love that they listen to their customer base and when we wanted combos, they offered it!"
3/11/2016,5 star rating,This place is wonderful. The tomato bisque soup is the BEST! I love their egg salad too! Friendly staff and independently owned. Definitely worth checking out

It was kinda on the spicy side, just how I like it :) The smoothies are very good too. I tried the weight watchers drink with a little honey. It wasn't too sweet and not too heavy. I would definitely buy that drink again. Overall, I had a great experience. Can't wait to go back and try more of the food!"

2/5/2015,4 star rating,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the Jerk Chicken Wrap on Tomato Basil Wrap, after initially being unable to decide from a surprisingly broad menu of items. I also ordered a ""mixer"", which is basically a blended smoothie with fruit juice & raspberry sorbet. Everything comes out fresh and well-prepared; the entire meal was delicious. The ambience is cool and definitely feels like a local, neighborhood spot--which is a big reason why you would come here. Dine-in service was good and prompt. A jewel in the Bronzeville community. My lone tip for the owner: expand your business hours. Hard to believe this place opens late at 10a each day (11a on Saturdays) and closes very early at 6p! This makes it difficult for many who work in the city (like myself) to make it here during the week as a take-out dinner option."
6/11/2015,4 star rating,"Had da Steve it was great 30MIN WAIT I wish they had two lines one for call-in an one to place order. They need to hire a little more help the order taker has to many jobs answering the phone,filling order,filling water jug in lobby cleaning tables. JUST TOOOOO MUCH."
1/4/2015,5 star rating,I loooove the jerk chicken wrap so that alone gets 5 stars from me! It is also a treat to have such a great cafe in Bronzeville. Sometimes the service leaves something to be desired...you don't always get a warm greeting and the one time I tried to call ahead I was on hold for 8 minutes before giving up. Despite the sometimes lack of friendly service I didn't knock them down a star because the food is that good and the prices are reasonable.
8/10/2015,5 star rating,No complaints!!! Love this place.   The jerk wrap is on FIRE! Love it! Probably grab one today...I can only catch this place on my off days--like today.
4/15/2013,4 star rating,"From my initial experience, I'd like to go back to re-rate this 4 stars right now due to customer service. The owner, Margo, personally saw my review on YELP and decided to send me a personal message on how she would like to make up for my unpleasant experience. To me, that means such a great deal. It is not everyday were you get a personal message from the owner, who really feels passionate about their business and wants to make sure the customer is happy. This made me feel happy! And of course, I'd still love to patronage you!!! :0) I just thought I would share this with other YELPERS."
4/2/2013,1 star rating,"I wanna like you ""Aint She Sweet""... I especially wanna support you because you are on 43rd and a black ran business...but I just can't get down. I am not sure what all the hype is about, and I am kind of perturbed that I even wasted my time to patronage the business. I know that may be harsh, but I have to be honest. What went wrong...well let me list it out for you. 1. I did have a Belly deal here...if you are curious to try it out, I advise you to  try it out with Belly...that way you are not gaining or losing. I ordered both of my sandwiches via phone because I was told through numerous folks they are slow when prepping orders. No problem, so I order: jerk chicken wrap, and the DA Steve (this is what everyone suggest getting here). Go up to grab my sandwiches, tell the guy (who I later find out is the owner) I have a Belly deal--and he seemed to be a bit perturbed. He told me I was suppose to say I have a belly deal before I called in because I am not suppose to get chips with the order. I was shocked because it doesn't advise me to do this on Belly and I have been using Belly for the past 6 months--never ran into this issue. So to me, it ain't my problem, take it up with Belly. By the way, they were 50 cent bag of Lay's Chips--it's not like it's organic! Get a grip lololol. So of course, he took them out the bag (no problem with me) and I paid for just one sandwich (again, Belly has it where you get one free). 2. Get home, get my sandwich NOT IMPRESSED FOLKS ( I actually was rather furious). I pay 8.00 bucks for one sandwich...and WHY?! Da Steve tasted and looked like it was thrown together....I didn't realize hot peppers came on a croissant sandwich (in my opinion is a no no). I took one bite, and threw it in the trash. It honestly tasted like slop.  The Jerk Wrap---nothing spectacular at all. Jerk Chicken pieces in a wrap...yep, that's it.  3. I don't understand why you are charging this much for sandwiches...wrapped in serran wrap in paper cartons. I understand I am not gonna get an organic made sandwich on 43rd but at least give me a 8 buck worthy sandwich (worth the gas and the time to make the sandwich). Needless to say, I won't be back. Sorry dude. :("
1/2/2016,5 star rating,This review is based on takeout. I always order the jerk chicken wrap on spinach. My God it kept me coming back for more. Delicious.
3/16/2012,5 star rating,"I live in the area and there aren't too many other thriving businesses so it's absolutely shocking that I've never been here. But it's true. Now that I've sampled the amazing food, however, I hope to become a regular!I came here with a friend because she works in the area and she had a Groupon burning a whole in her pocket. I was more than happy to help her spend her virtual dollars. So we mosied on over during lunch.The scene: The restaurant is very nicely decorated with local photographs and art work. There's a nice mix of music playing on the sound system at just the right volume. It's sunny and friendly. The place was packed around noon but the line moved quickly and seats became available quickly. The process: You grab your drinks from the cooler, order and pay at the counter, and grab a seat. All the magic happens right in front of your eyes. In a perfectly clean, orderly kitchen with pleasant employees. It's like a happiness factory!The eating frenzy: We ordered a jerk chicken wrap and a veggie panini. A friendly man brought us the food and a small bag of chips. We split the order so we each could have a taste. And then the pigging out began. I bit into the panini and experienced vegetarian heaven. But then...the jerk chicken wrap. Sweet heavenly goodness, this was amazing. Like pure joy, right in your mouth!The moral of the story: I've wasted enough precious time not knowing about this jerk chicken wrap of the Gods. You should not make the same mistake. Go now!"
8/24/2017,5 star rating,Da Steve is amazing.  Other food options looked awesome.  Quick and courteous service.  Smoothie was fresh.  Nice atmosphere to sit down.  Reasonable prices.

3/1/2016,5 star rating,Jamaican jerk chicken with coconut rice bowl is out of this world. Staff is all SUPER friendly and loving - it feels like walking into your family's kitchen/living room. By far my favorite lunch spot in the area.
7/11/2015,5 star rating,"Pretty delicious! I had the jerk chicken sandwich and it was great. Moist and well seasoned chicken, crisp veggies and a spicy jerk sauce/mayo that gave my sandwich a zippy bite. Yum!"
10/2/2014,5 star rating,"Wow.  Service was great and polite. But the food was that much better. I order the jerk chicken salad sandwich and it was DELICIOUS!!!  The jerk had the just right seasoning/spice and the chicken was juice. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago, just for this sandwich"
5/12/2009,5 star rating,"This place is a wonderful local cafe owned and run by wonderful local folk. Also, they support local artists. They really are a community oriented establishment and not another corporate franchise. They do a really good job too.  I will always prefer to give my money to places that are really supporting and engaging with their local community. Additionally, they do have fantastic food. The sandwiches are HUGE. I mean really huge. Like 6 inches tall. and so delicious. It really is the perfect south side lunch spot."
8/29/2015,5 star rating,I'm obsessed with the jerk chicken on a spinach wrap (with everything). Their tomato bisque soup is also delicious. I haven't tried the whole menu but my tried and true is always phenomenal and the service is pretty average for the stop-in-and-go sandwich shop. I recommend everyone to try this place at least once. It's a lovely shop with good food and smoothies.
2/22/2011,4 star rating,I like this place. I've been a few times and the sandwiches are good and you get a huge sandwich for what you pay. My only gripe is that I really like their smoothies and I usually get the same one every time I go but each time it tastes different from the last. So far it has been the BEST when the owner herself makes it. YUM!
8/7/2015,5 star rating,Fantastic cafe. My business staff loves this place. We frequently get their catered assortment tray of signature sandwiches. Clients love them - especially the Jerk Chicken Wrap.
9/25/2014,5 star rating,Great food. They have so much to choose from. The smoothies are good too. I introduced some friend of mine to this place and they are still going here. The service is excellent. Everyone is friendly and nice.

4/26/2015,4 star rating,This is a very small but quaint restaurant. Food is very good. The people are very friendly. it has the feel of going into a family member's home for lunch.

9/21/2011,4 star rating,"I had heard a lot of good things about this place and I confirmed them today--it is a gem.  Nicely decorated with unique art pieces, even the bathroom, which means a lot to me--I think you can tell a lot about a restaurant from the bathroom!The food was good--creative and fresh cafe food.  I had the fiesta salad.  I've never had a salad that had so much fruit on it and somehow it worked. A tad sweet for my taste but that is just me. My kids shared a veggie panini and seemed to enjoy it. I was impressed that they managed to get broccoli into the sandwich mix.  My dad had the jerk chicken wrap and said it was delicious--my husband recommended the wrap from his earlier visit.  These are only suggestions, not complaints: the waitstaff could be a little more inviting/instructive.  It was our first time so we didnt know and there were no signs about where to sit or order, if they bring it out or if they have you pick it up at the counter.  Its pretty obvious that you order at the register but the two guys behind the counter sort of hung back in the open kitchen and took my order from there.  That was a little awkward but then he came out set our table and brought our food, which was a nice touch that I wasn't expecting--I thought it was a pick up deal.  Anyway, charming spot.  Even my dad who doesn't like trying new things liked it."
2/9/2014,4 star rating,Fresh and delicious!!! Every time I go I get the jerk chicken wrap and tomato bisque soup it's So scrumptious . I really want to try something else but it's difficult to deviate from a sandwich that's SO tasty!!
8/11/2015,4 star rating,"Very nice cafe located in Kenwood, somewhat of a hole in the wall because it's easy to miss. Great atmosphere inside, it is always busy so the line gets annoying but the service is good for the most part. Jerk chicken wrap is great & the smoothies are also good. Assortment of sweets from cake to cookies to pie are all very good also."
6/3/2012,4 star rating,"One of my favorite neighborhood spots.  I loooove the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Wrap.  I could even have it spicier, but know that most people do not like things as hot as I do.   The smoothies are also very good, especially the tropical breezer.  The smoothies are not the most healthy because it's not all just fruit.  They are made with  syrups and fruit juices.  If you're not calorie counting, they hit the spot.  I go at least 2-3 a month for lunch or dinner.I wish the hours were longer, but maybe with more traffic and business this will change with time.  I do think sometimes a meal can be slightly expensive depending on what you get, but nothing unreasonable.The customer service is generally great.  The faces are friendly and the owner when she's present is always pleasant.  Definitely a place you want to try.  I have taken sooo many people here and they have all really liked it!"
7/30/2015,4 star rating,"I have to say, the staff was friendly, the decor was clean and bright with interesting art; but most importantly, the food was good!  Their Jerk Chicken wrap is really good! It was fresh, it was filling and it fed me. I would recommend it to others! They have a good selection of other wraps and sandwiches and also have specials. From the quality of food I had, I wouldn't be surprised the items are of high quality as well. They offered smoothies, and coffee, too. Plus, they have a cooler of drinks in case those are not up to you speed. There seems to be an option for everyone. Their customer service was top notch, the lady (who may have been the owner) took my order and made sure I got everything I needed. Nice, courteous, customer service that shows you care is a plus anywhere! Ain't She Sweet Cafe is indeed a sweet place to eat!"
7/10/2011,4 star rating,"We were running a financial aid workshop for our students (Chicago Scholars) at the Urban League and they recommended this place for lunch. I brought our staff and guest speaker here and we enjoyed it very much. Bright, open space, with good sandwich variety. We all enjoyed our selections. The jerk chicken got a rave. I had the Spartan, which was good.Afterwards I decided to have some ice cream and ordered two scoops (about $3.00) which came out like five, scooped by the owner herself, who was very nice and clearly involved in running the place. A nice local spot."
8/14/2012,4 star rating,"My favorite thing on the menu is the chicken Cesar wrap. It's delicious!!The tropical breezer smoothie is also a  MUST TRY!!! I actually think this place is a bit pricey after becoming a frequent visitor but even still it's one of the best restaurant's in the area. Therefore, I think it's worth it to splurge."
2/6/2012,3 star rating,I bought a groupon for Ain't that Sweet and decided to try the jerk chicken wrap. I didn't like the jerk sauce so the sandwich wasn't very enjoyable but the ingredients were fresh and otherwise tasted pretty good. I think if I'd followed my first mind and bought the grilled chicken caesar wrap I would've enjoyed it much better.The portion size is generous and you get a lot of food for your money. I ordered takeout but the inside of the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. Ain't She Sweet is a definite gem in an otherwise struggling up-in-coming area. The one drawback was the customer service. The guy at the counter wasn't very attentive and seemed to be more concerned with what was going on over my shoulder rather than what was coming out of my mouth.Even still I'd give this place another chance and would recommend it to anyone passing through the area.
1/6/2014,5 star rating,Best soup & sandwiches in bronzville! So many healthy choices on the menu! I would recommend the tomato & spinach bisque soup & jerk chicken wrap on spinach! I also love the fact they server cucumber water everyday!
3/20/2017,3 star rating,"I've only gone to the new location in Beverly. I love supporting black owned businesses and was excited there was one in my neighborhood.  The food is delicious but the wait was unacceptably long.  45 minutes for two sandwiches. When I asked the young lady about my order she was non-responsive. The owner, on the other hand,  was apologetic and offered to refund my money.  I declined as it wasn't about the money... more about my time.  I will order again,  but will call in my order in advance!"

Me and my office frequent this place no less than 1-3 times with pretty big orders , on occasion we send someone to grab the order for us. Well to cut to the chase there has been forgotten items on more than one occasion , no big... But today I placed a phone order and asked for a particular flavor , now I've been told before when they forget to give the person our smoothies that they make them upon arrival. Well today must've been different , I was told that the smoothies are made before hand and I wasn't allowed to change my mind or else I wont be able to place a phone order again in the future .. Really punishment for changing my mind !!!! Well with that being said Ms Sweet your not so sweet after all !!! I'll miss you no longer will me or my staff patronize for such a small problem that could have easily been resolved.."

12/23/2013,4 star rating,The food is really good. Came here on a Saturday looking to try it out. My girlfriend recommended the jerk chicken wrap since I was in the mood for jerk chicken. Her recommendation was correct. The wrap was very delicious. I can definitely say that I'll be back. It was so good that I had to get one to go. I do wish the prices were a little cheaper but I don't mind paying for good food.
2/15/2017,4 star rating,Went and got a jerk wrap today and it has really fallen off. It's been almost a year since the last time I've been however I use to go very often. The wraps are skimpy on meat and sauce is not as good as it use to be.
3/21/2015,5 star rating,"Ain't She Sweet maybe one of the best places to eat in Chicago! The service is amazing. The food is amazing. There is absolutely nowhere in Chicago that can give you a better Jerk Chicken Wrap. Their  shakes are amazing. I absolutely love all of the staff. I am good friends with the owner and she works very hard to keep the establishment high in the ranks. I would recommend this place over any place in Chicago. Sit down, have a meeting, eat you a wrap, and go on with your day. I'm going to buy this place from her one day!"
1/1/2013,5 star rating,"I love this place.  It is the whole thing.  The atmosphere, the people, the staff and of course, the food.Please try the jerk chicken wrap on spinach.  The flavor is perfect.  It is perfectly spicy and the chicken is perfectly tender.  Not too much, not too little of anything.Simply put, PERFECT.Oh, try the smoothies, they are all good!!!"

10/29/2013,4 star rating,"I can't get enough if this place. Such a little jewel in the bronzeville neighborhood. Fresh ingredients and very high quality. My favorite is the chicken Caesar salad, Da Steve sandwich...and the oh so delicious tomato and spinach bisque soup. I swear if they sold that soup in bulk...I would buy it all! The only downside is the place is very pricey for the amount you get. I almost feel like the owner continues to increase her prices."
11/8/2012,4 star rating,"My girlfriend and I have been patrons of Ain't She Sweet Cafe for years now, beginning with its previous location on 45th and Cottage Grove. This place offers a menu chocked full of outstanding wraps, salads, paninis and smoothies that are great in the summer or winter (honestly, Chicago only has two seasons.) We certainly enjoy going here and I encourage anyone who's on the fence to give it a try. There are an inordinate number of places selling burgers, gyros, chicken, and chicken gyro burgers every 20 feet in Bronzeville. Support the business that stand out and offer quality options that are healthy and delicious."

3/3/2013,4 star rating,"I stopped in here for lunch one day and a although the food was excellent, I had a terrible customer service experience. After my initial post, I was contacted by the owner who obviously takes pride in her restaurant because she encouraged me to come back and try my original order again on her assuring me that this service was not typical. I went in to redeem and the staff was a lot friendlier and the food was even better than before.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious lighter option. They close prettier early but its not in the best neighborhood so it's understandable."
2/18/2016,4 star rating,I made my first visit this afternoon. I'm very impressed! I experienced great hospitality and the food was even better! I'll be returning to support this business quite frequently.
9/16/2013,4 star rating,I had a free Belly Bite for this cafe and decided to give it a try. I like what I had so I came back  to tried multiple things. I had the Jerk Chicken wrap which was Great! I also had the tomato soup. it's a nice place where you can enjoyed it by yourself or with someone.
5/5/2009,5 star rating,"I was recently in Bronzeville with a friend to attend to a work event.  I would ordinarily never notice this little sandwich shop since it's easy to drive right past (and I'm never in the area) but my friend made me stop in.  Yum!  The sandwich I had, a turkey BLT, was fantastic and huge.  And I mean really, really big.  It was delicious and super fresh.  Honestly, the food here was fresher than anything I've had at any Subway.  The owner is very health concious and uses whole wheat and turkey bacon.  The inside is super cute also, with exposed brick and lots of art from local artists including paintings of our Pres, Barack Obama.  I grabbed a free chocolate covered strawberry on my way out...yay!"
1/20/2013,5 star rating,"Yummy Yummy. This is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Chicago. Their panini's are awesome. I like the fact that you can watch your food  being freshly made.

1/17/2009,5 star rating,I love this place.  One of my favorite spots in Bronzeville.  Ms. Strotter is a gracious and giving host.  You often see her behind the counter greeting customers and taking orders.  The food is excellent. The art on the walls are all from local artist in the community.  The exposed brick is a nice touch.  I love all of the food.  The vegetarian wrap and egg salad sandwhich are my favorite.
11/13/2009,4 star rating,"This small cafe is a wonderful place to go to get a reasonable soup and sandwich combo for under $6.  It's a small black-owned business in the heart of the an up and coming Cottage Grove.  I go on an average once a week. I've had the turkey sandwich on wheat and a creamy soup that I can't remember the name of - it has chicken, mushroom, and spinach.  They were both delicious!  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is kept clean, not to mention the beautiful art work that's on the walls.  I highly recommend people check this place out.  They offer non pork options with turkey bacon on sandwiches, if you choose.  Great for those who don't eat beef or pork and even vegetarians!!!"
7/22/2010,4 star rating,"I stopped in for lunch today Groupon in hand. The proprietors made the right decision there as I will be back and will be recommending this spot for our school's catering rotation. I really enjoyed the Jerk Chicken Wrap. It had lots of chicken, fresh veggies, and a good (if modest) kick. I accompanied this with their raspberry lemonade Grove Mixer, slushy type thing. This was very light and refreshing on this hot humid day. The place is spotless and well decorated, a very inviting boit. The staff was, without exception, friendly and conscientious. Next time...the Chicken Caesar Wrap and the soups sound tempting come cooler climes."
10/4/2009,4 star rating,"My aunt's baby shower was hosted here.  I really liked the space for a venue.  I have a good friend getting married soon and this would make a perfect place for one of her showers.  I'm definitely going back to try the food very soon.

12/5/2009,5 star rating,"Aint She Sweet is a great find in the Bronzeville area. I highly recommend their Reuben and Tuscany paninis. The Reuben had just the right combination of sauerkraut, dressing and mustard and the Tuscany had a very tasty pesto sauce. The usage of turkey pastrami and turkey ham was delicious and added to the flavor of the sandwich. I can't wait to try more of their menu, especially the smoothies and croissant sandwiches. The decor is very inviting and the service is friendly. Give Aint She Sweet Cafe a try, you won't be sorry :)"

8/31/2015,1 star rating,"I just left trying to place my order with the guy who prepares wraps best in my Family's opinion. I called before I went over to assure he was there. Upon approaching the counter, the young lady seemed immediately offended by me requesting him. She, with a ""stank"" face... and doggish tone, told me that he can't prepare my wrap. Choose from the others. He's doing a catering job. I asked would he be done soon, and when should I come back? She hits me with ""I don't know."", saying it as she turns with a smirk towards her team for reassurance. I proceeded to walk out after waiting to see if she'd lighten up with a genuine smile. I was stuck. I was in slight disbelief. I went back and asked how long should I wait before coming back. ""I don't know."" she replied again. I then told her to ask him. Then she blurts out without asking him anything, ""A hour."" The only reason she wasn't fifty bitches was because I enjoy their food when he prepares our wraps, in addition to it being Black owned, I'd assume. I cursed a little going out of the door, and I'm going back in 45 minutes to place an order. I will need the owner's contact information because ""the girl"" has no couth nor does she have customer service savvy. I loathe young, ignorant, unestablished adults who have mastered nasty behavior. It's a terrible practice. We won't crave their fixings much longer. I've only been going there for a few months. I can't be bothered."
3/4/2013,5 star rating,"I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place. I used to live in the neighborhood, and I walked here 2-3 times a week. I love the Bronzeville Salad with Turkey and ranch dressing. The service is amazing and the wait isn't long at all. I would recommend calling your order in ahead of time because it gets busy during lunch. This place is a GREAT addition to the Bronzeville area. They defiantly have a repeat customer in me!"

2/8/2015,1 star rating,"Came in on Thanksgiving looking for an apple pie. The older woman behind the counter (maybe the owner)  said she had no apple pie and tried to sell me a huge chocolate cake instead. When I declined on her cake she tried to sell me everything else and was pretty pushy. I felt a bit pressured to buy so I told her I'll take some cupcakes but only needed 3 and these were not your average size cupcakes. She then said she can only sell them by the dozen and I declined. Finally, I told her that I'd take the chocolate cake. When I handed her my credit card she ran it but I forgot my PIN number so I told her I needed to go back to my car and get another debit card. When I returned to my car my husband was impatiently pissed and said we didn't need a cake and to forget the purchase, so we left. The following day as I was checking my bank acct I realized that bitch charged me and kept her cake. I called my bank to dispute the charge and had them handle her. I live in the neighborhood and unfortunately will have to take my business somewhere else. I'm giving one star only because this is the only bakery in  the hood."

1/16/2011,5 star rating,"One of the best restaurants in Bronzeville, providing healthier sandwich and wrap options to the area.  We usually call in our order and pick it up 10 minutes later.  While the panninis are great, I especially enjoy their wrap; specifically, their ceasar and  jerk chicken wraps .  They are made to order, filled with extremely fresh ingredients, and just plain taste good.  You get a choice of the type of wrap (I'm partial to spinach), and most importantly, all wraps and sandwiches come with lays potato chips and a pickle! Give Ain't She Sweet a try!"

6/12/2012,4 star rating,"Very impressed by this location. I have been here and been blown away by the food. You have to try ""Da Steve"" it has to be one of the best darn sandwiches in the city. Only problem is that people know about this place and it can get packed really fast. But it is worth going to and trying. Also they have gluten free stuff for you health nuts."
5/18/2012,5 star rating,This is one of the hidden gems in the environment. They have the best salad the fiesta ugh! And the Jerk Chicken wrap is amazing.

The panini was excellent!! Very fresh ingredients, including the yummy multigrain brain. The cake was not very flavorful or moist, but this was from an outside vendor. I tried my friend's tomato spinach bisque soup (I typically hate tomato soup) and was in heaven! It was sooo good!!. The space is small but cute. I definitely will be headed back."

Had the Fiesta Salad this time and the strawberries, pineapples, and blueberries were quite fresh but they did forget to put the glazed walnuts in the salad. This is not a sit down restaurant but be prepared to wait for your food. The menu basically consists of sandwiches, wraps, salads, and smoothies. The price is very fair for the quality of the food received."
5/1/2013,1 star rating,"I tried to support a Bronzeville area eatery as I had done here previously.  Never again.  I was treated so rudely by the OWNER.  I came in at least 5 minutes prior to the stated 6 p.m. closing.  There was a table of ladies dining there.  There was a customer at the counter I presume was from the group and maybe settling the bill.  I was ignored as employees saw me standing there.  When the customer moved I stepped up.  The woman behind the counter said loudly and emphatically ""Oh, no. We're closed""  I told her I was in there prior to 6 p.m.  She responded that she had locked the door which would mean that she locked the door prior to the stated closing time.  I told her the door was not locked and that it was not 6 p.m when I came in.  If given a chance I would have apologized for coming in so late. I thought the voucher was good until the next day.  I told her that I had a voucher to use.  I had 2 vouchers in my hand.  The voucher was due to expire that day.  She said you can't use 2 vouchers.  I explained that one had been use by my brother but I wasn't sure which one it was so I brought both.   She argued loudly with me and then told me she wasn't going to argue with me.  She told me to take my ""coupons"" and leave.  An employee who had walked past me earlier said that was the owner so that I should ""be humble"".  These were Groupon Vouchers that I paid $7 for so they were not coupons.  A male employee came up and scanned the 2 vouchers and verified which was used and that the other was not. He asked me for my order.  The sandwich on the menu board (which is way up high and difficult to read due to the light font) described the sandwich as a wrap.  When I was placing my order I was asked by the civil male employee what kind of bread I wanted.  I didn't understand the question because to me a wrap is a tortilla. He responded that it is a sandwich and listed breads including a croissant so I chose that.  The sandwich was bland and overpriced.  I had to add my own dressing at home.   At least with Subway you know what you're getting.  When exiting I told the male employee that he might want to tell the owner that this is no way to get repeat business.  I have recommended this eatery to family and friends including employee of a nearby high school.  Now I will relay the rudeness and discourage patronage.  I hope the word gets around.  That school could potentially order for large lunches or meetings.  I hope not."
4/7/2008,5 star rating,"Looking for a neighborhood spot to read your paper, have a sandwich or tasty treat? Then this is your spot. I stumbled across this cafe during a neighborhood event in 2006 and have been hooked ever since. They offer a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, homemade sweets, ice cream, smoothies, etc. My personal favorite is the Steve; a warm croissant with several different types of turkey, melted cheese, and ... we'll I'll stop there, you'll have to check it out for yourself. The owner is usually there working and is a wonderfully gracious person. The service is great and the atmosphere is cozy and warm. Everyone feels welcome."
8/12/2009,5 star rating,"Today I (Camp Administrator) missed lunch. My head hung lo as I walked from the school lunchroom wondering what I was going to eat (because the school lunch was ""blah""). In came a Camp Counselor with food from Ain't She Sweet Cafe. She walked directly up to me and said that if I liked tomato and spinach, I would love the soup and gave it to me. It was obvious that the Heavens had opened up. I proceeded to return to the office with a big smile and lunch. After I ate the first spoonful, I heard Angels sing. I immediately told the Counselor (20 yr old)  that I would baby-sit her 1st born  5x for free ...whenever she had a child. Then I called and spoke with Ms. Margo and gave her a compliment on her soup. Not even 10 minutes later, the Dean of Students stopped in the office to tell me that she was running out for lunch and where do you think she was headed? Yep, to Ain't She Sweet Cafe. Again, the Angels sang (to me). I placed my order for a bowl and I'm licking my lips until it arrived.Healthy and Tasty! You can't beat it!P Raines"

I first heard about Ain't She Sweet cafe on Chicago's Best.  I went with my girlfriend to check it out and was impressed the moment I walked in,  The decor is perfect and the menu offers many different options. Everything is fresh and deliscious!  The person who took our order (who I think was the owner), asked if we were using a groupon and I said no. I did my research on the prices beforehand and made a list of everything I wanted to try because it is all affordable! I had the jerk-chicken wrap while my girlfriend had the veggie wrap in addition to a few of their treats and smoothies.  We will definitely be coming back again and again! We need to support Aint She Sweet Cafe  because it is a true example of healthy eating and customer-dedication!"

2/23/2013,1 star rating,My fiance and I tried to go here one morning 10 minutes after they were supposed to open. The door was still locked and the employees inside completely ignored our knocking. I was very disappointed because I was excited to support what looked like a good cafe on the south side.

2/5/2012,5 star rating,Aint she sweet is DELICIOUS!!! The food is wonderful and the service was great.  I ordered the Cesar Salad and Tomato Bisque soup - both were great --and my friend ordered the Jerk wrap which she loved! Me and my girlfriend spent at least 5 hours in there chatting over lunch and it was so pleasant!  Defiantly recommend!
