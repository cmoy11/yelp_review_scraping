11/3/2019,20191103,5,5.0,"Lizzy J Caf√® is a true treat on the north side. The views are absolute perfection facing the Wells park. Right along the bus route. The parking was easy to find. But to the real treat: the phenomenal service and impeccable food. The people treat you like family. They are so nice and explain everything on the menu to you in great detail. I have a shellfish allergy and they worked with me and created the most delicious food. The French toast was fluffy yet packed with so much flavor. The strawberries were even seasoned but not overdone. My husband loved the crab Benedict. So much so that he ordered 2! I even had to get the salmon and grits to go. The food was soooo good! Don't skip this place when coming to Chicago. This is a foodies haven. Also that tea was incredible. This is one of the best brunch places on the weekend. Heads up, they close at 3pm!"
11/5/2019,20191105,5,5.0,"AMAZING!!! Between the warm environment, amazing service and delicious food this is definitely going to be a regular spot for me. I have lived in Chicago for a almost two years and have not seen brunch done well until I came to Lizzy J's. It was so good I came two days in a row. The french toast is to die for. The shrimp and grits came from heaven and the crab cake Benedict made this east coast girl almost shed a tear. I'm already planning to bring my entire bridal party to check this amazing gem out. Everything tasted like I was getting a hug. I could truly taste the care and love that goes into this food."
11/7/2019,20191107,5,5.0,"Limited menu but so good! I had Freddy's Favorite - a delicate sweet potato waffle topped with a perfectly seared boneless thigh of chicken, a good quality maple syrup that didn't overwhelm the other flavors. Very friendly people there and i wish them the best. I'm coming back to try the Shrimp and Grits next time."
11/9/2019,20191109,5,5.0,"Just opened in the neighborhood and thought we'd check it out! Yummy warm drop biscuits with butter and jam, and flavorful breakfast bowl with grits, cheese and and eggs on top. They even greeted us with a complimentary mimosa on opening weekend. Warm, cozy, yummy."
11/9/2019,20191109,5,5.0,"If you want a warm, inviting and homey feel, this is the place. Chef Jamie, Freddie and the entire staff were welcoming and lets not forget the food. Oh my, the food was spectacular! I ate my food too quick to take a picture, because I just wanted the taste of mascarpone stuffed blueberry-lemon brioche french toast in my mouth. You know when you have every bite that is perfect? This was it! Plenty of blueberries for the right amount of french toast. Perfect balance of flavors and no syrup required. My hubby had shrimp and grits which he also said was the best he ever had. No skimping on the shrimp here! This place is worth coming back to many times, try everything! Food here is prepared with love and care, you taste it!"
11/9/2019,20191109,5,5.0,Excellent food and service! I've been 3x since they've opened and have yet to be disappointed. The Crab Benny is and the French toast is amazing!!
11/16/2019,20191116,5,5.0,"First allow me to tell you, this is my newest brunch, lunch and breakfast spot to go. I had the shrimp and grits. OMG .. Amazingly delicious. Best I had. Yes, it's 10am and I'm having shrimp and grits, don't be jealous! We also had the ""Frenchy"". That's some perfectly drench thick sliced bread with warm bourbon vanilla sauce blanketed over served with the option of fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream... Drop the mic! Need I say more? MmmmmThey have a kids menu too so that's a bonus. We love this place and will be back real soon.... is tomorrow too soon?!"
11/16/2019,20191116,5,5.0,Great addition to the neighborhood. Just opened 2 weeks ago and the food is delicious. The French toast is to die for and the quiche was awesome (lots of crab!). I cant wait to come back and try other dishes. Shrimp and grits or biscuits and gravy here I come. Yay!
11/16/2019,20191116,5,5.0,Omg soooooooooo good! I got the shrimp n grits and the Frenchy and I'm stuffed!!!! Soooooo good
11/17/2019,20191117,5,5.0,"Update: We came back the next day! We had their chicken and waffle. We each had the white and dark meat chicken plates. Check out the pics! Chicken were juicy, tasty, tender, and crispy on the outside. The waffles were hearty and had some sweet potatoes bits. Delish!"
11/17/2019,20191117,5,5.0,"My new favorite brunch spot. I am originally from Michigan (suburbs of Detroit) and since moving to Chicago, I haven't found a place that serves decent chicken and waffles. This place serves the best chicken and waffles. Everything was clean, neat and the food was made out fresh ingredients. Also, the coffee was amazing and the service was nothing but great. Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu."
11/17/2019,20191117,3,4.83,"My family and I tried LizzyJ for brunch on a Sunday. We arrived about 10am and there were 3 tables open and no wait. The host advised that we needed to order before choosing a table. That was difficult for me. Wrangling a toddler and trying read a new menu meant not paying enough attention to either. My daughter wanted a plain waffle, which they offered as a kid waffle, and were glad to charge less for no chicken, but when it arrived it was the smallest waffle- a half a waffle cut into 4 slices. Good thing she ate before she came. This was a snack.... My husband had the shrimp and grits, which he said was delicious and was the highlight of our visit. And for $15 he said it had a good amount of shrimp in it. I went for the bowl o' breakfast, which was tasty, but I neglected to add any meat (because i didn't read the menu carefully and was rushed to order) so it was a bowl of plain grits, a sprinkle cheese and 2 over easy eggs for $12/13. In my opinion, The food is overpriced and the staff was a bit blundering. No sides, no toast or fruit served with any dish. The coffee was 100% tasteless and they add the cream in the kitchen, which was fine for me , but for those who don't want a light cafe au lait, be aware to ask to add it yourself. I give this place 3 stars because the owner is super nice. When we were charged $5 for each cup of tasteless coffee, which was a mistake, she refunded the mistake without issue. It took her her while staff to make it happen and the entire length of our meal, but it did happen. I likely won't return. There are other places that are better for a $50 brunch."
11/19/2019,20191119,5,4.85,"Amazing!!! I ordered the signature shrimp + grits and it's incredible! I've never tasted anything like it. I was overwhelmed with the bold and savory flavors. The environment is peaceful and serene. It's nice, intimate and I'd suggest visiting any time of the day. If you're in Chicago, you have to visit."
11/19/2019,20191119,4,4.79,"The price was average for the area nothing to rave about. The food was really good. Soon as you step it is not many tables. So there is a little wait but the guest didn't sit long and hold up tables. The waiter was nice but he took a while to get us our tea. The tea was really good, I willVisit again to purchase the tea. My husband enjoyed the chicken and waffle, I sampled a piece and the waffle was amazing. I had the shrimp and grits it was different from what I am use to in to in the south. Once again it was full of flavor. Recommend going just have patience with the wait staff."
11/30/2019,20191130,5,4.8,"Love the service here, took my cousin here and we love the food. She had the French toast and I had the waffle chicken. First time having the waffle and chicken, the syrup has a little kick of spice which was amazing taste. Clean and the owner comes and greets you. Wonderful place to eat at."
12/8/2019,20191208,5,4.81,"If you're craving shrimp n grits, this is the place! Absolutely delicious!! The ginger peach tea was wonderful. My wife had the Sassy Salmon and it was also delicious. A bunch of great smells coming from the kitchen! Highly recommend!"
12/11/2019,20191211,5,4.82,"Lizzy J Cafe is honestly my new favorite brunch spot in the area. They are known for their Shrimp and Grits (which are phenomenal by the way), but I also truly enjoyed the Crabby Benny Eggs Benedict. The French Toast was delicious for those who like something sweeter in the morning. The atmosphere was extremely homey, and Jamie (the owner) and all of her staff was so sweet and sincere. We ended up chatting for awhile and spoke with some tables that were close to us as well - definitely a neighborhood hot-spot and you could tell everyone was very friendly! This cafe was a lot quieter and calmer than a lot of brunch spots in Chicago (they can get rowdy on the weekends) and was perfect for a Sunday morning. The menu had a small variety of dishes that all looked and tasted phenomenal, and were made to perfection. Just enough to have something for everyone, but not too many menu options where it's overwhelming and the quality lowers. I truly felt welcome here and plan on coming back many times in the future!"
12/14/2019,20191214,5,4.83,Best crab cake benny in the city! My husband had the sweet potato waffle with chicken and it was also amazing! Super cute little brunch spot that we will definitely visit again and again. Can't wait to try everything!
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.84,"We came here for Sunday brunch and it was delicious. Casual, cozy spot. We ordered the crab cake benedict and the french toast. Both perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and some of the best we've ever had. High quality and thoughtful ingredients are used. The chocolate croissant was also amazing. Good food takes time and it's worth the wait. Friendly service. We will definitely return."
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.85,"Cozy little breakfast place. Great friendly staff, the owner was in the back working as well as mingling with costumers which is always nice to see. I got the Nutella banana French toast. The Carmel sauce is to DIE for. Perfect consistency and sweetness. My partner had the crab benny and said it was very good. The crab cakes where huge!"
12/18/2019,20191218,4,4.81,Lizzy J Cafe was recommended for me to try because it's close to my neighborhood. Living on the North Side of Chicago it's hard to find black owned restaurants. Usually you have to travel all the way to the South Side. I was excited to see that not only is the restaurant blacked owned but it was also owned by a woman too. The restaurant is very small. There were only about 10 tables seating for about 2-4 people each. I would suggest that you check on Yelp first for the live waitlist. Lizzy J has very nice decor and it had a very casual at home ambience to it which I like. The food was bomb! My friend and I both ordered the Sassy Salmon which is pan seared salmon with lump crab on top. I got a side of red skin potatoes and she had a side salad. We both shared the peaches and cream French toast. The restaurant is BYOB but they do charge you an open cork fee. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice intimate brunch for two or a low key brunch for a loved one.
12/20/2019,20191220,5,4.82,"I have so much to say about this place! First and foremost, I drove from the South Suburbs to patronize this business after seeing it featured on @blackpeopleeats instagram page. And let me reassure you if you're hesitant to make the drive, ITS WORTH IT!LizzyJ's is a quaint, Black WOMAN owned business. The service is absolutely impeccable, outshined only by the perfectly seasoned food. While visiting today, I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Mrs. Jaime, who was so kind and humble. My host, Livell, was so attentive, was able to answer my menu questions without hesitation, and made sure my dining experience was enjoyable. I ordered the Sassy Salmon with grits, a side of eggs, and green tea. The perfectly cooked salmon is stuffed with lump crab, the grits are ACTUALLY creamy and didn't require salt (you sugar in grits people please don't come for me lol) or pepper, and the eggs were scrambled hard just like I like them. I attempted to finish my food out of sheer enjoyment of the taste, but couldn't. The portions are just right. My only complaint is that I didn't order something to-go!"
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.83,Lovely place to have breakfast! The strawberry French toast was absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and kind. They have over 30 different types of tea to choose from. We went with a ginger one and it was incredible. They offer free refills for the tea as well. We will be back to this nice little cafe!
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.83,Incredibly good brunch. I had the crab quiche and it was one of the best quiches i've ever had - packed with quality crab meat and tastes just right. This place is a cute unassuming restaurant - actually felt like an East Coast restaurant with some southern influence. The people who work there were very attentive and friendly. We can't wait to go back and try the other dishes on the menu. Def going back!
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.84,"We live in the Ravenswood/North Center/Lincoln Square area and wanted to have breakfast today (Saturday). My girlfriend saw that Lizzy J's was just down the street so we strolled over. When I tell you the service was impeccable I'm not lying. Our server was so friendly and accommodating that it made us feel as if we wereageists in her house. Lizzy J came around to all the tables and served complimentary mimosas to all that wanted them. Now to the food, I ordered the chicken and waffles and they were so scrumptious. The chicken was lightly breaded chicken tenderloins and the waffles were light with a hint of sweet potato. My GF had the shrimp and grits which were as delicious as you are imagining. They also had chunks of andouille sausage to perfectly make the dish. We definitely will be back often as Lizzy and her staff know how treat and serve people. Well done"
12/21/2019,20191221,5,4.85,Amazing food! I had the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. The staff is wonderful and so friendly. Highly recommend LizzyJs. We will be back!
12/23/2019,20191223,4,4.81,"This is cute little brunch spot with excellent food.We started with biscuits, which were excellent, and full of flavor.I particularly liked the basic eggs benedict - just very fresh eggs, flavorful and light hollandaise sauce, and an airy muffin.Lizzy doesn't have booze but does have an extensive tea menu from which to choose; I don't recall which one I had but it was excellent.It's a little pricey but the quality reflects the cost. Its a great place to go for a low key delicious breakfast."
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.82,"This is a small and quaint place, which I like. My husband, friend and I went because the original place we tried to go was packed and was like an hour wait. We're so glad we cane here instead! The staff were friendly and funny, and the food... sooo good! Shrimp n grits, quiche and salad were just awesome. We will definitely be back here next time we're back in town."
12/28/2019,20191228,5,4.83,Had the shrimp and grits--best ones I've had outside my grandma's! Great service and delicious food. This is a gem for sure. It's small so come early or use the waitlist.
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.83,Stopped in today to have brunch with my mom. We were really happy to see it was owned by a POC. There was no wait. The server was really nice and attentive. Restaurant was nicely decorated. I ordered the French toast with strawberries and cream with a side of potatoes. The food was great! Can't wait to come back!
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.84,LITERALLY will be one of my favorite brunch spots! BEST chicken and waffles I have ever tasted in my life! I'm not exaggerating. There is this special sauce they use that is so unique and so perfect for the entire meal. I can't wait to go try more dishes! They are full meals and definitely made with love! This place is amazing and the owners are so friendly. The servers always have smiles on their faces and are happy to serve you! Really impressed!
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.84,"Don't walk, run to this newly opened black owned brunch spot on the northside of Chicago. Soooo good! We had the chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and strawberries n cream french toast. I scraped the bowl of shrimp and grits, devoured the french toast and didn't lick the plate cause I'm a lady but it was that good! Great service, beautiful ambience, quaint spot. Can't wait to return."
1/2/2020,20200102,5,4.85,"This place is awesome! Went here on New Year's Eve, and it was one of the best brunch I've had. I got the Shrimp and grits, it was tasty and filling. The different flavors balanced out really well, with a bit spicy kick. Also the service was amazing. This is a small restaurant that just opened, so the owner was heavily involved in everything. She came out to help serve me food, and chatted with me a bit. It was really nice. Highly recommended."
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.85,"Wow.... That's it! Food is tremendous and from the heart. Customer service and every smile was spot on and sincere. I love that this place opened in our neighborhood! I'm excited to return for some tea and to try the Benedict! Definitely a return spot for us. Small place, so be sure to use the yelp queue for wait times. Wishing them great success! The neighborhood really needed this!"
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.86,"My boyfriend and I stopped here for brunch yesterday. They went over the tea menu with us and convinced us we needed some tea (not that it took much convincing since part of the reason I wanted to go here were the pictures I saw on yelp). I got the blueberry green tea while the boyfriend got apple pie. The tea was amazing. We also each ordered the chicken and waffle (I got the dark meat and boyfriend got the white meat) along with a side of biscuits and raspberry jam.The food here is phenomenal. The chicken was flavorful, crunchy and juicy. The waffle itself was soft, fluffy and reminded me of a fall donut in flavor. The biscuits we ordered had a nice bit of crisp on the outside but were so fluffy they melted in your mouth on the inside. Finally, the service is top-notch. Friendly and on-point. It's a small space but they run it expertly. However, as brunch is cut throat here in Chicago I recommend getting there early like we did and avoid the brunch rush so you don't have to wait. We will be back to sample the rest of the menu for sure!"
1/12/2020,20200112,4,4.83,"Stopped in for brunch today amd everything was delicious. Quiche with caramelized onion and bacon was very flavorful and salad that came with it was so fresh - greens, carrots, beets, radishes, a bit of cheese - clearly made with care. Biscuits and jam were also delicious and again, clearly homemade. Big selection of brewed teas, delivered in a french press with a timer so you don't oversteep it. Highly recommend this nice little spot. It is cozy with perhaps seating for a total of 25 (?) but very friendly staff and customers. Can't wait to come back and sample the rest ofnthe menu."
1/18/2020,20200118,5,4.84,"Im from the surrounding blocks of this place and a friend and I popped in on a Friday morning for the first time, and there was no wait at all. Ordered the Chicken and Waffles and it was fantastic. Sweet potato waffle and fried dark meat chicken on top (you can choose between white or dark meat). My friend ordered Shrimp & Grits and he said it was great. Very friendly service and the owner came by the tables to check in, ask for input, how we heard about the place, etc. Very nice people and we need more good breakfast spots like this to succeed in the area. This one has staying power for sure. Good food, good people, quaint space (I imagine this place will eventually have long lines as it's relatively small (probably 10 2-4 person tables). You'll leave this place satisfied with what you just ate."
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.84,We are so happy we found this gem!!! Our new favorite breakfast spot for sure. Everything is absolutely delicious. We highly recommend the chicken and waffles - the sweet potato waffle is a nice surprise. Jamie and her husband and all the staff are wonderful and made us feel right at home!
1/25/2020,20200125,1,4.74,"A friend made a list of some great places to try and this place was on the list. 12:45 pm reservation and waited about 5 minutes to sit..not too bad. We get a water and a menu. Limited menu. Many items have seafood (I'm allergic) but I decided on the biscuit and gravy. Waiter (the only one) takes our drink order and upon delivering the tea proceeds to then (not before seating us) say he isn't taking more orders for a little while because they want the kitchen to catch up. Mind you this place maybe has 10 tables and there are 3 of them that can seat 3-4 people. How are they that backlogged?! We wait 40 minutes and we decide to leave money on the table for our tea and leave. Then the waiter comes by and says he was just about to take our order. How rude can this place be?! No apology ever for the wait. No communication on the timing of things. 1:43 our order is placed. We receive our food at 2:24!! No one said I appreciate your wait, or I am really sorry to have inconvenienced your afternoon... the food in my opinion was just okay. There are soo many places to eat in Chicago. I understand lack of staff or crowds, but this was just rude. There are many places to go. I would strongly suggest to take a pass. It definitely is not worth 2-3 hours of your time."
1/27/2020,20200127,1,4.65,"It's was the worst experience from the service to the food. We sat down for 30 minutes prior to having oJt order taken. Waited another hour for eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy. Had to get our own silverware after the lady said she would bring us some and we waited 5 minutes for that. The biscuits and gravy had a charred taste with burnt pieces of biscuits in there. If you burn it atleset take all of the burnt out!! The eggs Benedict lacked any flavor, all this was $36, NOT WORTH IT!! Worst experience. Do not recommend and will not be returning."
1/27/2020,20200127,5,4.66,"Met a friend at Lizzy J's yesterday after finding the restaurant in a search for a brunch menu. They've only been open since Nov. 1st, but I see amazing things in their future. The space is intimate, but if the constant traffic was any indication, they'll be expanding soon. During my very reasonable twenty minute wait, I saw some amazing looking dishes leave the kitchen: shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, what looked to be a salmon Oscar, and French toast. I settled on the crab cakes eggs Benedict. This is one of my all-time favorite dishes, and its simplicity is deceiving. I've gone to some five star joints and have had it improperly executed. Lizzy J's nailed it! The English muffin was crisp, the crab cake was moist and flavorful without any overwhelming crabbiness, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise was appropriately set. It came with a side of perfectly seasoned potatoes. The right amount of sea salt and rosemary made them POP! I thoroughly enjoyed that brunch, and if you go here, I encourage you to partake in the extensive tea offering as well. Made me feel like I was back in London's East end or Soho...As I paid the check (prices are fantastic - I'd go as far as to say they're a bargain), I briefly chatted with Ms. Lizzy J herself. A very gracious and polite New Jersey native (bet you never thought you'd see those words in the same sentence). She even indulged me as I showed pics of food from my own kitchen. Hers is the type of homey cafe that'll steal your heart and all your weekend mornings. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1/31/2020,20200131,5,4.67,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. When you first walk in, the ambience is warm, inviting, and personal. R&B classics play in the background and it gives you the sense that you are at your favorite Aunt's house, waiting to hangout with your cousins and eat some good soul food. The staff here treat you like a guest in their own home. We had a larger party, and they accommodated us very promptly and made sure we were comfortable and not waiting for long. Our waiter took time to explain the menu to us, and even informed us that if we couldn't decide on a specific dish, we could order half size dishes. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, Peaches and Cream French Toast, and the Blueberry Tea. ALL WERE DELICIOUS. Best brunch I've ever had. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and each dish is made with love and soul. Weeks later, and I'm planning my next return to Chicago just to go back to Lizzy J Cafe and reorder my same meal. It was an overall delight to have brunch here. Ms. Lizzy (the owner) was very personable. Her spirit is contagious and makes you feel like family. We really appreciated her kindness and overall hospitality.I love this restaurant and I can't wait to go back to Chicago, to visit my new favorite brunch place. Thank you Lizzy for an awesome experience."
1/31/2020,20200131,5,4.67,"I wanted to try their sassy salmon or crabby Benny, but those are not available during the week. So I ordered their shrimp and grits, my daughter had the frenchy jr, and husband ordered a side of biscuit and jam. Everything was delicious."
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.68,"We came here on a Sunday for a late breakfast, arriving at about 945. Most of the tables were reserved, but they were able to seat us given they were only two of us. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend had the catfish and grits.I got say.. both of our meals were FANTASTIC!! The waffle was perfect; white, and full of flavor. The chicken was juicy and well seasoned, with a very light drizzle of syrup to accompany the dish. My friend said the catfish was very good; the grits were very well prepared, as I did it taste those.Definitely be coming back. The food was amazing, and the staff there was so friendly; it's like eating in someone's home!"
2/11/2020,20200211,5,4.69,"We will definitely be back! The biscuits and gravy is how everyone else should be making them. The sweet potato waffles with fried chicken is the bomb especially when you add the spicy syrup that we hope will be bottled and sold. The shrimp and grits are loaded with shrimp and andouie sausage. Also, the tea comes in a press, I had apple pie and mom had cinnamon plum. Photos in comments. Livell was a terrific server!"
2/16/2020,20200216,2,4.63,"Food has potential, but service was terrible.I wanted to love this cafe; it has such a quaint and inviting ambiance. However, my hopes were dashed today when I had the worst and slowest service in as long as I can remember. I'm pretty forgiving, and do not leave bad reviews. But what I experienced at brunch today was beyond tolerable.1. We waited 35 minutes past our reservation to be seated. The server/host seemed surprised to hear that we had a reservation.2. Coffee arrived 20 minutes after being seated. Ice water arrived even later. The requested sweetener for our coffee arrived only after multiple requests.3. The server took our order, but returned 15 minutes later to re-confirm our order as he forgot to enter it in the POS. 4. After quite a wait, the food started arriving one dish at a time, over the course of about 20 minutes. Two of us were literally finished before the third meal even arrived to the table. The only reason this cafe gets two stars instead of one is that the Crabby Benny had good flavor. Unfortunately, it arrived lukewarm at best. After waiting over an hour and a half, a hot meal would have gone a long way."
2/17/2020,20200217,5,4.64,"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said??? This place is a MUST whether visiting or living there...The owner has a DOPE personality and the atmosphere is a ""vibe"" chic'ish...I was visiting from out of town with 4 friends and ALL of us were THOROUGHLY impressed with the portion and flavor...I had the chicken n waffle with a side of grits and all I can say is WOW; EVERYTHING about it oozed deliciousness...My friends amongst them had french toast, shrimp n grits, salmon n grits, and catfish; and they were taken aback on how flavorful everything was; the food didnt stand a chance...Oh and I CAN'T forget the iced teas, SHEESH I couldn't been happy just drinking those; ESPECIALLY the orange flavored one, it's special...The only knock on this place is the restaurant size BUT Lizzy J's had taken Chicago by storm in ONLY 3 months so I accept big things soon...So if you're in the north side of Chicago or hell if you're in ANY part of Chicago for that matter; YOU MUST GO...LOLOH and shout out to Lizzys WONDERFUL staff, Lavale and Dora, who were very accommodating, professional, AND put up with me and my friends shenanigans..."
2/21/2020,20200221,1,4.56,"11am reservation on a Friday. 1110a- She ordered the Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. Four of the six patrons in the cafe were already dining so we assumed the wait wouldn't be long. We waited 1hr and 20 min without being served. The cafe wasn't busy and the other patrons weren't demanding. The couple of times we glanced over at the server he just shot us a casual head nod and mouthed ""it'll be a couple of more minutes."" We walked out at 1230. Never again"
2/21/2020,20200221,1,4.49,"My husband and I were so deeply disappointed by our experience we'll never go back to Lizzy J cafe. We had a day off together so we made a reservation for 11am. We arrived on time, ordered coffee, then proceeded to sit and wait for over an hour for our food. We ordered the chicken and waffle and eggs and Benny dishes. We never received our food because we decided to leave when we observed the diners sitting next to us (who arrived about 40 minutes after us) being served the chicken and waffle (Freddy's Favorite on the menu.) We were so frustrated at that point, by a.) no updates by the waiter and b.) people who walked in waaaay after us being served. The part that really stung was when we pointed out the fact that the other diners had received their food first, he said that they were eating an appetizer. Huh? There's not even any appetizers on the menu. It was plain weird to lie. Also we HEARD the diner, who was sitting right next to us, order Freddys Favorite, not some mystery appetizer from a secret menu. The waiter decided to comp us the coffee, which was all we had for over an hour while we sat and waited. He only did this when we got up to pay for the coffee before leaving, by the way. We were just really disappointed by this experience. I had eaten here once before with my friend and daughter and the food took about 45 minutes on that occasion. The food is good, but definitely not worth the 45 minutes to over an hour wait time, which seems to be par the course here. What I'm most confused about is why the owner of this new restaurant, seems to be okay with letting her customers wait so long. I understand the food is cooked fresh to order, which takes longer, but that was excessive for the items on the menu. It seems she also has a catering business, so again we were confused as to why her time management was not effective. I only recommend going here if you have your entire schedule for the day cleared. Sometimes good things come to those who wait, and sometimes you just find a better brunch spot."
3/7/2020,20200307,5,4.5,Came here with my young daughter and she loved her French toast. My breakfast bowl was amazing - best grits I've ever had! Friendly staff and cool atmosphere; we'll be back
3/8/2020,20200308,4,4.49,"This was a cute spot! It was perfect for a Saturday morning brunch with my daughter and bestie, there was no wait for a table - which is always a plus! The hand crafted sweet tea was delicious, if I wasn't being cheap, I would've ordered a second bottle to go. The tea press was super cute, my friend had a lemon ginger and enjoyed it. As for the food, the french toast was pretty tasty, it was two huge slices with apples and caramel. I ordered fish and home style potatoes. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned, but was not listed on the menu. I didn't love the fish, it was because I prefer thinner cuts of meat (I can't be the only person like this). However, it was flavorful and fried just right!"
3/12/2020,20200312,5,4.5,"So delicious! We got the bowl o' breakfast and lemon blueberry french toast stuffed with marscapone, everything tasted so fresh and the coffee was good. Excited to come back and try more! The music was good too and our waiter was attentive and friendly. The cafe is in a great spot for walking, nestled in across from a field and around other shops. Parking was free nearby. The owner herself was cooking and is so sweet! Thanks again for a great breakfast :)"
3/16/2020,20200316,5,4.51,"My friends and I made the hike from the south side here on a Sunday afternoon. It was worth the drive! FOOD - We had their version of a french toast flight (good!), chicken and waffle (good!), shrimp and grits (great!), and the sassy salmon (beyond great!). The shrimp and grits were so good that my friends and I began debating which was better, Lizzy J's/5 Loaves (that's a first and says a lot)! They were out of fish and grits and the Crab Cake Benedict but that's just another excuse to come try them a second time.  Restaurant is BYOB and charges a cork fee. But the cork fee includes a large carafe of orange juice.SERVICE - The hostess/server was doing both jobs amazingly! He was kind and always on task. Made sure our water was filled and communicated the status of our orders in a timely fashion. AMBIANCE/SEATING - The restaurant is smaller. Prob seats about 20/25 people max. I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time to make sure you don't have to wait. We were a party of four and there happened to be a reservation that didn't show so we took their table. Otherwise we may have had to wait a little while to be seated. I could see larger parties having an issue being seated without a reservation. I'm excited to go back and try other menu items in the very near future!"
5/9/2020,20200509,5,4.52,"LizzyJCafe is amazing, the owner was so kind to accommodate me today with the Mother's Day Family Feast meal because I'm an essential worker and I have to travel tomorrow for work on Mother's Day, she made my mom's day, the food was excellent, absolutely delicious! The food was ready on time, it was packaged well, they helped me put it in the car and even added a lovely gift! This was my first experience but will not be my last, LizzyJCafe will be my go to for catering all my family functions! The food was so fresh and delicious you can taste the love and talent in every bite!"
6/2/2020,20200602,5,4.53,The food is incredible and the staff was beyond sweet. Can't wait to go back!
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.54,"Had an amazing take-out breakfast during covid. The prices may look high initially, but the portions are giant and the food is top quality. We tried the shrimps and grits which was delicious. Different than the usual cheesy-grits you get, this had more of a savory sauce and the shrimp were big and fresh. Best thing I've eaten in a while.French toast with peaches and cream was also good. Hope I can eat there in person one day."
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.54,"The chicken and waffles were amazing. My girlfriend and I ordered this, and loved it. Shout out to Lizzy."
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.55,"I couldn't decide which to get, so I got both the chicken & waffles and the shrimp & grits. It's so flavorful and everything is perfectly cooked. I think I just found my new favorite place to eat. Thank you so much! This honestly made my day"
6/7/2020,20200607,5,4.56,"Got the chicken sandwich for lunch today and was really blown away. The gentleman bringing orders out for pick up let us know we would not be disappointed and he was right! Not only was the chicken juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside and very flavorful; the sauce was amazing, the bun was high quality and all the toppings were so fresh! Side of fruit was a perfect light complement to this behemoth sandwich! I can't wait to come back and try some entrees like the lamb chops and shrimp and grits!"
6/9/2020,20200609,5,4.57,"Love their french toast, as well as the salmon. Great variety on the menu. They have been consistently impressing with all the items we have tried. Definitely will be returning for more."

The staff called me to verify toppings, you can order more than one topping, compared to what shows on Grub Hub right now. Thanks for calling me!The grits are the creamiest grits I've ever had. The portion is large and very satisfying. I'm excited to go once the dining room is able to open!"

This cafe is pretty small (around 8-9 tables) but the delicious flavors, high quality food, and joyful personalities of owners, Fred and Jamie Gilmore, are huge! I'm pretty sure we've tried just about everything on the menu, and we're proud to say EVERYTHING is delicious! Ample portions, colorful vegetables, and melt in your mouth goodness depending on what you order. Some of our favorites include the carmel apple french toast, crabby benny, and the chocolate mint tea - (did I mention the massive tea selection?). In January, my husband and I began the keto diet, Lizzy J's has a keto bowl option which is a hearty helping of cauliflower grits, your choice of protein, and toppings (like the bowl 'o breakfast). Once this gem re-opens for indoor dining, reservations are a MUST. We can't wait to return!!! In the meantime, we take full advantage of the curbside pickup option."

6/22/2020,20200622,1,4.56,"I went this past Friday on Juneteenth to Lizzy J Cafe. I heard about this quaint breakfast spot on The BlackFoodies Instagram page right before Covid-19 pandemic and anticipated to patronize it soon. The owner Mrs. J had posted on IG several days before Friday that their patio would be open and to call for seating. I called Friday morning and made a 11:30am reservation. When I arrived at 11:30, I and another patron was told they just received a call 20 minutes earlier saying they can no longer have patio seating at this time. I should have left like the other lady. But since I drove 45 minutes, I decided to order my food and wait which I assumed would be an hour wait. I came to order the Sassy Salmon, the guy told me they do NOT have Sassy Salmon on Friday's. I asked for Crab Benny he said they do NOT have that today. My last choice was shrimp and grits so I ordered that, the reviews said it was great. I ordered chicken and sweet potato waffle for my mom and the Juneteenth French Toast caramel apple special. They were sold out of white meat so I ordered the dark for the waffle.  Around 1:00pm I checked status because they make the food fresh and the owner Mrs. J is the only chef.  At 1:20 pm, (almost 2 hours later), the other host came outside to tell me that the original host made a mistake, they do NOT have shrimp and grits!!¬† I was livid. After 2 hours I won't have anything to eat and will have to go pick up from somewhere else.¬† He said they would give me an eletronic credit for me to use on another visit.¬† You pay for the food when you place your order.¬† Let me say the host was empathetic and nice. (Another visit, I'm not ever coming back). I asked how long would the chicken and waffle be, he said another 20 min. I received my mom's chicken and waffle which smelled really good. Also the french toast. However, when she opened her container, the dark meat was a 1/2 of chicken thigh!!! I was flabbergasted!! I had to write a review after that.¬† I guess they had run out of chicken or was trying to stretch the chicken. At all restaurants and I am an avid foodie, dark meat is 2 pcs (a leg & thigh). My mom did say the sweet potato waffle is very good. Overall, the food may be good at Lizzy J Cafe and I read they were caterers first so maybe stick to catering. Just because you are a great caterer does not mean you can handle the demands of running a restaurant. I was totally disappointed with my visit."

6/29/2020,20200629,1,4.46,"My girlfriend and I found Lizzy J after looking for a nice brunch date spot this past Sunday, and set a reservation after salivating over pictures of the food and reading the menu online. Upon arriving, the staff was confused when we mentioned we had a reservation, and we were asked if we would like to sit inside or outside, despite outside seating being full. We were seated, waters were brought, and our order was taken; All in about 10 minutes. We ordered the shrimp and grits, two Arnold Palmer's, and a Bowl of Breakfast, which had lots of ways to customize the bowl to how you'd like it (I ordered grits, cheese, smoked sausage, peppers, and poached eggs). We were asked after ordering if we would like to pay up front, which we thought was odd, as we did not want to tip on service or meals we had not yet received. Unfortunately, it took us about 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive, which was only because we mentioned it to the waiter. At this point, I noticed a lot of the people waiting for to-go orders when we arrived were still waiting around, poking in to check on order status, and looking increasingly impatient; This should have been a sign. After another 15 minutes or so, my girlfriend received her shrimp and grits, and I assumed my food was coming out shortly after. After about five minutes and assuring her to go ahead and eat, I was told my food would be out soon.My food came out about 20 minutes after her dish, and unfortunately the dish was completely wrong, which included just about every topping I did not select to be added to my bowl of breakfast. This bowl contained grits, spinach, onion, and scrambled egg. I let the server know this, who checked with the person that took our order (who I heard repeat exactly what I ordered), and my dish was then taken back to the kitchen, then brought back out, and I was told that the dish is completely correct, but was just missing the sausage. I'm not one to argue with restaurant staff, and I'm willing to put up with a lot, but I had to reassure the server that the dish did not have the other items I ordered and the eggs were not cooked as I had asked. I was then told the peppers were ""very small"" and the cheese was just hard to see, but the kitchen was cooking the sausage to add to this bowl for me. This still didn't tackle why I have spinach, onion, and scrambled eggs, but oh well. I asked if I could just not have the dish, as it's not what I ordered, and the thought of waiting another full hour for my meal was unfathomable to me. My girlfriend and I settled on splitting the shrimp and grits, which was pretty amazing, despite being charged more than the menu price for it on the receipt (at that point it was too much to even bother bringing up another issue). I REALLY wanted to like this place, as the food that we had was amazing, but between the wait for it, the poor service, and being left feeling like I was in the wrong for pointing out an issue with my meal, we will not be back."

7/11/2020,20200711,5,4.42,We had a good experience here. The staff was friendly and attentive. They were good at practicing health and safety measures and will also provide outside seating (weather permitting). They take reservations so I recommend making one prior to coming. They will take walk-ins but you may not get the ideal setting you want. The chef is really nice and friendly. She came out to great us. The food was fresh delicious and filling! I would make the hike to the north side to support this business. They also offer delivery through various apps. On the weekend they run bunch specials too!
7/26/2020,20200726,1,4.38,Ordered a $16 chicken and waffle that took 1 hour to make and all I got was a baby waffle and a nugget. First and last time going here.
7/26/2020,20200726,5,4.39,"Really good food that was worth the wait! Not a typically experience as we ended up waiting more than an hour for our meal and they ran out of one of the dishes we ordered. However, the food was delicious and the owner along with her staff more then made up for the wait and the oversight on the dish! The owner came out to apologize and comped the whole meal as she wanted us to enjoy the whole experience. More than enough as the food was delicious and I definitely will go back for the shrimp and grits, French toast and chicken and waffles! Looking forward to visiting again!"

Next time we're at the park I'll be popping over to get another bottle. We had the peach and triple berry and loved them both. It was my first time trying catfish and it was SO good. Fish can be scary - but this was fresh, flaky and cooked to perfection. My favorite part of the dish was the white cheddar grits with the spicy oil around the bowl. My husband had chicken and waffles and that, too, was so good. I really can't say which was my favorite I loved them both so much. We will be back!!"
8/25/2020,20200825,2,4.32,"I heard so many good things about this place so my husband and I were so excited to try them. Although we ordered during black restaurant week we still purchased full price food. We got the Crab Benedict & catfish and grits. We placed our order online and my husband went to pick it up. We live few blocks away so he arrived a little before the estimated time. On our order I specifically asked for my catfish to be placed on the side and not directly on the grits since it had to travel back home I did not want soggy fish. My huband waited passed the the quoted time which was fine I get everything is different right now due to covid. My husband checked the order and the fish was on the grits . He pointed out on the receipt it says on the side .He works in hospitality so he was very understanding. So they had to make another order of catfish and grits. My husband also asked would the crab Benedict be remade as well since he has to wait. They told him he would be given all freshly prepared food. In total my husband waited over 45 minutes for the food. He gets home and the fish is piping hot , the grits were warm , the crab Benedict was a cold soggy mess, and they forgot our side order that comes with it. I was so disappointed. Now I would have been willing to possibly give this place another chance but it was clear they lied to my husband about remaking all the food , they forgot an item , and it was all very bland except for the catfish. Salt and pepper goes a long way .The crabcakes had big pieces of bell pepper and onion in it that were not fully cooked so it was not pleasant to eat. It was just not a good expirience . I really do not appreciate the dishonesty. We really had high hopes for this place. For the price there is no way there should have been these kinds of errors. We do not eat out much now but we try to support our local restaurants when we can this was a huge let down."
9/5/2020,20200905,5,4.33,"Try this place out!!! I got one of their breakfast bowls and my friend got the shrimp and grits. We were both convinced after one bite that this would be a new favorite! Also, the staff was FRIENDLY, not just professional and attentive. We felt like we were at a friend's family's house for breakfast. Definitely two thumbs up!!!"
9/6/2020,20200906,5,4.34,Very good - ordered takeout for breakfast. Shrimp and grits was so flavorful and chicken and waffles were delicious. Will definitely be back!
9/13/2020,20200913,4,4.33,"Tried this out for brunch today. Definitely make reservations beforehand because it is a smaller establishment. The food was very fresh, and I appreciated that we could order in advance. The establishment is also BYOB for a fee. I will be back to try other items on the menu. This is a real little soul food gem in the area."
9/30/2020,20200930,5,4.34,Wow! I was not expecting the level of amazing. If you are looking for a dish that has your tastebuds doing cartwheels get the Catfish with cheese grits. If I were not home and Covid I would hug the cook. I will definitely come back with my family and friends to try other dishes. Not to mention the Level of customer service. One of the gentlemen dropped my food to my car wish such an warming personality. I could not be happier to find this place. Sorry my pictures couldn't do it justices. Catfish and grits yummy!!!
11/1/2020,20201101,2,4.31,"This was my first time ordering from Lizzy J. My friend had told me about this place a year ago and I've always wanted to try it. I decided today was the day. I ordered shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and the lemon blueberry French toast. My order came on time. The bag had a tamper evident seal so that was nice. I'd paid $46.95 for 3 items before tax and service fees so I expected it to be great. The reviews were also very positive so my hopes were high.I'm a small business owner myself so I think twice before leaving a review for any business. I just had to write this because I am very dissatisfied with the food I received. The shrimp and grits was overly salty. The French toast was super thick, dry and didn't have any hint of lemon like the menu suggested. It was supposed to be stuffed with cream but there was nothing. The only thing that was decent from my order was the sweet potato waffles. Well seasoned and flavorful. The chicken was okay. There was no maple syrup or hot sauce accompanying the chicken and waffles like you'd expect. The blueberries for the French toast were super rubbery. I don't know how they were cooked. Overall, I don't think I'll be patronizing Lizzy J again. The food isn't cheap so I definitely expected very high quality and taste. However my expectations have been crushed."
11/10/2020,20201110,5,4.32,"My Yelp Elite Chicago Community Manager Alex C. ROCKS! He was instrumental in creating a ""Black Owned Business"" Collection on the website. I browsed through the collection and saw this gem. Based just on the food pics, it looked like a winner, but I noticed the reviews were good also.We made 11/7/20 10 a.m. reservations prior and took a drive on a mild, sunny Saturday morning here. I live 22 miles away from this restaurant so I was hoping my experience would be worth going the distance. We get there and see this quaint and bright establishment. I walk in and was immediately greeted by Chef and Owner Lizzie J! She was so pleasant. She actually was the one that seated us outside (due to Covid restrictions, no indoor seating allowed, only outdoor) which that impressed me RIGHT THERE! I've never been to a business where the actual owner seated me. I felt special :)We started out with hot tea which is created by her. Decided to try the Hibiscus Sangria flavor. It was really good! There are many hot/cold teas, lemonades that she offers and makes herself. We had ordered our food and was looking forward to our meal. Once again, Lizzy J came out proudly with our food. We tried the Shrimp and Grits, Freddy Jr. (chicken atop a sweet potato waffle) and fried Catfish fillet and Grits. Presentation was beautifully done. I tasted the shrimp & grits and I wanted to just immediately start crying due to having ultimate joy swirling around in my mouth! That was the BEST shrimp and grits I have ever had in my life, do you hear me? The shrimp in it were HUGE!! Grits were tasty also. Lizzy convinced me to get andouille sausage as an additional meat instead of the chicken sausage which I appreciated because the flavor was out of this world! My buddy enjoyed her catfish and grits as well.I want to clear up some false truths here. In some reviews, I have read that the service is slow. This is NOT TRUE! Folks, please keep in mind that everything is made from scratch so it does take longer. Even with that in mind, we did not wait long at all before our food came out. We were there for 3 hours and I watched food constantly being brought out to customers. I enjoyed my fried crispy flavored chicken so much, I ordered another thigh and I saw a customer with a cheesy biscuit that looked good so I ordered that as well. Again, the wait wasn't long before Tirell brought it out. Speaking of Tirell, he was the wait staff there. Amazing service with a smile he gave. Pleasant and very attentive - I really enjoyed him being our server and you will too. I also read in reviews complaints about certain food items being salty. I disagree with this as well. I have high blood pressure and cannot have food with alot of salt in it. All the food I had (I tried alot of items), none of it was salty. And if you find that it's salty, let Lizzy J know so she can fix it, she prides her creations on excellence. She is very good about asking how the food tastes and if it needs anything more to your liking.Lizzy J was happy to hear that her business was listed in the Yelp black owned business collection. I told her that is what brought me here. The business just recently made 1 year old. I noticed that Lizzy J took the time to talk to every customer that was dining there. Now, that's good business. I also got to meet her husband and he was pleasant as well. Just good people.I didn't want to leave. It was so nice outside and the area is quiet despite the street being a very busy one. Lizzy J also does catering and I definitely want to support her in that business as well.Please come and support this black owned business, you will not regret it! Make sure to make reservations (through Open Table) as this is a small restaurant with limited seating. Masks required, temp checks given, tables are distanced apart. What I thought was awesome that I've never seen is that each table had a bottle of hand sanitizer on it which I truly appreciated.Lizzie J, thank you for the most wonderful experience! I have been to a lot of restaurants but I must say that yours was one of the best & memorable experiences that I've had from pleasant service to excellent safety precautions to delectable food. You know I will be back and have already spread the word about your excellent establishment. Congratulations. A+++++!"
12/8/2020,20201208,5,4.33,Excellent foods for us and family! We ordered a 2nd bowl of cream of wheat because it was made in perfection.Definitely will come back when I am in the area.
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.34,Holy sweet taste buds of Jesus!!! We had reservations at this place a few weeks ago...the day of the big snowfall so we cancelled.We rescheduled for yesterday and SOOO glad we did! The specials called out were so amazing we couldn't decide so we ordered 4- half plates of the server's recommendation...BEST decision we could have made!Started with shrimp and grits...amazing flavors with andouille sausage and peppers...yum! Homemade biscuits and jam...so flaky and never disappoint! Then came the scrumptious crab cake benedict (Crabby Benny) with a side of delicious blueberries & creme French toast topped with homemade whipped cream! Amazing!!! This was before we even got to the chicken and waffles...chicken batter every so delicious and absolutely amazing! Shout out to my man in the kitchen frying up them wings...Mississippi native! EVEN better than the food was learning about the restaurant inspiration from the owner herself with those Philly roots! Love how this place incorporates the east coast brunch technique vibe with spice combinations of the south that intercept at greatness!!! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!! See you next Saturday???
2/22/2021,20210222,2,4.31,"Wanted to try this place for a while so me and my girls drove 50 minutes to this place anticipating some great eats. We were seated and began to review the menu only to find out they were out of half the menu. No crab Benedict, no lobster Benedict hell that's what we drove here for. We ordered a full order of the shrimp and grits and it came with 3 shrimp for $17! The flavors were good but not the best I've ever had. The owner came out and acknowledged the table across from us but barely gave us a second look. I guess because we complained to our waiter that if your confirming reservations the day of you should also let the patron know you're out of half the menu. Very disappointed, I really wanted to love this place."
3/6/2021,20210306,5,4.32,"Highly recommend!! Great staff, amazing food. We got the breakfast bowl and split a plate of peach french toast. YummmmmmSmall place but they do take reservations."
3/14/2021,20210314,5,4.33,"At the recommendation of a friend, I decided to pop in for a bite to eat. I fully understand why my friend kept banging on about the restaurant.Outstanding service from entry to dining to exit. I got a reservation because I had heard it's a small establishment. The host/server took my temperature and also provided sanitizer. Given we're still in pandemic mode, I appreciated the safety measure.But on to the good part. The chocolate chip scone was not dry like you get at most places. The Brit in me would not have clowned if they had cluttered cream to go with it. The dish that my friends will get tired of hearing me talk about are the lamb chops. I ordered them medium and they still came without being half cooked and they were extremely juicy. The scrambled eggs were hard enough that they we're runny, yet not crispy. And the home hashbrowns had enough seasoning that they were not just potatoes with salt and pepper. Washed it all down with some Lizzy J leach tea and it was all good.I could see myself showing up regularly every weekend. Given the location, they are going to be overwhelmed once the word gets out that the food they serve is indeed worth a long line."
3/21/2021,20210321,4,4.32,"Hubby and I found LizzyJ Cafe from a list of recommended restaurants to try during Chicago Restaurant Week from TimeOut. This deal includes your choice of selected entr√©e with a half order of French toast for $25. I chose the crabby lo benedict (butter poached crab and lobster tail meat with lemon and tarragon sauce topped with a poached egg) and lemon/blueberry French toast. Hubby had the lamb chops (pan seared lamb chops topped with a mushroom shallot reduction and cheesy hash) and peaches and cream French toast. Between the two entrees the crabby lo benedict was the clear winner. There was a generous amount of crab/lobster and the flavor of the benedict was good. However, I wish that it came with a side of hash browns. The lamb tasted gamey and the meat itself was tough. It only came with three pieces of lamb so it didn't seem that filling. Both of the French toast weren't bad. I just wished they used fresh fruit instead of canned/frozen fruit."
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.33,"My boyfriend & I came for restaurant week, but we will now be returning customers. I absolutely love this place already, from the food to the decor, down to the customer service. This intimate place is the best for a spin on traditional breakfast. & it's a plus that's it's black owned. I highly recommend."
3/21/2021,20210321,5,4.34,"First off..... BOMB! The food was made with love. This is a black owned business and baby when I say the customer service was EVERYTHING. To top it off, Lizzy herself brought our food to the table. That says to me she takes pride in her establishment. Livell was our waiter and he was very attentive. My BEST experience in Chicago thus far. Thank you staff for making this experience memorable"
4/8/2021,20210408,5,4.34,This little cafe has exceptional food. Wonderful dining experience. Everything Is homemade.  Biscuits are amazing.
4/18/2021,20210418,4,4.34,"Cute little restaurant. The food was good while being a bit different. The Freddie's Favorite sweet potato waffle had an interesting taste and the combination of syrup and hot sauce was a tasty combination.The French (French Toast) comes with a number of fillings. I ordered the Lemon Blueberry stuffed with Mascarpone. I did not find any mascarpone, but the tartness of the lemon with the blueberries was a nice mix.My one suggestion would be to offer a pot of coffee on the table. The waiter, a very nice young man, had his hands full with the getting food to the tables and we asked for refills and had to wait for coffee twice. While it may be a small thing, it is the little things that stand out.I will recommend Lizzy J's to my friends and we will be back."
4/25/2021,20210425,5,4.35,"a lovely time. we had an incredible brunch experience here - the food was absolutely delicious- we had the biscuits with jam, shrimp and grits with the chicken andouille sausage, a waffle, fish and grits, and the crab stuffed salmon and EVERYTHING WAS BOMB AF. The service was warm and inviting, Livell was spectacular! The byob champagne was great and the corkage fee was minimal. LizzyJ was extremely hospitable and we enjoyed ourselves immensely... oh yeah, the music was a vibe too!"
5/14/2021,20210514,5,4.35,I love this place! I'm here visiting my cousin end we stopped by for brunch. I love that it's BYOB also.. I ordered the crab Benedict and it was amazing! And I got to meet the chef! She is so sweet as was our server! I see people on Yelp who commented on the length of the wait for their food but everything is made to order so I'm not sure what people expect.. still worth it in my opinion. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago.
5/15/2021,20210515,5,4.36,"I can not say enough about Jaime and her staff. They are not only great at what they do, but they are good people most importantly. Try the shrimp and grits! The roux that they add is crazy!"
5/15/2021,20210515,4,4.36,Excited to try. Got the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a lot of fat and skin wasn't crispy. The spicy syrup they had on it was good and different. The peach French toast was a delightful treat. My server was very sweet and attentive.

5/17/2021,20210517,5,4.37,"The food and service--awesome!!! Our server was great. I could tell he was busy, but we always had everything we needed and he was very pleasant. Also, felt very covid-safe. I had the avocado toast and a side of grits. I usually find grits to have little flavor, but not these. They were creamy and delicious. My friend had the French toast, which is served with a sauce, not syrup. I haven't tasted a sauce like it... was it vanilla? Not sure, but it was magical. The only thing I wasn't stoked on was that a lot of the menu items said out of stock on the virtual menu. Cannot complain though, because the food I did have was so yummy. Will definitely be going back soon. Also, my parents had recommended this place to me, and they had the crabby Benny and loved it."

6/6/2021,20210606,4,4.37,Stopped in for brunch. Small space but super cute. I had my very first eggs benedict - with crab. It was very delicious. We also tried the sweet potato waffle which was delightful. We saw the chicken & waffle come out & it looked awesome. Will have to go back to try it out.

They have no waiting area therefore you wait outside on the street to be seated, not my favorite place to wait. The one waiter there was so busy I felt for him but he kept his cool and provided great service. I will go back."

6/19/2021,20210619,2,4.34,"We arrive early and we're seated quickly. The order system is cool. You order through your phone and it's sent straight to the kitchen. However, it went a little down hill from there. I didn't really see a clear system of follow through. The hostess had the manage orders, clean tables, organize pick ups and deliver food to tables. That's too much. I love you Lizzy J and I want you to thrive but might I suggest you get another person to manage the house and manage the to go orders. Maybe another cook or prep line person. You have so much potential to be amazing and a staple in this area. Hope to see you stay. I'll try you again some time."

6/20/2021,20210620,4,4.32,"Food was fine, service was a little slow, unorganized and inconsistent! They may need another person to help with the front-end of the restaurant. Ordered drinks they never came. Only when i asked to have them removed from my bill did i finally get them. Overall just need more help. I like the order system, they just need to be more efficient with the wait. You must make reservations otherwise you're turned away!! Just a heads-up!"
6/26/2021,20210626,5,4.32,"We have had LizzyJ on our list of Black-owned restaurants to visit for a while. This quaint, six-table restaurant had great customer service and tasty food. The atmosphere reminded me of my grandmother's kitchen, but the contactless ordering and pay system is definitely something from the 21st century. We ordered LizzyJ homemade teas and a short order of apple caramel french toast to start. The French toast was sweet and fresh. For brunch, we had the Bowl O'Breakfast and Fried Catfish & Grits. The food was good and came out hot. I was hoping for the Salmon but it was all sold out. All in all a great experience. Would recommend checking out!"

6/27/2021,20210627,3,4.32,"Visited this spot for Juneteenth and I am glad I did because I have been wanting to go for awhile. I went there and got the fish and grits--the catfish was on point! Fried nice and hot in temp, flaky, perfect seasoning--it was all that! Sauce at the bottom was coo, but grits were cold on my plate. I didn't understand that at all. They had some issues with pushing out orders timely due to back up in the kitchen. My friend ordered the french toast and hers was good--she said she wished the apples were cooked instead of raw but I thought it was delicious! Skip the bottled drinks. Although they sound delicious and fancy, I wasn't blown away by mine. I would go back again early on a non busy day and try the shrimp and grits!"
6/30/2021,20210630,3,4.31,"Stopped by to give it a try on Juneteenth in support of black owned businesses. Not a long wait. Tiny spot with 7 tables but nice spacing. Staff was pleasant but overwhelmed. I absolutely love that you scan the menu, order electronically and pay by phone. You would think that all it takes for the staff to do is READ so there are no mistakes that may happen such as a waitress getting something wrong or forgetting an item. NOT the case. A little chaos in the kitchen. The waitress/hostess/busie/greeter/runner was so exhausted and sweaty. Ordered mascarpone stuffed lemon blueberry French toast but I guess they did not read and the waitress/ everything lady was just walking around asking did you order this did you order this. A MESS! I want so bad to love this place because the owner did come around during the chaos to try and soften things up but too late couple at the other table was like nah... refund my money and they left. IF I am in the area I just might give them another try."
7/1/2021,20210701,4,4.3,"This place is a cute small restaurant with great service and food. Unlike other restaurants who overfill your plate, the portion sizes are exactly the right size to fill you up,The French toast was perfectly cooked with the caramel bourbon sauce, nuts and apple pieces as garnish. This place is definitely a great local, black owned spot that's a must stop for anyone looking for a quality meal."
7/2/2021,20210702,5,4.31,This spot is a great place to feed your empty tummy. Be sure to add all your special instructions in the ordering app. Also if you can't take caffeine bring your own beverage. The food was DELICIOUS!
7/9/2021,20210709,4,4.31,"This was my second time visiting Lizzy J's. Honestly, the first time we visited we were a bit disappointed because a lot of things were out of stock. However, what we did order was so delicious we decided to give it a second try. This time, we made a reservation for 9am when they first opened. This was perfect because we were the only customers for about the first 30 minutes or so. I had the chicken & (red velvet) waffle, which is a special for July. It was delicious !! Typically, restaurants just add red food coloring and call it ""red velvet"". But this particular waffle was very similar to the cake! I would definitely recommend. Lizzy Js is a great restaurant to visit if you're in the area. Try to book an early reservation and be on time as they have a 10 minute grace period."
8/15/2021,20210815,5,4.31,"This place is phenomenal. For my family i ordered the chicken and waffles, salmon and grits, and an eggs benny. My spouse really enjoyed the benny, and my daughter and I devoured our chicken & waffles like there was no tomorrow. Excellent fried chicken thigh and a delightfully spongy waffle. Also, the salmon was perfectly grilled, and the grits exceeded by leaps and bounds my sole criterion: they were better than what I can make at home.Now I ordered carry out, but the dine-in space - though smallish - appears very clean and cozy. The front staff was very welcoming without being obsequious; it was almost like visiting relatives (that you like). Great location, too, right across from Welles Park and half a mile west of the Brown Line station. I waited far too long to try this neighborhood spot, and I won't prolong that mistake. This is now my local go-to for breakfast."
8/29/2021,20210829,5,4.32,"This is a gem in Chicago. Visiting for the weekend and had to come by and support this Black, Woman owned business. The food is delicious, the service is friendly and professional. This will quickly become a staple in the area. Can't wait to come back again!"
9/14/2021,20210914,4,4.32,"An excellent place for brunch. The place is a little small, so the atmosphere is intimate and the tables go fast if you don't make a reservation earlier in the week. I recommend the catfish & cheese grits or the chicken & waffles. We even got to meet THE Lizzy J. herself, which was super cool to see the owner so close to the action."
9/26/2021,20210926,5,4.32,"I don't know where to start about this place. Great atmosphere. Great customer service, clean establishment and DELICIOUS FOOD! Definitely will be my spot to visit whenever I'm in town."
11/12/2021,20211112,5,4.33,"Went in for breakfast today and we were overwhelmed with how good the food was. We both tried a different tea (white tea mango & oolong peach) and both were delicious. You can easily split a pot of tea with another person as each pot has about 2.5 mugs full. For our meals, I had the bowl of breakfast with veggies, sausage and poached eggs. The grits were some of the best grits I have ever had, and the eggs were just perfect. I ate the entire bowl, I just couldn't stop!My boyfriend had the Freddys Favorite and the flavors were amazing together. It was so much more than chicken on a waffle, it was like these things were just meant to be together. We loved everything and would highly recommend stopping by. Amazing food, great service, and just all around a fantastic experience."
12/16/2021,20211216,3,4.32,"First off, I must say that the food here is delicious and I love the tea selection. I found the menu to be fairly simple, and it seems like they have worked hard to perfect those selections. I will say that these selections seem to be often limited, so I would recommend going early in the morning before most of the menu is marked ""out of stock"". My father felt some kind of way because the owner checked in with every table except for ours, however, the last time I visited here she did check in with my table, so I assumed that we may have been overlooked by mistake. The seating setup was just very uncomfortable this visit. We were seated right in front of the water refill area in a corner with very limited space. I realize that this is a small restaurant, but I think there is a way to space out the tables a bit more. Also, the server continued to nearly bump our table as we were super close to another table, which was less than ideal, particularly during a pandemic. I may come back for the food and tea, but it may need to be more of a take-out situation."
1/3/2022,20220103,5,4.32,"I stopped in solo on a weekend afternoon when I was in the area. I've had this place on my radar for at least a year. I was originally hoping to try their sweet potato waffle and chicken brunch dish, but they were out of it when I was there. I ordered the catfish and grits meal and was blown away. The piece of catfish was large, and the chili sauce the bordered the grits was the perfect touch. The restaurant is pretty small, but I believe they also accept reservations as well."
1/5/2022,20220105,4,4.32,"@guccis.grub's overall rating: 8/10As soon as you walk into Lizzy J Cafe , you enter a small space with less than 10 tables. However, that made it even more intimate . You see the team cooking in the back, you get genuine interactions with the waiters, and the owner is accessible.The food was a little salty for the others in my group but I was thoroughly satisfied with my Chicken & Waffles and they all cleared their plate! The only thing is that I wished there were more drink options. :( However, from what I have heard from others, the teas are great!"
2/14/2022,20220214,5,4.33,"Lizzy J Lizzy J !! My taste buds are still rejoicing! The petty in me didn't want to write this review because I don't need everyone rushing there at once... hogging up the tables. but this is too good not to share! I've visited Lizzy J cafe twice now and each time has been rememberable. It's a smaller cafe on the north side of the city. Paid street parking is available. Be sure to make a reservation before visiting! This is a neighborhood gem and I've seen people lingering outside waiting during my first visit.Before I get to the food, let me give flowers where they are due. There is a host/servicer/ operations manager that handles business.. ok! Kuddos to them for keeping everything moving smoothly while Lizzy J is in the kitchen with the rest of the team cranking out the goodness.During this visit four of us visited for brunch on Saturday morning. Our table wasn't ready as soon as we got there but our whole party wasn't there either! 8 mins after we were good to go. The space is small but it's cozy! You order via a QR code and use one phone to order. A little annoying but very efficient... I get it.I've tried both the dark and white chicken and waffles and both were AMAZING! The waffle, chicken, and syrup! I'll cry if they ever change the recipe. Lol! One one my girlfriends got the crabby Benny and LOVED it as well. Another one of my girlfriends ordered the catfish and grits and there was NOT A CRUMB left on her plate! Prices are also more than fair in my opinion. If you're looking for a great brunch place give Lizzy J cafe a go!"
2/18/2022,20220218,5,4.33,"I CANT EXPLAIN ENOUGH HOW AMAZING THIS PLACE IS. I want to keep this place a little secret since it is so amazing but I just HAVE to share. Not only does this place have AMAZING food, but the energy in this restaurant is unmatched. Me and my aunt had a morning breakfast date here. When arriving we were immediately welcomed by the amazing woman who I believe is the owner. She was so amazing! And don't even get me started on the food! We ordered the eggs benedict, catfish and grits, and the special which I can't remember the name of! This was 100% the best food I've ever had. It literally felt like I was having a home cooked meal. The special blew my mind. Will definitely be coming back over and over again."
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.34,We went for my mothers birthday. Everything was wonderful and they accommodated us perfectly. Very good vibes and great food.
3/10/2022,20220310,5,4.34,This guy knows how to cook! Atmosphere was chill. Food was thoughtfully prepared and plated. So many good options couldn't decide. Catfish and grits was flame!!!!!! I would recommend. Prices were very fair as well! Will definitely be back!!!!!
3/21/2022,20220321,1,4.32,"My best friend from graduate school invited me to have brunch here along with two of her coworkers. We had a reservation at 12pm and two of the friends were a bit late due to the traffick from the Shamrock race being held downtown. My friend and I were able make it on time as we live nearby. We were seated and no one came to check on us for 30 min. When the waiter came, he noticed that our full party was not there, and we gave him an update on their ETA after apeaking with them. The waiter was so rude, and told my friend who made the reservation to her face that she will be charged the no-show fee despite being present and seated. The waiter went on to add salt to the wound by telling my friend to read the policy next time in his rude fashion.Though we were excited to try the food, My friend no longer wanted to stay because of the rude exchange, and did not protest the fee charge. We simply told our friends who were present at this time, about the exchange and we decided to take our business elsewhere at a nearby diner. As someone with a legal background, Policy is policy. These are their rules to be followed understandably. However, no where in the policy does it state you should be rude and nasty when exercising that policy. I will not be returning to this business."
