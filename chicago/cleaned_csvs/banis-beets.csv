1/8/2019,20190108,5,5.0,The juices are amazing! She has everything that you need if you want something refreshing or if you're trying to go through a detox! I love the service that I get once I'm in this place. It's small and quaint! If you haven't tried it I highly recommend doing so! She also has snacks and other things for purchase. My favorite juices are purple rain and morning glory!
1/11/2019,20190111,4,4.5,Had the green juice. Very refreshing. No aftertaste. Will be going back for more.staying healthy in 2019 is one of my goals. Replace meds with green juice.
2/4/2019,20190204,1,3.33,"Terrible customer service! The woman that works there, I believe she is the owner, has a terrible attitude. The store was empty when I arrived and yet I had to wait while she finished a personal phone call in order to place my order. I was in the store for over 20 minutes for one juice, I will not return."
2/24/2019,20190224,4,3.5,"I would technically give it a 4.5 stars if I could. LOVED the ambiance and the decor. As a vegan, loved that she had a vegan food option. She had about 4 drink choices, tea, and snacks. I hope as her business does well she adds more drinks and food options to her menu.y juices were awesome. I got two different kinds. Also, the best part? If you return the glass jars she gives you a discount. This is awesome for the environment and I am sure saves her some money also! The only negative I could foresee is that the sign on the door says ""by appointment only"". She just so happened to be there when we were but I can see this potentially being a problem in the future if I wanted to stop by unannounced when running errands for example. It could be because she is starting up a business and needing to hire additional staff once it gets up and running.Her business is a breath of fresh air on the south side !"
3/13/2019,20190313,5,3.8,Incredibly cute place to start your day out healthy. I literally must have the purple rain..... soooo good with ingredients I dont see in any juice bars even downtown! So excited to have this healthy option on the south side. The owner is a sweetie
5/13/2019,20190513,5,4.0,I've been drinking this juice since before the owner opened and its always so fresh and yummy. The ambiance is zen and the street parking is always pretty easy. My favorites are the lean green and morning glory. Bottoms up!
6/11/2019,20190611,5,4.14,"I ordered their Lean Green cold pressed juice while dining at Majani's and finally made it to the actual shop. This place is so charming! I love seeing young business owners execute things well. All of the items that I ordered were fresh, not too sweet, and presented nicely, while the service was friendly and professional. I will be back for sure!"
10/3/2019,20191003,5,4.25,Such an amazing addition to Beverly. The juices are healthy and delicious. The owner is a hardworking woman who truly believes in the power of nutrition in our health. Definitely check this spot out - you will not regret it. Support small businesses!!
2/24/2020,20200224,5,4.33,Bani made me this plate of Scrambies on a croissant. She put some Beet-infused hot sauce it and it was outta this world.I got on the metra shortly thereafter and began my day drinking expedition.
6/25/2020,20200625,5,4.4,"Friendly service, great juices! Love to shop local so this place is great. Definitely try the Morning Glory and Lean Green"
7/17/2020,20200717,5,4.45,I love coming in here! The location is super convenient being right by the train. It's really nice to be able to get fresh cold pressed juice on the south side. Each juice has its own unique kick and I find myself craving them all the time! Definitely a favorite stop before heading to work!
10/13/2020,20201013,5,4.5,Deliciousness served with a side of great customer service!!! I always receive great service from Banis.
1/10/2021,20210110,4,4.46,The avocado toast was the best I've had in a while! I've tried it at other locations and this was by far the best I've had. The mild jalape単o spice along with the dressing and greens was delicious. I'd definitely go back just for the the toast. I also ordered the blueberry beet smoothie which was also delicious and had me feeling full long.
1/10/2021,20210110,5,4.5,"Banis Beets is a wonderful discovery. Great products and service! The customer care is unsurpassed! I'm so happy that they are in the Beverly area, and I wish them continued success at their new South Loop location."
3/5/2021,20210305,5,4.53,Great start to my morning!! The packaging is the perfect size for transporting and the juice tastes great. 10/10 I will be trying more items on the menu. Do yourself a favor and check out Banis Beets
4/9/2021,20210409,5,4.56,"Bani's beets is great! It's nothing but natural ingredients. Smoothies, healthy shots, salads, smoothie bowls, juice!! She has it all. If you struggle eating healthy come here and have it made for you with love."
5/28/2021,20210528,5,4.59,"This Sis right here has figured out the beat and made a full mix!!! 2nd stop on my May 2021 Chi-Town tour. We ordered via UberEats for some morning munchies. We ordered two order of Avocado Toast, Blueberry Beet Smoothie and the Beet It Juice. Delivery was prompt and the smoothie was still thick!So let me just tell you that this Avocado Toast gave me life!!! The mixture of spring mix, radish, cilantro, tomato, red onion, mozzarella, lemon, balsamic, and jalape単o is absolutely priceless. The radish and jalape単o give a nice crunch, the lemon a splash of citrus, and balsamic never disappoints. I honestly wished I had another slice! LolMy Blueberry Beet smoothie was yummy! The fruit blend with the almond butter and flax seeds gave it a smooth and nutty flavor which blended well with the blueberry, mango and apple...and thankfully I couldn't even taste the beet! Now the Beet It Juice...I'm going to say it was awesome since my breakfast partner drank all 8oz in one gulp and I didn't see it after blinking nor was I allowed to taste it. Lol!P.S. Sorry no pics...I was hungrier than I thought! Definitely order here...you won't be dis disappointed!"
8/9/2021,20210809,1,4.39,"This place deserves five stars for its products but I'm giving it a whopping one stat due to the nasty attitude of the people working behind the register. I don't know if they're unhappy or what, but I repeatedly experience customer service that is subpar. They act like I'm wasting their time or want to see me good and dead. It's honestly appalling. To whoever made me feel like crap today for simply wanting to buy a six dollar juice, I hope you experience the shitty feeling back so you understand how AWFUL you can make a person feel just because you're annoyed to be at work. I won't be coming back."
8/17/2021,20210817,5,4.42,"After taking my morning walk today I decided to visit Bani's Beets. They had been on my list of local black owned businesses to visit for a while. Upon arriving I walked into a clean and neat environment which for me was an immediate plus because I have a compromised immune system. A dirty entrance and waiting area is an immediate red flag for me. All three women were friendly, attentive and wearing masks! A second plus for the business. I ordered the Avocado Toast, 8 oz. Morning Glory Juice for me and the Blueberry Beet Smoothie for my mother. There was a minimal wait time and everything was made fresh. I will definitely be returning! The Avocado Toast was absolutely delicious. It was fresh, light, with just the right amount of heat from the jalape単os and the combined textures of the ingredients made it totally satisfying. The Morning Glory Juice was refreshing and a perfect after walk replenishment. And my mother who turns her nose up at anything healthy, and only wants milkshakes loaded with ice cream, drank every last drip of her smoothie and kept commenting on how good it was. That was when I knew we had found a new favorite. PLEASE keep doing things professionally and purposefully. So many businesses start skimping on the integrity of ingredients and slack on customer service once they have an established customer base. Thank you for bringing such healthy and wonderful food to our community. I hate it took me so long to visit. But I will definitely be back for more!"
11/30/2021,20211130,5,4.45,I was visiting family in town and had the pleasure of trying these pressed juices. Omg! Everything I tried was absolutely delicious. I thought the space was super cute and the aesthetic was right on point. I wish I was able to travel home with my juices. I will definitely be back the next time I'm home in Chicago.
12/11/2021,20211211,5,4.48,She's so sweet and those smoothies really get me going in the morning by far one of the best places in the city I really love this place and highly recommend it
2/10/2022,20220210,3,4.41,"I heard about this place through a friend! I was excited to start my health journey! I've purchased their pressed juices from Vegan restaurants so I was excited to go to the store! Unfortunately, my in-person experience was not great. Great products but due to bad customer service I will not return."
