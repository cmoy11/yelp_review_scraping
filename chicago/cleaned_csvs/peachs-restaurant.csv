Youthful staff, great customer services, seasoned management, well prepared great taste for morning menu. Fair neighborhood prices. A thumbs up for the community."
3/2/2015,20150302,5,4.5,"Very friendly staff, Rachel was great! Bright and open floor plan made for an atmosphere conducive for enjoying this wonderful breakfast. The food was fantastic!  The peach-infused coffee... was, in my opinion, a HIT! My only comment regarding the coffee is that I would have liked a saucer instead of using my napkin for my used spoon.This location is situated on a historic corner in the history of the community. Hopefully they will stay here for a very long time."
3/4/2015,20150304,5,4.67,"Excellently prepared breakfast items, especially the stoneground cheese grits. Decor is bright and open. Lunch menu is in the planning. I'll be back. Good job Cliff Rome"
3/10/2015,20150310,5,4.75,"Excellent spot!... Roomy,friendly, and CLEAN! A must try!! I had a full stack w/peach bourbon compote... GREAT!... & they have duck bacon, very unique..this is now my new hang out for breakfast or lunch!"
3/10/2015,20150310,3,4.4,I had the pleasure of visiting Peaches restaurant just the other day. It just opened this month and I must say it's good to have a sit down breakfast and lunch place on the Southside at 47th.st located on the northwest conner at King Dr. It's very convenient if you are taking the EL downtown and want to stop and have something to eat or a coffee before you make the trip. Unfortunately if driving parking could be a concern since there is no parking lot. The French toast was excellent the omelets were a nice size and very good. The other breakfast dishes are very delicious and inviting however it seems somewhat pricy for breakfast. The waiting staff is pleasant and fast. I'll have to try the lunch menu next time I go.
3/12/2015,20150312,4,4.33,"The staff is amazing! I was greeted as soon as I entered, everyone had a smile on their face and it made me feel welcomed. The food was ok, nothing I would rave about however, the coffee was exceptional. This is a new establishment and there are a few kinks that need to be ironed out. I believe if the restaurants keeps the motivation high they are sure to succeed. I give Peach's 4 stars solely on the customer service."
3/24/2015,20150324,3,4.14,"The restaurant is ample in size with a 6-8 person counter. It's bright and airy, clean. The waitstaff were pleasant. The biscuit with peach compote was delicious as was my egg white omelet. If you like your pancakes crepe thin, you'll like these. Good, solid breakfast with little fuss. A nice and needed addition to the neighborhood."
4/4/2015,20150404,4,4.12,The service was great and the food was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the duck bacon. I appreciate the attentive management who kept the obvious newbies buzzing around earning their stripes. We had a great time without waiting too long on a crowded Sunday morning. The prices were appropriate for the meal.
4/5/2015,20150405,1,3.78,"I had so much hope for this establishment. However when I visited with my mother and grandmother all hope faded. The only reason they received 1 star from me was due to being seated fast. That was the last service that came in a timely manner. After sitting for 10 minutes I asked for a server. The young lady finally came and stated she will be back shortly. Up in her return maybe 5 minutes later she took our order. The waitress repeated our order 3 times , bust still came back to the table 10 minutes later asking what type of meat I want. At that time I should have been alarmed. We continue to sit there and sit there and sit there and sit there and sit there lol ( 25 minutes went by) . Finally my grandmother ( who has short term memory loss) noticed we been sitting for a while. I asked the manager/owner where is my food because people who came after us has their food, and almost done eating. She stated it will be out shortly and do want some more water?! Uhhhhh NO I would like my food lol. After waiting another 15 minutes for some scrambled eggs we just left. So basically my trip to the city was going terrible until I went down the street to Ms. Biscuits!!! I will NEVER SUGGEST OR VISIT THIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN! The guy at the door was smug when I informed him we never had the chance to eat after all that time."
4/19/2015,20150419,2,3.6,"Ordered two eggs scrambled with cheese as a side order to a special. Here's how they rang it up. Eggs X 2:   3.90Cheese X 2: 1.50That's right folks. Two eggs scrambled w some American cheese is $5.40 at Peaches. Do they know how many eggs I can get for $5.40???I could see if there was some culinary interpretation, fancy garnish or artistic presentation. But no, this was two eggs w American cheese as served at every diner, dive and greasy spoon found anywhere in the country. Plain as plain can get. I'm calling shenanigans."
4/19/2015,20150419,3,3.55,"Tried Peach's today, I was interested because they serve duck bacon, you have to try a place with duck bacon. It was thick and tasty. The home style potatoes are seasoned well and eggs cooked perfectly. The pancakes were just ok, the duck bacon is why you should try them. Nice sized restaurant that can seat a large amount of people and parking wasn't too bad you can park on king drive or 47. The staff was nice and friendly."
4/21/2015,20150421,3,3.5,"I stopped in with very little time on my hands so I stuck with a safe order: bacon egg and cheese on sourdough and coffee. They carry Stivers coffee which is good. The sandwich was okay. The place is bright, the prices are fair, there is plenty of seating and the staff is very very friendly. I plan to return when time isn't an issue."
4/26/2015,20150426,4,3.54,"The food is very good. I tried duck bacon for the first time. It was great! Our order came to the table quickly. The waitress was very professional, nice and always had a smile She made very helpful food suggestions. Overall, the restaurant was clean and inviting. A very pleasant experience."
4/30/2015,20150430,4,3.57,Peach Bourbon compote on everythaaaaang
5/5/2015,20150505,5,3.67,Great food... Try the DLT. Peach coffee is really good and strong. The service was great. I will be back soon to try the salmon croquettes and cheese grits :)
5/10/2015,20150510,5,3.75,"Today was our first time there, my mother-in-law told us about, so my husband and I went to check it out for ourselves. The hostess was very friendly and asked if it was our first time and we said yes. A waiter brought us water as soon as we sat down and informed us that he would not be serving us but he gave us the name of the waitress that would be. She was very friendly told us that they had just opened March 1st. She took our order and it arrived in a timely manner. I had the Peach's special scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and home potatoes with green peppers and onions sprinkled with paprika, sausage links and pancakes with Apple Bourbon Compote Delicious!! My husband had Salmon patties with cheese grits also Delicious!! I also had Peach coffee which was very flavorful. I will definitely go back again and recommend my family and friends give it a try!"
5/10/2015,20150510,3,3.71,"We visited here on a Sunday and it just so happened that Peach's was serving their Mother's Day brunch - only menu. After about a 30 minute wait our party of 5 was seated. Overall I thought that was there was minimal attention to the customer experience and the food was just Okay. To start, the waiter approached with water but never introduced himself or established that he was the waiter, I actually thought he was a busboy until he suddenly started taking orders. Additionally, the waiter seemed unfamiliar with the offerings of the day. One member of our party requested an omelette. Several minutes later we were notified by one of the other many staff members that they weren't serving omelettes that day... Which I found strange since they were serving eggs. Wouldn't it have been easier to just accommodate the customer in this instance? While there seemed to be a ton of unnecessary staff present, we still had to hail someone down for coffee cream, straws, and coffee refills. I order the fried chicken and found it to be under seasoned and overly greasy. The chicken was accompanied by French toast which was meh. While I think Peach's is a positive addition to a neighborhood that has very few seated dining options, I would not go out of my way to eat here again."
5/12/2015,20150512,4,3.72,"After waiting for nearly three years for an actual business to follow the window's announcement, Peaches has finally opened. Congrats to the local chef who is leading his own quiet revolution in historic Bronzeville to assist in the area's return to its former splendor.I recently enjoyed a late breakfast at Peaches. Although it was well after noon, the place had a casual but active group of patrons dispersed throughout the wide, open space. Upon entering, my guest and I were immediately greeted by a pleasant, attractive young woman. We were seated within five minutes and both ordered the ""two egg special"" with bacon and coffee. While the skimpy bacon portion was hardly justified by the cost, the other components were on point: eggs cooked to order, creamy grits, choice of toast or potatoes and fresh coffee (there is an unusual Peach-flavored brew that wasn't to my liking but it wasn't terrible - I switched to regular).Service was attentive and accommodating. We spent $25 for two for breakfast. I was glad to support the effort, especially since the site, food quality, etc are sorely inadequate in the area. Best wishes, Peaches, and I plan to return soon!"
5/14/2015,20150514,5,3.79,"I really enjoyed my visit to Peach's. I came across this place accidentally and was very pleased with the experience. The waitstaff was perfect--they were all helpful and attentive without being overbearing. I liked the atmosphere and the decorations. It's a cute place to go for breakfast with family and friends. And the food was very good. There is not a huge menu, but I ordered Peach's special which is salmon croquettes and cheese grits and it was a perfect brunch meal. I also had the peach tea and that was delish as well."
5/16/2015,20150516,4,3.8,"Pretty good. Some unique options. The waitress seemed possibly new, as she came back about 5x to confirm/ask more questions about our order. I wouldn't go here if you are in a rush- kinda slow. Also waited forever for the check. Worth checking out! My mom raved about the peach coffee."
5/17/2015,20150517,5,3.86,"This is an awesome new edition to the Bronzeville neighborhood. Me and my Fiancée have been looking for a great brunch place in Bronzeville since we moved here. With the new initiatives that are happening in the area, this was a perfect edition and we are glad we noticed it. The inside of the establishment has a loft meets cafeteria feel to it mainly because of the exposed duct work and the tables. The staff is very welcoming and they had a DJ spinning some old school R&B tunes. As for the food, it was delicious. I had Peach's special which is 2 eggs any way, choice of meat, with choice of pancakes or toast and homemade potatoes or grits. I had duck bacon (my first time ever) with the potatoes and pancakes. I added the peach bourbon compote on top of my pancakes! My fiancée ordered the same thing but had turkey sausage and cheese grits. There was one down side to the food experience. The grits were kind of bland and the pancakes were really soft. I'm sure if you let them know they can fix it. Overall the meal was excellent and it was surprisingly cheap. Our bill came to about $25 for the two of us combined and we had great portions of everything. We are def going to return soon!"

5/24/2015,20150524,4,3.91,"Upon waking in you notice the old school stove, decor and that southern hospitality. They have a chalkboard wall with specials. I had the banana foster French toast, good flavor to the bread but slightly on the sweeter side for me. The potatoes are off the chain, very well seasoned. I would come back to try the omelets and pancakes which looked very delectable. Good portion size you leave full but not overstuffed."
5/25/2015,20150525,5,3.96,I love breakfast and I'm in love with Peaches!!! Love the salmon croquettes and the cheese grits. The BLT is also great as is the peach coffee. Lovely spot!!! A must for brunch and breakfast lovers.
6/7/2015,20150607,5,4.0,Excellent service and food. I'm happy to see Peach's in the Bronzeville neighborhood. Black owned and employing young Black people. I'll be back.
6/14/2015,20150614,5,4.04,"Solid diner. Very cute. The fruit was fresh, duck bacon delicious, and service was both prompt and friendly. Prices were more than reasonable. Peach coffee was also very fun."
6/15/2015,20150615,4,4.04,"Good clean, new diner in Bronzeville. Solid faire for what I have tasted. Eggs cooked to order, and the duck bacon...real good. Their potatoes taste just average, but they aren't greasy...so I am betting they are healthy, they got a small kids Menu too...my wife is still raving about the cheese grits..."
6/20/2015,20150620,5,4.07,Fresh and fluffy omelettes. Delicious pancakes but the winner has to be the house potatoes!!! Plus they have peach coffee that was very tasty and on the stronger side. I'll be back for sure.
6/25/2015,20150625,1,3.97,"Once again i try to support my neighborhood but as always lack of customer service comes into play! Sat down for almost 10 minutes without being asked for even water! I tried to show moms a good time couldn't even do that! When entering, management gave no acknowledgement or nothing and they got the nerve to be pricey!!! Won't see me again!!"
6/28/2015,20150628,1,3.87,"I hate that I didn't have the option to give this place less than 1 star. My first mistake was telling my mother that no one could screw up breakfast. It was HORRIBLE! All of the workers with the exception the manager looked like they had just rolled right out of bed after a long night on the town. No one wore hair nets despite the long weaves and shoulder length braids and cornrows that dangled from every waiter and waitresses head and into the plates of diners. AND then the food came! Uuuugh. Their idea of an omelet; four leaves of spinach between 2 to 3 eggs that were cooked to hell and sprinkled w/ the cheapest cheese. Well you should just forget about the seasoning.The pancakes were raw in the middle. My mom requested crisp bacon. However, when her bacon arrived it was still flopping on the plate. So when we made mention to the waitress she had my mom remove the bacon from her plate onto another plate. The waitress then whisked the bacon off to the kitchen. She then came back with the SAME pieces of bacon that had been nuked for 2 additional seconds and brought to the table, now, only half way flopping on the plate. It took us exactly 25 minutes to receive our food-- not counting the time we sat waiting to be acknowledged or given water. Ooooh, after all of this I almost forgot to mention, the food was cold. I spoke with the manager Cynthia who was nice and seemed to be receptive to feedback. She never communicated that she would be taking a portion off of our bill. She just delivered the bill and I guess we were supposed to be grateful that she took off a portion of the bill. We certainly did not expect her to comp a portion of the bill as we had fully planned on paying. We still gave our waitress a tip for okay service and bad food. I will say that Abby our initial waitress was good but 2 other random workers/waitresses actually delivered our food. Umm where did they come from???? I was excited to try this place and was looking forward to having a place to dine as it is located right in my neighborhood. I don't think I will ever be back. I'm chuckling because they had the nerve to be costly. Ooooooh there is soooo much more I can say but I will leave it at this . . . . .. a major disappointment! I hope that they can make some adjustments and improve on the quality of their workers and food. Hoping they can turn it around."
7/5/2015,20150705,4,3.87,"1st time here once seated we were bought menu's & water but the wait for our server was at least 10 min. Server was pleasant and knowledgable about menu. Nice soft jazz played through the speakers - provides a nice background sound track. Once we ordered chicken gumbo, salmon croquettes, veggie omelet. Wifee went with fried cat fish greens, and grits. In a word the food was great. The gem in the heart of Bronzeville is a must visit spot for good eats. They just need to tighten up the service. That's why the get a 4 & not a 5 rating. Food & atmosphere are excellent !"
7/8/2015,20150708,3,3.84,This is my third visit. I keep coming because I am a block away and I want to patronize a neighborhood business. The food is pretty good but they are slow and a bit unorganized. Upon arrival each guest should be greeted. Upon being seated someone should bring a glass of water to acknowledge your presence. Guest should not have to wait 20 or 30 minutes to be acknowledged with a glass of water. After you manage to get some water you then have to wait another 15- 20 minutes to have your order taken. They have 9 or nine people running around not getting anything accomplished including management. This could be a very good dining experience if the management was more invested in customer service than telling each employee every step as they attempt to wait on customers. Their grits are really good!!!!
7/9/2015,20150709,2,3.79,"I was excited about a new breakfast spot on the South Side; however, I must say I was very disappointed with my carry out order. I tried the Peach's Favorite (Salmon Croquettes and Cheese Grits). Unfortunately, it was not my favorite! The cheese grits were soupy and I was extremely dissatisfied with the taste, as well as, texture of the croquettes. In addition, this dish is way overpriced.  For the price, it should at least come with a side of toast and/or eggs. I really wanted to like this place...oh, well."
7/11/2015,20150711,3,3.76,"I had the peaches special eggs, pancakes & diced potatoes with duck bacon($1.50 upcharge) & peach flavored coffee. I asked for a side of the bourbon peach compote for my pancakes. Breakfast was average the potatoes was good it was cooked hard enough not mushy and great flavor with whatever seasoning they added to it. I never had duck bacon it wasn't fatty more lean and good they gave 3 or 4 pieces don't remember. I enjoyed it more then turkey bacon & it will be my go to for now on in my home i need to google to find where to buy. The pancakes were average w/the peach compote it reminded me of a peach cobbler not too sweet w/nutmeg. I'll return menu wasn't extensive"
7/12/2015,20150712,5,3.8,"So so so so GOOD! I've been here 3 times and the experiences gets better and better. Their servers are phenomenal (shout out to Jerome!!!) and the food is ALWAYS fresh. I am so glad this restaurant is in Bronzeville. Continue provide excellent service and I will continue to return!Oh, and the Peach Blend Coffee and the DJ.... AMAZING!!!"
7/29/2015,20150729,4,3.81,"Nice diner style place that's good for breakfast or lunch. The service can sometimes be slow or forgetful but we have noticed an improvement over time since they first opened. That said, almost every trip there's some small hiccup. Last time we asked for a coke and coffee refill. The waitress brought the coffee but completely forgot about the coke so we needed to ask again. The time before our food took forever to come. When we asked it showed up instantly because it has been sitting ready for a while and the waitress just forgot about bringing it to us. Minor annoyances that the good food makes up for, but you don't need to deal with this type of thing at most other restaurants."
8/8/2015,20150808,2,3.76,"I would love to give this place five stars for multiple reasons the service was good, this restaurant is black owned, it's close to where I live and the food is affordable. However, there is one thing I couldn't mention which is the most important thing when I visit a restaurant, the food. We go restaurants to have our taste buds satisfied but I did not experience that here. I ordered the Peach's special in which I chose French toast, grits, sausage with 2 eggs scrambled with cheese. The grits were way too salty, the French toast had no flavor, the eggs were hard and nearly too brown and the sausage was just regular. This place has very good rating on Yelp but it didn't live up to the hype. My BF had been here before and he said the food was delicious and the service was excellent but I can only agrees on the good service the food was horrible I was very disappointed and will not be returning anytime soon. P.S if you want some good coffee to take home get some from Peach's the coffee is really good and has an amazing peach taste that you will remember"
8/19/2015,20150819,4,3.76,"After reading other reviews I decided to try it myself. I went with two of my residents as our lunch outing for the month. I was expecting a long wait to be seated, a long wait to be recognized and a long wait for my food order to be taken and delivered but I was surprisingly wrong! Everything was great, the food, the deco, the servers, everything. I especially like the fact that the restroom was well lit and clean. The only complaint I have is that they have a limited lunch menu. The breakfast for lunch was great! We had a good time. The manager came over and talked with us. He listened to us and thanked us for our comments. I will be back!"
8/29/2015,20150829,5,3.79,"I absolutely love the food. Coming all the way from Atlanta I was excited to try the food. It came highly recommended and they definitely lived up to their great reputation. My husband and I tried the Peaches special with the duck bacon, and my son the waffle and turkey bacon. Very healthy meal with egg whites and good coffee. I've never tried duck bacon before and I must say it was yummy delicious. On top of going with some friends that frequent the place we had a great time and will definitely be back."

9/5/2015,20150905,1,3.76,"I love this place. However, they have to receive 1 star for the horrible experience my wife and I had today. Apparently, they were short staffed today, which is never a problem, if the establishment (I.e. Management) knows how to strategically place everyone. We should have known to turn around from the door once we entered. The wait was very short, about 5 minutes, if we wanted a table. We requested a booth but noticed that several tables and booths were available yet dirty. We inquired about the available booths and were told they would be ready soon. About 10 minutes later we were finally seated. Ok. A little rough start.Things took a turn for the worst when we sat for about 15 mins before someone came over to give us water. When the person brought the water, they did not greet us. They just sat the water down and left. We started to think: Ok, maybe this wasn't the best idea but the food is great. Let's just stay. As we sat there, we noticed that the servers were just aimlessly walking around: some going to the same tables over and over, some just gazing off and others conversing with each other. At this point, my wife and I are frustrated. We angrily stare and try to flag down several servers to come take our orders. Finally, one server (who was already carrying almost the whole restaurant) came and said I'll get your server. 5 minutes later, she came by the table again, saw we had not been served and took our orders. She was very apologetic and explained how understaffed they were today. She became our saving grace for the rest of the time there. My wife called for the manager. Christopher C., the manager at the time of our service, came over to inquire about what was happening for us. When my wife explained about the lack in service we had been receiving, he gave us this half assed excuse about how he too has been ""shocked"" at the service today. Sir, how can you be shocked at the service if you are the one coordinating it? He continued to fumble through his excuses and gave us some apologies. He then offered to give us a free drink for our Inconvenience. Yeah. That surely makes up for our inconvenience in the service you are coordinating today *sarcastic voice*. While this is happening for us, other customers around us are beginning to notice the lack in service as well. They all are being treated in the Same manner as us. Some have complained to Christopher as well or have decided to leave. After about 45 minutes from the beginning of this whole fiasco, our food finally comes. My wife's food was fine. However, my eggs were undercooked and had a weird taste. I stopped eating them and had my wife taste them. She agreed that they tasted funny. We called for Christopher again. At this point I have lost whatever appetite I had left. He comes back over and we explain to him the issue. AGAIN, he tries to explain away the situation stating ""the server should have asked you if you wanted scrambled eggs soft, hard, etc."" He then expresses how over the last 4 years he has worked at different establishments and this is the first time this has ever happened under his watch and how shocked he was that this is happening. Good sir, my wife and I ordered the same thing and neither of us specified, beyond just wanting scrambled eggs, how we wanted them. As my wife pointed out, it's not the servers fault for not asking us, it's the cook for not being consistent and management for not properly training the servers. After we made a complaint about the food, several tables around us starting complaining very loudly. The manager is giving all of them the same excuses. We all united in a storm of complaints. He offered us 50% off of our Bill. He then tried to tend to all the other complaints. The server came back one more time to apologize. At this point, My wife and I lost our appetites and just pushed the food away. When the sever brought us our bill and Christopher (the manager) didn't do anything to the bill, we called him back over again. He again gave more excuses with apologies and then finally said he would cover the meal 100%. We gave him some insight as to how we would have liked this experience to have happened and then we left. We will give them another try as this is the first time we have received this kind of poor service, but we won't be returning for a while. Hopefully, a new system will be in place by the time we return."

AGAIN, he tries to explain away the situation stating ""the server should have asked you if you wanted scrambled eggs soft, hard, etc."" He then expresses how over the last 4 years he has worked at different establishments and this is the first time this has ever happened under his watch and how shocked he was that this is happening. Good sir, my wife and I ordered the same thing and neither of us specified, beyond just wanting scrambled eggs, how we wanted them. As my wife pointed out, it's not the servers fault for not asking us, it's the cook for not being consistent and management for not properly training the servers. After we made a complaint about the food, several tables around us starting complaining very loudly. The manager is giving all of them the same excuses. We all united in a storm of complaints. He offered us 50% off of our Bill. He then tried to tend to all the other complaints. The server came back one more time to apologize. At this point, My wife and I lost our appetites and just pushed the food away. When the sever brought us our bill and Christopher (the manager) didn't do anything to the bill, we called him back over again. He again gave more excuses with apologies and then finally said he would cover the meal 100%. We gave him some insight as to how we would have liked this experience to have happened and then we left. We will give them another try as this is the first time we have received this kind of poor service, but we won't be returning for a while. Hopefully, a new system will be in place by the time we return."
9/7/2015,20150907,2,3.65,"Unfortunately the experience here was mediocre at best. The decor failed to invite and felt more empty than anything despite the moderate crowd. There was an unnecessary wait for the food which lacked and the signature Peaches coffee left me begging for the regular blend. I will not be returning but I'm happy to see the business erected in the rising Bronzeville community. Since food and these reviews are subjective, I encourage those in the area to support and more importantly, the business to step it up a bit and find a way to WOW their consumers."
9/10/2015,20150910,5,3.68,I was very excited that there was a new black own business in the community so I just had to give it try. I came here with my best friends was automatically greeted and seated the atmosphere was just amazing the customer service was five stars and the food was great this will be a go to a lease once a week thank God my job is right down the street.

We got there 15 minutes before they closed and they had every menu option available.The Peach's coffee was so strong yet so good. The service was very attentive and generous. I got the 4 wings and french toast with strawberries for about $12. The chicken was well seasoned and the french toast was buttery and amazing.My mom had the turkey sausage with eggs, grits, and the home made biscuit. My cousin and sister in law had the grits, salmon, and pancakes.Everyone loves the grits and the biscuits were soft and flaky.We all were full and the bill for 4 people came to about $55. We will definitely be back."
9/13/2015,20150913,5,3.77,"If you haven't tried this place yet where have you been? This is my new breakfast spot! The food and service was amazing. I ordered the salmon and cheese grits. The salmon was seasoned well and the grits were outstanding. Our waiter Jermaine was on point he checked on us often and made sure we were ok. Oh I forgot to mention the coffee was better than Starbucks, it was a little strong but was very tasty. I will definitely be back!"

Also loved the peach waffle and creamy grits. The service was excellent. Really warm and inviting dining room. Will definitely go back and recommend it to others."

9/20/2015,20150920,5,3.88,"My expectations for Peaches are always high because every time I visit my guests and I have a great experience. Our server this morning, Tilila, was outstanding. She exceeded our high expectations through the way she interacted with us. Her menu suggestions were right on target. We will return again."
10/1/2015,20151001,5,3.91,"I promised the owner I'd write a review now I'm holding myself to it. OMGAWDTHISPLACEWASEVERYTHINGABROWNGIRLEVERWANTEDIN­ABLACKOWNEDBRUNCHSPOT!!!*breathes*1) I went with some of the most beautiful brown queer femmes I've come to know and it was just fantastic to laugh, and grieve and eat.2) Our waitress was phenomenal. Knew that menu like the back of her hand and kept the specials coming so we all had feels about what to eat. 3) Because the wait for our food was long, the kitchen staff came out to apologize for the wait, and gave every single person at the table a complimentary biscuit and peach glaze. Those biscuits are the size of a grown man's fists and are not to be eaten by the weak.4) Everything was just delicious. And being around so many brown and black people who just wanted to share in joy and love of food was everything a girl could ask for on a cloudy Sunday afternoon. 5) While the decor seemed to be a place of ""oh my gawd this isn't inviting at all"", I can say that it's about the feeling of a restaurant when you walk in that is the appeal. You had church folk, friends, lovers, families that came and just wanted to enjoy each others' company. I actually thought it was brilliant that it looked like old school black diners and the real presentation is in the food. This place is DEFINITELY worth the trip and I'm all the way in RPark so you know I mean business."
10/2/2015,20151002,5,3.93,I was here yesterday with my best friend and I loved it my food was delicious I order the steak & eggs with pancakes and grits the steak was delicious tender and juicy this was my first visit and I must say I will be back on my birthday on the 29th my whole meal was delicious service was OK overall great place just wished they were open a little later
10/4/2015,20151004,5,3.95,"Awesome little Brunch restaurant located on the corner or 47th & King Drive. Went there on friday with girlfriends for breakfast, the service was great and food even better. I am definitely happy and welcome new business to the community."
10/6/2015,20151006,2,3.91,"I am very disappointed with this place. I had been hearing good things abt this place and our experience wasn't a good. We normally go CCW down the street (sometimes crowded but always have more than enough food). Decided to try ""Peaches."" We ordered 2 greek omelettes and we were only given 2 smalls strips of lamb( approx 1 oz) served with an egg white omelette with peppers. So I basically paid $25 for 2 egg white omelettes. We wont be back. I only gave it 2 stars bc the service was great and the place is clean."
10/6/2015,20151006,1,3.86,Let me begin by saying the servers are really nice at this establishment HOWEVER.. The food is sub-par at best. We ordered one of the specials which was the Greek omelette. Well what I received was an egg white omelette. I ordered the omelette to be made with all egg whites as it was however I didn't think I was gonna receive only roughly 1 oz of gyro meat(approximately 5 little strips for an omelette that probably consisted of roughly 4-5 egg whites. The omelette had a few onions sparsely placed throughout the omelette and an overwhelming presence of Swiss cheese. I would have done better ordering and all egg white veggie omelette with cheese (it would have been cheaper). The best thing about the breakfast was the toast now I am not an advocate of carb eating however after this breakfast I was still slightly hungry. Nevertheless this was our first and LAST EXPERIENCE with peaches as we will never be back again. When we are in this area we typical frequent another breakfast establishment nearby however we decided to give peaches a chance after looking at the ERRONEOUS Yelp reviews. Well.. Sometimes change is not always good.
10/8/2015,20151008,5,3.88,"So, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Whenever I am in Chicago, I have to go to Peach's. I just have to. Everything about this restaurant is great to me. The food is delicious, the people are great, and the prices are even better. My first time visiting I ordered the egg and bacon sandwich with potatoes. My friend ordered the catfish, grits, and greens; I regretted my decision once I tasted his food. Don't get me wrong, my sandwich was delicious and just what I wanted, but everything about his food was mouth-watering. The grits were cheesy and smooth, while the greens were super flavorful. So good!"
10/11/2015,20151011,4,3.88,"We had a great meal! My husband absolutely Loved the cheese grits with the salmon cakes. The catfish, greens and grits were scrumptious too. In fact, the duck bacon and a biscuit with peach compote rounded out a nearly perfect meal. The staff was courteous; service was a bit slow and spotty (plates weren't cleared regularly, and it took a while to receive our orders and water) but the manager and individual staff members were responsive when prompted. I will definitely go back before I leave Chicago. Really great to see another new restaurant with nice ambiance and good food on the Southside."
10/12/2015,20151012,5,3.9,Yummy! Went here for the first time with my LSs and the food was excellent!!! Had the philly omelette and chocolate pancakes. I'll be working out for awhile (; but the food was great!
10/14/2015,20151014,5,3.92,"I love this place. The food, service, and atmosphere are all wonderful! I have eaten there several times on Sunday mornings and every experience has been great. The waffles are fantastic."
10/15/2015,20151015,5,3.94,I love this place. . . The perfect addition to the neighborhood (long overdue). Great Food with Great Customer Service. :-)
10/20/2015,20151020,4,3.94,The young people here are very hospitable. It was great to see them working and providing excellent customer service. They were extremely attentive to the customers' needs. The food was pretty good as well. I plan to go back with my family so that I can just put some more money into the pockets of the young people.
10/25/2015,20151025,5,3.95,"Incredible restaurant with A+ service. The Greek Omelet is my favorite. It's incredibly tasty and the tzatki sauce is better than most Greek restaurants I've been to in Chicago. We usually have Jerome as our waiter and he is one of the friendliest, professional waiters I've had. The good news is that even when we've had other servers, they've been wonderful too."
10/25/2015,20151025,3,3.94,"This has been a long process for this location to open. We have been anticipating the opening of Peach's for a while and I'm so excited to finally try it. This location has plenty of parking space throughout on King Drive on both sides of 47th street. The restaurant was open and bright and full of people this Saturday for brunch and there was only a less than Ifive minute wait to be seated. Looking around this is a great location for families or friends getting together for brunch and the staff was very friendly and the manager was walking around ready to answer any questions that customers may have had. The server that served us was really great wonderful personality and was able to explain some things on the menu in terms of what we can substitute and what we could not. When we placed our order it took a little while for order to come out in the first thing when we asked for was coffee which took over 5 minutes for her to come though the server did tell us that they were brewing a new fresh pot of coffee it still took longer for the coffee to get to us. The manager apologized and brought out a cup of coffee and also their special peach coffee which was pleasantly surprising good. Once our food arrived which we ordered one scrambled egg, chicken and french toast, and cheesy grits the chicken had a weird taste. The manager came over and quickly asked if he could exchange it for something else so we got bacon. Overall the restaurant was nice but nothing special and the staff is trying to work things out. I won't probably return but a great place to probably just get a simple breakfast at an inexpensive price."
10/26/2015,20151026,4,3.94,"A neighborhood delight I was here on Saturday and enjoyed the chicken philly omelette which was very good. The potatoes were excellent seasoned and cooked to perfection. I will be back for the biscuits. Great service, nice atmosphere, great location!!"
11/1/2015,20151101,5,3.96,"This is a great restaurant with an awesome menu, great service and space. I particularly enjoyed the southern omelette with home style potatoes and the duck bacon. The service was professional, timely and genuinely warm so much so I can't imagine why I'm just now trying. This is a bronzeville gem!! I've not had a chance to sample the lunch menu but I'm definitely looking forward to visiting again real soon!"
11/17/2015,20151117,1,3.91,This is usually my favorite place for breakfast but the food was not on point today. The grits were watery and did not have its usual great taste. The eggs were rubbery and full of oil. I was in a hurry so I did not have time for the back and forth. The toast and coffee were about the best thing! Very disappointed today!!!
11/18/2015,20151118,3,3.9,BLACK OWNED BUSINESS I love the decor and had heard great things about this restaurant. Sadly my Catfish Poboy disappointed me.It was kinda fishy and dry. For $8 I expected a better sandwich and it only came with chips.My friend had the Philly Omelette which was good. I'll give them another try and order that next time.
12/7/2015,20151207,3,3.89,If you love grits this is the place. If you do not then this is not. The people with me love grits and are happy. I do not like grits and my omelette is okay to bland. The potatoes are well seasoned. My food came out warm.
12/15/2015,20151215,4,3.89,"My first experience at Peaches in Bronzeville was very pleasant and satisfactory. The waiter, Tarvis, was exceptional and the chef went above and beyond in providing a hearty vegan breakfast that wasn't on the menu. Clean, with quirky decor, I will be returning."
1/3/2016,20160103,4,3.89,My cousin and I got to try the 7up pancakes and I gotta say that although I couldn' taste the 7up as much as I hoped...the cream cheese glaze that they gave on the side really sealed the deal.The food was on par with what you would expect of a good diner. And everyone gave service with a warm smile...who woulda thought Chicago would be so cozy in the winter time? :)
1/6/2016,20160106,4,3.89,"Went to Peach's yesterday for the first time and had the cheddar grits and croquettes. While the aroma of the food didn't mesh as well as I would like, the food definitely tasted well together. I will definitely go back to Peach's for breakfast sometime. Next time I plan to try the French Toast and the Duck Bacon! Follow me and my adventures : @pattydrive"
1/20/2016,20160120,5,3.91,"Brunch after churchI took my family to Peach's after church. It was my wife and two sons (3 and 1). So, it started that there were no booster seats for the chairs - not a good start, but that is the ONLY bad thing I can say about the experience. Let's start with our server Jerome. He was professional, nice, accommodating, made relevant and GOOD recommendations and moreover was attentive - ask for him when you go. We started off with Jerome's recommended Peach's coffee. My wife got the Gouda and spinach omelette which I would like to say was delicious but she inhaled it without even offering up a bite!I got the shrimp and grits, cheese grits that is. At first I was disappointed because even though the shrimp were big there was only three, but as I dug in there were two more large ones under the blanket of grits. Everything was in perfect balance, the cheesey grits, the large shrimps, the chunks of bacon. Three words: de lish ous!!!This is a great brunch spot, with great service and great food. I highly recommend you try it out and then, try it out again. See you there, Sunday, after church!"
1/22/2016,20160122,5,3.92,"Fiance and I came in for breakfast and must say we were blown away. I had the shrimp and grits which was amazing, perfectly seasoned. She also had the gouda and spinach omelet which was amazing. We had an opportunity to speak with the owner. She is an amazing woman with a great heart. Our new spot for breakfast and lunch. Service was amazing by the staff also, Talela (spelling) gave amazing customer service. Will always come back."
1/25/2016,20160125,1,3.88,"Wow!This was such a let down. The environment & the staff appeared open & friendly. The food itself was a disaster. The salmon, bacon, & pancakes were all sent back b/c they were served to our table undercooked. The pancakes literally had wet dough in the center. The pork bacon was still pink as was the salmon. The food was sent back initially for being cold not room temperature but literally cold. Like how long was this sitting on a table with no heat light cold. When all of the food was placed on our table we knew exactly why it had taken so long to get our food! We had 1 order for the shrimp & grits which was piping hot (obviously was just cooked) but everything else was cold. SMHThere was a numerous amount of apologies but I'm sorry there is no excuse for a restaurant to send out cold food then replace it with undercooked food."
1/30/2016,20160130,5,3.9,"This is my second time coming here. This place is great. There is usually a short wait, but the food is great and the service is wonderful. So much professionalism and the decor is great as well. I make the 40 minute drive from Downers Grove and is completely worth it"
2/2/2016,20160202,4,3.9,"I visit peach's at least twice per month.... I always get the bacon, cheese eggs, grits & pancakes YUM.! It's always the same GREAT ! But today was different... I can definitely tell they have a new cook.. They must! My food was different & under cooked . I live 3 blocks away and by the time I made it home I noticed my eggs were swimming in a pool of I don't know what ... I'm so disappointed but I will order my food WELL DONE next time since it's now necessary to get cooked food."
2/7/2016,20160207,1,3.86,"First time there, was told it would be 5 mins to be seated at a table. 20 mins later, they offered us a spot at the lunch bar. 15 more mins just for our order to be taken, another 20-25 until food was delivered to us. 10-15 waiting for the check, 5 for our change lol all for mediocre food everything was just ok, not enthused on returning anytime soon."
2/11/2016,20160211,3,3.85,It was a good wholesome breakfast. The customer service and peach coffee was good. Nothing really stuck out on this visit except the coffe.
2/14/2016,20160214,2,3.83,"The 2 stars are for the grits. The service was so bad, I'll probably never return. After waiting close to 40-45minutes for three meals, my duck bowl was prepared with a big piece of plastic cooked in it. I ordered my egg over easy and my daughter ordered over medium but they both came well done with the entire yoked cooked. We waited 20 minutes for lemons for our water and had to ask for flatware and napkins once we were finally served. Our server didn't check on us at all, the runner had to correct everything that was wrong with our order so I left my tip for him. When the bill came we were charged full price for everything. Go figure! The cheese grits were great and the duck bacon was good."
2/15/2016,20160215,2,3.8,"Since there are no real family restaurants or sit down spots in Bronzeville, I was EXTREMELY excited for Peach's to open up. No words to describe my excitement. And because I am a mild H-Dog fan, I just KNEW Chef Rome wouldn't disappoint. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Because I try not to give up so easily on Black business, I went here on 3 different occasions. They EACH left MUCH to be desired. 1) The prices are too high. And for prices you pay, the portions are very underwhelming. Very. My ""grits"" were disgusting. Maybe it was some sort of grits soup that my uncultured ass just doesn't know about, but... No. Wasn't feeling them. The pancakes were not done in the middle. And the bacon was cold and unimpressive. When I told the manager, he was very nonchalant about it. 2) I'm a coffee drinker and if for no other reason, I would visit for the peach coffee. Absolutely amazing. I love it. 3) I had a server named Talilah who was SO awesome that it was a mild distraction from the unimpressive menu. I requested her the times I returned. There was another woman hosting who was amazing as well. Don't know her name though. All that to say... Customer service here (from the staff) is actually awesome. Overall, it's nothing to get excited about. If you live or work in the area, it's a cool lil spot to meet up for Saturday morning coffee or whatever, but other than that? Nah, bruh. Don't go in here starving expecting to leave satisfied. If imma leave broke, I don't wanna leave hungry. If imma leave hungry, I don't wanna leave broke. I left both. Lol! One star for customer service. One star for the amazing coffee."
2/15/2016,20160215,2,3.78,"The space is large and airy with simplistic but homey decor. The wait was pleasant enough (five minutes longer than expected but short considering they were busy). We noticed right away that the employees were scattered, doing multiple tasks. For example, the hostess was seating guests, taking to-go orders, answering the phones, in the kitchen preparing to-go orders, cleaning tables, and mopping. The waiters and waitresses were also seen doing several jobs. They also were waiting on tables across the entire restaurant instead of a designated section which made them scattered. Our waiter was pleasant but not as attentive as we would've liked. When the food came out SEVERAL items were missing and when we inquired he asked us what was missing. If you see two omlettes that you know come with some form of bread, how does the waiter not recognize that those otems are missing? The food *sigh* it was just OK. Between three people we had the lamb omlette, spinach omlette, pancakes, peach bourbon french toast, duck bacon, potatoes, and grits. The omlettes were bland and overcooked. The pancakes weren't fluffy and reminded me of frozen ones. The other items were not bad but just ok. Not sure if I will return. I MAY try one more time. I would give them 2.5 stars if I could."
2/15/2016,20160215,5,3.8,"Delicious food, delightful service, charming atmosphere. Forward-thinking soul food, and even the veggie sides are great -- especially the greens and cheese grits."
2/17/2016,20160217,3,3.79,"The food was good. It was my first time trying duck bacon. I think more options on the menu would be good. The service was good as well. The prices are reasonable. All together, I spent under 20 bucks. Con: Their signature drink (peach tea) is served in a small cup and you have to pay full price for a refill."
2/20/2016,20160220,5,3.8,"Outstanding food! I'm not certain what took me so long to visit. I had heard great things about Peaches, but it took an out of town guest to visit. We ate there twice this weekend and enjoyed every bite. Pancakes were fluffy and moist. Shrimp and cheese grits was extremely tasty! Catfish, greens, & grits were yummy! Peach bourbon French toast were also amazing. I will be back!"
2/27/2016,20160227,4,3.8,"Very nice place,shrimp and grits was delicious and signature peach coffee would definitely recommend this. Wait staff very good and attentive. Clean restrooms."
2/29/2016,20160229,3,3.8,"Finally made it to Peach's. Walked in and it was a pretty long wait (25-30 mins) but with my desire to want to try this place out AND starvation from skipping breakfast, I decided to just buckle up and wait it out and see what's the hype about.And it was about nothing! First, when you have a long line of people waiting to sit down, it's probably a good idea to clean the tables to accommodate those waiting to sit down. This wasn't the case. We sat and watched tables go 5-6 minutes with empty plates and trash from the people who previously sat there. It may seem picky but there were more than enough staff walking around that someone could've cleaned up an area and allowed to others to eat and keep the line moving. We finally got a seat and menu and the selections looked pretty impressive. Our waitress was attentive, professional and knew the menu and gave us a good breakdown of the choices. One positive is substituting foods. Almost every entree you can choose from 5-6 different things to substitute as sides. I ordered the Philly Omelette and it was overcooked. And little bit of salsa they give you doesn't help it all.  The upside is I chose the waffle as a side and that was pretty good. As was the house potatoes that came with it. But the side order of chicken wings we received were severely overcooked.  And my guest ordered shrimp and grits and the grits looked like a soup and only had a few shrimp in them.  Wasn't impressed with the food at all.Price wise I thought it was pretty fair. It's a pretty decent portion size and if the food was cooked better, it would've been well worth. Place is a little small but with a few touches here and there, it could be much better."
3/13/2016,20160313,4,3.8,"Very Spike Lee movie-ish ... Very diverse mixture of brown people in a very laxed atmosphere. The wait staff was friendly but did not hover ().  The food was delish....We had the lamb omelette with grits and pancakes and the lemon cheese cake French toast with duck bacon. I tip my hat to you Peaches, good job!"
3/13/2016,20160313,2,3.78,I had salmon and grits. I was not impressed. They had no seasoning. The only thing I enjoyed was the biscuit. I would not eat here again
3/19/2016,20160319,3,3.77,"I want so badly to love this place, ... but I can't over look the tiny details that just affected the experience. Unless you're going to a dive bar, restaurant owners sometimes forget that it's not just the food that people incorporate into the dining experience. In the case of Peach's the everything else just added up... from dirty paper menus, a bathroom with an empty paper towel roll, a server forgetting to provide us utensils, to having dirty plates just pile up in front of you... not sure if the food was enough to overlook everything else."
3/26/2016,20160326,3,3.76,"Cute little place that's close to where I live. I had heard about it and was excited to try them out. The wait was alittle long. We were told 30 mins at the door and it was roughly an hour, but a kind waiter did come by to offer everyone waiting coffee. Once seated, I oredered the catfish, grits and collards. It was ok. I mean the catfish could have used more seasoning, but still enjoyable. The grits were perfect! However the collards tasted alittle like canned 'Glory' greens to me. (Maybe Glory greens are better) The biscuit was just like your basic boring biscuit. They even didn't bring butter so I asked for their ""signature"" peach compote...they charged me $1.50 for literally 2 peach slices. Our server was normal, not particularly fast or slow. He did forget my coffee refill...but I didn't really need it anyway. Overall everyone was so polite, and there are some other things on the menu I would like to give a try. I would eat here again for sure."
4/13/2016,20160413,5,3.77,Food is really good and the service was great! Friendly customers and staff. I'll definitely go back soon.
4/17/2016,20160417,4,3.78,Came with a group of 11 people.Didn't take too long to get seated.Our waiter was awesome! He didn't get frazzled. He was so nice.We all had the Peach Coffee. Delicious!Everybody ordered something different. No complaints.I will be back
4/17/2016,20160417,5,3.79,"Great place for breakfast and lunch. Today's choice is a Healthy start and my Auntie is having the Good Fella my cousin is having Waffles . A great place for physical nourishment any morning but after Sunday morning spiritual nourishment. Very friendly wait staff Tarvis, Breanna and Jerome to name a few. Viola the manager is the exceptional at making everyone feel welcome and at home.Ok. You guessed it, I love this place. P.d. you have to have a cup of Peach coffee."
4/20/2016,20160420,5,3.8,"Wow, I'm impressed! And about time. A nice place to sit and eat in the neighborhood, went for breakfast with my son who had the good fellow omelet with pancakes which was good as was the French Toast and bacon. Will be back for sure"
4/29/2016,20160429,5,3.81,"I'm a very picky eater, and I would say that Peach's Restaurant is one of the best hidden gems in the city. The peach coffee is excellent, and the wait staff is impeccable. The price is right and the food is excellent, you can't go wrong here ."
5/7/2016,20160507,5,3.83,"As always the food was deeeeeeelish and the service was great (truly a pleasure being serviced with a smile). I couldn't make up my mind today so I had my usual, Salmon Croquettes and Cheese Grits but I also had the Fried Chicken Wings and Cinnamon French Toast. My usual dish was PHENOMENAL as always but those wings made me wanna slap somebody because they were just that good...Lord continue to bless the hands that prepare all the menu items for Peach's so they can continue filling bellies with great food. Amen. Kudos to the Chefs and staff...keep up the great work!!!"
5/29/2016,20160529,5,3.84,"Loved the food here! The peach bourbon French toast, grits and peach Palmer were awesome!"
6/5/2016,20160605,2,3.82,Their take out needs a lot of work. 1st visit they forgot my biscuit..2nd visit I was charged 1.50 for a very small sample of peach bourbon compo. So it is best if you eat in
6/5/2016,20160605,2,3.8,The advertised omelette featuring smoked duck sausage was so rubbery Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler could dribble with it during their practice scrimmages. The service was slow and disorganized. This was my second and last visit there. There are eateries in the area with similar menu selections with better quality and services. Go to any of them.
6/9/2016,20160609,5,3.81,"Great experience! Staff was welcoming, pleasant and attentive. Vibrant yet suttle decor, great atmosphere.Food was delicious. Shrimp and Grits, Goodfella omelette. Catfish and greens, all outstanding. Convenient location in Bronzville. Best part price!"
6/10/2016,20160610,5,3.83,Couldn't love Peaches more. Had a lovely breakfast of salmon croquettes and eggs with duck bacon. Coffee was terrific. Waitstaff were so polite and nice. What a great meal!
6/12/2016,20160612,3,3.82,SLOW SLOW SLOW! The staff is very nice but they are SLOW SLOW SLOW. I waited over 35 minutes for a to go order of bacon and eggs with toast and it was a pretty measly serving. It wasn't crowded and they seemed to be well staffed so I'm not sure where the hiccup was. I understand things happen but a little communication goes a long way! Just let your patrons know what's going on before they have to ask
6/14/2016,20160614,3,3.81,"This place was average. While the popular peach bourbon compote was delicious, it was merely peach cobbler filling.The food was not hot when brought out to us :( We had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our complete meal to come out once it was sat on our table. Our server was friendly enough, but service didn't rock my socks off. I am not surprised that the turkey sausage are the standard frozen little patties, however I was disappointed. Eggs were prepared OK. Gluten free pancake was edible and like I said before the peach compote was good. Come here if you are in the area, starving, and it's on an off day because it is definitely not worth waiting over 10 minutes to be seated. We may be back to try something else on the menu!"
6/18/2016,20160618,4,3.81,"I came here on a busy Saturday morning after finishing a 5K... Lots of other runners had the same idea and the service was still fast & friendly. Khalilah/Talilah(?) was really sweet and patient with all of my questions. Eventually, I ordered the lamb omelet and it was DELICIOUS! Way larger portions than I was expecting and everything was seasoned well. Food came out hot and at the same time for my party. I also got a side of the salmon croquette at the recommendation of server and it was okay. Not sure if the mix includes sauce or flour for holding together, but that's my one critique: I like mine more flakey less cakey.Also, I like the music and spaciousness--you're not bumping into other nearby tables. Can get kind of loud when it's busy so they should probably add furnishings to balance acoustics. All in all good food, quick service without feeling rushed, and walking distance. I'll be back for sure."
6/21/2016,20160621,2,3.79,It started with the service. Our waitress didn't know how to interact with customers. We had to ask her several times for condiments. It was Tuesday afternoon and there were 4 tables but she only had 2 tables. The coffee was lukewarm and the food was even colder. It was quite disappointing and I won't be back.
6/23/2016,20160623,4,3.8,"Any place that takes my allergies seriously is good in my book! I have a peach allergy (I know - why would I go to a place called Peach's. I like to support local business what can I say). I wanted the coffee but the waitress told me that regular coffee is sometimes made in the same carafe as the peach flavored (which my bf had and he reported it was delicious). We had the chicken and waffles and the bayou bowl (shrimp, potatoes, scallops, sausage and tomatoes). Both were great though I wish the bayou bowl was more saucy. But it is great to have a nice resto option in Bronzeville."
6/24/2016,20160624,5,3.81,Peaches has a great cup of coffee for only $1.10 (tax included). It is right up there with Starbucks minus the high price that they charge for Venti. I usually grab a cup on my way to work and it is always a treat.
7/2/2016,20160702,3,3.8,"Came here one Sunday morning with a small group. We beat the after church crowd and the place wasn't that crowded so we were surprised that the service, while super friendly, was pretty slow. We had a variety of food - from the catfish to the omelets. The food was hot and everyone got their food at the same time. We also liked that they have a variety of options (lamb, Gouda, feta) for the omelets vs. just ham and cheese. Everyone thought the food was good, not great. The grits were runny to the point of needing a spoon to eat them, the salmon croquettes were tiny and the seasoning was bland across the board. Peach flavored coffee was a unique twist. Overall, a comfortable, friendly place to eat if you happen to be in the area and aren't in a hurry. I would return if I were in the neighborhood but wouldn't make a special trip here."
7/17/2016,20160717,4,3.8,"My new favorite Sunday spot! Their signature peach coffee (I know, I was skeptical too haha) is Amazing! I recommend the peach bourbon French toast, shrimp & grits, and salmon croquettes!"

7/17/2016,20160717,5,3.82,My husband and I LOVE this restaurant. It is sudden a hidden gem in the Bronzville community. The food is fabulous and the service is always top notch. Everyone is always smiling and is so attentive. We frequently do carry-out and dine-in and we are always pleased. Their grits (both plain and cheese grits) are awesome! Their shrimp and grits are tasty. I've had all of their entree meals and the chef knows how to season fish and chicken just right!  Breakfast is always a pleaser with their omelettes. We always look forward to seeing what their specials are and giving them a try. We haven't had one item off of the menu that tasted bad. I highly recommend and I look forward to every weekend when we decide to enjoy breakfast at this restaurant.

I gave it another try and the girl didn't understand why I just couldn't continue to hold until she was free.She told me she couldn't write down my request because she had to attend to the customers first!I was left with a bad impression. Does it make a difference if you make a reservation due to first cone, first serve?I never dined at this restaurant but will give it one try with the group I was trying to make reservations for!"

It was the best decision we ever made! We work on sundays so we knew it would be crowded so we called ahead to place our order for pick up and it was ready in about 30 minutes or so. I had the peach cobbler french toast and it was absolutely amazing! My co-workers had the chicken wings with cinnamon french toast and they loved it. We can not wait to eat here again! I highly recommend this place, great food and great service."

7/28/2016,20160728,2,3.77,Peach's is a restaurant where you can find loud old women and bland food. We arrived and did not know if we should seat ourselves or be seated by a host. We were seated by a host but had to wait a few minutes for tables to clear. I ordered the bland lamb omelet with a side of potatoes and a piece of luke warm toast. The potatoes were okay until I added salt. Once the magic salt was added they tasted very well surprisingly. The lamb tasted like hamburger meat and was bland even after adding salt. The omelet tasted like any ordinary egg nothing special. It had feta cheese in the middle which was all in on spot. I could have made a more flavorful omelet at home. This review is as boring as the food I had. We did not need to go boxes since the food was whatever. The highlight of this trip was when we waited 20 minutes for the check to come and when the server lady kept bumping the back of my friends chair.
7/30/2016,20160730,3,3.77,"The first time I came here, several months ago, the service was great. This time around, I was highly disappointed. We waited for over 30 minutes for our food AFTER ordering. My steak arrived overcooked. By the time I received my food, I could have made it home and cooked it all myself in less time than they did. I don't know what the back of the house issues are, but it will definitely be keeping me away."

Second time visiting Peach's and had Jerome as our server both times. He is prompt, attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly as a server.Both visits I've ordered their house special, salmon croquettes & cheese grits. Also ordered a side of pancakes. The salmon croquettes were fresh, flavorful, and a hearty portion. Served with a remoulade sauce on the side, that was a good complement. The cheese grits were creamy, savory, and enjoyed without adding any salt, pepper, or butter. The pancakes were excellent. Buttery, light, fluffy, and cooked golden brown.Clean, bright, and inviting restaurant space that I would definitely return to and would strongly recommend to anyone a trip to Peach's for breakfast, brunch, or lunch."

8/20/2016,20160820,3,3.76,"I had known peripherally that Peach's was there, having gone down King Drive on my bicycle a few times, but I hadn't been in the mood to dine at the moment. But after two different people talked about it in the course of three hours, I decided that I needed to try for myself. I do believe that the one word that convinced me was ""biscuits'. I grew up in the Deep South, and I'm particular about a few things: collard greens, grits, sweet iced tea, and biscuits. I went the next morning, a Saturday, with my girlfriend and another friend who was from out of town visiting. We were seated promptly, and the hostess and busser were both very attentive to making sure that we had water on the table, silverware and even asked if we wanted coffee to start. I chose coffee, and my companions stuck with water. Then the waiter stopped by and introduced himself and told us if we had any questions, he'd be happy to help. Up to this point, the visit was fine. But then the waiter disappeared for an inordinate amount of time. My coffee had been brought by the busser, and I began to wish that he was our waiter. When the waiter finally returned, we placed our order. My girlfriend chose the lamb omelette with grits and biscuit as sides. Friend asked for the waffle with sliced banana, and I had the Peach's special: two eggs over easy, bacon (because i cannot seem to find anyplace that offers pork patty sausage anymore), grits, the biscuit about which I had heard rave reviews, and a side of duck bacon. The food was good for the most part. Grits were done very nicely, eggs cooked just as I asked. The biscuit really was lovely, flaky and moist, just like I remember from back where I grew up. The duck bacon was also a treat. My friend's waffle arrived sans bananas, and she pronounced it as an ok waffle. Girlfriend picked at her omelette, then proceeded to try to steal my eggs. She didn't like the omelette, but didn't tell me until after she ate all of her grits, part of my eggs, some of the duck bacon, and a half of her biscuit. There wasn't anything wrong with the omelette, she just never should have ordered it for herself. Greek omelette with lamb, feta, tomatoes, seasoning and tzatziki sauce is not in her taste profile. I would have eaten it for her, but I have a strong aversion to fresh tomatoes. Overall, the food was good to very good. The weak point of the experience was the service. The waiter just seemed like he wasn't mentally organized enough to handle as many customers as he had. I waited for coffee refills too long, the amount of time he took to return to take our order was ridiculous, and we were practically finished eating before he came back to ask how everything was. I will point out that I used to be a waiter myself, both in fine dining and casual restaurants, and I do tend to pay close attention to the service, and perhaps I'm a bit more critical than most. The girl at the cash register cheerfully took the bananas off the bill when I told her that they weren't on the waffle. I would have loved to have given four stars because the food was good. But the poor service on this occasion lowered the score. That being said, I do want to return to try the fried catfish, collards, and cheese grits, along with another biscuit or two. If only they had southern style sweet tea on the menu....Another tip for anyone who wishes to try Peach's is that it's bright and airy, with a good amount of space between tables so that you aren't bumping into the person seated behind you. But the acoustics in the space make for a very noisy experience. So keep that in mind if you are going to attempt a quiet conversation."

While the waiter didn't pressure me he took my order as soon as I indicated that I was ready. The food came quickly and was delicious. There are some interesting items on the menu I had lamb as the meat in my omelet and it was great. The biscuit served at Peaches was the best I've ever had. Light and perfectly baked. The parking was free and easy. The restaurant is clean and the waitstaff was friendly. I'll be happy to go back!

They really do live up to their name when it comes to their products. Although they didn't quite have peach cobbler, their alternative to the dessert has a homemade twist to it and that is their biscuit! A golden brown and flaky biscuit with peach compote was a great way to finish off the salmon croquettes on a Sunday brunch!"

Southern food (shrimp, grits, pancakes, catfish, greens) with a nice twist (duck bacon, refined sauces). A kind young staff and appreciative customers. So far, we've had the lamb omelette, shrimp/grits, and catfish. All at the top of their game. The biscuits are some of the best I've had. The house-blend coffee and ginger tea are excellent. This isn't a hurry-up-and get-out diner--servers give you time to digest a good meal and enjoy conversation."

So far, we've had the lamb omelette, shrimp/grits, and catfish. All at the top of their game. The biscuits are some of the best I've had. The house-blend coffee and ginger tea are excellent. This isn't a hurry-up-and get-out diner--servers give you time to digest a good meal and enjoy conversation."
9/22/2016,20160922,2,3.77,"I ordered the meat lovers omelet with potatoes and expected a good sized dish with plenty of meat as described on their daily special menu. Instead a got a plate of soggy, warm potatoes that probably were cooked an hour or two earlier. My small egg omelet was not warm, overcooked and had a smattering of duck bacon. Where's the meat? The service was slow, which didn't help. There are lots of places to go where $18.00 (includes tax and tip) buys you a much better breakfast dish. Others in my party enjoyed their selections so if, and that's a big if, I return I'll stick to two over easy, grits, and bacon at half the price."
9/24/2016,20160924,5,3.77,"Excellent food and service! Can't believe I've lived in the area for years and this is was my first visit. I ordered the catfish, grits, and greens and enjoyed a cup of the peach coffee while I waited. Let's pause for a moment and talk about the peach coffee. The coffee was so good, it could have its own yelp review. It's made from a blend of coffee beans. I didn't have to ask for a refill at any point-- they kept the coffee flowing. I greatly appreciate that!! The food came out quickly and multiple servers asked if I had everything I needed. I really can't wait to go back. Plus I've heard such great things about the duck bacon-- can't wait to try it with more of the peach coffee!!!"
9/29/2016,20160929,1,3.75,My first and last experience was horrible. Decided to have breakfast there just to see how the food was. I have heard great reviews and wanted to try for myself. As for the breakfast itself the only thing edible was the steak. The coffee had a hair in it and the seats weren't clean. I love to support black businesses but i won't be back to this one.
10/9/2016,20161009,2,3.74,"Food was palatable, powdered eggs not a good idea. Unfortunately the service was horrible, maybe Sunday is not the day to try breakfast here. May give them one more chance on a weekday."
10/11/2016,20161011,3,3.74,"The food is good considering your options around the area and the servers are ok, not great but they are pleasant. I have been here 3 times, each time thinking that maybe something was going on the previous times and NO. It's unreal how long it takes to get your food and it isn't ever that busy to where you could vouch for the time lapse. The only reason why I don't go anymore is because I don't have an hour to wait to eat breakfast. This is not an exaggeration, I was in there a total of 1 hour and 20 minutes to only get a coffee and the 7 up pancakes."
10/23/2016,20161023,5,3.75,This place is amazing. I came to visit my best friend from Los Angeles and she insisted we go eat brunch here. Ive been to Chicago before but this was my first time here. Its very cute and the service was AMAZING!! I got the Shrimp & Grits and it is recommended!! I grow up on the East Coast but my family is from the south. So you know Ive had my fair share of Shrimps and Grits. The consistency of the grits...the cheese ratio to grits... AMAZEBALLS!! The food was great. Definitely going to be back here.
10/29/2016,20161029,1,3.73,"SERVICE SUCKS!!! My fiancé and i ATTEMPTED to eat here. Lisa, our server brought us water and said she would be right back, a few people came in AFTER us and she was taking their order, WTF!!!! She never CAME BACK, not even to ask us were we ready to order, did we need a minute......NOTHING. We walked out. To KFC we went. I am willing to give them another chance. ..in 6 months. JERKS"
10/31/2016,20161031,4,3.73,"Okay, man... Y'all know when Peach's FIRST opened, they food wasn't hitting on shit. Like at all. The coffee has always been excellent, but the food? Nope. Visited Friday for the first time in a while (over a year) and I was EXTREMELY pleased. Jerome, our server, was GREAT and the food has improved TREMENDOUSLY. I had the salmon croquettes and cheese grits? ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. 5 stars for that alone. BUT, I also ordered the biscuits and gravy... the first one was cold and the second one had hard biscuits. Despite those lil mishaps, the flavor of the biscuits and gravy (which included peppers, chicken sausage, and onions) was SO GOOD! So, yeah, man... Peach's can be bae! I'm so happy for Chef Rome and all the folks over there for bringing good quality, sit down food to Bronzeville! Very pleased!"
11/7/2016,20161107,4,3.73,"I am so happy i made it here. This place is truly a south side gem. If you are dining on a Sunday, be sure to get there before the hunger pains kick in. There is a wait, so be aware. However, the wait is worth it. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was divine. It comes with pork but there is an option to substitute. The peach coffee is an acquired taste but i am happy the server offered to let me try it since it was a restaurant staple. The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is bright and light very simple and brunch like. Since the food speaks for itself there is no need for much decorum. Overall i had a pleasant dining experience and i am grateful to dine at a local black business. I will be back again."
11/13/2016,20161113,5,3.74,Visited Peach's restaurant for the first time today and my meal (shrimp and grits) was very tasty. My family enjoyed their dishes as well. The peach coffee is actually quite good. Not too over powering. The service was excellent and I felt that the staff really took pride in where they work. Very friendly environment. I recommend everyone try Peach's. My family and I will be back.
11/20/2016,20161120,5,3.75,"This is our new favorite breakfast/brunch spot in South Chicago. It's a great, modern classic diner with some delicious southern options. They even have duck bacon.I had the cornmeal fried catfish with greens and buttery grits. Everything was perfectly delicious. The greens were flavorful, and the cornmeal coating on the fish had a nice crunch .My husband had the peaches special which included scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausages, and pancakes. In his words: ""it was a good, classic breakfast with everything you could want. The potatoes were well-seasoned and crispy.""The portions are hearty but don't leave you feeling like you need to nap for three hours afterwards. Everything was very homemade.It was a bustling, comfortable and cheerful place."
11/20/2016,20161120,4,3.75,"I come here when I'm in the mood for a Southern brunch around beautiful Black people. They have some unique menu items (like Peach coffee and duck bacon) & everything is fresh and/or homemade; which means it's slightly more expensive than the average breakfast spot, but still reasonable. It's usually super busy so service is not always prompt. But everyone is very friendly & welcoming so I let it slide. Can't wait to go back!"
11/20/2016,20161120,5,3.76,"Visiting Peaches on Sunday mornings is our tradition. I've been a patron since day one. The atmosphere is great, the restaurant is clean, service is both timely and gracious, the food is delicious, and the serving size is healthy. The staples on the menu are all delicious...yes I've tried them all (shrimp and grits are the best). However, there are almost always specials so the menu remains fresh (jerk omelette this week). I am somewhat reluctant to invite you to try my favorite place because Peaches is a best kept secret of mine. But, we need to support our Black businesses especially when they get it right. Check it out, I know you will enjoy!"
11/21/2016,20161121,4,3.76,"We came here to try out a new brunch place and loved it! This restaurant is a great place for this area, I think Bronzeville could use more brunch spots, this restaurant is also located right by the 47th Green Line. I can tell this place gets pretty popular especially on Sundays. The atmosphere is casual theres tables and booths available and also you can eat at the bar. The service was good we were seated in about 10 min when we arrived and our food took about 15-20 min, so I was pleased with the pace of everything. I ordered fried chicken and cinnamon French toast, the chicken tastes very good, fresh and clean, and by clean not very greasy, so I didn't feel gross after eating it like most fried chicken. And the cinnamon French toast did not disappoint, Im coming back!"
12/18/2016,20161218,5,3.77,"Loved Peaches!! The pancakes are awesome, love the peach coffee, the staff is friendly, biscuits and gravy are great too! I'll def be back and I'll be getting that coffee for home brewing as well. Get there!"
12/20/2016,20161220,4,3.77,"I went for the first time yesterday. The host was friendly. My server came quickly and she was quite pleasant. I ordered the gluten free pancakes, turkey sausage patties and a salmon croquette. The gluten free pancakes and turkey sausage were both pretty tasty. The salmon croquette was a little salty for my tastes but I think I will try it again next time to see if I like it better. I enjoyed the music that was playing and the atmosphere was comfortable. Overall, I had a really good experience."
12/26/2016,20161226,1,3.75,"I am extremely disappointed with my experience....Being short staffed is an understatement. The only things decent are the coffee, salmon croquettes, and biscuits..everything else is pathetic! Our server only came once to check on us, the food came out lukewarm and nobody including the manager on staff seemed to care. When we voiced our concerns our waiter just looked at us. The ambiance is cute but skip this experience if you can. I am extremely disappointed...another business I will never visit...ever!"
12/28/2016,20161228,4,3.75,"What a cute spot! I don't know why, but it reminded me of a cafeteria/diner. I went with the recommendation of my associate and went with the shrimp and grits. Winner! I also highly recommend you try the biscuit. So big and buttery. It almost melts in your mouth. Now I'm not a coffee person, but I was talked into trying the peach coffee and I could actually stomach it and it did wake me up. :) Great spot in bronzeville and I'll be making my way back there soon."
1/21/2017,20170121,5,3.76,"Urban sheek with amazing food! Highly recommended... try the salmon, cheese grits, French toast, hell, all at the same time! :)"
1/28/2017,20170128,5,3.77,"Urban sheek with amazing food! Highly recommended... try the salmon, cheese grits, French toast, hell, all at the same time! :)"
2/10/2017,20170210,4,3.77,"Good eats, definitely!Salmon croquettes grits, duck fat bacon, and a Peach Palmer.Staff was very courteous, pleasant, and friendly."
2/13/2017,20170213,5,3.78,"Excellent place to eat, very family friendly atmosphere, great food & great service. As close to homemade as your gonna get. There is usually a bit of a wait, that's how good the food is. But it's definitely worth the wait, I suggest everything. The music, the conversation, it's absolutely the best."
2/17/2017,20170217,5,3.78,"I've been trying to make it over to Peach's for quite sometime. It's Chicago Black Restaurant Week and my childhood friend is in town so we met for a late breakfast. I arrived earlier than her and was seated without any issues. My server was very attentive bringing me refills of hot water for my tea. As soon as my girlfriend joined me, the waitress was right there to take our orders. We both had the shrimp and grits. It was great!! I would have loved to have more shrimp but the meal left me satisfied and feeling great.The service and quality of food was great. I'll be back to try another dish."
2/20/2017,20170220,5,3.79,"Excellent food. The shrimp and grits, duck bacon and biscuits were amazing."
2/22/2017,20170222,2,3.78,"I visited Peaches for the first time a few days ago with my family. The food was actually decent but the service was horrendous. We walked in and weren't greeted immediately. It took 3-5 min for someone to even come over and acknowledge us. After we were seated our waitress did come over to the table promptly. That, however, was the extent of her good service. I ordered the catfish with greens and asked to substitute the grits for fries. They were out of greens so I had no choice but to order grits I didn't want. The waitress said it was cheaper to order the meal then to get everything a la carte. Not having greens available was a big turnoff. If you're trying to run a reputable business then you need to have the food items on the menu available. Period. I don't care if it is an hour from closing. Running out of food isn't a good look especially for a first time customer.I asked for ketchup and hot sauce to be brought out with the meal but was only given the hot sauce. It took another 10 minutes to get the ketchup. The waitress never brought it though. We had to flag down another employee to ask for it. The catfish was excellent but the grits were gross. They had no flavor whatsoever. I took one bite and never touched them again. The fries were ok but nothing spectacular. My sister ordered the French toast, sausage and potatoes. She didn't like the sausage (it was greasy) but loved everything else. I sampled her food and agreed with her assessment. My mom ordered the catfish, fried shrimp and a biscuit. She thought her food was just okay as she didn't care for the catfish or the biscuit. She'd been to Peaches once before and didn't like what she ordered at that time either.We had to flag down the waitress to get to go boxes and our check. I liked the catfish so maybe I'll give Peaches another shot but the first visit was definitely a disappointment."
3/1/2017,20170301,4,3.78,I love coming to Peach's for their peach coffee. The restaurant offers their peach coffee to purchase. You can order soy or almond milk to go with your coffee. Unfortunately there is no non-dairy creamer options at this point. My husband ordered the Peach Bourbon French toast and duck bowl which to his delight was pretty tasty. I ordered the 7-up pancakes and side of potatoes with veggies which were super yummy. You get a lot of food with your order so you will have to take a doggie bag home.Finally I have to give it up to our server. She was awesome. My husband ordered an omelette that it was undercooked. We had to send it back twice but she nonetheless did not seemed irritated or annoyed. At that point he ordered the duck bowl and it was perfect. I overheard that on the third Sunday of every month there is a live dj. If you been to this restaurant on the weekends it can be very noisy. I think it has something to do with the acoustics. During our recent visit it was a weekday so it did not appear to be very rowdy.
3/2/2017,20170302,5,3.79,Wonderful neighborhood restaurant. Great variety for meat lovers as well as vegetarians alike. Great service & friendly staff. I especially like the Peach Flavored Coffee combined with the Beignets.
3/6/2017,20170306,4,3.79,"Stopped in with my family for the first time after hearing how great it is. The staff was unbelievably nice, I was blown away. Food was great I had the biscuits and gravy. My only critique would be, with my meal I couldn't substitute chicken sausage for turkey sausage because the gravy was pre made. Other than that. I had a great time. Angela was our server and she was tremendous!! Thank you."
3/7/2017,20170307,3,3.79,"My sister and I went to Peaches on a Tuesday around noon. We pretty much knew what we were going to order from reviewing their menu online. She ordered the wild salmon croquettes with cheese grits and I had the shrimp and cheese grits. We also ordered 2 biscuits. The meal arrived and noticing how large the biscuits were, I knew they couldn't possibly be done, so, I immediately pulled mine apart and the middle was doughy, just as I'd suspected. We asked that they take the biscuits back and maybe finish baking them. Well, another server brought back 2 biscuits that looked like they were placed in a toaster oven and stayed too long...they were burned, you could smell it as soon as she sat the saucer down and ran from the table! Needless to say, I was appalled because (a) they sent back something that I'm sure the person that prepared it would not eat and (b) the alternate server had to have known what she was bringing back because she dropped them on the table and scattered away quickly. Now the meal itself was good and our server Chantal was very kind and attentive. But the biscuit saga is just enough for me to not return."
3/8/2017,20170308,2,3.78,"I looked forward to trying this establishment as I had heard good things about the food and I liked the uniqueness of the food offerings on the menu. My friend and I walked in on 3/7/17 at 10 a.m. and the restaurant was nicely lit and looked clean. A young man greeted us nicely and took us to our table. There was a good amount of people dining which was a good sign for me. Our waiter Tarvis was friendly and helpful in answering questions about the menu. We ordered our food. After waiting quite a while, we wondered why we saw everyone else around us with their food but we hadn't gotten ours. Finally our food came, so I thought. A young lady brought out my friend's food but only brought out half of my meal. I waited awhile (I saw the young lady giving other people food but not the rest of my meal) and finally had to ask Tarvis where was the rest of my meal. It was brought out. Unfortunately my friend let me taste her omelette and it was COLD and it had to be reheated. My cheese grits were delicious and hot and so were the duck bacon! Pancakes were a really nice size and fluffy with a good flavor. The scrambled eggs didn't have much flavor and it seemed to me to be less than 2 eggs. The peach bourbon french toast was only okay - I thought the sauce was going to be poured on the french toast when served. I ate my food and Tarvis came to check on us. By the time we were finished with our meal, the breakfast crowd had dissipated.  We then were ready to go and we asked Tarvis for the check as we had an appointment to get going to. We saw Tarvis taking other tables orders but he never came back with our bill. We waited and waited and finally I had to get up, get an employee to print our bill so we could leave. We were given the bill but it was not by Tarvis - he never came back to our table, just left us hanging which set a bad taste in our mouth. If this is the service on a Tuesday, I don't want to even imagine what the weekend service is like. I will be back as I want to try the shrimp and grits but they have some work to do with regards to better service."
3/9/2017,20170309,5,3.78,"I had the shrimp grits and it was very good. Lots of great flavors going on here with cheese, bacon, mushrooms swimming in my grits. The grits itself was a little thin but served hot and tasty. Since I wasn't that hungry I didn't have anything else but I will back. The ambiance was simple with a few art pieces on wall. The place was clean and very well lit. Plenty of street parking. Service was great."
3/12/2017,20170312,5,3.79,"Fantastic diner! I came by around 10:30 for breakfast on a Saturday and had to wait (always hard to find). I obviously had to try a sip of my friends' peach coffee, which has a lovely flavor that was just lightly peachy! I'd heard SO MUCH about the duck bacon before coming here, so of course I had to order a side of it with my peach and bourbon compote french toast. The bacon was delicious! I'm not usually a far of bacon that isn't he traditional kind (I'm looking @ you, turkey bacon!), but I LOVED this! It had a great texture, developed a bit of a crunch, but not too much, and the flavor was fantastic. My french toast was also amazing! The peach and bourbon compote is so good - it's rich, but not too rich, and full of flavor. The portion sizes are generous, but it was so good I ate it all! I really can't say enough good things about this place - everyone was so kind and I had such a wonderful experience!"
3/25/2017,20170325,4,3.79,We had the salmon croquettes and the steak and eggs. Not bad. That peach coffee was really good. It took me by surprise. My dad raves about the shrimp and grits.
4/2/2017,20170402,1,3.77,This place was terrible I would never go back. The food was not flavorful and it came out cold. The wait staff was not attentive at all. The food took a long time to come out. I could of made a better breakfast at home. I was told before I came that it was not good but I wanted to see for myself and it was exactly what I had been told. I told my husband it was terrible he went and he was disappointed as well. I will not be back that's for sure. They need to revamp the whole menu and get a new wait staff .
4/15/2017,20170415,5,3.78,"From beginning to end this place is a gem. Excellent customer service! Delicious food! Bright cheerful and a dj..What???!!!! We had the chicken wings, peach french toast,salmon croquet, duck bacon, cheese and regular grits. Yummo! The croquet wasn't all that I have to say good but not the best I've ever had. But overall looooove this place. Will definitely be back! I cannot express enough how great customer service is everything and everyone we came in contact with was amazing! Thank you! A gem!"
4/26/2017,20170426,5,3.79,Love this place. The servings are huge. I'm not a fan of the peach flavored coffee- reminded me more of a peach body spray than a fresh peach. I will be back and recommend to many. Also- the duck bacon is so yummy
5/1/2017,20170501,4,3.79,"The peach coffee is great. The duck bacon is also delicious. A very pleasant diner, and certainly the type of place I would brunch at, if ever I brunched."
5/2/2017,20170502,2,3.78,"Peaches was ok, my first time visiting. I may give them another chance to impress because their specialties look like something I would order"
5/7/2017,20170507,5,3.79,"Good, service, ambiance all top notch.  ( i forgot to mention the great music ) I am imagining getting here prior to church letting out would be a good idea unless you like to wait lol. Got here when they opened first customers of the day. Great experience."
5/15/2017,20170515,4,3.79,I took my mom here for Mothers Day. I figured it would be busy. I called a little beforehand to make sure they were open. The lady who answered the phone said they seat the last party at 2:45. We arrived at 2:35. We were greeted with a less than enthusiastic welcome. The wait wasn't too long; to be seated or for our food. The peach French toast was delicious! And so was the salmon croquette. Yumm I'll definitely go back. And next time I'll make sure to get there earlier so I won't get the look of death upon arrival
5/17/2017,20170517,5,3.79,Duck bacon... Yes!!! Awesome food... Yes!!! Excellent service... Yes!!! I would highly recommend venturing out of downtown and heading out to try Peach's. Also the original building that was Ray's music exchange in the movie Blues Brothers is just down the block. Check it out if you have a chance. It's called Shelly's loan and pawn. But let's get back to Peach's. Good portions and delicious food. Visit this place if you're in Chicago and looking for breakfast!
6/3/2017,20170603,5,3.8,"Wow the food is terrific here. I ordered shrimp and grits, as it seemed popular with the other patrons I saw gobbling it down. And I was not disappointed, it was awesome. I also got a side of duck bacon, which I've never had before but it also seemed like the thing to do. It was great, leaner than I figured it would be. The peach coffee is their own, and I didn't think I would like it but I loved it. Finally, a shout out to my server at the bar, who was charming and helpful and funny and prompt (which earned her a large tip). I like to tip extra when the service is unusually good.  I can't wait to go back to Peaches and bring the rest of the family."
6/9/2017,20170609,5,3.81,"I ordered the duck bowl and it was soooooo flavorful. The duck bacon, potatoes, spinach, and egg worked wonderfully together. The wait wasn't long and the service was good. I'm sure it's crowded on the weekends but I will return."
6/10/2017,20170610,4,3.81,"This place earns its ratings. I've been to Peach's several times and every dish has been delicious. Go there for their shrimp and grits, duck bacon, and salmon croquettes, or for their ""standard"" omelets and pancakes. You won't be disappointed. The only issue I have is they have forgotten my no-mushroom request on two separate occasions. This has caused me to have to watch my son eat while I wait double the time for my order.Overall, I'm impressed with Peach's. I might become a ""regular"" there."
6/26/2017,20170626,5,3.81,"OH. MY. GOSH!!!!!!! I love this place!!!! My cousin lives close by so we could have walked if it were not for the rain. We waited about 30 minutes for a seat. WORTH THE WAIT!!! We sat at the bar and had some of the best service. A bit of advice, the bar is first come first served. They have quite a few seats, booth style and table top. However it gets packed quickly. The beautiful decor makes up for it a tad. I enjoyed looking at the artwork on the walls.  Our server was so kind and delightful honestly. She convinced me to order the peach coffee. I'm STILL trying to figure out how to order some. I could kick myself for not buying a bag. Please get a cup if you love coffee. I ordered pancakes, eggs, house potatoes, and turkey sausage. It's called the Peach's Special. All of that for $10.95!!! Everything was delicious although I could have done without the turkey sausage. The pancakes were buttermilk, melt in your mouth good. The breakfast potatoes were well seasoned and were cooked just right. You definitely should stop by here! I'm coming back whenever I come back to the CHI."
6/29/2017,20170629,1,3.8,"I had passed the ""Peaches...coming soon"" sign for nearly two years and was awaiting the day they opened their doors. I had not been on the area for some time and was pleasantly surprised to see it finally opened. I went online to look at Yelp reviews and decide on my entire before going on. I ordered my food to go with the cashier. I waited 25 minutes after given a 10 minute wait time. The cashier goes ghost for another 10 minutes, shows back up and says let me close out these 5 people's order and I'll grab your food. Finally after another 10 minutes grabs my order and all of the food was cold. I'm still okay with it (even though service is horrible for the middle of a weekday) and she even offers to comp me a sweet tea - which I appreciated, but tasted like liquid diabetes. The bill is $22 for a Peaches waffle and one salmon croquette. I leave and drive away, while checking my bag and she failed to include their signature Peaches in the bag. The name of the restaurant is called, ""Peaches!"" I'm baffled. A mess. Why? I'm done and starving. I was so exhausted and hungry, but can't stomach to give my hard earned money to mediocre food and service. So at that moment I drove back to the restaurant and asked for my money back. They had the nerve to offer to put the order in again. I said after waiting almost an hour for this food, I had no interest in wasting more of my time. They refunded my money and I left hungry. I will not be returning. The irony of it all!"
7/2/2017,20170702,1,3.78,"I had been trying to make it over to this place since it opened. My aunt was visiting from California, so this was the perfect time to go. Upon my arrival, there was a women paying for her food telling the cashier this this was her first time here and her last visiting the restaurant. I should have taken her advice and left too! But I had to stay so I can give my own review. Long story short, I won't be back again. The food took forever to come out. My aunts grits were very lumpy, she had to send her toast back because it wasn't toasted. My food was luke warm. Oh and my egg white omelet was rubbery and not fluffy. Our waitress took forever to bring our check after asking for it twice. The breakfast was a $27 I'll never get back!"
7/2/2017,20170702,2,3.78,"Preface: My rating is based on service, not food quality. The food was good. No great, but good. I visited Peach's on July 2, 2017 at approximately 2:40pm. I was very excited to visit this spot because I live in the neighborhood and I hadn't been yet but had heard decent comments about the food. No one was at the hostess station/register when I walked in so I waited for about 5 minutes before being approached by the hostess. She looked at the time on the register and then gave me a side eye informing me that I was cutting it close. At this point I giggled along with her and took it as a joke, but then the hostess tried to force me to sit at the bar even though there was an empty, dirty table. I asked her to be seated at the empty table and she told me that it wasn't clean. I told her that me and my guest would wait and she reluctantly allowed the request. Once seated at our table (about 5mins later), it took at least 15-20mins before our actual server came. Once our waitress showed up, she made it known that it was not her choice to take on another table. She provided us with basic service, meaning she brought us our food only, and when requested condiments and silverware. Other than that, she did not really engage us at all. Overall, I was disappointed with the service.  As I stated previously, the food was good. I had the salmon omelette and my guest had the french toast with peach compote."
7/5/2017,20170705,3,3.77,"Sorry but Peaches was just ""OK"". The duck bacon was good and our server was courteous."
7/7/2017,20170707,5,3.78,"Shrimp and Grits delicious, wonderful atmospheres and great service in the middle of Bronzeville."
7/14/2017,20170714,3,3.77,"The service was great. I felt like I was back in Texas! They were very welcoming and personable. The service was good,The food wasn't the best. Their food wasn't as tasty, we ate it but it wasn't impeccable. The corner was a little sketchy too..."
7/16/2017,20170716,4,3.77,"Well another adventurous try in the south side Chicago for brunch Historic Bronzeville area since I am a northsider. I came there during the lunch time hours and my oh my was it BUSY! With Christian natives coming out from mass. I am glad I did this solo and not as a group or on a afternoon date. I ended up sitting at the bar instead of a table since that would take longer. I will remember to make reservations since they said they take reservations and it is RECOMMENDED to avoid the wait for a table and to be served. Anyways I had ordered Duck bacon bowl, the Salmon Croquettes and the greens (AKA collard Greens with some meat, not sure if it was ham). The Duck bowl was OK. Nothing super special. It was a curiosity to try since it was Duck bacon and never had it before. It is similar to turkey bacon taste wise which I never really liked. The signature dishes I should have ordered as the main was the Salmon Croquettes. That was delicious! I did order it but as a side dish or appetizer. The ""Greens"" or the Collard Greens was yummy too. It was savory with meat inside. Portions we're good but not generous or BIG like some breakfast lunch places. I would come back for the Salmon Croquettes dish. It's another Southern comfort State inspired restaurant. What I did not like was at the bar the waiter and the staff was not as responsive in my order of certain things. I also did not get my utensils to eat my entrees right away. I do give them some excuse since it was busy but they should not treat a customer any less important. Especially 1st timers who write or type reviews on websites such as Google,Yelp, and Trip Advisor. Again, I would come back since the food was great! A little pricey on some dishes FYI. Some interesting names of Entrees in the menu such as Fresh Prince and Bananas in Pajamas LOL."
7/16/2017,20170716,5,3.78,"This place is amazeballs. The fried chicken is crunchy and juicy, the grits are perfect and the tea is sweet. The service was on point as well."
7/22/2017,20170722,2,3.77,"The two stars are for our server Eric. He was positive, friendly and thoughtful. I had SUPER high hopes. So high, that I brought my mother in law here for her birthday brunch today. It was ALL of our first (me, my husband, and my mother in law). We only had to wait for about 10 minutes before we were seated. Another 10 before our sever came to tell us that he's going to get the orders from the 3 tables. Front of us and come back. He did just that. Took our drink order and then our food order. Then the marathon wait began. We waited and I kid you not, a little over an hour for our food. When my husband inquired what the wait was (after 45 minutes) out server kindly explained that the tickets ahead of our order were taking a long time. While we didn't quiiiite understand what that meant, around the full hour mark was when our food came. They got my order wrong. I got turkey sausage instead of turkey bacon. He brought be turkey bacon anyway. They put the cheese on my eggs instead of my grits. Sausage was cold. Eggs were warm, grits were hot. French toast came without the peach compote but he brought that too upon request. We weren't rude and didn't get upset but I honestly wish this was not the experience I offered my mother in law for her birthday. Peach's please hire more cooks. You're restaurant has such great potential to be a neighborhood jewel if your kitchen ran faster. I say this out of love and respect because the food industry is tough but this has the moxie to make it. So I will offer a few recommendations to help a brotha out:1.) Hire 4I cooks responsible for specific parts of your menu. The menu isn't complex so 4 should be the minimum cooks you need. Play it safe and get 5. 2.)Line worker. Who is in charge of inspecting the plates food before it goes out? You need that line worker. 3.) If food tickets are backed up, have something to give your paying customers. I'd recommend coming up with some kind of peach bread/biscuit to serve while they wait. Hopefully these three things can help your establishment improve. Sadly I won't be back to see these improvements because of the suggested air of complacency in this place. Good Luck."
7/29/2017,20170729,5,3.78,"OMG first time here & the food is GREAT. We didn't have to wait to be seated which was perfect b/c we were starving. The young ladies that greeted us was very friendly & funny. We both ordered the Peaches Special. The cheese grits is a must try. They were very fluffy, hot & so yummy. The pancakes, eggs & turkey sausage were great. I been to alot of restaurants where the eggs were horrible & the turkey sausage was dried out. Not this place. Every bite you could taste the freshness. This place cook there food with love. I will return."
8/18/2017,20170818,4,3.78,"Not enough staff but they worked as har as they could to accommodate us as fast as possible. Since the food was fresh, it took a little while to receive our food. The quality of the food was amazing."
8/27/2017,20170827,2,3.77,"Peach's....I really wanted to love you. I'd been looking to try this place for a few months now as the menu looks great and I'm always excited about the opportunity to support black businesses, but I hate to say that I was really disappointed in my food.I ordered the Peach's biscuit slider. With this being a seemingly southern themed restaurant I expected the biscuit to be slammin. What I got was more reminiscent of a hockey puck. The biscuit was hard and crumbly, no flakiness or tenderness about it. The cheese on my sandwich wasn't completely melted and the bacon was very thin. I don't know about you, but when I order bacon at brunch I expect a thick cut bacon. The sandwich comes with their signature peach compote, which tastes very similar to peach cobbler filling. Flavor-wise this is a good thing but compote is supposed to be thick and spreadable. This was runny like juice so I unfortunately had to top my biscuit sandwich with strawberry jelly rather than the compote. I tried their house peach flavored coffee which was interesting. Definitely not bad, but not sure that I'd go back for it.My fiancee's food was better than mine but average at best and his order came out wrong. On the way out, I noticed a sign at the checkout counter that asks patrons to ""kindly check their bags prior to leaving the restaurant to confirm that their order is correct"". I take this as an admission that they frequently make errors in orders?? The best things about our experience here were the friendly and attentive staff and the complimentary candies."
9/1/2017,20170901,5,3.78,"I had a great meal here and hope I can come back. Even though I came in close to closing, I was seated at the counter and got great service. The staff was winding things down but I never had to wait for anything - they were very attentive and I got my meal fast.I had two eggs, potatoes, pancakes, and bacon. I was glad they had duck bacon because I don't eat pork. What a treat! I would almost go back just because of the duck bacon. Mmmmm duck bacon. Pancakes were delicious and so were the potatoes. Eggs are eggs, right?Update; been back twice since and have continued to enjoy great food and great service. I just was having breakfast somewhere else and was talking with other customers about Peach's. They said they heard bad things about the food, so I just wanted to update to confirm: great food, great service. Will continue coming back."
9/1/2017,20170901,5,3.78,"1st time coming here to eat! We picked a good day no wait time. I ordered Solomon omelette with house potatoes DELICIOUS worth the price. My husband enjoyed the goodfella omelette with grits & pancakes. Try the Peaches house blend coffee nice & smooth flavor. Our server Eric was very friendly & on top of his game, with a great smile! We definitely will return to try new menu items."
9/4/2017,20170904,1,3.77,"Lovely restaurant, nice location; however very very poor service. The wait is way too long. Upon checking in was told the wait was 25-30 minutes--although were plenty of empty tables; okay kinda reasonable for a holiday Monday. But, then after waiting 40 minutes the floor manager (as she identified herself) yelled ( because it's so noisy in that place you can't hear yourself think) that the wait was now an additional hour because the food is out and low on servers. Poorest service I've ever encountered in any restaurant. Needless to say, I left and food a lunch spot in Hyde Park!"

9/4/2017,20170904,5,3.76,Sooo good. We had a large party so we received complementary beignets with fresh fruit that was amazing! I ordered catfish with greens and house potatoes that was really good. It was filling and at a reasonable price. I don't live in Chicago but I would definitely come back next time I'm in town.
9/4/2017,20170904,5,3.77,The food and service completely exceeded my expectations and appetite. I was an out of town customer and would definitely recommend this to any first time visitors. Peach's is a very family friendly environment and we were happy to enjoy everything.
9/6/2017,20170906,4,3.77,"This place is pretty good, the service is great as well. However, the menu is very basic and could use some tweaking. For the area this place is definitely a gem."

10/2/2017,20171002,2,3.74,"Just not a fan at all. The food just taste ok. I went in with high hopes. I always enjoy picking the waitress brain about items I must try but he didn't have a clue what I should order. With the name being Peaches I then asked what peach things should I order, they said there were no peach products. Hmm... I settled for a hash brown, pancake and sausage which came out cold and depressed. Sorry Peaches, it's nothing Peachy about this spot. No need for pictures, it was Donald Trump SAD"
10/4/2017,20171004,4,3.74,"Oh my! Where has this place been! If you are a Chicago Northsider like me, let me now encourage you to hop you ass down to the south side for this gem. I had the French toast and fried chicken wings. It was tasty and prepared perfectly. My wife had the salmon and grits and my daughter had the duck bacon bowl. And just because we were hungry we ordered the dish they are best known for to spilt - the bourbon glazed French toast. Everything was just excellent. Oh, and do order the coffee. It comes with just a hint of peach. I don't care for flavored coffee but this was good. Folks, this is a must-do"

Fortunately we were seated quickly and ordered promptly.I split the salmon croquettes with cheese grits and the duck bacon bowl. The salmon croquettes were interesting to say the least, fishier than I like my salmon usually. The cheese grits were good but I've had creamier before! The duck bacon bowl was disappointing, the potatoes were mushy and not crispy like I like them to be. Additionally there wasn't much duck bacon, it was sliced thinly and you had to dig for it. The duck bacon itself didn't really taste like duck which is disappointing. Skip it and go for pork if you really want bacon.Average brunch and diner food, there are better Southern comfort food restaurants in Chicago I'd rather go to."

10/8/2017,20171008,3,3.73,Nice spot. I had a traditional breakfast with sausage eggs and potatoes. It was solid. My friends experimented with duck bacon which was cool to find on a menu in my neighborhood. I want to go back and try some different dishes and see if there are any standouts so It's definitely worth a visit.
10/8/2017,20171008,4,3.73,"I ordered the peach French toast, salmon croquettes and cheese grits to go. The wait wasn't long at all. While waiting we drank a courtesy cup of pineapple infused water.

10/15/2017,20171015,5,3.74,"It was a delicious experience. My BFF had the catfish, greens, and grits. I had the peach compote with the biscuit slider. And we shared peach cobbler. We also had the peach Palmer. Delissshhh all around. The Chef Michelina came out and asked us several times how the food was. Definitely a must eat at again when back in Chi-town."
10/16/2017,20171016,5,3.75,Went for breakfast had the Peaches Omlet which included my choice of a large variety of sides so I had potatoes and pancakes. All fresh good cooked to order as requested. Coffee was even great. Great atmosphere good service.  I will go again
10/18/2017,20171018,2,3.74,"My best friend raved about Peaches and when I finally went last year, he was right and it was excellent! However, the last 5 visits were disappointing, at best! Management of the dining room and seating is haphazardly frustrating, especially when you wait for nearly an hour and there are multiple tables open in plain view. The waitstaff that was there initially were excellent, and some of them are still there. The newer ones are sub-par and should not be there. About the food:Biscuits - Went from delicious to huge, unattractive mounds of dough that are raw in the middle and flavorless. Simple leavening techniques were abandoned, which is shameful for a professional establishment.Pancakes - Box mixture that is over-mixed and therefore tough and rank tastingEggs - Never cooked to specificationGrits - Either unseasoned or over-salted depending on the visitThe waitstaff rarely comes back proactively and has to be summoned for a simple coffee refill, which is the ONLY consistently good item on the menu. I too love to support local businesses but the business owner has to operate the establishment as if it were a 5-star restaurant in the best areas. That is how you build and keep a growing business with satisfied clients. For the aforementioned reasons, I could not be more saddened and disappointed in Peaches after such a promising start!"
10/22/2017,20171022,3,3.74,"Been there twice . The fried chicken is really good. Don't order the steak! They don't know how to cook it. Also, they have the worst customer service ever. get a carry out vs dine in."
10/28/2017,20171028,3,3.73,"I keep trying for you... You have duck bacon and it brings me back... The service however is like a boyfriend who is good in bed but treats you shitty. I recently had the duck bowl with a sunnyside egg on top. hello!! So good. I had to ask 3x for the onion gravy, which is chicken gravy but looks like cream of chicken soup. The bowl had onions, spinach, red potatoes and cheese. I was in lust. I couldn't finish it. The next day I fried an egg and put it on my leftovers. Mmm mmm. So good."
10/28/2017,20171028,4,3.73,"Food is good, service a little on the slow side. Try the duck bacon is really good, there are known for their grits. I love the music and the environment with good conversation and coded."
11/5/2017,20171105,5,3.74,"I love the restaurant's theme! You can eat at the counter for a greasy spoon experience or dine at a table. I arrived around 9:30am on a Sunday, sat at the counter and received service immediately. Try the Peach Palmer and/or shrimp and grits. The meals are big so come hungry!"
11/18/2017,20171118,5,3.74,This was my first time her and it was a great experience. My server was helpful in giving me some tips to help me choose my meal. I ended up getting the salmon croquettes with grits. I got regular grits but you can also get cheese grits. It was amazing. The creole sauce that came with it was good too! I couldn't stop eating my food even after I knew I should have. I will definitely be back!
11/25/2017,20171125,4,3.74,"Wow! I've heard about Peach's quite a bit over the last couple of months and finally had the opportunity to visit. Amazing food and great service. This place is definitely no frills. There service was just nice enough, not overly attentive, but also very available and made amazing recommendations. I was not a fan of the Peach flavored coffee, however the food was so good. The french toast was phenomenal. The grits are very creamy. Duck bacon was good as well. I will definitely visit this place again to try other options on the menu."
12/2/2017,20171202,5,3.75,"I love Peach's. Its close, more healthier options and great food. The service is a hit or miss at times but nothing that would make me stop coming. A definite regular you have in me!"
12/4/2017,20171204,4,3.75,"We had a group of 18 for breakfast on a Saturday. They were able to accommodate our group without a problem. Everyone enjoyed their food and I throughly enjoyed my shrimp and grits. I didn't care for their biscuits, but overall everything was great. Peaches is a good addition to the neighborhood."
12/6/2017,20171206,4,3.75,"Quiet spot not too crowded, I had the peaches special with French toast eggs and bacon. My colleagues had shrimp and grits, the food was good but unfortunately I found an eyelash on my cup and my fiancé found a piece of hair in his eggs..I would stop in again but maybe their chefs and or food runners need to cover their hair..this is the only reason I am not giving them a 5. I also was rather annoyed that I went with a group to celebrate babies, like a small shower luncheon and for me to be the pregnant person, I was served my food last and my order was wrong."
12/9/2017,20171209,5,3.76,"A visit to my hometown is never complete until i've had a chance to partake in the local fare. This trip i was introduced to Peaches a large welcoming and bright space in the heart of Bronzeville.Sherri the Manager greeted us with a warm smile and as we were early we had our pick of seats. Our booth was comfortable and spacious.Aby, our server, as I was a newbie, made me feel at ease as she explained the menu and the popoular dishes. I ordered the Peach Bourbon French Toast and Duck Bacon. Both excellent choices.What I enjoyed about the French toast was it was as described. Peaches simmered down in Bourbon and sweetened with Brown Sugar a perfect blend of flavors and no syrup needed. I also appreciated the fact they didnt bog it down with powdered sugar and whipped cream.Now i am a bacon purist and when Aby recommended the Duck bacon i was skeptical. Again however a spot on suggestion. A leaner meat, not greasy and a meaty satisfying bite.Without hesitation i recommend Peaches to locals and visitors alike."
12/11/2017,20171211,4,3.76,If you have not came to peach's and tries there famous duck bacon then you are missing out. I was able to try there famous Peach Bourbon Waffle with a side of duck bacon and I tasted a piece of friend heaven. The bacon is really lean and not fatty which is good seeing that I do not eat pork. This was my first time having duck bacon and I am now a duck back lover. Then the waffle added so much flavor to the meal. There famous peach Bourbon is good on any item but when it is on the waffle it is nothing like it. Make sure you get here to try this.
12/12/2017,20171212,2,3.75,The first time i went i had the fried chicken and French toast w/ a side of cheese grits. Let me just say Cheese grits is goooooodddd i wasn't a big fan of the French toast because they ran out of they're cinnamon butter and didn't tell me until AFTER i got food and had to ask for it. The 2nd time i went i had cheese grits and salmon croquettes and the cheese grits was gooodddd for 2nd time but i wasn't a big fan of the croquettes they should have been friend harder than they were but the homemade biscuit was pretty good as well though

Finally the hostess came to say that our waitress did not know that anyone was sitting there. Really? You missed five people??? We ordered and again waited a long time before even getting coffee. Another long wait brought part of our order. Another wait for pancakes, sauces, etc. We had to ask for refills of coffee and hot water for tea. No one came to ask if everything was okay and in fact, we had a hard time finding a server when we wanted something. The Duck Bowl was very good. Everything else - the Peaches Special and the fried chicken - was unremarkable. Very small portions. No syrup was served with the pancakes. The restaurant is very noisy. We had a very hard time having a conversation. Even though I liked the Duck Bowl, I won't return. They need to visit a good breakfast restaurant to see how to run their business."

My issue is that one of the employees felt the need to comment to someone else about my friend and I still enjoying ourselves at the restaurant. We were still conversing after 3. Nobody mentioned that we needed to leave. But, my friend overheard a female employee referencing us. Not professional and totally unacceptable behavior. If you need us to leave, let us know in a professional manner. Train your workers, please!"
1/12/2018,20180112,4,3.75,"I gave it a four star rather than a five because of the wait time for my food, but I would definitely come back, I had the Shrimps and cheese grits with duck bacon. So good to the taste. The place was very clean, the waitress was awesome, she made sure we was OK, she kept checking on us."
1/14/2018,20180114,1,3.74,"If you're looking for a place to wait and wait and wait at every point of your meal, this is the place for you. Granted, I don't mind waiting when it's crowded and the food is good but it wasn't either of those things- it was poor management or lack of efficient staff. There were over 15 people waiting in the front and when w we're finally seated in the back there were 3 empty tables, not to mention the three empty tables we passed walking there. To top it off, our waitress didn't check on us once. We flagged down random staff for the items we needed once our food was served. Unfortunately, besides the duck bacon, the food was average breakfast fare. I was hoping for more since there were so many good reviews."
1/20/2018,20180120,5,3.74,"Visited Peach's in Chicago today for the first time. Don't know why it took me so long to get there. I'll correct that, by coming back multiple times. I had the Healthy omelette, keeping to my resolutions , but had to get me some cheese grits. Yes, they were excellent. And the entire staff is friendly and very welcoming to all guests!"
1/31/2018,20180131,5,3.75,"Be prepared to eat in weekends but the wait is surly worth it. I always get the salmon croquettes that are made from FRESH salmon. They are the best I have ever had, hands down! Servers are always nice and accommodating. I've seen people playing cards, hosing business meetings, quietly working on their computers and simply enjoying conversation with their family. Whatever you decide... Just go and enjoy the flavor of Peaches."
2/8/2018,20180208,4,3.75,"So.. we went on a Friday morning and waited approximately 10 minutes, not bad at all. Our waitress was basic and she appeared dirty. She had stains on her black pants and all over her shirt. Basically, she looked slovenly. Now, about our food-IT WAS AMAZING. I ordered the shrimp and grits which was appropriately sized and soooo flavorful. At first I thought three shrimp to be too few, but I cut them up and it worked out fine. My hubby ordered the omelette called the Goodfella. It had Italian sausage and peppers and onion in it. He says it was delicious as well. Lastly, I tried the duck bacon and it was very similar to Canadian bacon. Oh and don't forget to order a Peach Palmer, it's super sweet but if you dilute it with water, it's still great! All in all, I'd definitely come back because those shrimp and grits were waaayy too good!!"
2/8/2018,20180208,3,3.75,"A decent breakfast/brunch spot with good options. Had the pancakes which were huge, literally the the entire size of the plate, so a short stack (2) would definitely do; generous portions. Pancakes were good, satisfying, but missing just a little something. Omelettes were pretty tasty too. I'm interested in trying the duck bacon possibly next time, but passed on it this time around. Visited during a weekday morning and it wasn't too crowded at all, but I imagine this place gets quite busy/crowded during the weekend. Would recommend for a quick breakfast option."
2/10/2018,20180210,5,3.75,"I LOVE PEACH's. It's awesome!! I've been going to the gem for about a year and I haven't had a bad experience and i don't think I will. My go to is the Catfish, grits and collard greens but I've also enjoyed the Salmon Croquettes, the Duck Skillet, and the Peach Slider is my go to when i don't have enough time to dine in. It's one of my favorite places. I absolutely love it. Always fresh and good. The Peach coffee is my favorite."
2/11/2018,20180211,5,3.76,This is one of my favorite breakfast spots! Today was especially wonderful. They have a new special call the Gladys and oh my was it wonderful..it features a salmon croquette and rice with homemade chicken gravy. The cheese grits and homemade mile high biscuits w/peach preserve will make you slap somebody (be careful not to hit yo mamma but you just might). They have a new pineapple Palmer that was awesome. Everything was simply mouthwatering.
2/12/2018,20180212,5,3.76,"The hangover wings from @peachson47th is a 5star on flavor, spice, and sweetness. Most wings do not have a balance flavor when they say sweet and hot but @peachson47th has this on lock. Make sure you come here this weekend to try their special Hangover Wings. They are a hit!!!#wings #foodie #videooftheday #insta_chicago #mychicagopix #Chicagogram #Chigram#chicagoeats#Chicagofestivals#ChicagoFoodAndDrink#eatalyseptemberfest#chicagofoodcoop#eaterchicago#chicagogrammers#rejoycelyfe#stampchicago#likefood"
2/14/2018,20180214,5,3.77,If you have not had their peach bourbon French toast then you are missing out. The peach compote paired with the soft bread is the perfect combination. If you are looking for some sweet breeds then make sure you come here because this place is a hit!!!!
3/2/2018,20180302,3,3.76,"Really good down home soul food. I had the fried chicken wings and catfish and both were fried to perfection, Golden Brown with great flavor. Greens were excellent. The restaurant was nice and the staff seemed nice although my waitress was covering too many tables and desperately needed help. As a result it took way to long for me to get my food or extra items requested. This was lunch time so I would expect management to ensure that there is sufficient wait staff to cover so that the patrons don't have to wait as long as I did. Food great, service subpar but the waitress and cashier were nice just understaffed."
3/2/2018,20180302,5,3.77,"Had the Peaches omelette and pancakes! Delicious! Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I'm not sure what's in the salsa, but wow! Also, the biscuits are delicious."
3/4/2018,20180304,1,3.76,"Last weekend, My boyfriend recommended for us to go to Peaches Restaurant for breakfast because they are known for their shrimp and grits. I was fine with it because I've never been and the reviews looked good. So, I figured why not give it a try. From the moment we arrived, the service was good! Our waitress was excellent; she greeted us with a smile and full of energy. My boyfriend ordered the ""shrimp and grits"" and I ordered the ""peaches special"" along with 2 ""Peaches Palmers."" The food came out in a timely manner. But as we were eating, my boyfriend mixed his grits and found a HUGE BUG in his food! Disgusting! We told our waitress and she alerted her manager. The manager was unprofessional, she never addressed us or the issue. She just had the waitress remove the shrimp and grits off the bill and gave us a $20 coupon for our next visit(which we'll never return). All in all, INSpECT your food here before you eat it, I'm sure you don't want any surprises ;)"
3/5/2018,20180305,1,3.75,"I think this place has a lot of potential to be a great breakfast spot, however, they need to communicate with their customers. We arrived at 12:45 added our name to the list, we were not seated until 1:57 for a 3 member party. Had we not been with a person who had hip surgery we would have left the establishment. I need to also state that we saw several tables sitting looooong after they were done eating. Once were seated, the waitress was attentive, however, the food did not arrive until another 45-50minutes later. We expressed our disappointment with waitress who informed us that the kitchen was running 45min behind since morning. When the food came, I could taste it was good, however, after waiting for so long, I expected our food to be HOT, it was room temperature. I may return but it will not be for quite sometime. The ONLY thing that makes me open to returning was that staff maintained their composure while enduring constructive criticism. I did speak to Sherri at the front desk when paying to leave: I suggested a few ideas: 1) Inform patrons of wait time when entering the establishment2) Inform patrons once seated that kitchen is running behind and provide a complimentary fruit bowl or coffee/tea while waiting OR provide a discount on meals (I bet service will quickly hasten with that)* * DO NOT allow other patrons to sit and talk endlessly after their meal is finished when you are super packed. Put up a sign, say something at the top of the meal when taking orders, etc.3) Food should be HOT4) Having many customers should not be an excuse for a breakfast spot on Sunday. There may understandably be a wait, however, once seated things should move quickly. A better system needs to be in place."
3/10/2018,20180310,5,3.75,"First of all, they serve the best coffee in the city--Stiver's--which means even the peach-flavored house coffee is delicious. Happily, it's in our neighborhood; we've been several times now and each time the food was memorable. My favorite is the shrimp and grits. I think about it between visits. It's that kind of thing. Definitely worth going out of your way for."
3/11/2018,20180311,1,3.74,"Walked in with 7 people and was told the wait would be 20 - 30 mins. 1 1/2 hours later we walked out because we still had not been seated. Yes, 1 and a half hours. Been there before, food is good, but will never go again. The entire restaurant turned over while we waited before we walked out. Head waitress didn't seem to care."
3/12/2018,20180312,2,3.73,"Average Breakfast Spot. Shrimp & Grits were a bit too garlicky for my tastebuds, and I do like garlic. Shrimp were overcooked & for $14 only 4 Shrimp were in it!!! Chicken Sausage was just Okay. My friend had the Salmon Croquettes, which had no Onion, Bell Pepper in it. Just the Salmon Server was friendly & Service was fast. Nice Looking Restaurant. Tried it but pretty sure I won't be back-"
3/31/2018,20180331,1,3.72,"So our friend suggests we go to Peaches after class on a Saturday. No problem, we go in and wait patiently for our seat and the wait wasn't bad at all. Now the horror story begins...The waitress takes our order, 1 hour later we are still sitting and it's not packed. When we inquired, the waitresses response was....""it's almost up."" She was friendly, but she should have ensured she checked. I guess she doesn't understand how that affects her tip. We literally watched as people who sat WAY after us got their food ate and left. They blamed the incident on a ticket error. Unless they had to go to the lake and kill the ducks, there is no way it should have taken that long. An hour and a half later our orders were messed up, luke warm and a total disappointment. The manager was insincere in her apology and gave us 20% off the bill. Really??? Once we paid our separate bills the 20% basically went back into it. When you know better you do better. I letting you know now you need to do better! Could we have left, sure. Could we have attempted to correct the situation we did, will we be back, not ever. Keep the 20%, but know the damage from bad customer service can do more harm than if you had just gave a sincere apology and corrected the issue."
4/1/2018,20180401,4,3.72,"I really like the food here and the wait staff work hard to make a good dining experience. I eat here several times a year. I see some reviews show slow service but I've only seen that when it's quite busy. My only complaint is their policy of not seating people until the entire party is present, even if the restaurant is not busy. I understand doing that if it's a large party, or a busy time but use some judgment-not a hard fast rule. On the north side I walk out of restaurants that do this for breakfast or lunch-on the south side I have less options so I stay, but the irritation impacts me-I usually don't invite people here for that reason. I'll come by myself. The rule loses them $"
4/2/2018,20180402,5,3.73,I love the food and staff here. I come here regularly and my experience is always delightful.
4/8/2018,20180408,4,3.73,"Great food, but Imma need them to to add white rice to the menu, please and thank you."
4/23/2018,20180423,5,3.74,Very hospitable very well designed great service amazing food beautiful owner whom was gracious enough to take a photo i only have one complaint....there is no PEACHES RESTAURANT in Pittsburgh nothing even close
4/28/2018,20180428,5,3.74,Delicious food and good coffee. Friendly service. Inviting space. I will definitely come back.
5/1/2018,20180501,1,3.73,My first experience with this reaturant was okay. I had pancakes and sausage...they werent good but they were not nasty. I decides to go again thia time thw food was terrible. The chicken was not cooked to order...instead when I asked the young lady how chicken (fried hard) came out so quickly...she stated oh someone else had ordered it but left..so mind you it was not fried hars like I wanted it ro be...the salmon croquetts were just horrible. I am very surprised that it has stayed open as long as it has..
5/3/2018,20180503,4,3.73,"All of these breakfast options are amazing! I went with a large group of friends, and we all got different items. The duck scrambler was the favorite of the crowd. Many of us got the peaches coffee, and I hadn't tried anything like it. It tastes like it is a blend of coffee and peach tea. Initially I didn't like it, but it really grew on me. Cannot recommend this spot enough."
5/3/2018,20180503,5,3.74,Cliff takes a lot of pride in the restaurant. He wants nothing but the best for it and the community.
5/6/2018,20180506,5,3.74,This DUCK BOWL IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!! I was highly upset about the size of the salmon croquettes for $15.99 but this Duck Bowl makes up for it.
5/8/2018,20180508,5,3.74,"Every time I come here I have a minor panic attack about what to order because everything on the menu & the plates of my neighboring patrons looks incredible. The FOMO is always outweighed by the delicious though. Shrimp& Grits, Steak & Eggs, Biscuits & Gravy all perfect. I don't even like French toast but that peach compote converted me."
5/13/2018,20180513,1,3.73,"I am regretfully Been sitting here over an hour to have Mother's Day Breakfast with our Mother. We have seen multiple parties to have a seat n leave. No organization or understanding of how to accommodate large parties. And the hostess has the absolute worst attitude. My goal was to support black business today but sometimes we just make it difficult!!! We finally sit down, we let them know we have a show to catch at 12:30pm and after 30 mins of sitting they come and say the food will take an additional 40mins to come. We have now been here over 1hr and a half and no food, so now we are leaving."
5/14/2018,20180514,5,3.74,"Great food. Our favorites were the southern Benedict, catfish and grits, salmon croquettes and the peach bourbon French toast. Great ambiance. Good time had by all!Went to Peach's with a large group(about 20). Staff was accommodating to our needs and made sure we all were taken care of, even on a VERY busy Mothers Day. You guys made all the mamas in my group smile so for that, I say THANK YOU! When I tell you, everyone in my party was planning to return soon, I'm not kidding. Peach coffee was great. Buy a bag or two. This place has great consistency and as a chef myself, I can truly say I respect that and kudos to the back of the house for ""firing"" our tables with great pace."
5/18/2018,20180518,5,3.74,Love this place! The shrimp and grits are awesome. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was great. I will be back.
5/19/2018,20180519,5,3.75,I love peach's!! I've been back several times for shrimp and grits! My family eat there often and they like the duck bacon and French roast. The peach lemonade or tea is good too! I plan to try the salmon croquettes next!
5/22/2018,20180522,3,3.75,"This is a nice place for brunch, but don't go on the weekend, unless you are prepared to wait over an hour for a seat and about just as long to be served. Not sure if they take reservations or not, but they don't seem to sit people in the order they came in. The catfish and grits is good, and well as the biscuits and gravy."
6/4/2018,20180604,1,3.74,"I had the Philly chicken omelet (i.e. The ""Fresh Prince"") and I was very disappointed. It was over cooked and the char from the char grilled chicken on the inside didnt mesh well with the egg (the chicken was also dry). My cheese grits were meh, the pancakes were okay. I was also side-eyeing the 3.50 they charge for a very small cup of juice with no refills. Although I didnt enjoy it, I would like to go back and try something different to give them a chance to redeem themselves."
6/6/2018,20180606,1,3.73,"I give this restuarant 0 stars the young lady at the register was very rude.. I was standing waiting to be seated and no one else was in line with me , I had to ask do I seat myself because no one said anything to me.. because of that experience i walk out .. customer service should be #1 and they are lacking it!!!!"
6/10/2018,20180610,4,3.73,"Small hiccup with reservations but, Amir was amazing! The food was great. It's not a huge place but also not a tiny diner. We had a group of 9 and were quite comfortable. They only split the tab once but will except multiple payments just FYI. The duck bacon is great and the peach cobbler French toast is great as long as it's hot. The shrimp and Grits went over well as did the Catfish. Personally I though the fried wings could have had a tad bit more seasoning."
6/10/2018,20180610,5,3.73,"Aaaaaaaaaaagj this place is SO GOOD. The portions are huge and the food is amazing. Service isn't always super speedy, so if you're looking to zoom in and zoom out check out McDonalds down the street. If you want to enjoy a fantastic meal at a leisurely pace and go home full and happy this is your spot!"
6/16/2018,20180616,4,3.73,"Peach Coffee? Yes, please. It's delicious. Atmosphere feels just like home. Cheese Grits are a must have."
6/24/2018,20180624,5,3.74,This was my 1st time coming here. We arrived around 11: 30am on a Saturday morning. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Staff was very pleasant. I had shrimp & grits with garlic bread. This dish was delicious. Service was great. I think the prices are responsible. I will be back to try something else on the menu.
6/27/2018,20180627,2,3.73,"I was thrilled to try a restaurant I have never frequent. I was told by my sister to check it out. I came from NWI so why not. The atmosphere is great. The food that I got a chance to taste was good. However, the breakfast meal I ordered arrived in pieces and the meat and eggs were overcooked. I asked to have the meat to be replaced and the server informed me that he had to talk to manager. He returned to get the meat and I gave him the entire plate to be replaced. Still I have not received my pancakes. I asked to speak to the manager to no avail. The server pointed to a group of people and said that's the owner. TO make a real long story short the manager on duty Ms. T handled the situation in a very professional manner. I received a gift cert and a complimentary breakfast. I will give them another try. Chef Ramsey, Jr."
6/28/2018,20180628,5,3.74,"Peaches thank you for being here! You've saved my Southern Soul! Breakfast from Heaven. I'm so happy I'm not only working my way through the wonderful menu, so far and always dee-lisch1. Shrimp & grits. Yummy2. Salmon crop and grits yeah! 3. Southern Benedict great4. Duck bowl -awesome for duck bacon lovers!Biscuits & gravy - 2 huge yummy homemade biscuits and incredible chicken gravy!And the list keeps going ALL GREAT, big portionsGo to Peaches-on 47th and taste for yourself!!!!!"
7/1/2018,20180701,5,3.74,"Staff was very friendly and the food was amazing. This isn't where you go on your diet. It's where you go for really good, comforting food."
7/3/2018,20180703,5,3.74,"I see why everyone loves their signature peach coffee, it is so delicious, I had several cups. My family loves trying out new breakfast spots. I've heard about this place for a while now and was eager to give them a try. We arrived at the right time because it was basically empty. The server was very attentive and got my little toddler set up in a high chair and child size drink right away. I believe I had the fried chicken and french toast. This was some of the best fried chicken I have had in my entire life, it was crispy and seasoned to perfection. I wish i took a order to go, it was just that good. My husband had the pancakes, he said they were good but nothing really special. The crowd really picked up on our way out. We will definitely return."
7/3/2018,20180703,3,3.74,Good food. Friendly service -- but very slow service. Expect to spend some time here.
7/6/2018,20180706,5,3.75,"Hi Friends i Stop in this little spot call Peaches on the Corner of 47th and King Dr. It's a very open air and Friendly place, the type of Place for a Second Date. The Menu is Packed with all your Soul food Favorites Shrimp and Grits, Chicken and waffles along with a few New ones Duck bacon, Catfish Greens and Grits the staff was Courteous, Fast and Polite. The seating is set up like a Cafeteria with plenty of room between the Tables the Food is Definitely of a Strong Southern Hand with a well Prepared presentation it's Really Worth a Second Visit..."
7/11/2018,20180711,3,3.74,"Knocking off Southside bookmarks we chose to check this place out, the pics/reviews seemed like a good choice. NOT SO MUCHWe arrived about 11am on a Weds, we were seated/greeted promptly. The space is bigger than it appears from the outside. They weren't packed, but had a nice crowd coming & going. We ordered fairly quickly: fried chicken entree, salmon croquettes & grits, & the biscuits & gravy. It took our meal about 15-20mins to arrive I assume do to the fried chicken. I tasted my biscuits & gravy and the overwhelming taste of cheese flooded my tongue (GROSS). I was instantly not a fan, I immediately asked the waitress was cheese in it? She replied no, but everyone thinks so. (Maybe they should tweak that ingredient then because it's not good) So I asked for a to go container and another order of their peach French toast (the chicken came with French toast, but I let my cousin eat those assuming I'd like my biscuits and gravy). At that point you'd think the server would ask did I not like my food? Would I like to replace it?, but nah nothing! LOL .... My fried chicken was bland, I had to dump salt on it. It was fried right and fresh though, and they gave me 5 wings. My French toast order came out after I devoured my wings. They were the saving grace of the place. My cousin said her salmon croquettes/grits were just ok. She felt it wasn't fresh & her French toast was too soggy to her. Lastly, the 2 star loss is for the food issues and I noticed the person who delivered the food carrying out our food in her arms so the food was touching her apron almost under her arm pits. I noticed this with my table and 1 other table. I DID NOT LIKE THAT!!! Our server just sufficed. She disappeared for long periods of times so I couldn't ask for things. I wouldn't go back, but check them out for yourself!"
7/15/2018,20180715,4,3.74,"My sister and I decided to go to Peach's restaurant before heading back to Atlanta. The staff was friendly and we were seated quickly. My sister got the fried chicken and french toast. She said she enjoyed it. I got the catfish, greens and grits. The catfish and grits were good, however the greens weren't all that. They had a good flavor but was way too mushy. Overall, we had a good experience though."
7/15/2018,20180715,4,3.74,"Had the catfish, grits and greens. The fish was fried to perfection and the grits were on point, but the collards were mushy and inedible. I informed my server and she offered to sub my greens for potatoes, but I declined. Enjoyed my food with the exception of the surprisingly terrible greens. Will be back to sample more."
7/21/2018,20180721,5,3.75,"This place was perfection. I don't have one complaint. Easy to find parking. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient. There's WiFi available. Our food was delicious with gluten free options. The omelets are flavorful, seasoned to perfection with a choice of hash browns/grits. Gluten free pancakes also were an option. The coffee is OMG strong and amazingly great."
7/22/2018,20180722,3,3.75,"I think the management meant needs to pay attention to customer reviews. 1) I commend (as I think many who patronize the restaurant), the economic &employment opportunities this business provides to the local community as an anchor - I want to continue to support it. (2) I would recommend manage& owners to review recipes of some items that are not good like Salmon Croquettes) it was a huge disappointment !! (3) food handlers training on how to handle open plate of food( the server who brought the food to the table had her finger in the bowl of fruit and also, touching the toast points served either the Grits n shrimp. (4) building in some efficiencies in the care, movement & management of patron with a focus on customer service can enhance the whole experience for the customers. Lastly, Your host/hostess and cashier need to be less policing more welcoming, with genuine care. Not like robot ""can I help you"" and then dismissive. WE CAN DO BETTER!!!I hope to return, I hope this review helps."
7/22/2018,20180722,5,3.75,DELISH I do not eat animal products and they accommodate no problem! Long wait Sunday around 10 but worth it. Parking on the street.
7/28/2018,20180728,2,3.75,This is my second time trying Peaches because I had a friend in town. Their food is very basic dare I say it mediocre. I really want to like this local business because it's close to where I live. I tried the duck bacon which was ok not great but edible. The cheese grits everyone can make grits and Peaches did not do a good job. Only thing that was decent was the peaches in bourbon sauce that I put on my toast. I will not be returning anytime soon. Too many other brunch spots to enjoy.
8/8/2018,20180808,4,3.75,"My go to spot in Bronzeville for breakfast. The cheese grit and salmon croquettes are pretty good also they have Peach Palmer. Staff is friendly, food comes out quick. They even have duck bacon on the menus and some other cool dishes."
8/10/2018,20180810,3,3.74,"Came here one morning after a late night. Good food, slow service. I had the French toast with a side of bacon. It wasn't bad, but it's not something I will seek out on my next visit to Chicago. Although the service wasn't quick, the employees were extremely friendly."
8/11/2018,20180811,4,3.74,"Y'all. If you eat meat, get the DUCK BACON! Get it. It's SO GOOD. Also -- salmon croquettes are so good! Love love loved the food. Service was absolutely wonderful too; super attentive. Seating is limited and not great for large groups. I would recommend max of 4-5 people. They have tables and booths and a traditional diner bar top. I absolutely loved the breakfast potatoes. There was a lot of flavor and spice. The eggs were fried like they were in a cast iron. I can't stop thinking about that duck bacon though. I will be back!"
8/11/2018,20180811,3,3.74,"The food was good but not Reccomend for a group of more than 4 people , they didn't have steak at 9am for steak and eggs . There were several orders wrong and we were charged for an item we didn't receive."
8/16/2018,20180816,5,3.75,The food and environment is where I want to be. I love that I can be in my neighborhood and enjoy this wonderful restaurant.
8/27/2018,20180827,4,3.75,"Found this gem through yelp! It was busy! I asked how long was the wait... and the host said since I am solo I can just sit at the bar. Fine by me. The place was PACKED! As i sat, it took a few minutes for a waiter to greet me. During that time, i used Yelp on food recommendations. I opted for the shrimp n grits... and side of duck bacon. It took about 45 mins for my food to come. Whoa! I enjoyed my selections, especially shrimp n grits. The duck bacon wasn't anything special. It reminds me of my fave turkey bacon by Krasdale. Once checking out... you have to wait in line to pay. I have to remember that not everywhere is in a rush like us in nyc. Go check it out!"
9/6/2018,20180906,1,3.74,"The service was pretty horrendous, but the food was good. Went with my family on a Sunday and it became clear -- so we thought -- that they might have been understaffed for the day. It took a long time to get the basics -- coffee, water and silverware -- and they missed a couple of items that were ordered. The server never returned to refill our coffee or water and he rarely checked on us. We brought it up at the end of the meal when the manager stopped by and we essentially threw her an alley-oop by presenting the thought that their low staffing contributed to the poor service, but she told us that wasn't the issue. That pretty much ended the conversation for me, but it was clear she knew this to be a problem -- whether it was the server or her staff in general. I won't be back."
9/16/2018,20180916,3,3.74,"I like Peaches, however the food is not consistent enough. I've been here at least twice. The first time was with my family, the food and service were really good. The next time I met a friend for breakfast and the service was slow & the food was sub par & lune warm by the time it made it to our table. It was fairly early & not very busy. I would have thought the service and quality would have been better."
9/22/2018,20180922,2,3.73,"Had breakfast here yesterday, 9/21/18. Heard so many wonderful praises about PEACHES. THE GOOD: Our server, Latoya, was sweet and accommodating. Very pleasant to talk to and very patient with us. Street parking was easy, East 47th Street is metered, inner King Drive is free.AMBIANCE: Just your average diner, no frills, nothing spectacular on the walls. Nothing popped out and said ""come on back!"" Typical hard wood, chairs and tables, booths. All on top if a painted concrete floor. All I had were visions if someone dropping a coffee mug, and ceramic flying in some customers EYES. THE BAD: My daughter ordered the Fried Chicken and French Toast, butter looked like it had honey in it. You get 4 anorexic wings, not well seasoned and 3 slices of French Toast. What happened to the 4th slice of FT? And the FT was gummy and served at room temperature, not good!I ordered the Steak and Eggs, it came with Grits and Pancakes. BEST grits I've ever had, bar none awesome. Steak was suppose to be 6oz, it was more like 4oz, and bland no flavor. My eggs were served cold and the Pancakes were also gummy.And the coffee was ok, we had the peach coffee as well, the coffee cup was full of coffee grounds. Worst taste on my planet.And lastly, the restaurant wasn't that busy. After we were seated in the middle of the room, we asked for a booth. The hostess, Deja(?), told us NO, because she had to rotate her servers. 2 gentlemen came in and were seated near us, they too asked for a booth and were re-seated. That one gesture would keep me from EVER going back again!"
9/23/2018,20180923,5,3.73,"I love this place! It's in the heart of The Bronzeville! Great food, great service, from great people! Our server was LaToya and she awesome with a great smile! The food is amazing! I haven't had anything I didn't like and the biscuits are my favorite!"
9/30/2018,20180930,3,3.73,"Honestly, I enjoyed my bourbon peach french toast and the healthy start 3 egg omlet today. But HONESTLY, my wife and I waited about 60 minutes (maybe 40: 30min for the table and arguably 20min (wife) 30min (me) for the food) for some plain jane dinner food. I mean the people are nice and the place is nostalgic (we've been wanting to check this place out together for a while). But I want to be rewarded for my wait. This is why I get the bourbon peach... I just want their provisions to be more unique to be worth my wait.Enjoy but You've Been Warned,"
10/15/2018,20181015,3,3.73,This is one of my favorite breakfast spots! Today was especially wonderful. They have a new special call the Gladys and oh my was it wonderful..it features a salmon croquette and rice with homemade chicken gravy. The cheese grits and homemade mile high biscuits w/peach preserve will make you slap somebody (be careful not to hit yo mamma but you just might). They have a new pineapple Palmer that was awesome. Everything was simply mouthwatering. Update: Consistency sucks and the wait is horrible. Just being honest. You must have a couple hours to kill.
10/19/2018,20181019,4,3.73,"Always a good time whenever I come here, good service and good food are the key to my heart."
10/29/2018,20181029,1,3.72,I've been here a few times no. But today wasn't good at all. The customer service wasn't good at all. The waiter never brought napkins at all. Nor did she bring us anything to drink. Peaches is an amazing place but the hiring process should be more strict.
10/30/2018,20181030,5,3.73,"I wanted 2 try this spot due 2 the comments I read. I am so glad I did. The outside was clean and inviting. The same was 2 be said about the inside. The decor was just right, loved the old school stove and the writing on the wall. I gave hostess my name, she told me 20 mins. I sat on one of the nice benches and waited 11 minutes for a table. The server, Amirr, was nice, pleasant, professional. I love the berets they wear. Resembles the Black Panthers. Now I want one but have to get it custom made since I have a big head. . I ordered the egg white veggie omelette which was delish plus a side of duck bacon, which was my 1st time trying and I liked it. The peach coffee sounded odd at first but after adding creamer, it was pleasant. I may not buy it outside of this spot but here it makes sense. The pancake was delish; loved the grits, not too thick, not too buttery. My hub ordered a cheese omelette which he liked; the seasoning on his potatoes was delicious. The vibe was nice, a mixed crowd. I love supporting independent businesses. They did a great job. Keep it up guys."
11/2/2018,20181102,4,3.73,Good place for good breakfast food...the duck bacon is outstanding if you get a chance to try it....
11/4/2018,20181104,5,3.73,"This was my first time eating at this restaurant. I was impressed. Our server(Raven),was amazing. She was very polite, greeted us with a beautiful smile, and was very attentive toward us. First time trying the Peach Coffee, and OMG, IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!. FOOD was delivered nice and hot, and delicious as well. I will be returning."
11/4/2018,20181104,5,3.73,"I only can speak for the Reese cup cookie , duck bowl , peaches biscuit slider and the chicken waffle. Everything was wonder but the chicken was just ok ( not bad just ok) ; nothing to brag about !!!! Despite the chicken the food is the bomb !!!!The parking suck on Sunday's !!!!"
11/5/2018,20181105,5,3.74,"I only can speak for the Reese cup cookie , duck bowl , peaches biscuit slider and the chicken waffle. Everything was wonder but the chicken was just ok ( not bad just ok) ; nothing to brag about !!!! Despite the chicken th food is the bomb !!!!"
11/6/2018,20181106,4,3.74,"Peaches, is a diner that has a lot of charm. Its fantastic spot in the heart of Bronzeville for breakfast or lunch. At the corner of 47th and King Drive. There is plenty of free parking on South Park street just west of the boulevard. If you feel like splurging there's metered parking on 47th street. Some of the favorites are the fried catfish, grits and greens. Today, I'm going for the Salmon croquettes and cheesy grits. This is one place that I keep in regular rotation. They also have old school peach penny candy at the door as a parting gift."
11/17/2018,20181117,2,3.73,"I really really wanted this to be a good experience but I dont think I can make it to be. I ordered my food for pick up (a friend lives close enough to walk). I ordered the shrimp and grits. The total was around 13 dollars. This was my first time eating from this restaurant so I was unaware of how many shrimp would come with the meal, so I ordered extra shrimp. The total went from 13 to 22 dollars. The price jump made me believe I would most definitely get a surplus of shrimp for my meal. Upon picking my food up and arriving home, I found the original meal only came with FOUR small shrimp. And a huge bowl of grits. And to my surprise, the 9 dollar jump in price only secured THREE extra shrimp. JUST 3! for 22 dollars. Needless to say, that's disappointing as heck. Also, I expected a creole type of taste for the shrimp and the juices it floated in...wrong. It was just watered down brown water. I'm disappointed and plan to never order again. Period."
11/18/2018,20181118,5,3.74,Went here for breakfast yesterday morning and it was amazing. I ordered the wings with the peach bourbon French toast with honey butter and one fish filet. There may be a wait but it was definitely worth it.
12/1/2018,20181201,5,3.74,"Hospitable, charitable, reasonable. The service is friendly. They are present in the community, donating to local schools. And the food is tasty and reasonably price."
12/1/2018,20181201,5,3.75,man jo...peach's dat number for real everything from the ambiance the bronzeville vibe the food the beautiful black people vibes when you walk in wit good soul music playin ...definitely wanna check them out i stay rite down the street from them now ...dem pancakes so big and fluffy ..man
12/4/2018,20181204,2,3.74,"Nothing to write home about, I've seen people give good reviews about this breakfast spot but it wasn't too special in terms of the food. Everything could have used a little more seasoning, I had to add salt and pepper to the wings. The omelette could have used a little more love as well. The place bigger than I thought and everything is very clean. Our server was very nice and make sure everything came out as ordered. Not sure I'd return, you probably could get a better omelette at ihop."
12/11/2018,20181211,1,3.73,"My friend and I stopped in after the universoul circus, we we're starving. We were seated and kinda just left there without any other kind of acknowledgment. My friend wanted to leave, I gave it another 2min. A couple had walked in, they were seated and were given glasses of water ( I was kinda thirsty). Maybe, they don't serve Latina women. That was all I could assume. My friend had ordered us coffee a while back, but I stayed in the car (the coffee was good, hence the one star)."
12/21/2018,20181221,5,3.74,"From the customer service to the food, everything is in point.I have eaten at Peach's at least 4 times and my food is always perfect and the waitress is always tentative.The peach coffee is a must."
12/22/2018,20181222,2,3.73,"I really, really wanted to like this joint, as it's so close to where I live, and an excellent, nearby brunch go-to can really make or break your weekly routine. Situated across from Harold Washington community center, Peach's looks promising on the outside, but seems a little dilapidated inside, the walls a puke-ish green, with orange accents, and not much natural light (at least from where we were seated, in the back, delightfully close to the restrooms). Expect a long wait- at 1:30pm there weren't too many people still there, but it took them till about 1:50 to even acknowledge my friend and I. Service and attentiveness was truly mediocre- since we had a such long time to look at the menus we were ready to order as soon as we were seated, but again, weren't attended to for at least 20 more minutes; a pair of ladies who arrived right after us got seated earlier, and had received their food well before we had ordered. The person that took our order (peach coffees, the duck bowl, and fried chicken) never checked in about whether we liked our food, took another 20 minutes to bring us maple syrup after we asked, and even longer to refill our water and coffee. Food was reasonably priced but the portions are pretty small, and the quality wasn't anything extraordinary- a fairly decent meal, with a smattering of options for vegetarians like myself. The peach coffee (with refills) was surprisingly peachy and absolutely delicious, the highlight of the entire meal, and I would definitely consider coming back just for this, though as a take-out order for sure. Everything else, I could do without."
12/22/2018,20181222,3,3.73,Decent place in this neighborhood of Chicago. The coffee (peach flavored) is really good. My salmon omelet was just okay as was my wife's salmon coquettes with grits. Negatives would be to expect the service to be on 'island time' somewhat (big lulls between attention) and staff forgot to bring me my sourdough toast that came with my meal.
1/10/2019,20190110,2,3.72,Although the food here is great they lack in customer service. My first/second experiences were amazing.The service at my 3rd visit was lacking it took an hour just to get my food and the waiter brought me back an over cooked steak that he admitted was rushed because the kitchen had closed by the time he remembered to put our order in.We asked for the manager... she never came and we were told she was on a call. We asked for her again and noticed she was the lady just sitting at the bar the entire time. She took 3 dollars off our bill after we waited half an hour on her. Terrible!Then today my boyfriend called in the order and while our order was ready when he got there the hostess was so overwhelmed by a whopping 8 customers she didn't even notice that the food was ready. They wrap to go orders in foil yet my food was still cold. Let's u know how long it was sitting there. I'm so disappointed bc I really love their food.
1/13/2019,20190113,5,3.73,"Wife and I came in for a Sunday morning breakfast. Fast and immediate service and food came out quickly - salmon croquettes and grits for wifey and catfish, cheese grits, greens, and peach coffee for me - DELICIOUS!"
1/14/2019,20190114,3,3.72,"The food was good. If you never had duck bacon, it was cool. I wish the customer service was on point. I was served by three different servers and they kept forgetting what my friend and I asked for. I understand it's Monday but come on guys.."
1/23/2019,20190123,1,3.72,Everything was awful. Nothing had ANY seasoning in or on it. Everything was just BLAND Chicken was HOT but bland. :(
2/2/2019,20190202,5,3.72,"This is my second time at this restaurant and once again they did not disappoint. Of course Latoya was my server and she was awesome! Very kind, always smiling, and down to earth! I wanted to take a walk on the wild side and try something different outside of a basic breakfast that has become my usual. She recommended ""The Goodfella"" omelet! It comes with Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, and provolone cheese. The giardiniera peppers were thee perfect pairing with this omelette, pleasing my taste buds. I also had their light and fluffy pancakes, potatoes, and cheese grits! Of course I couldn't finish it all despite eating for two but I was happy to have some to take home for later! If you're ever in the area looking for some good breakfast or brunch, this is the place f"
2/2/2019,20190202,1,3.71,"The food was good, but overpriced. The customer service was horrible. Not only did I wait 30 minutes to be seated at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I waited another hour for my food... oops, I mean someone else's food. They brought me the wrong order! When asked if I wanted them to remake my order, I declined the offer. I didn't have another hour and a half to wait before eating my breakfast. I was left with scrambled eggs on my plate and a spoon since the waiter took my fork away. You think they would've kept the first order at my table while they remade my correct order or offered me a piece of toast. I mean, they're not supposed to put the old plate on someone else's table once it's been given to another customer. This was my first visit after hearing great reviews, but it will definitely be my last. No apologies, only excuses given for the poor service. The waiter blamed the hostess who blamed the kitchen, blah blah blah. No tip, no repeat visit."
2/3/2019,20190203,2,3.71,"Went here for breakfast for the 1st time with my family on a Sunday morning (10:30am) after church. We were seated immediately upon arriving. There was no line & the restaurant was not busy. There were a few empty tables. We were seated at a nice big booth. Our service was terrible. We ordered our breakfast & waited at least 25-30 minutes. When the waiter bought our food, she ought it out in segments. I was confused. Our pancakes came 1st, then our meat 5 minutes later then our eggs. I didn't understand that. I was bothered by having to wait for ALL of my food on 1 plate. Once the waitress brought our food, we never saw her again. She didn't top off our coffee, refill our water, bring us syrup or even come back to ask us was everything ok. It wasn't.  Food: The bacon was undercooked. The steak & egg was terrible. The 6 oz steak was over cooked & couldn't be cut with a knife. Everyone at my table food was served room temperature-it was not hot AT ALL. The potatoes were hard, unseasoned & were also undercooked. We couldn't find our waitress so, we started to flag other waiters down to obtain their attention. We had to request napkins, ask for our coffee to be topped off and ask for syrup when we all ordered french toast & pancakes.  Our waitress never returned until it was time to bring our bill. I felt it was necessary to mention our complaints when she returned with a big smile asking ""How was everything?"" It was our 1st time but, there is no need to return. The service was poor & it was not crowded. The food was not tasty, it was under cooked, lacked flavor & was mediocre. This was simple breakfast food-no specialty orders, nothing complicated. Not only was the service poor, they couldn't prepare simple pancakes, bacon, potatoes & eggs. They ruined all of it. Peaches need to improve with their poor slow service & the cook needs to be ashamed of the food he prepared!"
2/10/2019,20190210,1,3.7,Just walked out of this restaurant. We arrived at 11 AM (before the Church rush) and gladly waited the 30 minute wait. We sat and our server did not arrive at our table for another 10-15 minutes. She came and we placed our order. Waited 45 minutes and out food STILL had not come to the table. We finally asked the server how much longer and she informed up she had (2) tickets before ours and then (2) of our tickets would be worked on but we had (3) people sitting at the table. Just wasted an hour and a half and didn't even get a chance to eat. I used to be a hostess here and know Chef Rome and his sister Summer personally. How horrible it is to write this review. Wouldn't recommend going on a Sunday. Or maybe at all at this point.
2/12/2019,20190212,1,3.69,Ok well went for breakfast arrived at 1020 am left at 1140 am no food yet we were tired of waiting. Restaurant was pretty slow many empty tables still took OVER an hour and no food. Won't be rushing back. Ordered a salmon croquet and a waffle. What's so hard about that. Lady behind me ordered cheesy grits and salmon croquet got hers ate and left. We were never served.
3/1/2019,20190301,5,3.7,"A Bronzeville treasure. One of the best places for brunch period! Latoya is a dream; warm, inviting and always ready to serve. The food is always on point. The ambiance is always pleasant - great music in the background, festive vibe. I eat here at least once a week and I highly recommend it."
3/3/2019,20190303,1,3.69,"I'd love to provide an excellent review, but I cannot. Arrived, was told it was a 30-40 minute wait but could sit at counter now. Sat at the counter, waited 10 minutes for acknowledgement. Spot I sat at, along with 3 others, were not bussed in this time period. There were 4 staff behind the counter, one of which polished silverware the entire time I sat, unacknowledged, at the counter. 6 minutes into my wait, cook brought out food. I had not ordered yet. I really wanted to support, but bad service is an immediate do not return for me."
3/9/2019,20190309,2,3.68,"The waitresses have poor customer service skills. Not very thorough at all. First of all, I ordered a kids combo for my son. It came with 1 pancake, choice of meat and 1 egg It was $5 on the menu. I asked for fruit instead of eggs because my son does not eat eggs. The waitress told me it would be an upcharge of $1.90. I said ok. That is fine. When his food arrived, it was 2 sausages, 2 pancakes, and a fruit bowl. Im like ok they are generous with their kids meals. When I received the bill, his meal was $13 dollars plus tax. Just as expensive as the salmon omelette I ordered. I called over the waitress. She says that that is the most cost effective way I could have charged you. I am like well that is expensive for a kids meal and it would of been nice and appreciated if you would have let me know that that is how you had to do it. It is your job to be informative. You can not just spend someone's money for them. She says oh well im sorry and walked off. Well maam. I am sorry too because your tip paid for his food. I am usually a generous tipper. I want the waiters to do a good job. I used to be a waiter. I know what it is like. Also, on the menu, it does not say that you cannot get chicken sausage. It says ""your choice of meat"" Our waitress was wrong for not informing us. Also, my salmon omelette was slimy with like 2 shredded pieces of salmon in it. All of the of the food aside from that was mediocre at best. Very bland and watery grits. The omelette had no taste. All i tasted was fish. My fiance's meal was mediocre as well. We honestly know of a hole in the wall place called, Thomas's, right off of 87th and Stony Island that is waayy better and more cost efficient. We spent $55 on breakfast for bland tasting food. They are overrated. I wish I could give them 5 stars because I am African American and they are an African American owned business but they do not deserve it. I do not mind paying $55 for breakfast if the food is actually good. Not worth the money. Go someone else. Also, the cashier is rude as hell as well. Will not be going back."
3/13/2019,20190313,1,3.67,"Let me start off with the positive - the shrimp and grits were really memorable that I had on 2/18. We also ordered the peach french toast, which was average. Then there is the problem with the restaurant policies. I tried to use our WBEZ membership card to get a discount for the food. At the time, I was told that the restaurant no longer subscribes to the service. Funny thing is, it does as the restaurant is listed. It was through this subscription that we decided to try the place out, as I live in a different part of town. Two times I attempted to follow-up (phone call and email) with the staff afterwards (once I was told that the accountant would call me back and the second, the restaurant manager), and have never been able to get ANY resolution. No one at the restaurant seems to be taking this seriously as have not received a return phone call or email. This is a business and perhaps they should be running it like one with their customers being a priority."
3/17/2019,20190317,4,3.68,"Food is good, service a little on the slow side. Try the duck bacon is really good, there are known for their grits. I love the music and the environment with good conversation."
3/17/2019,20190317,1,3.67,"No stars if I could. Waited 2 hours like dummies. Told us multiple times your food is coming but it never did. People sat next to us after an hour given same food orders that we ordered. You would think they would expedite us but I don't think they understand how to do that when your customer has been waiting. This is the terrible experience that unfortunately mars our community's reputation. How can one support such poor service and inability to adapt to the situation? Given this experience we will never be back. Also told they will open a third location, hmmph, please get service at the first one right. So so disappointing."
3/17/2019,20190317,1,3.66,"I would honestly provide zero or negative stars if I could. My review is solely based on service as I was deprived of the Peach's breakfast experience.My girl friend wanted to try this place. We are both from the south side and I recently moved to Bronvzeville. It is always good to support your local businesses and especially African American owned businesses in this day and age. My girl friend lived on the Northside for years so when she suggested Peach's, I jokingly said ""oh yeah, you missing that black business experience?"" She looked at me like-""no- don't""... I agreed, that stigma on our businesses is BS.But...Ok. The folded egg Mc Muffin with white cheddar and a folded egg was off the chain!  The apple pie was great too... oh wait, those are not on the menu at Peach's. Here is the deal:We were on the waiting list for 30 mins to be seated. Walked the neighborhood and almost bought an Adidas track suit but they did not have the right color jacket...So, got back 15 mins later and it was still like tons of people waiting.  Actually sat at the bar counter... one of the waiters made mention that that was not supposed to be there- speaking of the seats and locations. Checked the main deck again because the bar was really too tight. Surprised to see so may empty seats and tables and so many people waiting.So here is the deal-We moved from the bar to a table. Then, the staff asked us to move again so we could allow a large group to sit together. We allowed it. Our food never came. When I say never, I mean never!!!So? I ordered regular coffee. They evidently have a peach coffee that many like. I asked for regular. I received the most peach flavored regular coffee I ever had in my life. BTW- peach and coffee does not go together unless you are eating peach cobbler and washing it down with coffee.So, I ordered plain but got peach.  We moved to a table after coordinating with the bar staff. Then, after that, the establishment asked us to move again so they could seat a large group and use our table to push tables together with others and make a larger seating situation.No problem...Wait- we waited for another 1/2 hr. Then we shifted tables. Then another 1/2 hr. They asked us if they could comp us a dessert. They sold us on the peach cobbler. After all, we were in Peach's. 20 minutes later they came back and told us they did not have peach cobbler but the last thing we would ever order- ""fried dough"" was amazing. we didn't order the fried dough, that was the last thing we would order but the waiter vividly described why we should consider taking that off our ""never order that"" list...They profusely apologized; apparently they are really good at apologies. The bar waitress came out and explained while we were getting much hungrier by the minute and assured us, our situation would change. Subsequently, the hosts both explained what went wrong... after receiving a complimentary bowl of cooked peaches and a biscuit... the biscuit was buttery and crispy crunchy on the outside and hollow in the inside. . The food never came. Many apologies and explanations (on what went wrong) came but food never did. We were assured several times we would get our orders quickly and ""soon"" but instead, on more than one occasion, people seated 1 hr after us got the same dishes we ordered. We were like dayum... They offered to comp our desert but never said our breakfast was on the house. Well, you can't really offer to comp something that will never arrive. In that regard, the staff if trained to manage expectations.Can you imagine? Maybe I am not describing this vividly enough. If this was a white owned establishment, I would be certain they were racist. They did everything perfectly to subtly suggest they did not want our business and wanted us to leave. After 2 total hours, we were out. That service needs work before you open and replicate the offering. We were told 3rd location opening soon. Don't!We wasted 2 hours of our lives to the last minute wishing to experience what we have heard people rave about. On the other hand, we faced an opponent so determined to assure we would not experience what it is to eat at Peach's we left in a surreal daze pondering ""how could a business be this effective in pushing an eager customer away?""So McDonald's was great. I ordered aSausage Mc muffin with no sausage, white cheese, and a folded egg. Mikky D's only gets that order right 10% of the time. Today, after leaving Peach's, I got my request fulfilled quickly and flawlessly. It was so good. Wish I could actually comment on Peach's food.Unfortunately I mostly have the taste of very strange coffee as reminder of why I will not come back.-Paul"
3/18/2019,20190318,4,3.66,"Ok so I had to be honest and update this review from a 3 star to a 4 star. Hey when I'm harsh I can admit it. So since my first visit I've been back actually a few times. I went by myself and actually received much better service. Lawdy the chicken and waffles with peach cobbler sauce is to die for. It's so yummy, gone ahead and drizzle that special sauce on that waffle. Yum. Washed it down with peach tea. Will be back, and glad I gave them another try."
3/19/2019,20190319,5,3.66,"It was my first time here. I came as part of a group of 6. The place was spacious and definitely good for groups. Our host was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. Her service throughout was excellent.I was impressed with their house blend of coffee. Peach flavored/infused coffee. It sounds weird at first but it was actually really good! I would recommend that alone for any coffee drinkers and they even sell the roast itself. My dish was a cinnamon French toast with fried chicken wings. The chicken wings were amazing and were not greasy whatsoever. I was very pleased. One person in our group ordered duck bacon! You heard that right! It was really good and better than turkey bacon. It actually tasted very ""hammy"" and was crisp on the edges. Definitely recommend this as well. We were even given a cup of coffee to go. Great staff and great service. You can tell the chefs/cooking staff know what their doing in the kitchen. My review is based on service and dish. If ever in the Bronzeville area of Chicago, you must support. It is a local business which makes it even better. Whether you're a local or just visiting, please support! To the owner and staff, great job! As always, I hope this helps."
3/24/2019,20190324,5,3.67,"I found this restaurant using Google 'Black Owned Restaurants' leading me to Yelp. Don't sleep on Peach's deliciously bustling restaurant. If you can't wait run to the counter. The space is large with plenty of table top seating but busy. I had things to do so I opted for the counter. My server was friendly and helpful working this difficult to navigate counter. She is short the counter is high with thermo coffee pots and glasses of water. But she made it work. My questions were answered in detail and suggestions made.The coffee I started with was pretty good. The delivery of the food is slow but it is very busy, a Sunday at 11:00am. So I'll give them a pass. I asked if the grits had any dairy products, heavy cream, cream cheese etc., I was told they did not but they did. Not a fan of that at all! But the catfish and greens were on point flavorful without being salty. Now the Peach Bourbon French Toast was DIVINE!! I ordered a side of French Toast and the server suggested the sauce as I could not eat a full portion. Peach Bourbon French Toast is a ABSOLUTE MUST!!If you're ever in Bronzeville make Peach's your FIRST STOP!!"
3/30/2019,20190330,1,3.66,Horrible customer service!!!!! I called to confirm my takeout order and the person huffed as though she did not want to confirm my order. I cancelled my order. Learn how to do business.
3/31/2019,20190331,1,3.65,NEVER! Going back to this place. The ladies that work the front are idiots! And the chick at the register with the wack lace front is rude as hell! If you want good service do not go here.
4/4/2019,20190404,5,3.66,"I suppose it shouldn't be a surprise that at a restaurant named Peach's that is famous for its biscuits, two of the most amazing things on the menu are the biscuit and the homemade bourbon peach compote. You have a lot of options for how to combine these things, and what else to add to your breakfast, but I thought the biscuit sandwich was a particularly nice way to do it. Though it was just about as good to just get a second biscuit, and top it with butter, hot sauce, and compote. The service and ambience are wonderful as well, in exactly that way you want a breakfast diner to be. Our waitress warned us that a seven-top was about to place an order and helped us rush our order in first so we wouldn't have to wait; she brought crayons and paper to entertain our little one and maybe napkins to clean up his messes. The food came promptly and with exactly the right condiments and accoutrements. It reminded me how rarely you go to a restaurant where the staff is devoted so perfectly to getting you your food and helping you enjoy it as seamlessly as possible.Take your guests. Get the biscuits."
4/7/2019,20190407,4,3.66,"A friend and I visited last Monday for lunch. Peach's provides a nice, chill environment. Great service provided by our waitress. We both ordered shrimp and grits with turkey bacon, with a salmon croquette on the side. I was disappointed on how my grits dried up so fast, while my friend's grits was still moist. We both commented on the side of salmon croquette. It resembled a hockey puck. It was thick and small. It should have been flatter and less thick.... Oh and warmer. I would definitely come back but I won't order the salmon croquette again."
4/15/2019,20190415,2,3.65,"The food ain't nasty but it ain't worth what you pay. Do yourself a favor and pass on the bad customer service, dry chicken and this $2 per egg restaurant."
4/18/2019,20190418,5,3.66,"Excellent breakfast and brunch in the heart of Bronzeville. It's always pretty busy, but you're probably going to be able to grab a free table. The coffee is DELICIOUS and smooth, and there are plenty of options to choose from. The portions are big; I find that I don't have room for extra sides because the dishes are big enough by themselves."
4/19/2019,20190419,1,3.65,"I USED TO LOVE PEACHES!! I defended peaches in regards to their ""terrible service"" for the last couple of years. I did so again two weeks ago when a couple friends went to Facebook and spoke of their displeasure in service. Unfortunately, I was hit with this same issue today...but MUCH WORSE.Slow service is one thing, but utter disregard for the customers is an entirely different one. When I came in, with my family at 9:20, we were seated almost immediately. It took about 15 minutes for someone to take our order. Once taken, we sat for another 40 min waiting. The restaurant had a good amount of people in there, so I didn't bring anything up and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, I then saw a woman walk in, walk to the kitchen, then sit at the bar. Within a couple minutes, the woman received her entire meal. At this time, multiple groups of people were still waiting in disgust as their meal was not served yet. At this point, while the woman was eating, we were approached by our waitress stating that our food would be out soon. At 10:15, I had enough and joined a couple other groups by leaving. Come to find out, after speaking with an employee, the woman sitting at the bar is ""one of the owners"". THIS IS THE REASON I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW. In no way, should the owner see their restaurant struggling, then walk in the back, take ready food (which in my mind is someone else's order) and eat in front of her hungry, disappointed and disgruntled customers. Peaches was once one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. It is now off my list and I will no longer support them or defend them."
4/21/2019,20190421,5,3.65,"Peach's is a go-to favorite. Attentive and friendly staff, and the food is always great. I love their menu- traditional breakfast items with a twist- there is something for everyone. They can get pretty busy but they're take out is always a fast option. Definitely recommend."
4/26/2019,20190426,3,3.65,"I love Peaches food but I really need them to take heed to the feedback regarding the EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE! I am certain that there are a fair amount of customers that come and wants to promote this business especially since it is black owned and that in itself is a label that often comes with negative assumptions regarding poor customer service which o don't believe to be true. The challenge is when customers who want to see the business thrive provide feedback and the feedback is not implemented. I have referred several ppl here just for them to tell me the food is delicious but the service is slow! I went yesterday and almost waited 45 mins for food just for it to be wrong. I was also charged for a refill on my drink which I wouldn't necessarily have an issue with if it weren't for the fact that if I'm waiting 45 mins for an egg white omelette and you bring my drink at the beginning of the 45 mins then of course I'm going to consume the small glass WELL before the food gets there. What else would I have to consume while waiting such a long time for a meal that at the very most should take no longer than 15 mins. I really hope someone reads this feedback and establish service expectations with the staff. The food is great but this is an area that I know for a fact is negatively impacting your review, returning customers and referrals!"
4/26/2019,20190426,2,3.65,"I live near Oak Park and have ordered from this restaurant many morning before so I am very familiar with the ordering practices here. I always order grits when I am 20-25 minutes away. If I order something else, I make sure that I order 30-45 minutes in advance so that the food is ready upon my arrival. Today was a bit different and frustrating to say the least. I ordered grits only 25 minutes in advance and upon my arrival, the grits were not ready. I waited 15 MINUTES and asked the new hostess about the order and I was told ""she's (the manager) packing everything up together"". I was confused as I only had 1 item but noticed that there were other people waiting for their food as well. Another 5 minutes passed and by this time I am late for work and frustrated because it does not take this long for grits to be put in a large bowl and bagged up. When the manager I'm assuming came out with everyone's order there was no ""thank you so much for your patience or sorry for any delays, etc."", I went over to see if I could see my bag with my 1 item in there and the manager said to me in an undesirable tone, ""did she cash you out already?"" Imagine my facial expression and my disgust when she did not apologize for the delay but instead asked me in a nasty tone had I paid. I waited an additional 20 minutes and this is what you say to me? I am very frustrated with this establishment and torn because they have really good food but the customer service many patrons receive is horrible and very cliché for black owned businesses. I hate to say that because I support my own but you have to do better and stop scheduling 1 server and 1 hostess to work. Needless to say, my grits were AMAZING."
4/28/2019,20190428,2,3.64,Very slow...workers have no sense of urgency.waited an hour to be seated then an hour for our food. A group of people walked out after waiting an hour and a half. Would give the food 8/10 but the portions are skimpy. Shrimp and grits came with 4 shrimp on top of grits. Catfish dish with 2 small pieces of catfish.
5/4/2019,20190504,1,3.64,"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend and was sadly disappointed. The quality of the service was poor. We waited 45 minutes at the bar for breakfast food and when the food finally came out it was cold (Southern Benedict and steak and eggs). The service was very unorganized and very slow, seating and food delivery needs some improvements. Please work on order and process improvements within this organization. The servers keep their attitudes in check but they need to work providing faster and quality service. This review is intended to help them become a better establishment not bash."
5/5/2019,20190505,3,3.63,"Well I will not be back,I had not been here since it opened and although it was good then I was hoping for even better now. Well not so ,six shrimp in the shrimp and grits and their not creamy cheesy grits. The duck bowl was all potatoes and 1slice duck bacon with cheese and the Peaches special wasn't. The peach coffee is still very good. I just won't be back. I try to support black business, but I still want good food and nice portions for the price."
5/5/2019,20190505,2,3.63,"The food is decent but the customer service leaves much to be desired. This is not my first time having an issue. I called in a carry out order. I was told it would be a 20 minutes and I even gave them an extra 10 minutes. My order was not ready and in fact I was informed I would have to wait an additional 10 minutes. So when it was all said and done I waited almost an hour in total. Service can truly ruin a restaurant and not make you want to come back I don't care how good the food is, it's just not worth it to me. Oh to be fair they did apologize."
5/12/2019,20190512,5,3.63,"Amazing coffee. Delicious food. It's worth a wait. I've been here a few times, and will defnitely be coming back again. Also, I love that they have their coffee for you to buy and take home. I always grab a bag to go. It is incredible iced at home."
6/4/2019,20190604,5,3.64,Everything was great-over stuffed my self sampling but I got a nice takeout container. Perfect brunch
6/18/2019,20190618,5,3.64,"LATOYA ( I sincerely hope I am spelling that correctly) is an extreme delight. She has a full knowledge of the menu, a beautiful smile and warming personality. I haven't received my food yet but I will be back to let you know how that was.So I ordered the steak and eggs with French toast. R everything was cooked perfectly. For price point the quality was par for the course. Although, I would have enjoyed a more hefty piece of meat. A FRIEND AND I ONLY SPENT $40.95 - he got the catfish, greens and grits! A must if you're in Chicago!"
6/18/2019,20190618,5,3.64,Good food good location may have to wait depending on time you go. This is my 2nd time eating here brought some friends and they enjoyed it as well shrimp n grits with duck bacon is the bomb.. Tried the biscuits and was not disappointed
6/19/2019,20190619,4,3.64,"Neighborhood diner, community feel. Nothing crazy -- go in, grab a table or sit at the bar. As a fan of diners, I'm a fan of Peach's Restaurant.We went for breakfast, both of us had omelettes -- no problem there. Could have used more frequent coffee refills but that isn't a reason to dislike Peach's. Would go again."
7/5/2019,20190705,1,3.64,"It's Ant Season at Peaches, y'all!! ~ Tiffany, the manager.My preference would be a zero for management. However, that's not possible via Yelp. Sooo, I have to enlighten people via the review. My mother and I stopped in for brunch. Dontae, the greeter, was exceptional; Shawn, our server, was hospitable. If you grew up under the helm of real southern cooks who whipped up all things from scratch, you WILL NOT be impressed with the fare at this establishment: the chicken was fried soft and wasn't quality chicken, overall; the french toast tasted as though it had been frozen -- not fresh. The grits were fine, thankfully.At some juncture my mother noticed a congregation of ants on one side under our booth. A prior occupant of the booth had dropped a morsel of food, and the ants had eagle-eye vision and was on it. We'd received our food, so I was reticent to move. We simply just edged a bit more toward the edge of our booth and completed our meal. The ants weren't interested in us, however it was a disgusting spectacle to have witnessed during our meal.After we received our bill, my mother, who is a senior citizen, asked our server if we could be compensated for the inconvenience of the congregation of ants partying off to one side under the table.He was flummoxed by this simple request which bothered me. He should have felt comfortable apologizing and offering at least 10% or so off of the meal. I've worked in customer service before. A solid establishment will give you agency and trust your judgement to the extent where he should have felt comfortable in offering something small for the inconvenience.He ran off to get the manager. In her sistah-girl glory, she came swooping in with her implacable stone-scripted face and condescending tone.Same question posed to her: what concessions can you make for our inconvenience?Remember, she's speaking to my mother, who is a senior citizen.First error.She offered ZERO apology. Second error.Condescension.""We could have moved you""... (Really, we could have moved ourselves, Einstein.)Third Error.Making mindless excuses.""IT'S ANT SEASON"" (Really?!? This is a manager telling patrons of a FOOD establishment it's ant season, and basically stating there was nothing she could do about the ants. MMmmmm.. try again. This time, Tiffany, don't even reference pests, at all...)Fourth and HUGEST Error perpetrated by Tiffany.Disrespecting an elder.My mother was calm and reasonable. This manager showed zero respect toward my mother, nor did she actively listen to what my mother was saying. She came with the stone-face of disregard and held onto it tightly throughout the brief interlude. If she'd had proper training in hospitality anywhere, she would have apologized and at the least offered my mother a senior discount.Tiffany is EXTREMELY unprofessional and insulted our intelligence. You never know who you're talking to or dealing with. She's probably the reason this establishment can't eek out a 4-star rating. There are plenty more places to sit and not be amidst bugs and stank managerial attitudes. You have no respect for your elders, Tiffany; I have no intention of returning for sub-par fare and lackluster management. We have deep, deep roots in Bronzeville: I live in Bronzeville; my mother lives in Bronzeville; and my brother lives in Bronzeville. I attend church in Bronzeville, too. We won't be back. Chicken and Waffles is less than one mile north of this location. Head there for breakfast or brunch. While I enjoyed my coffee at Peach's, I can do without the management style of Tiffany and her lack of respect for her elders."
7/8/2019,20190708,2,3.63,"OMG!! I sooooo wanted to love this place The CHI is one of my favorite cities in the country and I absolutely love breakfast food. The location is great, the decor is adorable but oh LAWD, the 40min wait time to be seat irritated me. Once seated it took another 40-45min to get our food; our server never came to ask if we needed a refill on our beverages or if we needed anything. And after being in Peach's for 2 hours our food finally comes out and the order is wrong . The food was ok-your typical bacon, eggs & grits-nothing spectacular. Service can affect EVERYTHING! Hope things improve because it definitely has potential"
7/13/2019,20190713,2,3.63,"THE SERVICE IS BAD AND THE MANAGER NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!!!! I just run a 5K I wanted to come and have celebratory breakfast with my kids. When the food came they serve the kids first ok cool. When my side order of wings came it had sauce on them and I told them sauce on the side ok simple mistake take it back and I will eat my steak and eggs. But when they bought my steak and eggs, the steak was still red on the inside I order well done even my waitress agreed that ain't look right so they took it back. They mess up both of my orders so I had nothing to eat while my kids ate. So by the time they bought my wings back my kids who are young had finish eating 10 minutes ago. I had to ask four times to gets some lemon for my water. The staff did not apologize for the mix up and the manager on duty July 13, 2019 working at 10:30am did not stop by the table at all. When it was time to pay at the counter I ask to speak to the manger to tell her about my experience the lady at the counter went to go get her. I WAITED THERE AT THE COUNTER FOR 15 MINUTES TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER AND SHE NEVER CAME TO THE FRONT COUNTER. So I ask the lady at the counter to get the manager again and that's when she told me the manager was the lady over there. I thought the lady was in the back or something the manager had been on the floor the whole time and never walked to the counter to see what I wanted. I watch her socialize with patrons at the bar and just stand around. So I'm like let me get this straight I had to wait twice for my order and I have to wait more than 15 minute just to talk to a manager who never came to see what I wanted and she had time too. I seen her just standing behind the bar. So I paid and left and with that so did the catering breakfast event I was going to have Peachers do but nope!!! The manager just lost you another customer I see she has a few complaints on here. You can not reward bad service with your business."
7/16/2019,20190716,4,3.63,"I really loved coming across this restaurant! It was right on the way to the science and industry museum- but what really got us was the gluten free pancakes!!My daughter loved them I had the duck bowl- duck bacon, Potatoes, spinach, sautéed onions and peppers, cheese and an egg on top!It was a great serving size.The staff were very friendly, and the vibe was excellent. I would definitely return. I will definitely return The reason I didn't give them five stars is that there was a new waitress helping us, and it took longer than we had anticipated. I'm not sure how fast service normally is. The place was packed. Regardless- give this place a chance!"
7/31/2019,20190731,2,3.63,"My family (5 people) and I decided to come here for breakfast. With no one waiting before us we had to wait 20 minutes before being seated. People were being seated before us who came in after us and when we caught the attention of the host she told us that the manager wanted to seat us so that's why the wait took so long. When we were seated all the manager did was place down the menus tell us our server would be out and she left. One would assume she wanted to introduce herself to use after making us wait so long for an available seat but she didn't. It was nothing different than what the host could have done. She did not seem like she wanted to be bothered honestly. It took 20 minutes for the waitress who was named Raven to come and take out orders. My mom and grandmother ordered the Peaches Special, my youngest sister ordered the catfish, greens, and grits and my baby sister ordered the chicken and French toast. I ordered the French toast with peach bourbon compote on the side. It took 35 minutes for our food to come and when it did she only gave 2 people at most their food at a time so between that time until everyone at our table received their food it took 10 additional minutes. My mom and grandmothers grits were nasty and clumpy, the eggs were specifically requested to be medium done and they were so hard two of my family members were unable to eat them. They expected nice fluffy cheese eggs and instead they received eggs with shredded cheese sticking outside of the eggs! When they mentioned this to the waitress she said ""Yeah, I believe you did ask for medium done eggs."" but took no further initiative to resolve the error made from the error of the chef. My grandmother paid the additional charge for chicken sausage patties and that too was nasty! My youngest sisters catfish was fried too soft that the meat tore apart and my baby sisters chicken was fried so hard it black on the outside and inside. She couldn't eat it. The greens were just okay nothing spectacular to advertise as a meal in this establishment. Me and my sisters french toast was really good however I ordered pork sausages as a side and they were grotesque! Did not taste like sausages. My side of breakfast potatoes were delicious with the green peppers and onions. What was another turn off is that they don't have whipped butter. Most restaurants will bring out butter for pancakes, waffles and french toast that's usually whipped butter but instead I had to use the little packages of butter that is mostly reserved for toast! The establishment itself could use a lot of work on the inside as the decor looks tacky and is confusing. They have an old stove with a magazine rack and sticker decals with paintings that do not compliment what they're trying to say or represent as their brand. I'm assuming a black owned restaurant and as a black woman I can appreciate that but based on what I experienced today I had a very disappointing experience. Overall, I suggest a new cook, better waitresses who enjoy their job and who provide better service. I believe this businesses intention for their brand is differentiation with the peach coffee and peach bourbon French toast but all I got was low cost leadership and bad service. Let's do better because this restaurant is OVERPRICED with McDonald's like service."
8/6/2019,20190806,3,3.62,"I read the mixed reviews so I was hesitant. The biggest complaint that I read was about wait times, so I had another nearby restaurant as my plan B. I walked in & was greeted by the hostess. She explained that there was 30 minute wait for a table but because I was alone I had the option of eating at the bar area. I chose the latter. My server, Elaina, was very attentive. It took me no time to order & my food came shortly after. Anything I needed, she was there to provide. Now about the food. I ordered the ""Fresh Prince Omelette"". Which was supposed to be stuffed with chicken breast, onions, green peppers, & provolone cheese. The green peppers & onions must have been virtual, because I didn't see ANY. The chicken was so dry that the cheese didn't help. The omelette accompaniments was pancakes & hash browns. I chose the duck bacon as my breakfast meat. Pancakes tasted like they were a store brand. The duck bacon reminded me of turkey bacon. I was underwhelmed. The hash browns were ok. As my beverage, I chose the peach coffee. The coffee was very smooth. Overall, the food was mediocre at best. The coffee was delightful. My server made my experience worthwhile."
8/8/2019,20190808,4,3.62,It's a neighborhood favorite of mines. Several dishes I like here. Healthy portions and seasoned well. I often go alone and sit at the bar to get in and out quickly!
8/11/2019,20190811,4,3.63,"This place has a really homey feeling. It felt like I was in the south visiting my family when I walked in. I was a little confused as to why there was a wait to be seated when there were open tables though. The food was DELICIOUS. I ordered the duck bowl which had duck bacon,house potatoes, sweet peppers, onions, and spinach. It was also topped with an egg. I also had a side order of French toast. The food was fresh and hot. I will say it did take a while for the order to leave the kitchen which I didn't like because I was VERY hungry. The service was good. She checked on us frequently. Overall, I loved this place. I plan to return in the future. I gave them 4/5 stars because I had to wait longer than I expected for my food."
8/17/2019,20190817,5,3.63,This is a late post but I had the most amazing shrimp and cheese grits. I also had the salmon croquette as a side. I loved a spoon full that I ate. The staff was so nice and friendly. The young lady that was assist our table was so helpful in giving recommendations for my brother and sister who could not make up their minds. I know I will be coming back again.
8/17/2019,20190817,2,3.63,"Took my mother here for Mother's Day and they were busy like any place else. Took about 45 minutes to get our food. The waiter forgot to put an order in for a side of grits. Those didn't come until I was halfway done with my meal only to find a hair in them. For a first time visit, I was highly disappointed. Def won't be back."
8/17/2019,20190817,2,3.62,"I had high hopes, they were quickly dashed. I was willing to look past a few small errors but when they messed up my order TWICE! I was more than done. There are too many other options..."
9/8/2019,20190908,2,3.62,"Stopped here for breakfast and lets just say I was not pleased. The server was pleasant. However, the food was edible but not tasty, and maybe because I was hungry I ate it. Ordered the steaks and eggs and pancakes. Steak and potatoes were cold, eggs were bland. Pancake came out after I reminded her that I was supposed to have it with my order. Worse pancakes I've ever had. Will not be back. Cute place though. By the way, my sista friend's food came out 15 minutes after I completed my meal."
9/8/2019,20190908,1,3.61,"Service is horrible!!!! I walked in here at 10:40 am. 90% of the tables were empty! Told us there'd be a 20 minute wait...we waited 30 minutes! Then they had the audacity to seat people that came in after us! I haven't even had the food yet! The explanation for the lousy service? ""We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen..."" There needs to be some serious changes if they plan to survive! I'm gonna cross my fingers that the food makes up for this unacceptable service."
9/16/2019,20190916,1,3.6,"Peaches is a great local breakfast restaurant. We enjoy the shrimp and grits, their palmer tea and other tasty items.Unfortunately we are very unhappy with our recent experience and the lack of service we experienced. We are not sure we will go back again.We visited on a Sunday afternoon at 2:20pm. The restaurant closes at 3pm. We were seated and then waited for a waitress. This took about 10 minutes. The waitress asked us if we wanted something to drink and we told her. We got not water or silverware. We waited, and waited. I told my wife I should get the waitress and she said we should wait. All other tables around us were getting service and their orders.At around 2:50pm, the waitress (who I found out is also the manager) came to our table with my drink, not my wife's and no silverware. She asked us what we wanted to order and then went away. We waited, and waited. I told my wife I should get the waitress and she said we should wait. At 3:20pm the waitress came back and said that they were out of what we ordered and do we want to order something else. At that point we decided to leave. This situation was very unfortunate and are not sure why this unpleasentness happened. We will not go back, nor recommend it to others."
9/21/2019,20190921,4,3.6,"The PROs: friendly staff, nice decor/ambiance, unique menu items such as duck bacon, shrimp grits, wild salmon omelette, and peach coffee. Food was hot and fresh! I had the biscuits and gravy with were the BOMB and best I ever had; would definitely eat those again! The peach French toast was also delicious and the duck bacon was good!Cons: cheesy grits don't taste like cheese at all ‍ were pretty bland. My friends had The fried chicken, while it was hot & crispy, it didn't have much flavor. The crab croquet was a little dry. The shrimp grits were about 3 stars because the grits were bland and can't taste the cheese but the shrimp & bacon topping was flavorful & good! Conclusion: I would come again. I believe in supporting local businesses. I would keep trying different menu items to find the best ones :)"
9/21/2019,20190921,1,3.6,"Great food but awful customer service. No one told us how long the wait would be, and no one talk to us either. When I asked about the wait after 30 minutes of already waiting with 4 kids, we were told it doesn't work like that and we'd need another 30 minutes to get seated. No apologies, just a blank stare followed by an eye roll! Horrible horrible customer service! I was hoping to enjoy brunch at peaches but that's never gonna happen again! If you want to save time and not wait forever for food and also have a great meal, go somewhere else and spend your $$ where it's valued!"
9/29/2019,20190929,4,3.6,"I HAD to make my way to Peach's by the way people were raving about the peach bourbon french toast. I didn't know about anything else on the menu (but I am a french toast fan so that's all I needed). Sadly, the french toast didn't live up to the hype I was hearing. I thought the batter would've had a peach flavor to really give it a special boost, however, I got what any other restaurant would give... Regular french toast with a side of Peach Bourbon sauce/compote. Not super extravagant to me. Still had good flavor! The peaches could've been a little more fresh to bring out the flavor but the bourbon glaze was delicious! I didn't leave overly full and stuffed which was fine with me. The portion was good enough for you to enjoy and eat other meals during the day. The best part of my meal was the eggs, bacon and potatoes LOL. I may have to pair pancakes with that next. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, nice restaurant space so there's minimal crowding and there's enough seating in the waiting area for large parties. I will visit again."
9/29/2019,20190929,1,3.59,"If I could give less stars they would so deserve it. Empty tables long waiting. Employees act like they don't see you. Totally disrespectful, obviously poor management. Not worth your time or money!!!"
10/19/2019,20191019,1,3.59,This place is a joke. We waited for 2 1/2 hours for food. They messed up half our orders. The serving sizes were tiny. They were out of 4 different dishes. Did not offer to comp anything. They weren't even busy. Took 4 hours total. Dont waste your time or money.
10/21/2019,20191021,1,3.58,"This is usually one of my favorite places for breakfast since their opening. I order two eggs soft scrambled regular grits plain toast buttered and a fruit cup. The waitress who was very pleasant brought me dry toast and a cup of grits, no eggs. She indicated the grill was behind. There was approximately 4 tables occupied. So while I'm waiting for the eggs and fruit cup I ask for a plate. The plate I received was dirty. While waiting for everything to come together the grits and toast are now cold. When the eggs arrive I could see they had been cooked on a dirty grill and the fruit cup is clearly not fresh. What is going on???? It's time for management to reassess the plan."
10/21/2019,20191021,3,3.58,"Meh. I really wanted some Shrimp and Grits this morning and decided to try out this place. While they were flavored nicely, I did not order shrimp and grit soup. I'm accustomed to be able to eat my shrimp and grits with a fork. I basically drank these. The flavor is there, just need some ummppphh in the grits. I have eaten from here before which is why I gave the 3 stars. For $35 ( I ordered some for my friend) I expected so much more."
10/22/2019,20191022,2,3.57,"Pro- this was not my first visit, the staff is polite and welcoming.This is normally one of our favorite breakfast spots to go to. We brought a visiting family member with us and were sorely disappointed. Con- the wait and the quality of the food. It was a Saturday afternoon, about a 40 min wait (which is okay and expected on a Saturday, when the service and food are exceptionally great). This day, it was not worth the wait, they ran out of biscuits and waited about 30 minutes after we ordered to tell us they were gonna swap it for Texas toast. It came out with regular flattened bread, visibly not ""Texas toast"". The salmon croquets were not warm or cooked on the inside and burned on one side. The cheese grits were bleak, no cheese flavor at all. I order the same thing each time I come, it was not the same rich taste as before- change in chef? The shrimp and grits looks like it was scooped from the bottom of a pot of gumbo and slipped on a mound of grits. We were told they were prioritizing the phone orders and that caused a delay. The visit had disappointment after disappointment, we tried to be understanding- but not eager to refer or bring anyone here again."
11/9/2019,20191109,1,3.57,"So I usually don't do this, but Peaches is nasty. I asked for a Salmon Croquet everyone's food came no croquet. Waitress (Shavon) said they don't have a salmon croquet ok that was strike 1. Then she ask what else would I like they bring these mystery meat suppose to be chicken patties that look like hog head cheese but they come up in like 1 minute. So now I'm like I don't want these either. The party I was with food was cold we asked for the manager. Here we go so here comes the manager talking about they work with the community and today is a bad day. Huh you say what.. I ask to have the mystery chicken sausage removed and she said but you ordered it. I said I didn't eat it and how was it able to come out so fast. Oh and did I forget to mention it was a 30 minute wait and they had empty tables why are we waiting. So listen my advice is to go down the street to Chicago chicken and waffles and have good food and nice management. And to the manager Abby you should enroll in management classes and have a better approach to paying customers. I rate peaches a -10 and will make sure I tell everyone who will listen. It's nasty, and their slow cause remember they work with the community ..‍"
11/10/2019,20191110,1,3.56,"Today I went to Peach's Restaurant to have breakfast with my brother & three of his friends for his birthday before the Chicago Bears game today at noon. We got there at 10 am., there was a wait; which was fine. My party of 5, was told we were on a 5-10 minute wait; which turned into 45 as the host's continued to seat others as they walked in. As we were sat the server told us the kitchen was on a 20 minute delay; which was fine, but that 20 minute delay turned into a 40 minute delay. Only saw my waitress once beyond her taking our order & that was to see if our food came out & before we would say anything to her, she speedily walked away & then the best part, literally each entree of ours came out cold. Wasn't worth the verbal complaint due to being on a time limit, but definitely do not recommend this place at all. As a server myself, I do not appreciate the service."
11/12/2019,20191112,4,3.56,Alright! We made it! This is like my 83839th time here and I always forget to review this spot. It is black owned! So that's an automatic 1.5 star..‍I've had the peaches French toast and that shit fire if you like sweets (but it ain't too sweet). The peaches coffee is unique and I don't like the taste of coffee but it worksI just wish they had more food options. The vibe is great! Music is A1! Great brunch date!All the duck stuff is bangin too...shit weird eating duck but it's good maneI wish they had mimosas. That's all.
11/12/2019,20191112,5,3.56,Super delicious. Peach bourbon compote is amazing. Best fired chicken and the salmon coquettes are very delicious too. Fast service nice atmosphere.
11/16/2019,20191116,5,3.57,"A neighborhood staple, peaches is the perfect place for a quaint, southern-style breakfast.Bring an appetite and of course bring a friend. I had the salmon croquettes resting on top of cheese grits along with a side of greens and top it off with peach flavored coffee, which was a treat in itself.I ate at the bar so I didn't have to wait for a table. The atmosphere is chatiw but friendly, service was quick and painless and the staff is a definite Delight.I also have to remark that this is my first review on Yelp because as of this weekend I am no longer a Yelp employee. Employees can't leave reviews because of conflicts of interest oh, so I'm excited to be able to leave this post for you to read and enjoy."
11/21/2019,20191121,5,3.57,came here with a friend and there was a wait but it was worth it. i tried the duck bacon and it was very tasty i like the area and it wasnt hard to get to since its right near the train. only got an entree and it was very filling but next time i'll save room for dessert
11/24/2019,20191124,5,3.58,"Peach's is supportive of the community and works hard to hire our youth, train them and serve great food. Check them out as a destination and experience and leave pleasantly surprised. Take home a bag of Peach's coffee locally roasted by Stivers Coffee."
11/25/2019,20191125,2,3.57,"The attitude of 1 server or manager called it all into question for me. Went with friends and several items that were ordered were seemingly forgotten. No worries, I'll just bring it up. My friend didn't want it any longer just cancel the item and permit us to check out. I don't fault him for wanting to eat all his breakfast items together and I didn't blame the lady for her initial response but then she felt inclined to speak on it some more... Weirdly aggressive. Like, she said she'll get the item out. He said no thank you. I don't want it. She said well I didn't know about the problem before. He said.. Yeah, I know you didn't I'm just explaining that I don't want it any longer. It was like she was out to prove something that didn't need proving. My catfish was seasoned well but the greens were horribly unflavored and the fish too fishy. Their wings are nice. Everybody seemed to enjoy the grits that made it to the table. What was forgotten: 2 cans of Coke, a cheese grit, regular grit and toast. I think something else but it's a week later and I forgot. After that whole exchange at the table ... I opted not to by my parent a bag of peach flavored coffee. I'd return if others want to go but it's not my top choice as I don't care for breakfast. Oh, the place appears clean and good diversity in the staff."
11/29/2019,20191129,2,3.57,"A group of four of us went here this morning for a nice morning-after-thanksgiving breakfast. We were seated very promptly and were greeted by some lovely staff! We got our coffee, Peach's blend. The table wasn't too impressed. It had some fruity notes (which we should have guessed it would have), but it just didn't hit the spot. After our first cup of coffee, unfortunately our service went downhill. We had to flag down a server to get refills on our coffee, and one of the guests never got their toast. (And it wasn't even crowded!) The food was unfortunately also a big let down after it seemed to take far too long for it to come out to us (let me just say, my grits were cold and congealed). My partner and I split the peach bourbon french toast and the salmon croquets on cheese grits. The croquets were alright (4/5 with the tartare sauce), nice and crispy and pretty well filled with salmon. The grits were really unfortunate considering it was my first time trying grits. Based off of this experience, I wouldn't try them again :(The peach bourbon French toast was alright, the peach topping was a star and had good flavor, but the French toast itself was just plain Jane. Nothing special, nothing to call home about. So overall, just a really disappointing meal. And based off of everything I knew about this business, I really wanted to like it. Sorry Peach's."
12/7/2019,20191207,3,3.57,"I'm not sure if it was just an off Sunday or not, but it didn't fulfill the hype. The eggs were yellow, like too yellow. The food wasn't warm enough. The service was good which is why they have 3 stars. But I'm not sure I'll return. I believe it's worth a try because everyone's take away could be different."
12/8/2019,20191208,3,3.56,"Visited with a group of four. Most of had shrimp and grits. While the dish was good, for the price it should have had more than 3 medium shrimp. Service was excellent"
12/12/2019,20191212,5,3.57,Tried Peaches for the first time today and it was AMAZING!!! it's very clean and service was great! The food is SO SO SO SO SO GOOOOOOD!! It came out hot and quick! THE BISCUITS are perfect!literally PERFECT!! Every part of my experience was great and I can't wait to go back again and again
12/14/2019,20191214,1,3.56,I waited almost 2 hours for my food and it still did not come in. Received a refund. The place was not even busy. I have no idea what they do but work isn't one of them...Never going back and not recommending
12/20/2019,20191220,4,3.56,"This place has really good food. Although we had to wait awhile for our food it was still good and hot. Highly recommend the peach coffee, peach Palmer, duck bacon and shrimp and grits. The grits were extremely hot and had very good taste to it."
12/20/2019,20191220,1,3.56,My girlfriend and I ate here and had the worst service. We got seated quickly and took our coffee and food orders but barely saw our waitress. I asked for a coffee refill a she took forever bringing me some and when I got it it wasn't even hot smh. The food took foreverrrrrr to come to the table and it wasn't even all that. Do better.
12/23/2019,20191223,3,3.56,"Came here for breakfast while killing time before an appointment in the city. The establishment is pretty roomy, with about 10 tables, a section for larger groups and a pretty long breakfast bar. Since I was dining alone, I opted to sit at their breakfast bar. I grabbed a menu that had been left behind and sat myself. It took about 5 minutes for someone to come over and acknowledge me, but she was really friendly and had assumed I was waiting on someone else as there was another menu next to me. She took my order and offered reassurance in the choices I'd made. I ordered the shrimp and grits, substituting turkey bacon for the pork bacon, a side order of a salmon croquette, and tried their bacon each brewed coffee. The salmon croquette had a light crisp coating to it and came with what looked like a remoulade sauce. The shrimp were tail on (which I find a little annoying in dishes like this), the grits were creamy, and the turkey bacon was soft and cut into strips. The grits came with Texas toast which looked pretty good, but my appetite wasn't big enough to try. I also tried the peach coffee which was pretty good. The peach wasn't overwhelming at all, it was more of a subtle undertone. Overall, the experience was nice and the food wasn't bad at all, just nothing that stood out especially."
12/23/2019,20191223,4,3.56,Please hire more staff so I can come back! Food is great but the service is just too slow.
12/28/2019,20191228,1,3.55,"First impression is always a lasting impression ! I've always driven past this restaurant however I was at the Original Pancake House it was packed as usual, so this couple came in an they said they were going to Peaches. They said the food was good, I followed them to the restaurant. Upon arriving I checked In, just me. I arrived at 12:56 pm and waited almost a half hour before I noticed their was a counter so I asked if that was available and why when I checked in the greeter didn't give me that option since I was alone. So I'm seated at the counter and I was offered coffee and water and someone finally took my order. I'm waiting another 30min, I asked the server to check on how long before my food is ready, she never came back! I decided to leave and spoke to the manager about it, she said it takes 35-40 min for breakfast. They're half the size of Original Pancake house and less customers... I try to patronize community establishments however the service is awful!!"
12/30/2019,20191230,2,3.55,"When this establishment first open, I truly enjoyed the food. Today I went after not being in for some time and the service was pathetic and the food was so-so. We waited absurdly long for food and my coffee to be refilled. They need new or better management."
12/31/2019,20191231,1,3.54,"We've been coming to Peach's since we moved to Bronzeville over 3 years ago, and it used to be our absolute favorite breakfast place in the area. The food, particularly the shrimp and grits was always a hit. The service hardly ever lacked. And the feel of the place was welcoming and organized. I must say that in the past 6 months to a year everything has taken a serious nose dive. First, the food has gotten just ok! There will be times we come in and the shrimp and grits are just like we remember; and there will be times, more often, that they are lacking the flavor and consistency we've come to enjoy about them. The service is confusing and unorganized. They make patrons wait to be seated even though there are lots of empty tables. They seem to be understaffed and the staff present seems a bit undertrained. This review is mainly for the owner to understand that you have a real neighborhood gem and if you continue to let it fall by the wayside, more regulars like us will discontinue their patronage and find a place with more consistency and care. -A Bronzevillian"
1/7/2020,20200107,5,3.54,"Though the establishment wasn't what I envisioned it to be, the food DIDN'T disappoint me at all. I ordered 'Shrimp and Grits' and some peach coffee and it was definitely EVERYTHING I thought it would be. The service was EXTREMELY SLOW but I think it was because they were short handed that particular day. Overall it was a great experience, I would definitely be back."
1/24/2020,20200124,1,3.54,"I went in Peaches and there were only a few people in there. They set you right away, however after that the service was slow. It took awhile for the coffee to come. When the meal came they got my egg order wrong. I ordered lemonade I had to keep asking for it at least three times before I got it. When we were done we did not see the waitress to get our bill. I had to try and get her attention. The food was OK but nothing to brag about. I have gone there three times and the first time it was not good. I went back another time and it was better. This time it was not good and I will not go back again. I am so sorry because it is close to me."
1/27/2020,20200127,3,3.54,"After reading several reviews and seeing some amazing food pictures I was excited to visit. Sadly to say It was a total disappointment. I love breakfast, and I go crazy for some good shrimp and grits. Today I have very few words for the shrimp and grits I had. Very tasteless and unattractive. My friend had omelette and potatoes also a disappointment. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because:1. The Peach Coffee was a hit2. The Peach french toast was tasty3. The customer satisfaction was A1"
2/14/2020,20200214,5,3.54,"You know those restaurants that you visit in cities far away from your hometown, yet when you walk in somehow you feel right at home? That's how it feels walking into Peach's.Let me set the scene: Anita Baker - I Apologize is playing on the radio softly, a waitress with a warm smile says she'll be right with you and a woman from the neighborhood chilling inside compliments your hair. How can you not fall in love with a place like this?Peach's is one of many recommendations I gained from one of my Instagram followers while visiting Chicago last week. I was told to go here for breakfast and I must say, it was a great way to start my last full day in the city.Crispy chicken, warm grits, biscuits n' gravy lovin' is what you get when you visit here. I've had my fair share of shrimp and grits, so I went with the 'Fried Chicken' dish, which consists of fried chicken wings with cinnamon french toast and sweet honey butter. Eating the chicken dipped in spicy hot sauce with the french toast sweetness combined was true southern love at first bite. Their chicken is fresh, crispy and cooked to order. Full of flavor and it came out with smoke still coming from it! The french toast is soft, airy and cinnamon sweet.Service is awesome; this particular day only maybe 2-3 tables were filled, but the waitress never missed a beat. She was super nice and made sure each table was assisted, never hesitating to pass by during your meal with a ""You enjoying everything?"" Enjoyment is an understatement. If Peach's was someplace in Louisiana, Georgia or Alabama, it would most definitely be known as a southern staple. But since we aren't nearly as fortunate as Chicago is to have one, its definitely a black business staple in this community. I assure you, the next time I touch down in Chicago, my beloved Peach's and I will meet yet again."
2/16/2020,20200216,4,3.54,"I had a great experience with great food. We arrived at around 11:30am on a Saturday, the hostess couldn't give us an approximate wait time, but we were seated within about 20-25 mins. There was plenty waiting room area so it went by quickly. I was looking forward to ordering either the salmon croquettes or the biscuit which is served with a peach bourbon compote. Our server notified us after mentioning these items that they were out as it had been a busy morning. We were disappointed, and ended up ordering the shrimp and grits which were delicious. The grits were creamy and had the perfect amount of cheese, and the shrimp was seasoned well.. my only complaint is that I only had 3 shrimp. I substituted the regular bacon for duck bacon, great choice as it was unlike any thing else I've tasted, it had a nice texture and taste. They did forget to bring us the sides of house potatoes ordered but when they did come they were flavorful and cooked perfectly. The peach's Palmer was a great blend of lemonade, tea and the peach flavor. I do think they need more staff to work, as it was clear the servers were overwhelmed.. though they did the best they could. Thank you Peach's for such tasty food!"
3/6/2020,20200306,5,3.54,Outstanding service and my servicer Eric is the best.I am a King-ager and baby they treat you right here. They got Senior Day- I love them for that.
3/8/2020,20200308,2,3.54,"3 of us went to Peach's at about noon. We have been there about half dozen times since Peach's opened and we were expecting to eat lunch. We did eat but this review is about the lousy experience at that lunch.  To cut to the chase... they had: No greens (the server said the chef said they were still frozen)No shrimp (seriously?)No ice tea (WHY??)No waffles (the server said that they either need a new menu or a new wafflemaker) We were offered spinach in place of the greens and having no other choice we had the spinach - which was perfectly cooked. On the other hand, my catfish was greasy - as if it had been sitting and reheated? Which was confirmed when the server brought my friend's catfish (subbed for the absent shrimp) and said that HER fish had just come out of the fryer! The grits were clumpy (had been sitting?)My other friend's wings were tiny and overcooked.... again as if they had been sitting around.Another question I have for them is why there is no fresh half and half??? After asking, I was given those tiny little white cups of half&half and they curdled in my coffee. Do people really use those toxic little cups of Coffee Mate? You don't serve diet pop but Coffee mate is OK? It was noon... Peach's, if you're not going to serve lunch...don't. But don't run out of food and disappoint lunch customers like us."
5/13/2020,20200513,1,3.53,"We ordered two meals but only received one, mentioned it, the cashier got a lil snappy. The cook was already talking to them about having incorrect orders. The portion was small, too few shrimp for the price. Long story short we got a refund. It'll be a long while if at all before we go back, needless to say."
6/26/2020,20200626,4,3.54,My 1st experiencing at Peach's...although this Pandemic has prevented me from getting the full on dining experience- the staff was friendly and attentive and gave tip top curve side service lol . My partner and I got there a few minutes after 2 if I'm not mistaken they close at 3 so we were their last order of the day . I was allowed to enter the restaurant I can't recall the lady who took my order but she was pleasant. food was ready in 15mins . I had french toast served w/ caramelized peaches with the cheese grits. My partner had the wings which reports was an enjoyable experience.we will be back.
7/16/2020,20200716,5,3.54,"Food was EXCELLENT!! If you are a pancake person like me, you will love this place! With all of the social distancing due to COVID, the staff did a wonderful job with social distancing customers and providing excellent customer service for take out orders. Will definitely be back!"
8/23/2020,20200823,5,3.54,"I drove 20 minutes to peaches and I was not disappointed. My hubby & I ordered the salmon croquettes and grits along with the peach drink (sorry can't recall the name, but it is a mix of tea, peach flavoring & lemonade I think). Customer service here is outstanding. Staff are professional, polite, and wears their masks correctly, covering their nose & mouth which I am happy to see (incorrectly worn masks causes me to turnaround & walk out the door). I definitely recommend you visit this wonderful black owned restaurant."
9/22/2020,20200922,4,3.54,Love the food. Moderately priced. I've suggested people go here in the bronzeville community. Love the staff but management/owner needs to work on her customer service skills.
11/29/2020,20201129,5,3.55,I would like to acknowledged the exceptional service from Jabriea. She went out of her way to ensure I was well informed about the menu and made some great suggestions. I tried the peach coffee and gourmet peach French toast it was delicious.
11/30/2020,20201130,2,3.54,"First let me say I love the location and the idea of this southern style restaurant and I try to support small businesses. But there's a lot that needs to be done to improve service. I've been here at least 3 times in a span of a few years and there always a problem with the order. Something was undercooked, wait time is always forever, you have to flag down waitstaff or it's the wrong order. I love the shrimp and grits, duck bacon and peach cobbler. But with there always being an issue I don't see myself coming back here. I hope management can make improvements cause it really needs it. If you go here try to go during off peak hours and don't go when you are extra hungry."
12/1/2020,20201201,4,3.54,"We came here for carryout birthday brunch after workouts. We called and picked up peach bourbon french toast, salmon croquettes and grits, and biscuit. (I think for $16 grits dishes should come with pancakes/toast/biscuit like the big chains do, but the portions were a nice size. And yet..)The peach bourbon compote was AWESOME and the salmon/grits combo wasn't as odd as I thought. Everything was really good! The toast was crispy and thick, the grits were well seasoned and creamy. I'm happy to support black-owned/small businesses but this is a rare treat for me. I can do this maybe once a month, but it's a great way to break the routine, plus it can stretch into 2 meals and a snack!"
1/6/2021,20210106,5,3.55,I moved to the Bronzeville/Hyde Park/Kenwood area (I literally still don't know which neighborhood I live in haha) and the first place I ate at was Peach's. Oh. My. God. Peach's is so good!! I got the shrimp and grits with a peach iced tea and it was *chef's kiss* amazing.I would 100% recommend Peach's to anyone who wants a great bite in the neighborhood.
3/27/2021,20210327,2,3.54,"I really wish I could give a higher rating but my experience was unpleasant. I bought my family here to celebrate a birthday. Food came out 40 min late, my sisters (birthday) potatoes were burnt, kids didn't get meal & orange juice only got pancakes and my food didn't come out until it was time for us to leave. Waitress was very nice but the kitchen couldn't handle food for 6. It was a struggle to get them to change the receipt to get a refund on food that we did not receive. I can't give a rating based off food taste because I haven't had the opportunity to eat my food. I wasn't looking for a discount or anything but there was not any accountability for our experience. I'll likely won't be returning"
4/18/2021,20210418,5,3.55,"I see why Peach's Restaurant is the ""home of the cheese grits "". Everything was fresh, flavorful and delicious considering the fact I've ordered carry out. I've always wanted to come to this gem and definitely will come back. I've enjoyed the hangover plate and mind you I'm not intoxicated lol."
5/10/2021,20210510,5,3.55,If I could give this place 100 I could. Best brunch I've had in a long time. Best wings I've ever had! Please go support this black owned business--you will not be disappointed!!
6/13/2021,20210613,3,3.55,"Every time I am around someone who has not had Peach coffee and I know that they are a coffee drinkee... I have to bring them. The food is also pretty tasty. My biggest issue is the way the kitchen sends the food out. There is no way I should have sat for an hour after ordering food, watching ""to go"" orders constantly go out. This also comes after waiting 45 min to sit. Very frustrating. Our waitress seemed to understand our frustration. There needs to be a better management system, this behavior can cause waitresses/waiters to lose tips and also the business losing money. My guest was not as understanding and swore never to come back."
6/25/2021,20210625,5,3.55,"O.M.G I love this place. I came here to support a local business on Juneteenth. This place was comfy with a southern hospitality. I was greeted with warm smiles when I walked inside. I was a little hesitate at first but the host Monquette ease my feelings. I was seated by the window that gave me a nice view of the outside. I'm not a Big fan of anything peachy but let me tell you. The Peach Palmer is the bomb. She let me sample a taste and I was pleased with it. I ordered the catfish, greens, grits and pancakes. Everything was delicious and seasoned with some good flavors. Monquette was Superb her interaction with the guest were top notch. She was attentive to each person and made sure we were ok. I look forward to coming back again for some more southern food."
7/11/2021,20210711,1,3.55,"July 11,2021; 12:15 til shortly after 2:00. Wait list: 12:15 Seated @ 1:15Order taken @ 1:45 Partial food was bought out. I ordered scrambled cheese eggs; bacon and bourbon street French toast. I was given the bacon and eggs but with no cheese, initially. The older precedes to take my eggs away and brought them back with melted cheese on top. I never received my bourbon French toast. My daughter tried to give the waitress her order but the waitress suggested a special which my daughter ended up agreeing to have but it caused her to receive the original order before the suggested one. The service was horrible because it's being ran by a bunch of young and inexperienced people who are not being trained properly. I tried to support this business for a long time but it seems they have gotten much worse. I nor my family will be returning. I'll pray success over them and hope this post helps them, not hurt them."
7/18/2021,20210718,1,3.54,"I write this review out of all love. Let me first say I love peaches. I have been going to this black-owned and run business since its inception. I have most definitely seen it go through its growing pains but it was something that has always brought me back which was the food in the warm atmosphere. I live in uptown on Argyle and Sheridan, the drive to 47th and King drive is at least 40 mins but I still go to support. I want to see black businesses succeed. Let's cut to the point. I arrived at this space at 12:15 and didn't receive my food until 1:45. Being that it is still a pandemic the restaurant wasn't crowded. I ordered the chicken and toast with a side of eggs and house Potatoes with a coffee. I will note they where having a chicken wing Shortage and where serving boneless thigns which where just ok. I would suggest bone in thighs because it adds more flavor. The waitress never checked in to see if I wanted more coffee I had to ask for more and when it was brought back I sensed attitude. When the food finally arrived it was Lukewarm and the bread in the French toast felt like it was microwaved. My waitress didn't even remember to give me butter. The food wasn't good I would have complained about the quality but at that point, I just wanted to eat and leave. I have never eaten a meal and looked forward to the finish of it. Every bite felt like a chore. This meal was $25 and when looking at the 15% for the tip I asked myself what am I paying for? The most joy I got out of this experience was joking with the folks at the bar about the Terrible service and placing bets on how long their meals will take. I will end with this I have seen this restaurant in its stride so I know what the food is supposed to taste like. Get an effective cook and motivated staff to bring the soul back into the food. Restaurant service is a collective effort if one thing is off no one benefits. This must be done especially if this business is to survive. We are coming out of the pandemic folks are being very careful where they spend their funds. You must put in maximum efforts. I know this comes off harsh but I believe if you truly care you will do better."
7/24/2021,20210724,5,3.54,Exactly what I needed right when I needed it! Went to peaches after their morning rush (pretty much 1pm). We were at quickly. Our server recommended the peach Palmer and I was not disappointed. The shrimp and grits were really good. The catfish was amazing. Fried perfect! And the greens were ok. I was really really liking for some full leaf home cooked ones but I understand and wasn't disappointed because I really like greens lol. Otherwise great lunch.

9/1/2021,20210901,5,3.55,"As many times as I have been to Peach's I am surprised I have not written a review in a while. I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Food is always made with love and the staff is the best. The peach coffee adds a unique twist to the breakfast diner-style of this restaurant. Lately, I have been ordering for pick up and my food is always made within the window, it's hot, and fresh. I've tried almost everything they make and even though they got rid of the duck bowl, I love that their menu continues to evolve. I recently tried the 7up pancakes something I never knew I needed. This is why I keep coming back."
10/16/2021,20211016,5,3.55,"It is not often I post up 5 star review , but they deserve it! My daughter and I both got the Shrimp and grits which was about $16.95 but they gave us a generous amount and we both took home a doggie bag. I had the Peach Infused Coffee as well as the Peach and Lemonade Infused Tea and both were top notched and Im glad we gave the place a try.We watched as other dishes passed our table and we both looked at each other like oh yes we will be back.The prices are comparable to many other restaurants.The place was clean and it filled up quick and we were glad we got there early, because the place had a line.I wish I could remember our waitress's name she was an employee in training and I would have never known if she hadn't told us. She gave us just the right amount attention and with just one hiccup I would ask for her service each time.So yes I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to have a great family friendly breakfast and lunch spot.As always.....Enjoy and be Safe!"
11/28/2021,20211128,3,3.55,"NOW SELLING BEIGNETS!!!!!!! Damn, they are delicious too! Promoting them as donuts isn't doing this any Justice, in my opinion, your minimizing the awesomeness of this delectable item...Had to reduce my initial review from 5 states with the beignets to 3 with my entree of Fish and Shrimp, Tilapia & Chips - raw shrimp, 1 filet (2 in an order), cold fries."
12/5/2021,20211205,4,3.55,Very good food and service. Their menu offers some traditional savory and sweet soul food classic's that I definitely appreciated. Parking can be a challenge so keep that in mind.
3/9/2022,20220309,5,3.56,I absolutely love this place for brunch. The food here is fantastic. I got the shrimp and grits which were rich and creamy. We also got the peach French toast which was bomb too. It was decadent and they serve good size portions. The service was attentive and everything was great!!! I will definitely be back to Peach's!
5/4/2022,20220504,3,3.56,"This is an update to my last review of Peaches.I never review to harm; I only wanna see businesses grow and make better choices for their customers and overall company. I fell in love with Peach's when they were gaining momentum, and I believe they have the potential to get back there with a committed staff and influential cooks. I am happy to say after suggesting checking out Peach again, the meal and experience were a lot better. It wasn't too long of a wait. My family and I sat at the bar to avoid the 30 min wait, and we were waited on right away. I got my usual French toast and chicken; however, the wings were replaced with boneless chicken breast, which I wasn't expecting or excited about but was seasoned well and good. The food came out as cooked and wasn't long of a wait. My sister got the Salmon Croquettes & Grits and a Happy Biscuit which is always a joy. The peach coffee is still one of my favorites in this city. The wait staff was amicable and attentive, which helped the overall experience. This was a better experience, but I can feel the budget cuts. I want Peach to succeed, and I believe they have a chance if they continue to push out quality experiences. It's not just about the food but how you make people feel. My favorite restaurant, five loaves, shut down over the pandemic, and they were a tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant with so much love put into the people and food. I'd wait an hour to experience that. Peach had that energy, and I hope they continue to pursue that. 3 of 5"
5/14/2022,20220514,3,3.56,This restaurant used to be good but not now. It was not a very good breakfast. Don't see how you mess up a salmon patty in an AA neighborhood. No catfish on Friday in the hood. No No. will not return. My breakfast mate loved the flavored coffee though and the waitress was wonderful. Next time I will go somewhere else.
