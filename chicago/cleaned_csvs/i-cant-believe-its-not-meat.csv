4/7/2019,20190407,5,5.0,"The name speaks for itself. I had the ""Who Betta Burger"" I thought I was actually eating meat. This burger is delicious. If you're trying to wean yourself off of beef. Give this place a try. The burger was so good wished I'd ordered two. The experience was great. Friendly cashier, the owner was great and her mom gave me a big hug. Support them because the food is delicious."
4/9/2019,20190409,5,5.0,The absolute best no meat burger I've ever tasted! But mostly what won me over was the impeccable customer service from all of the people that worked there. Especially the mother of the owner! She was such a sweetheart that she would come and check on the people in line to ensure a warm experience and to give updates on wait times. I will definitely be back and I will spread the word of this most wonderful place!
4/14/2019,20190414,5,5.0,"Finally got the chance to try this place after passing by seeing tremendously long lines outside day after day. It was well worth the wait! I have been vegan for a few years now and I must say this place has had some of the best vegan food I've ever tasted! I had the pizza puff with vegan cheese and a philly cheese steak. The flavors took me back to my meat eating days when I could actually enjoy these types of things. The texture was also amazingly meat like, unlike vegan meat substitutes you'd find in most places. They also have dairy options available. If I could give it more stars I would, will be returning!"
4/15/2019,20190415,5,5.0,The food and service was excellent! I ordered The Who Betta burger and Cookie Monster shake - it was DELICIOUS and well worth the wait!! The beautiful staff was very friendly and accommodating! I can't wait to go back and try something different.
4/18/2019,20190418,3,4.6,"I like call myself a Flexatarian, leaning towards Vegetarianism. So I was so excited to see another vegetarian option in Hyde Park!After waiting 45 minutes for our meal, (sheesh!) the burger did have a delicious meat flavor that I enjoyed. But it's REALLY hard for me to justify paying $14 for ONLY a ""burger"" with no fries and/or soda! Really?My hubby did not like the taste or texture of the ""meat"" in the Pizza puff or Philly cheese steak.Will I support them again, maybe. But no time soon. I wish them well though!"
4/18/2019,20190418,5,4.67,The who betta burger is GOOD A+ but the regular fries is tooo pricey. its just a fries a regular fries.
4/19/2019,20190419,3,4.43,Ok so I finally got their hours right and decided to have lunch today... Walk in nice vibes music playing I order lasagna(you're given option of vegan cheese or dairy) I choose vegan. She says 35-40 minute wait I said ok...an hour goes by I ask about my order the cook says it's cooked fresh it's coming out the oven now. Ok.The food... It's not lasagna it's pasta or spaghetti with vegan cheddar with bowtie pasta! I HATE BOWTIE PASTA and it's not worth $16. Nothing Italian about it oh and not piping hot out of even either. I will have to give them another try but this was a fail.
4/19/2019,20190419,3,4.25,"Stopped in there today I had the pizza puff with diary cheese it was good. My friend got the Philly cheese steak, but she or I wasn't impressed. It wasn't much vegetables nor meat on there. They was very stingy with the quality size of the sandwich. The fries was not hot. Only took 25 mins for the order."
4/20/2019,20190420,5,4.33,I Ordered The Who Better Burger & Shake..... They Really Out Done Themselves.. Awesome Job. FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.4,"I had the opportunity to visit and order some food from this restaurant today. I was not disappointed. I ordered the watta burger. It was so good. The seasoning and preparation of this meatless burger was outstanding. If you are in the Hyde Park area in Chicago area looking for a vegan restaurant, this is it. This is a carryout restaurant only."
4/23/2019,20190423,4,4.36,Was good but very small portions giving but good cheat for vegans especially alkaline vegans
4/25/2019,20190425,5,4.42,"As someone who is really trying to make better decisions with my food choices I was really looking forward to this place opening. I saw flyers alll over IG about it. This plant based vegan/vegetarian restaurant opened in Chicago's Southside in Hyde Park on April 7th! I drove past the day it opened and the line was out the door!!! I knew people would flood it on the first day so I waited......I came back today and praise the baby lamb of god the line wasn't ridiculous. It's a new poppin restaurant so you are going to have to wait regardless! The restaurant is small but cozy. She made the small space work. It's styled very contemporary and clean. I love the little plants on the table and plant borders around the restaurant. The hanging light fixtures were a nice grand touch! They looked like little diamond rings. Nice music selection the old Kanye , Aaliyah and Chance the rapper graced the speakers. They were jammingggg! It was also a Dr. Sebi mural on one of the walls which was a nice touch. I met the owner she was very genuine and nice too. My order was taken by a nice young man named Jordan. I ordered the Who Betta Burger it's an grilled 1/4 lb impossible burger loaded with green mix, tomatoes, pickles, grilled red onion, vegan cheese, and Epitome sauce. I also ordered fries and a smoothie called ""Bad and Boujee."" Everything was a la Carte. My total was about $28. I personally don't think that's that expensive. You have to take in consideration that you aren't at Wendy's. They don't sale 4 for 4's!! This is a plant based restaurant so you are paying for quality as well as nutritionally sound food. My burger was delish! It was on a soft Brioche bun. You really couldn't tell that you weren't eating meat. I opted for vegan cheese instead of regular dairy cheese. You couldn't tell the difference visually or flavor wise. I got the Epitome sauce on the side because I hate ketchup and wasn't sure if it was a ketchup based sauce. It was tasty. It tasted like a chipotle mayoish based sauce. It was smoky and tangy. The fries were excellent. They had some type of crispy coating that was fyeeee (delicious)!! My bad and boujee smoothie was tropical flavored. It had nodes of strawberries and pineapples. The restaurant is on 53rd by the time I got on 51st it was gone!! Hahaa!! I throughly enjoyed my meal!! Everything was great!! I amalready thinking about what I want to eat when I go back. ‍ I want to try the pizza puff oooouuuu ohhh Yumm! Try them out you won't be disappointed!!!  *Personally I would recommend going after 4pm the line wasn't that long then. I waited like 25 minutes for my food but remember your food is cooked to order!!!!!"
4/25/2019,20190425,3,4.31,"I've tried this place three times, each time the wait is ridiculously long. The line is long and it takes forever (up to an hour) for your food to be ready. The food for the most part is delicious; however each time something I ordered was not available - either they ran out of the burger, or they were not making fries anymore, or we do not start lasagna after 8:30p (really??) The lasagna and the burger are delicious - the best items on the menu. The fried chicken is awful. The fries are good. At any rate, regardless of how good the food is, service is everything! Please train your employees. Also please update your website with the correct phone number. And finally please allow phone in orders that can be picked up. Otherwise the lines will get shorter and you'll lose business."
4/27/2019,20190427,3,4.21,"Solid. The operational structure of the restaurant is unique, but the food is rich -- interesting -- It's not a vegan restaurant, but a vegan/vegetarian transitioning spot. Solid. So if you're diehard vegan, ask questions, first. #VeganPerspective"
4/28/2019,20190428,2,4.07,"I was excited about this restaurant, I tried the vegan pizza puff and fries. The pizza puff was nasty and the fries were gross(soft and soggy). My husband had the sloppy joe, he enjoyed it. He also got an order of tacos. The tacos were dry and tasteless and the tortillas crumbled when handling. I would not eat here again or recommend it to anyone. I give it one stars for the sloppy joe and one star for being plant based."
4/29/2019,20190429,2,3.94,I tried the philly cheese steak paid 13.95 and it didnt even come with fries! Very over priced! It tasted ok but sandwhich was small and kinda salty
5/2/2019,20190502,2,3.82,"I just had the world most expensive vegan burger! $15 with tax. NO SIDES! Not even a bag of vegan chips. I like to support small local business, but this place is just too expensive. You definitely can't feed a family of 4 for under $80! The burger had good flavor but it's was just warm. I expected food too hot to eat when all I got is a burger. If they relocate and cut the prices in half they have a chance. Other wise they won't last a year at those prices. ""I can't believe it's so EXPENSIVE""!"
5/4/2019,20190504,1,3.67,"WAY OVERPRICED!! And not particularly tasty. Fries were decent, but not served at their best, given the outrageous WAIT TIMES (30-40 mins this Friday). The ""Philly Cheesesteak"" was not the right texture (ground ""beef,"" not chopped), and there was no cheese and precious little of peppers or other veggies promised. A weak showing: small sandwich for $14 (sandwich only). ""Lasagne"" was bow tie pasta! They were out of half the menu, too. Unless this place gets its act together, lowers its sky-high prices and improves the food, it is doomed. Don't go here, while you can! (Try the impossible burger at Medici, a couple blocks south, cheaper with plentiful and excellent fries, homemade bun, and fresh veggies.)"
5/4/2019,20190504,5,3.74,Yayyy I had a burger! It was hardy and very flavorful! Was like eating the real thing but with out the itis afterwards. The wait was long and at the time you couldn't call in the order but once they work that small detail out they will be awesome! Next time I'll try the philly cheese steak
5/6/2019,20190506,4,3.75,Only four stars because the wait time was a bit much and we weren't reassured the time after just standing around... No employee was available to provide extra assistance as the lady at the register was swamped... Other than that the experience and food was great. Love the vibe of the place... All of the diverse faces made my heart smile
5/7/2019,20190507,2,3.67,"They were ""okay"" and the prices were DEFINITELY not worth it. I bought a sub-sandwich for $14 thinking I would get my money's worth (even though I knew it didn't come with ANY sides) and bought some fries for $4 thinking they were gonna be something ""unique"" about them. I was TOTALLY disappointed. The sub sandwich was only six inches. The fries were regular crinkle cut in a small container for $4. Now I'm not gonna compare this business to any other business but you can go to other vegan spots for less. Customer service was also ""okay"". Go at your own risk."
5/8/2019,20190508,4,3.68,Another African-American own spot in the Hyde Park area that I could not wait to try they actually lie on the spot next door which is called the soul Shack which is soul food
5/8/2019,20190508,4,3.7,"Hubby and I went to CBINM yesterday for the very first time. I generally don't eat meat but was having a craving for a burger so we decided to take the trip from the burbs to the city and CBINM did not disappoint!!! I got the the ""burger"" and fries and my hubby got the Philly cheese ""steak"". OMG, my burger was SO delicious!!! You would've never know it wasnt real meat! The fries were the only thing that was ""ok"", they are seasoned fried but I would have preferred fresh cut or even homemade chips. My hubby said the Philly was good but could have used a bit more seasoning but he still enjoyed it. He also Loved my burger. Great food, cool spot, and we lucked out and only waited 10-15min. So perhaps we'll continue to come during the week to avoid the crowd and long wait times as previous reviewers mentioned. All in all, it was totally worth the trip from the burbs! Def check it out!"
5/9/2019,20190509,3,3.67,We tried to try everything ... lol we ordered the tacos 2 burgers 2 pizza puffs philly cheese steak & lasagna ... everything was good the best was the burger .. I wanna try this place again because the place is really for ordering to go so I had a couple runs to do and had to warm the food up .. I think food is best right off the grill or out of the oven so next time I will try the food as soon as I get it while it's still hot .. that's y only the 3 stars ‍
5/20/2019,20190520,4,3.68,"My first time trying this restaurant was on Saturday with my friend (who's a true meat eater but I'm the vegan). We went around the time they opened so it wasn't that crowded. I ordered the ""Who Betta"" burger and Pizza Puff while my friend ordered the bratwurst and tacos. Yes, we ordered all that food don't judge us lol. Verdict: the food was absolutely amazing! That pizza puff brought back so many memories of me being in high school and ordering one for lunch. My meat eater friend was definitely fooled and said the food was well seasoned and had good flavor. Her favorite was the tacos.Pros: Great customer service Great musicGood quality food Cons: It is a little pricey for the portion sizeThe wait is long but the good music makes up for it plus they make it to order All in all, I would definitely recommend this place and would absolutely come back again to try the chicken that they were all out of (sad face)."
5/22/2019,20190522,5,3.73,"I visited this establishment with a friend who is a meat eater. My friend ordered the Italian beef and I ordered the pizza puff with fries and mild sauce. The food took a long time to come out, but the owner was personable came out and apologized for the wait and informed us on how much longer. The food was overall good, the pizza puff definitely made me feel nostalgic. I just wish the pizza puff had some pizza/mariana sauce on the inside to accompany the spinach and cheese."
5/22/2019,20190522,1,3.63,I went into the restaurant to order a pizza puff I waited over an hour for it I was given the wrong order and another customer was given my order after she went to her car and discovered it was wrong she brought it back in and they wanted us to just exchange orders which is not sanitary I was very upset and asked for a refund . I was not compensated in any way for their mistake and no apology was given
5/23/2019,20190523,5,3.68,"Great Vegan Burger. I've been waiting to come here and it was definitely worth it. Not cheap, but that's the point of eating vegan right...not putting cheap crap in your body. Food was made fresh to order with quality ingredients and excellent seasoning and flavor. Open more of them."
5/24/2019,20190524,1,3.59,"Not happy. Entered the restaurant with one person ordering ahead of me at 6 pm. Didnt get my order, which was a pizza puff and fries until about 6:30 pm. Paid almost $15 for some mediocre food with pretty small portion size. I don't mind spending money on quality food where the portion size is at least ""fair"". I will not be back. Even if food is made to order, they need to get their prep game up to par to eliminate long a$% wait times."
5/25/2019,20190525,3,3.57,"Short hours, long wait, great food, ridiculous prices. I think the prices are so high to compensate for the shorter, after sundown hours. If they were open for lunch, it would (should)be cheaper.We came by after 7pm on Sat and found the very small space (it used to be the fro-yo place, I think) packed. After a wait, we placed an order (cheeseburger and fries, $19) were told to wait 25-30 min and expect a text. We had to leave (thank goodness the pouring rain had stopped!) because the place was so small, just a few chairs, a tv, and a stereo system for some reason.The seasoned fries were great, and the burger was SO realistic, it really was hard to believe it wasn't meat! I Even the 'cheese' was good, not waxy. They might give Native Foods a run for their money, but NF has a MUCH bigger menu, and they include a side when they demand $12 for an entree."
5/26/2019,20190526,4,3.58,"I checked online and saw that this restaurant uses the impossible burger, and boy this burger was everything I hoping for in a well round burger. The impossible burger really taste like ground beef like I remember, and the sauce they use on the ""who betta"" was sooo good. The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food is pretty expensive, especially for being in a college area.  I only tried the burger and purchased a very expensive bottle of water. This is a much try, but only as a treat if you just got paid."
5/28/2019,20190528,5,3.62,"My daughter and I visited on Saturday and we were both SATISFIED! I kinda flex (smh) between Vegetarian & Vegan, and my daughter eats meat. We shared a Pizza Puff & a Philly Cheese, both w/vegan- non-dairy cheese. I absolutely loved every single bite of that Pizza Puff because I haven't had one since my pork eating days which ended in 1992. The Philly was delicious as well and my daughter said she might just become a vegetarian as well...lol! We will be back so we can try the other items on the menu as well - finally a restaurant where I can eat everything on the menu - I AM SO HAPPY!"
6/2/2019,20190602,3,3.61,"I've been anticipating visiting this place for about a month now. While my visit wasn't anything epic it still wasn't a bad lunch per se. If you're craving a vegan dish especially something as coveted as a cheesesteak I imagine this could've been a lot worse. As far as flavor goes it just doesn't quite compete with good old fashioned protein. I do have days, especially post gym days, where I feel like I shouldn't compromise my workouts with fatty foods & this is such an occasion. You have your choice of dairy or vegan cheese atop you cheesesteak & they even have an option to text you to notify that your food is ready. The cheesesteak is a decent size but didn't come with any sides. As with all establishments owned by this person, Litehouse especially, the hours can be confusing but I'll definitely return just not with my expectations set to vegan being able to compare to the real thing."
6/4/2019,20190604,4,3.62,"Hello World!Beautiful holistic, earthy vibes @ this restaurant.Service with a smile and a humble owner open to suggestions. Please know that your food is made fresh to order so patience is a must. If you are short on time, you may want to call in your order. I ordered the ""I cant believe it's a pizza puff""! Haven't had one in years! But this freshly made; crispy tender crust pocket, filled with vegan sausage, herbs, spices and your choice of vegan or dairy cheese, knocked my socks off!!!! It was absolutely delish! I also secretly had one of their chicken nuggets, yes, it tastes like chicken! Try the restaurant people, you wont be disappointed. STILL waiting on my tee-shirt!"
6/5/2019,20190605,5,3.66,"I love this place. Delicious plant-based/vegan comfort food. A really calm, relaxing atmosphere, and super professional and warm staff."
6/8/2019,20190608,1,3.58,"My photo speaks for itself. Take a look at this $8 hotdog. Pathetic! If you're going to charge for an overpriced hotdog, make sure it doesn't look like a anorexic wiener with slim pickings. I was so disgusted and annoyed especially after waiting 20 minutes on my lunch break for this. Not only was the presentation horrible but the taste wasn't worth $8. I've had better hotdogs for much less at home and on food trucks. Ridiculous!"
6/13/2019,20190613,5,3.62,"Best vegan burger ever! Not anything like ""beyond"" burger. Not a bean burger either. Definitely holds shape and tastes FANTASTIC!! Local spot, try them."
6/15/2019,20190615,5,3.66,"ABSOLUTELY MIND BLOWINGI was soooo skeptical and at my bff request went there with our 4 year olds who loved it ! We had a pizza puff and fries, lasagna, and a shake ! Ok so you have to wait 30mins (same as Harold's sometimes)It is a small inside may not get a seat if packed ( it's a Togo setting obviously, same as any taco stand or maxwells)The decor is fit for a sit in restaurant (clearly they care about every detail)The guy taking our order didn't know who OutKast was !!!!! (he was only 16 and surely part of the family)Family ownedFresh made to order foodBlack ownedVegan/vegetarian restaurantHyde parkOwner came out talked to us (as she did everyone else)And the food is LARGE PORTIONS and taste impeccable ! Oh and they got mild sauce ! Real mild sauce !I will be back and congrats let's keep rotating the melanin dollar ! Congrats sister ! Do your thing Xoxo Tiese"
6/15/2019,20190615,5,3.69,"My mother and I went there yesterday, not realizing it was primarily take-out.The service was incredible and the people could not have been nicer.The owner got as a table at the restaurant next door and brought our order to us. She came back several times to check on us, bringing extra chips and sauce.The food was excellent. My mom said they were the best chips she'd ever eaten (seasoned tortilla chips on the taco salad. I had the burger. It was delicious.While the prices are high, the food and the service make it well worth it.Definitely will be going back."
6/17/2019,20190617,5,3.73,Amazing service and great food. I am on a budget with a 12 year old Vegan daughter . We both ate good delicious fresh food at a reasonable price. We shared the .... Little Italy Lasagna. We will be back! We hope you come
7/2/2019,20190702,4,3.73,"The food is amazing. I had the Burger which was outstanding and I could not eat it in one sitting. I wish however that it came with fries for the price. Also the pizza puff and fries were quite delicious. I really enjoyed the food, the service and professionalism of the staff but it is a bit pricey."
7/9/2019,20190709,4,3.74,"Very pricy in comparison to the amount of food that will be given, but the delicious food makes the price worth it."
7/10/2019,20190710,4,3.74,"Stopped in with a vegan cousin and was excited to try the Vegan Philly. Ended up ordering a Pizza Puff, the Who Betta Burger, and the Vegan Philly. For starters, the place itself had a cool vibe to it, but looked like it be tough finding a table to eat at on a busy day. Luckily it was early Wednesday and we got a table right away. The first thing I tried was the Pizza Puff and, as meat eater, I wouldn't have guessed it was vegan. Next was the Philly. It was solid, but nothing crazy for me. I was a little thrown off by the vegan cheese and may have over-hyped myself up for this one, after having a fiire Vegan Philly at a spot in DC. Lastly was the burger, the sauce was really good and I imagine if In N Out made a vegan burger it would be pretty much this. I'd come back for the pizza puff and the burger, but would come back more often if prices were cut down a few bucks. If I remember right, our total came out to around, if not over $50. Kind of a lot to spend for the food you get. Overall though, I'm glad I gave it a try and wish them the best."
7/12/2019,20190712,3,3.73,"I'll start off by saying that it met my expectations for the stereotypical customer service experience we often hear about at black-owned establishments. Take that however you want. It is a consistent characteristic that few prove wrong. My experience here was no different. I wanted to give 4 out 5 stars but the memory of the employee's attitude is forever etched in my memory. So is the sight of the bottom of the chair she decided to prop up right next to me while I was eating. The space is tiny. There was no need to flip chairs on top of the bar or tables while customers were still present. It could only take 20 mins max to straighten up after the last customer leaves.I get it. You're closing soon. She might as well have told me, my boyfriend to get out, it would have saved us the discomfort while eating and she would have been able to close the entire restaurant down right at 6:45 on the dot--wait no. 6:40 (she told the kitchen right in front of us that she was not closing at the time listed on the door.) Customers shouldn't pay to feel the wrath of someone with a piss poor attitude or unwelcome. Period. Now let's get to the two parts of our order that was not given to us. You would have thought we asked the cashier, employee, whatever her title, to go in the back, sauté 20 bags of spinach and squeeze a gallon of wheatgrass into a glass jar, by hand. When we asked for the smoothie she forgot, she looks and says ""What about it?"" The second order of fries that never came out? It was like we had interrupted her acceptance speech at the awards ceremony for worst customer service in Hyde Park. Like I said. The customer service experience was disappointing.The food, however, was good. I had the Philly Cheese Steak, Tacos, Fries, and a berry smoothie (made with fruit ""flavoring."") My suggestion? Take yours TO GO."
7/21/2019,20190721,4,3.73,"I'm going to give this place four stars because it was pretty good and it's cute. BUT- it is way overpriced and the service could be a little more inviting. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak, fries and a shake.... $30!!!!! Whaaaaat! That's no table service, bagged up to go! There are so many options in Chicago and a few pretty good ones nearby. I split my food with my friend who ordered the burger. I love Beyond meat and Impossible burgers and this was prepared as expected. Portion sizes are on the small side, especially for the price. They do need a friendly face at the counter, one who can interact with customers."
7/21/2019,20190721,5,3.76,Best burger ever! I went there last night. The tacos are good also but the burger is outstanding.
7/24/2019,20190724,2,3.72,"I really wish I like it, because it's one of the few vegan places near me. I got their ""hotdog"", it was tiny, shrunken, and mediocre. I also don't know why they had to put it in an oversized plastic container, completely unnecessary. The plastic container offended me more than the actual hotdog. I felt like I paid $8 to kill the planet. After consuming the ""hotdog"", I'm feeling both hungry and angry, a most undesirable result I've ever had after eating."
7/29/2019,20190729,4,3.73,"First impression: very nice restaurant/location, very beautiful and artistic on the inside. The menu was small, and somewhat overpriced. The choices were similar to vegan fast food. I had a pizza puff with diary cheese, and while it wasn't nasty...it wasn't the best. There wasn't a real taste to it. Felt like I was just hitting through hard dough and cheese. My friend had The Who Berta Burger and said it was really good. So maybe it was just my choice. My real complaint comes from the fries. Though they came with my meal, the fries alone were $3.95. And they were Aldi brand fries. I think for a vegan establishment it would be best to have actual hand cut fries, not fries I can go home and fry myself lol. I have high hopes for this establishment, as it is something unique, and in its first year of opening. I just hope that they source out new vendors for food, and maybe bring some healthier options to the menu. I'm not even a health fanatic but I was turned off by the lack of veggies in a vegan restaurant. I give it another year and it may just be one of the best take out places in the city. All in all, I give it a 7/10! Best of luck to ""Can't Believe It's Not Meat."""
8/4/2019,20190804,5,3.76,"Best plant-based food I've ever had. Because everything is made fresh, there is often times at least a twenty minute wait. It's well worth the wait. Trust me."
8/9/2019,20190809,4,3.76,"I enjoyed my first visit to CBINM in Hyde Park. We were in the city and decided to grab an early dinner before returning to the burbs. The cafe is super small but super cute. I only noticed seating for about 15 total in the eatery. However the decor is definitely modern with a summer-cool vibe. The counter attendant was friendly and answered our menu questions with ease. Bravo for great staff training by management. We settled on a pizza puff and chicken nuggets for our first visit. Food is cooked to order so there will be a slight wait. If you are on a meter give yourself an hour to accommodate ordering/eating for anyone dining onsite. Although I am a fan, one star is deducted for price to portion ratio. We spent $28 for two basket meals and bottled water. Although I will return to sample other goodies it will definitely not be apart of our regular eatery rotation due to value."
8/11/2019,20190811,5,3.78,"By far the best vegan, plant based restaurant I've been too. What this restaurant has done with classic, signature Chicago food options is genius! The Pizza puff is bomb, and the burger is freaking amazing. The vegan cheese actually taste like cheese! Hands done a must visit! They have smoothies and juices as well. Go visit ASAP!"
8/13/2019,20190813,4,3.79,So excited to finally check out this place while home. I grew up on the Southside of Chicago and something any Chicagoan ate or knew about was Pizza Puffs. We ate pizza puffs like people eat potato chips and they are unique to Chicago (one of the many signature items).I haven't had a Pizza Puff since like 1999 since they always were filled with Italian sausage and I haven't had pork since 1999 and had to give those up when I gave up pork. Ooh how I missed pizza puffs until NOW. This gem makes pizza puffs that are VEGAN yes I said that VEGAN. They even offer Vegan Cheese in it or Dairy cheese for the vegetarians or people who want to try and not ready for the entire Vegan experience. My husband had one with me and being from Manhattan he never heard of a Pizza Puff until we met in 2005 but he never got to taste one because they had pork in them. He had the one with dairy cheese and I had the vegan cheese. Upon him taking a bite from mine he said he should've just got the vegan cheese as it taste the same if not better than his. On my 14 day SummerTime CHI visit I had about 6 pizza puffs (Judge Your Momma *sticks tongue out*) and now running 5 miles a day to try to get it back together.
8/17/2019,20190817,5,3.81,"Literally the best vegan food! Food took 25 minutes for 4 dishes- pretty alright. Super cute place- intimate. Took the food home and even after a 20 min ride home I wasn't disappointed!!! Everything we tasted was so good! Fries=awesome! We tasted the Brat, nuggets, phili cheese and pocket!"
8/19/2019,20190819,2,3.78,"I really wanted to love this place. Excellent vegan spots are hard to come by. After reading articles about them, following them on Instagram, drooling over beautiful pictures and watching the over-the-top videos of customers trying their food for the first time, I was super excited to try this new restaurant. Gave it a shot, but was disappointed. Ordered a shake - they had none...early afternoon in the middle of a summer day...Pizza puff lacked flavor. You taste oil and nothing else. Greasy. Best part: mediocre fries you can get anywhere. This place is very unfortunately not worth the hype."
8/22/2019,20190822,5,3.8,"The name speaks for itself. I had the ""Who Betta Burger"" I thought I was actually eating meat. This burger is delicious. If you're trying to wean yourself offf of beef. Give this place. I have one complaint. Paying $13 for a plant based burger should include French fries."
9/1/2019,20190901,4,3.8,"Great food with a great atmosphere to go along with it. I originally went for the the ""Pizza Puff"" but sadly they did not have it at the time. So I ended up with the ""Hold Up! Wait A Min!"" Phillysteak, fries, and the ""Cookie Monster"" Oreo milkshake and it was phenomenal. Although the wait time was between 45 minutes and an hour and it was worth it. I went on a Saturday evening and before the restaurant opened there was a line. I give this restaurant 4 stars simply because of the wait time. My recommendation is that you clear your schedule when going especially when it's busy but you will not be disappointed!!"
9/10/2019,20190910,5,3.82,I am officially going Vegan. The cheeseburger tasted like ground beef and it was big and juicy. The fries were seasoned perfectly. The cashier was the perfect hostess. I really really enjoyed everything.
9/15/2019,20190915,5,3.84,"While helping broil (brother-in-law) babysit a couple toddlers we came upon this place. We were in the process of choosing somewhere to grab a quick bite, kid-friendly too and happened on this storefront. It's kinda bougie (bourgeois) at first, the entrance is donned up like it's a boutique or upscale salon, instead, it's a vegan eatery. That entry makes for some good IG photos & selfies. It kept the kids busy while waiting on food.Between us and the kids we ordered all sorts of stuff to try. Smoothies both beneficial and dessert. Salads, fries and ""chicken"" nuggets. I was pleasantly surprised. The kids loved their faux nuggets. Every item was tasty, nice presentations and left us with a feeling of wanting to return and try more. We dined in and service was fine except for a hiccup when one child realized she never received her smoothie. They got it out fast and the child's frown turned upside down. With bellies full we felt clean, pumped and looked forward to the long stroll we had ahead. If only I lived or worked nearby. I'd know this menu backwards and forwards.. Needless to point out, but, I'm definitely checking them out again."
9/22/2019,20190922,4,3.85,"First time there and it was nice. The place is very small so don't go with the plans of chilling there. I went when.they were first open so I was able to grab a seat. Your food is cooked to go. The prices are not favorable for some of the items. 3 tacos shouldnt be more than chik'n and fries. A water was 4 bucks. Interior...Its very clean and cute inside. The staff was cool, nothing extraordinary but good. Food took longer than I would have thought but wasnt a huge deal but noticable. Now the food... I LOVED the Chicago Chik'n and fries. Spices were delicious and texture was great. They have a nice mild sauce too. If in the area, I can go for more."
9/22/2019,20190922,5,3.87,This is the best vegetarian/vegan food I've had. The staff are nice and always cheerful. I've only been four times but plan I'm going back every chance I get. I recommend the pizza puff but the tacos and burger are great too. Thanks for great food in a great location.
9/26/2019,20190926,3,3.85,"This restaurant isn't very good. The inside of the restaurant is very small. Please don't expect to go there with a large party. I ordered the pizza puff and it was just mediocre and very greasy. My total bill for pizza puff , chicken nuggets and a burger with no fries with two drinks was around $60. I certainly won't be coming back."
10/8/2019,20191008,3,3.84,"Finally got around to trying this non-meat option. Great portion sizes but the taste itself left a lot to be desired. I had the philly steak sandwich and while it was filling , the meat substitute really didn't have a taste. The toppings overpowered it all. I also ordered the Who Betta burger which was for my partner....they were underwhelmed as well deciding to add seasoning to their sandwich. I can appreciate a plant-base/meatless option as I am I big fan of another similar restaurant who sales similar options. I will be back to try other menu items ."
10/8/2019,20191008,3,3.83,"It's probably the best vegan food I've had in the Chicago area. HOWEVER, paying $13.95 for Philly cheesesteak that DO NOT include fries is over paying! I will def come here to treat myself once in a blue moon but not so often."
10/13/2019,20191013,2,3.8,"First, let me start by saying it truly hurts to have to give this place such a bad review. After reading SO much about the new soul food vegan spot, I couldn't wait to try it. I ordered the Philly Cheese steak for my boyfriend and the meatless burger for myself. The burger was mediocre at best. However, the cheese steak is on the top three list of worst things I've ever tasted. My boyfriend felt the same way. He managed to finish it since he was starving, but I couldn't even bring myself to swallow the bite I tasted. To make matters worse, it's was $15!!!! Do yourself a favor, choose someplace else. If you're curious, give this place a try but do NOT try the cheese steak."
10/13/2019,20191013,3,3.78,"The pizza puff was a hit! I also ordered the philly cheese, but it wasn't as hitting. Not to mention try to get one of the Smoothies. They have wonderful selection of healthy juices."

Had the Mezcal tequila cocktail it was awesome. I think it had pomegranate but I can't remember. Stephanie is one of the best bartenders in Chicago! Make sure you go see her, and try the food, the chef is super personable and they tell you every detail about what you're eating and what's inside of it. I thought that was really cool. The pork belly bao is bomb. Definitely coming back when I'm in town or I'm moving back because Chicago is the greatest city in America. Hands-down"

11/17/2019,20191117,2,3.8,"Have tried this place three times and seems like I get disappointed pretty much every time I came here. The customer service is ok never bad but never a lasting impression. The food is overpriced, never filling and mediocre in my opinion. The best thing I had on the menu was the pizza puff the burger wasn't worth it in my opinion no real flavor also the philly cheese steak was basic. Came down here to try the new shrimp item on the menu my wife got the basket and I got the shrimp po boy. You get the same amount of shrimp for the po boy but a Four dollar increase in price I believe for cold tomato,bread and lettuce. They ran out of mild sauce so you couldn't get any on your shrimp if you wanted some only buffalo. I feel like the cooks in the back don't really care about the food. The food is never is piping hot just medium temperature which is mind blowing considering you wait 30 min or longer to get food also just seems like no effort when they bring out the food how everything has been placed on the burger, shrimp po boy and philly cheese steak just seems like things are just thrown on and brought out. Another disappointment is for a burger the cost 15 dollars or should come with fries. The fries are not handmade how they first said when they first opened there regular frozen fries."

I also took my very picky little one and she enjoyed the burger as well. It can be a little pricey but I'm sure if I lived closer I would still be ordering all the time!

Why can't other restaurants create delicious smoothies like this?I also ordered their version of Sloppy Joe. Not only did it tantalize my taste buds, it also looked like a sloppy joe -- only bigger and better.The only con was the price: the meat version is much cheaper. For that reason, I'll only stop by occasionally. Next time for another smoothie and to try their ""shrimp."""

I think they just have lemonade, and I definitely would have preferred soda with my burger. my girlfriend got the pizza pocket, and neither of us liked it."

The young lady at the register was on her phone and she did not get off of her phone. Oh wait! She did - she said ""menus are in the wall"" and then she went back to her phone. She did not discuss foods they didn't have or suggest anything from the menu. I asked for several items only to find out after I asked that they did not have them... smhThe young man who came out of the back was wearing a DIRTY apron - I think it was an apron. His plans was hanging off of his but so I was introduced to his blue underwear... smh AGAIN.Well you already know I'm never going back and I will definitely pass the info on to others.Is this black-owned? Just wondering... ‍ ‍"

It was my first time here and OMG it was soo goood! I am allergic to real shrimp so I asked an another customer who ordered it too if I tasted like real shrimp and they said it was like the real deal. Food was great and so was my fresh strawberry lemonade! Plus it's another Chicago southside vegan restaurant so win win win in my book! Counting down the days to come back here and try their pizza puff and cheesesteak!! More seating would be great but I heard they're opening up another location soon."

2/18/2020,20200218,5,3.78,"Think you have to give up your favorite meals if you go dairy-free or meatless? Think again. Restaurants like Can't Believe it's Not Meat are perfecting your favorite comfort dishes with no meat and no dairy! This new Chicago spot prizes itself on tending to the ""flexitarian"" or those transitioning into a vegan or vegetarian diet but still want to keep the full flavor of their favorite meals. I had the ""Who Betta"" burger and... wow. It was delicious! If I hadn't known this was a meatless burger going in, I would have been completely convinced by the smoky, grill flavor that it was a beef burger. Keeping the cheese and toppings that I would have had on a beef burger made me feel like I was missing out on nothing. It comes with a house-made ""Epitome"" sauce (which resembles a chipotle mayo) that made me want another right after I finished the first! I really wish I could bottle the sauce and take it home with me. Ketchup and mustard was not needed with this sauce! I've had vegan/ meatless meals but THIS one blew my mind. The seasoned fries could have been crispier but they were wonderfully spicy and light and fresh. CBINM also has Philly cheesesteaks, lasagna, nachos, pizza puffs, Chicago style hot dogs, mild sauce, milkshakes, and sooo much more-- all meatless and with dairy-free options! You HAVE to try out this spot! Next time you're in the Hyde Park or Kenwood area (or in the Chicagoland and want to try a dope Black-owned vegan spot) definitely stop in to Can't Believe it's Not Meat."
2/21/2020,20200221,5,3.8,"Oh my goodness just ate out of I can't believe it's not meat and I must say I totally enjoyed my food. My husband and I ordered a philly cheese steak with a side of grilled onions, the buffalo shrimp which tasted so real were very delicious, and my favorite was the big burrito. Omg I could've just devoured that burrito because it was so good to me. I loved the cheese fries they were so delicious. I must say I was really impressed with this black owned, No Meat, friendly restaurant. It was a pleasant experience"
3/14/2020,20200314,2,3.78,"They need to get it together you have to have pride in the food that you serve and when I order this hoagie I just knew it was going to be good because of the description on the menu I'm so excited about eating me a vegan hoagie. It boasted tomato,onion,shredded lettuce, among other condiments with the smoked vegan lunch meat. It sounded so good that I was willing to pay for this overpriced sandwich that came with no fries or chips or anything. I'll just attach a picture of what the hell I got when it came to my house so you can see for yourself the disappointment that I was faced with.I cannot afford to give them another chance because the food is so overpriced, but if somebody wants to treat me to some food there I give him another chance and upgrade this review if they deserve it. But for real we have to do better .Also I never go inside of there because the vibe is trash they act like they don't want to be there.I gave them an extra star cuz they black"
4/11/2020,20200411,2,3.76,I have had a couple of bad experiences I have voiced my concern to the owner and I thought things were going to get better I order a chicken sandwich this time around and a smoothie .He said okay I'll call you when it's ready and Also got the text of the number I was in line .I waited looked at the number 30 mins then another hour passes and I decide to go in and ask was my food done and he said aw let me see goes back and said we have to cancel the smoothie order because the machine is broken now my food has been on the counter for lord knows how long got my food and it's cold I asked him how long has it been out he said I don't know lbs I'm over it I'll have to find me a new vegan every time I am patience and understanding but not this time unacceptable
4/12/2020,20200412,3,3.75,"I would've given this place a 4 star but had some issues with the Big Burrito. We ordered the wings, pizza puff, and burrito. The wings and fries were really good! The pizza puff had really good flavor but was kind of greasy almost like they didn't drain the grease off enough. The burrito is supposed to come with a protein filling and it had none. On the Instagram page the burrito did not appear to be deep fried but It was and very very very greasy. So we basically had a greasy deep fried tortilla with just toppings inside. If I'm in the area again I'd give this another try just not any of the deep fried items. Flavor is definitely there and the vegan cheese is amazing!"
4/29/2020,20200429,3,3.74,"Great place to eat if you don't eat meat! Flavor on your taste buds are here! Butttt the downfall is that they don't listen to you when placing order. I order here at least 3 times a week and I ask them to take tomatoes off my sandwich. I get home and take a look at my food, the receipt says no tomatoes but then I open my food box up and guess what I see...... tomatoes Not sure what's going on there but they do this every time. 3/5"
4/30/2020,20200430,5,3.76,The best chik'n sandwich I've ever had hands down! The fries also taste good As a vegan it's hard to find junk food that tastes great but this place helps deliver that satisfying taste. I haven't actually ate in but the cashier lady has always been friendly to me.
5/22/2020,20200522,3,3.75,"I haven't eaten beef for years but sometimes want a burger so I decided to stop here and try The Who Betta Burger. The items on the menu are a little pricey but that's to be excepted for vegan food. The burger came with fries and your choice of dairy or non dairy cheese. I tried to order a shake but they were out . Now the wait time is pretty long, it was about a 30/35 minute wait for my food- 2 Who betta burgers and a bottle of water. The food was good, the burger was flavorful, small but tasty. The fries were Ok, I would've like the option of having chips or maybe even a salad.The customer service could've been better, the cashier wasn't rude but I did stand at the counter for a minute or so watching the cashier scroll her phone and had to announce myself to get her attention. Because of the wait time and small portions I can't say that I'd revisit, I did enjoy my burger but $34 for such a small amount of food didn't sit well with me."

Most of my group had the WhoBetter Burger, and they all agreed that it was delicious. Yes, they actually said they couldn't believe it wasn't beef. Others had the Chi Town Chix'n, which was equally tasty. The food was fresh and hot, and the service was great. Our food was ready at the time they stated. Were all gave our visit and meal a 10+. Judge for yourselves...You have to try it"
6/1/2020,20200601,3,3.75,"I've had their burgers, chicken wings and pizza puff. Today I tried The lasagna and it was okay- reason being okay is because it tasted like cheese lasagna. I couldn't tell that it had meat in. I probably wouldn't order this entree again"
6/6/2020,20200606,5,3.77,"Mmm! I'm not vegan but this burger is SO GOOD!!! The taste, texture and condiments are on point! Fries was also perfectly crispy on the outside and soft of the inside! Yum. My friend and I biked over to pick it up. It even survived the 30min bike ride home and was still so yummy. Also loved that I don't have that ""I feel sick from eating too much meat"" feeling after, but that's probably just me. One thing to keep in mind is that it is a small business so it could take a little longer for the food to be ready, which means it is made fresh! But if you are in a hurry, perhaps good to call ahead."
6/6/2020,20200606,5,3.78,"Tried their signature Who Betta Burger, and it's one of the best burgers I've ever eaten, and it's fully vegan too! Service was excellent as well, I highly recommend. Would definitely go back again. Nice to have more options for burgers as a vegan in America, especially from small businesses."

6/9/2020,20200609,5,3.8,Mmm mmm good. I had the chicken sandwich with fries and the pizza puff. Both were delicious but the chicken sandwich was awesome! My daughter even wanted to give up her pizza puff for my sandwich. I'll be back to sample everything else on the menu!

I'm not vegan but it was delicious. It was all great. The fries were well seasoned too. They were a little cold because of delivery but I'll definitely dine-in in the future. It's a bit pricier but worth it for not feeling gross after eating a burger, fries and a milkshake. Happy to support a black owned business!"
6/15/2020,20200615,5,3.83,Food is really good . Don't order if your in a rush . Chicken sandwich is bomb and so is the pizza puff . Everything was fresh and taste great

Their burger is great - comes with vegan or regular cheese and the vegan cheese was surprisingly tasty. Seemed a little pricey for a burger but it came with a good sized portion of fries that were also very good, and that's to be expected with vegan places. Will definitely be returning!"
6/17/2020,20200617,5,3.85,"EVERYTHING IS PHENOMENAL AND I HAVE officially tried everything a few times...my addictions are currently the Philly, Bratwurst and now that darn Burger... I can't sleep thinking about it..debating if I should just go grab one, but its 7pm and I have to be up for work at 130 am..so tomorrow it is! Also for those complaining or I'm sorry commenting about the price...its pricey at every vegan place in any given city, unfortunately, they have to pay for the pricey meat options as well. If you miss meat...try the options here...best in town...period!"
6/18/2020,20200618,1,3.82,"I honestly wanted to like this place but I ended up paying $50 for garbage. The Chitown fried chicken had this very weird gummy/bready texture that I didn't like but I will say the mild sauce was good. The Philly ""NO CHEESE"" steak was just awful. I asked for no jalapenos and they still put them on there. Also, the sandwich was dry and the meat crumbles tasted nothing like meat. I will say that the Who Betta Burger was ok, but I can definitely find a similar or better burger somewhere else for a cheaper price."
6/26/2020,20200626,2,3.8,"I was very excited to check out this restaurant and support them on Juneteenth. I ordered my food online and was told that it would be ready in about an hour. After finding parking, I walked by the restaurant and saw that it was packed, with a line out the door, so I inquired as to when my order would be ready. I was told it would be another hour and a half. Being a beautiful day, I walked around Hyde Park and didn't mind the wait. However, after coming back, I was told the order still was not ready. Now we were at over 2 hours since ordering the food. I waited another 45 minutes only to finally have my name called and look in the bag and find out that I was missing an item. The server gave me the food and never mentioned that I was missing an item, so thank goodness I checked the bag before leaving out. I was then told that they were out of the nachos so I asked for a full refund. I was told it would be 5-7 business days for a refund and I am still waiting.I love supporting black businesses, but we have to do better. I don't understand why someone could not have come out and told the customers that they were out of certain items so that we could have made the decision to either replace with something else or get a refund. I feel as if my time was not valued. I'm hoping things get better so that I can one day go back and support them. However, right now, I will be taking my money to another black owned vegan/vegetarian restaurant."
6/28/2020,20200628,5,3.81,"Most flavorful, scrumptious vegan food we've had in a really, really long time. The chef used amazing flavors for each of the many items we tried. If we lived nearby, we'd be coming here every day. Seriously.We ordered online, and got there on time, but our order was delayed awhile. The owner gave us a beverage while we waited - super kind. I would be happy to wait again for the food served here - it was that incredible. Can't say enough good things about the high quality of the ingredients, delicious flavors and generous French fry portions. Just fabulous!!!!"
6/29/2020,20200629,5,3.83,"Black Owned Business Alert! 10/10 would recommend! I came during the pandemic so I can't comment on the atmosphere or service. The food however is AMAZING! It's so good I've ordered 3x in one week. The entire menu is Vegan and is some of the best food I've ever had! The Who Betta Burger tastes better than beef. The patty is seasoned so well and it was filling! The Can't Believe it's a Pizza Puff is sooo delicious! The meat substitute tastes like beef, the vegan cheese melted well and was very rich! The Bucktown Bratwurst was also very good! Finally, the Lasagna is a MUST try! It tastes like the world's best Italian restaurant's lasagna. The Oreo Shake is BOMB! There is no mistake!!"
6/30/2020,20200630,4,3.83,The place is not bad at all . Great customer service and great food . Only thing that is the disappointment is the portion size of the food . I paid over 16 dollars for this meal and got a small pocket of fries. Beside that this place is good and it's a must try .
6/30/2020,20200630,5,3.84,"This is great vegan fast food. The taste is on point. Definitely reminds you of all your favorite meat items. I would recommend. My top favorite items are the pizza puff, impossible burger and the nuggets."
7/4/2020,20200704,5,3.85,I saw the review for this spot in @blackpeopleeat.Wow oh wow!!! The philly egg rolls will not disappoint. I'm not a fan of buffalo anything but I decided to be adventurous and try their buffalo chicken...also good.
7/9/2020,20200709,5,3.86,"Let me begin by saying, I'm not vegan or vegetarian. But I like good food and if it happens to be healthy that's great! I had the pizza puff, fries and Oreo shake. OMG!!! The pizza puff was so good, it was so fresh, crispy and juicy. Much better than the flat over fried regular puff I have had my entire life. The fries were just ok, I expected better since it is a veggie spot. The Oreo shake was delish! I really don't need the fries with those two. I can't wait to go back."
7/11/2020,20200711,2,3.84,I went to this restaurant a year ago and the food was amazing!!!! I'm not sure what's changed but yesterday when I went I waited 35 minutes and my food still wasn't hot?? Not sure how that happened. The food was not very good it was sorta bland and when did they start adding spinach to the pizza puff and veggies to the Philly cheesesteak??? My biggest disappointment was the chi town style chicken. This item was 17.00 and it was the size of a kids meal. I spent 50.00 and it was definitely not worth it at all. I'm not sure if they were having a bad day a bad cook or what but I drove an hour and 30 minutes for this only to not be satisfied.
7/13/2020,20200713,5,3.85,The best vegan food I've ever had. I've had almost everything on the menu and have failed to find anything not delicious. I've been trying to try the shrimp for wweeeekks and it's always sold out . Worth the wait when they're super busy!
7/14/2020,20200714,5,3.86,"I was looking at places in the city with my vegan sister & we wanted to bring home dinner so we went here. She got the hoagie with vegan cheese & absolutely loved it. I (not a vegan) got the vegan philly cheese steak with vegan cheese and as a meat eater this was the best philly cheese steak I've ever had. We placed our order at 830, picked it up at 8:55 (5 minutes before close) and it still looked like they were getting more orders and had some ready to be picked up. The popularity of this place is totally understandable & I will absolutely be coming back. If you want a vegan option look no further!"
7/19/2020,20200719,5,3.87,Today was my first time there and I had the Who Betta Burger. It was very tasty. It also comes with fries. I had a fruit smoothie as well. I was expecting it to be a bit more sugary but was ok with it because I don't need the extra sugar anyway.
7/31/2020,20200731,3,3.86,"i was really excited to try this spot bcz the line wasn't long, but my hot dog was disappointing. i thought it would be char grilled, but instead it was just a boiled hotdog kinda thrown together with toppings. the flavor was subpar bcz it was missing the char grill taste, i'll give it another shot and order something else next time."
8/2/2020,20200802,4,3.87,"One of the best spots to vegan food, so good you can't even tell and that's how I like it. So far my favorite is The Who betta burger with vegan cheese and I adore their Cookie Monster shake. Again all vegan but who can tell, not I. Excellent black owned establishment."
8/4/2020,20200804,4,3.87,"Husband and I have been flex vegans for the past 7 months and it was a treat to try this place out. Truly cannot tell it's not meat and the cook herself was the one to bring out our food. Pickles and chips came with our meals, MHM. Support black owned and female chefs!! Will be back."
8/5/2020,20200805,4,3.87,"I ordered the Philly cheesesteak hoagie, the Philly cheesesteak eggrolls, chik'ins . The Philly cheesesteak hoagie and eggrolls were extremely good. I didn't like the chik'ins I did not like the texture. Overall I think everything was good the online ordering process was good. The estimated time for the order to be ready was not that good it took about 15 minutes longer than the time on the order. I am definitely going back for the Philly cheesesteak!"
8/5/2020,20200805,5,3.88,"My first vegan meal experience and it did NOT disappoint, even with the excessive wait due to Corona and good weather on a Sunday. Called the order in and came from Bolingbrook to try it. So amazing! I had the burger and fries with a oreo vegan milkshake. You cannot taste a difference unless you are looking for it. It was great, I'll be back."
8/8/2020,20200808,4,3.88,"We loved the Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls and the ""Who Betta"" Burger. Both were juicy and had lots of flavor. Not fans of the Chi-Town Mild Sauce Fried Chik'in. The chicken is very thick. We weren't expecting to get full so quickly/have that heavy feeling after eating. We also aren't vegan or vegetarian so we're not sure what it was ""supposed"" to taste like either."
8/8/2020,20200808,3,3.87,"Disappointed! I ordered the gyro, but it taste more like sloppy joe and the added hot peppers really through it off. My husband had the pizza puff he didn't enjoy it but I did. I don't think the food was worth $40+ dollars but we tried it due to the reviews."
8/13/2020,20200813,3,3.86,"Okay y'all, I wanted so badly to get more out of this place. I tried to eat here last time I was in town, but they were closed. The owner was there and she was so kind. She gave me a lemonade and told me she'd see me on my next visit. Fire! What a great first interaction, right? So, when I arrived here today at about 3:30 pm, I was excited to see what they had to offer! I placed my order about by five minutes later and anticipated my food. I patiently waited on the outside for 20 minutes. I figured they were a bit busy. The lady at the front desk said she'd call me when it was done. Hmmm, maybe it's done and she needed to see me to remember I hadn't gotten my food yet, yup, maybe that's it. When I walked back inside I realized there were a few people that ordered after me walking out the door, with food. Okay, ""Patience's is a virtue."" I ask the woman that took my order if the food is done yet, she glanced at the bags behind her and said ""No"". ""Okay"", I engaged in a few conversations with other customers, all who arrived after me and left before me. I look up, It's 4:00 pm. I am blown! There is guy from the kitchen that's assisting with the orders. I ask him, if my food is ready. Why did he look at the bag on the counter and hand it to me?!? Woooow! I ask him why didn't she call me when my food was ready, and he replied, ""I'm sorry, I don't know"". Alright, I guess, but where's my shake at? ""It'll be right out"". 4:10 pm hit, and I let them know,I can just get my money back for the shake. He apologizes and lets the lady at the front know. She's in earshot when he tells her I'd like a refund, she continues to write something on a yellow piece of paper and and ask, ""Does she have a receipt?"" I replied, ""Yes, yes I do."" Without looking up, she continued to write on the yellow piece of paper, which I now know as time card.Y'all! That girl said something about working the weekend and to the guy who was starting his shift, and Wales right out without another word. I'm glad she did because it allowed me to see how it was supposed to be done. Soon as an order came out the kitchen he read the name on the bag and called it out twice. If no one answered he went to the next bag. Ooohhh, it's not the system, it's the person they have taking orders. Finally, they arrive with my shake at 4:18 pm.The pros: The food was decent, although it was cold. The and my initial interaction with the owner was good, I'll come back to give it a try.The Cons: The cashier was not personable and she was very nonchalant with making sure customers got their food. I waited in the restaurant for about 20 minutes and didn't see her call not one name on the bag, and when it was time for her to leave, she did, and left the other cashier with a group of irritated customers.Overall: Good food, and as far as the customer service, I'd like to give it another try. I hope it was just a bump in the road, I really want this vegan restaurant to thrive."
8/14/2020,20200814,5,3.87,Hot dog and fries were yum. I'll pass on vegan shrimp. The Cookie Monster shake was one of the best shakes I've had! I'd go back for that alone!
8/20/2020,20200820,2,3.86,"I resent paying GrubHub a fee to order from this restaurant since I picked up my food. What did GrubHub do to earn an extra $3? This restaurant needs to offer a better way to order online for pickup. Don't think I'll be ordering here again if I have to pay extra to avoid ordering at the restaurant and waiting. The food isn't good enough for all that. Also, I asked for condiments in the side and that didn't happen. The greens in my salad were tired and wilted. I couldn't eat the salad, the salad dressing was horrible! I threw the whole thing away. Do better!"
8/24/2020,20200824,5,3.87,"I was looking at places in the city with my vegan sister & we wanted to bring home dinner so we went here. She got the hoagie with vegan cheese & absolutely loved it.

8/25/2020,20200825,5,3.88,"This place is really good. Im the type of person when I go somewhere new I order multiple dishes so I can get a sense of how the restaurant really is. So with that I ordered patty melt it was amazing this place means what it says I can't believe it's not **** meat. Grilled onions amazing with the cheese nice buttery toast to bring it all together .... also had the philly egg rolls man this was pleasant surprise it was a nice little Asian sweet sauce on it the bomb .... ok let's get to the burger ahhhhhh yeah!!!! Don't judge me someone did help me eat this not meat extravaganza "" my wife ""... ok last item chi town chicken they were my least favorite they have a great sauce and seasoned great it's just the pieces are to big for my taste. I guess they wanted to try to make them like they were a breast cut and it's a bit much . If they make them smaller stripes or into small cubes and fried them a little longer to get that great crunch I would definitely revisit them no doubt... If need some fulfilling comfort food especially after or before a night of drinking. This place really delivered. I will be going back. And if you are vegetarian or even if your not this place makes you forget about the politics and serves up just great food ."
9/6/2020,20200906,2,3.86,I was really excited to try this spot. I tried it on a Saturday and was disappointed. The Oreo shake was good but the nachos were subpar. I can make better vegan nachos at home. They forgot the meat and salsa. When I asked them to make a new one the drowned it in cheese and it was super soggy. And overall just basic. NotWorth $14. Decided to give it another go on Sunday. Was again super disappointed with the hotdog. It was cold and not very tasty. Not worth $8. Can't believe it's not meat is 0 for 2. And I'm not going to give it another shot.
9/9/2020,20200909,4,3.86,"Food is good but pro tip: add 20 minutes to whatever time the app say your food will be ready...and don't be surprised when you food is not hot...Update: ordered again and 20 minutes after food was suppose to be ready, I show up....and it is not."
9/10/2020,20200910,5,3.87,"I love this place ! The staff is great, food is made fresh to order and if you pre-order they keep your shake in the freezer so it doesn't defrost . So far I've tried the chicken wings (i think it's wheat gluten based), chicken tenders(Taste just like harolds mild sauce), the burger i keep getting because the texture is great and it's very high in flavor. The Cookie Monster shake is my go to! Now that i moved to the burbs i still make my way out there at least once a month."
9/12/2020,20200912,3,3.86,The food was decent. I had the Philly cheese steak eggroll. I'm happy to support black business but we got to do better on the customer service end. The cashier was busy texting as I was trying to tell her my order. I asked that they wipe off the tables which all had crumbs on them so we could sit outside and no one came to clean them off. It defeats the purpose of having covid friendly seating if people aren't cleaning off the tables.
9/14/2020,20200914,3,3.86,The food is good but slightly overpriced. A few of the women working the front register are unprofessional and will stare you down like you're sleeping with their husbands. Please work on the customer service.
9/16/2020,20200916,4,3.86,I ordered the pizza puff and it was delish! It had real cheese so it was nice and gooey! The only baffling part is how long it takes to complete the order - 45min...however it's was ready at the time they said it would be.
9/21/2020,20200921,4,3.86,"Amazing food- I love this place and have ordered twice in the last week. It tastes like real meat! My only issue is that they are not enforcing mask rules consistently for customers. Lots of people came in without masks while I was there, and they commented on the lack of a sign saying masks were required. I think having a sign would help!"
9/22/2020,20200922,5,3.87,"TL:DR - Food can take a bit to get ready. Eating in, our food was hot. The patty melt was amazing and the fries are super crispy and seasoned, similar to a Rally's/Checker's fry. No indoor seating during COVID, but they do have about four high top tables out front. Price is a tad high, but I think it's still worth it.Man, 100% this place is fire! I was shocked to see it only had 4 stars, but reading some of the comments, I kind of get it.As I said before, I love it when vegan places do food better than their meat counterparts. I will always try to lean towards meat substitutes for environmental reasons, but doesn't mean it has to taste bad. The shop itself is relatively small, during covid there is no indoor seating, there is about four high top tables out front though. It looks like pre-covid they had limited diner-counter top seating.I ordered the patty-melt based on the owner's recommendation, and she was right. That thing was amazing. The ""burger"" was juicy, flavorful, and everything including the toasted bread to the vegan cheese worked beautifully. They also have the best kind of fries, that double fried, super crispy, Rally's type of seasoned fry.Looking at the reviews, a lot of people were complaining about the temperature of the food and how long it took. We ate there, so the temperature wasn't a huge deal. Everything was hot when we ate it. The food did take an abnormally long time though. It was not particularly busy, but we had to wait about 20-25 min for our food, which seemed a bit much for a casual spot.Regardless, this place was good, the menu looks amazing, and I want to try the shakes. I WILL be back."
9/25/2020,20200925,3,3.86,"We ordered an hour in advance and still waited 45 additional mins for our order- our $13 salad didn't come with any dressing( of course we didn't notice till we got home) , the gumbo portion was immensely small for the price we paid. the Buffalo shrimp was good, but the fries weren't cooked all the way/ the cashier had her mask at her chin, didn't look like she wanted to be there, was letting the phone ring over and over... maybe I'll give this place another try when I can eat there and have the product fresh. Really wanted to go here due to social media boost from vegan vendors but I wasn't satisfied for what we spent :("
9/27/2020,20200927,5,3.87,"This was my first time eating here, and my food was delicious! I was more than satisfied, specifically because I usually feel sluggish after most meals, but even after having the chik'n sandwich AND fries, I felt good and still had energy."
9/27/2020,20200927,5,3.88,"There's a restaurant in the Hyde Park area called ""Can't Believe It's Not Meat... they offer an array of great non- meat meals... but I was taken by the smoothies lol. Colorful with with a full flavor taste and some of the smoothie names are a hoot lol.Wow, not only good location ... but a friendly staff kudos to them giving them four **** stars  Gabriella - GI' IACOMO Magazine Creative Dir./CEO"
9/28/2020,20200928,1,3.86,"I was super excited to try this restaurant on the basis of some of the reviews in addition to pictures of the food that were posted. I am a pescatarian and wanted to try a black owned vegan restaurant. However, the food was underwhelming. The ""chicken"" sandwich had an instant after taste that was a bit weird, and the gumbo tasted as though it came directly from a can. While I could live with the ""shrimp"" it lacked seasoning. Not to mention while the awning on the outside of the restaurant boasts that it is a black owned restaurant, I did not see one black worker in sight. I was definitely disappointed with this experience."
10/3/2020,20201003,4,3.86,"I can't speak for the service bc I did takeout. but the burger with fries and egg roll is amazing! Absolutely delicious. The egg roll is filled w a cashew cheese and ground bean. No soy! It's so fulfilling. The fries are better than Checkers, thick and crunchy. The burger is charbroiled like BK. I'm not a vegan but I wholeheartedly enjoyed. A must try."
10/15/2020,20201015,1,3.84,"First full day in Chicago and I decided to embark on the journey to get here. When I arrived at restaurant, order was ready and I checked when I stepped outside of the doors. Order was incorrect and I went back in and stated everything on the burger I wanted, wasn't included. Lady responded, ""Well, that's what you ordered on the app."" I opened app and showed her and read to her what was ordered. The man attempted to co-sign on what she said. I was taken back by the lack of customer service, resistance to remedy the situation, and the dryness in the response when I asked about a BOGO deal. I support BOBs nationwide when I travel and it's been a good minute since I have received the stereotypical behavior at one. Didn't appreciate the mediocre behavior; understand the restaurant was going to close in 30 minutes but at least act like you enjoy your job."
10/25/2020,20201025,5,3.85,Cheeseburger was amazing I really enjoyed the flavor the fries were great. I wish it was dine in
10/26/2020,20201026,5,3.86,"Ordered delivery through DoorDash. We ordered:- Pizza Puff: Delightfully herby with fresh spinach- Philly Cheesesteak: Tasty ""steak"" crumbles with a soft, fluffy bun- Bucktown Bratwurst: Brat was delicious with good texture- Hoagie: Giardiniera topping has the right kick -- sour & mildly spicy.Everything but the hoagie came with crunchy fries that re-heated well in the toaster oven the following day. They also came with a generous amount of vegetables. 53rd street's food options are pretty meh but this place stands out."
11/1/2020,20201101,5,3.86,Get the eggrolls with vegan cheese extra chili sauce I have eaten it everyday for the month of September 2019. Have to have it within my 12 hour work shift. I also love the cheese burger add vegan bacon and the pizza puff. Do not get the lasagna that is my only thing for some reason it have bow tie noodles and I don't like that. It's just not what I wanted then I saw lasagna it should be called the pasta. However I have never had a bad egg roll no eggs in it but child it taste so good. Lol I just placed my order as I wrote this. I love being a vegan now because honest I can't cook and i was starting to get tired of raw fruits and vegetables. You must go here. And it is approved by me some gentleman from Chicago that has been trying to be vegan for a while but all vegan raw meals are nasty except here. Wo child.
11/1/2020,20201101,5,3.87,"I was craving a vegan burger and went on Uber eats and saw this was a new restaurants added and decided to try. I was not disappointed this spot is amazing, plus it's a black owned business which is always awesome to support!! This is one of the best vegan spots in chi. I got their burger and the wings and the burger was phenomenal. The sauces and toppings and patty was so on point. The fries were amazing as well and the wings were good. My new go to spot for a burger!"
11/4/2020,20201104,5,3.88,I have ordered food from this restaurant before and I have never been disappointed in my options. I loved the pizza puff. This time I ordered the vegan chicken sandwich with vegan cheese. My husband who is avid meat eater enjoyed every bite of my pizza puff. I will be back to try some other menu items or at least order a pizza puff.
11/11/2020,20201111,1,3.86,"They use Boca soy meat substitute for everything, the food is not worth the wait time, soy, soy and more soy, they have a pic of Dr. Sebi but if you know dr. Sebi .. he would not advocate for such a place."
11/13/2020,20201113,5,3.87,"We ordered delivery last night. It was great.Southwest Taco Salad- Delicious. I ordered without cheese. This was one of the best taco salads I've had, even when I ate meat! It was a good salad base of greens and tomatoes with plenty of great tasting taco ""meat"" and sprinkled with green onions and tortilla strips. It was a great balance of ingredients, and actually healthy as well as tasty! Same with the salad dressing!Chick'n sandwich- Amazing. I ordered without mayo. This was a fantastic sandwich. The seasoned fries that came with are perfect. Well flavored, great texture.Cookie Monster Shake-Fine. I still dairy, so I would prefer a real milk shake. But that said, this shake was still decent.A previous time we ordered food and I had chick'n nuggets. They were great too!I will gladly order the Southwest Taco salad, chick'n sandwich and chick'n nuggets again!"
11/15/2020,20201115,5,3.87,"If you are looking for a plant based restaurant with delicious flavor, look no further, Can't Believe it's Not Meat is your place. The menu has so many options. First time ordering and I order the ""Who Betta"" Burger with vegan cheese and all the fixings, mouth watering! Place your order online and pickup in person. The process was easy and hassle free. I will be back! #blackownedbusiness"
11/22/2020,20201122,5,3.88,"Talk about a delicious alternative to eating meat. This place was suggested to me by one of my friends that has become a vegetarian and loves going here.Delivery or pick up is available, but prepare to wait because everything is cooked fresh when you order it. Saturday's can be tough because they are only open a few hours in the evening so EVERYONE is trying to order.The Big Mic - their version of a Big Mac sandwich. It tastes amazing. If you eat Turkey burgers, this will taste even better.Loaded fries - delicious.Philly cheesesteak - be sure to get cheese (I got extra). If not while the ""meat"" is good, I feel like it can be a little dry.Pizza poof - A very veggie version of a pizza puff!Lemonade - I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's to die for!This is a tiny place that lacks a big flavor punch!"
11/22/2020,20201122,5,3.89,"The lasagna is soooo damn delicious. You will not care that it doesn't contain meat. It's very filling and could be eaten by one person over several days...if you have supreme willpower The Vegan big mac looking burger was also off the chain.I've lived in Chicago for over 10 years, I finally had my first pizza puff experience here. It was seasoned and tasty. I didn't really care for the fries but if seasoned fries are your thing, you'll like them. I prefer handcut/steak style fries. You can order online which is great. I suggest you do that because this place is popular."
11/30/2020,20201130,3,3.88,Ok for the vegan and veggie purists who insist that this isn't healthy vegan and veggie. Let it go. First off it's no meat so that alone should give patrons extra brownie points for sparing animals. Second I give props on the Who Betta Burger it is a really good impossible burger. The minus is I just wish there was more portion size given on this burger and sides are extra. Third Cheese Steak is no where near tasting like a cheesesteak. It really should be named something else. It's decent but no cheesesteak like taste at all. Fourth the Buffalo Shrimp are pretty good. Please give more portion though
12/19/2020,20201219,4,3.88,A year ago I moved to the Hyde Park area and decided to walk around the neighborhood and discover the most delicious so so good tangy smoothies on 53rd Street.... Can't Believe it's Not Meat have the best smoothies and nachos omgawd... and their smoothies names are a hoot lol
1/23/2021,20210123,5,3.89,GO SUPPORT THIS MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! I LOVE this place. To have a black-owned plant-based restaurant within 5 minutes walk of where I live is totally a game changer. Their meat substitute is also one of the best i've ever tasted. Great job and beautiful inside space even though it's closed because of COVID-19. They need to give me a sponsorship or a punch card or something as much as I tell my friends about them lol.
1/30/2021,20210130,4,3.89,Orland park location is open and it was super busy! All in all the food was great but I was disappointed in what it looked like when I got home. I spent a good amount of money in the Orland park location today!Update: they contacted me and were very apologetic! Like I said the place is very good so I'd definitely go back!
2/1/2021,20210201,4,3.89,"tried it out today for the first time! Love that they are making all the classic ""meat"" heavy meals vegan and it's right next to soul shack! A great addition to Hyde park. I got the taco salad and it was really good. I would have liked it a little more hearty/bigger for the price I paid but it was tasty! The burgers looked amazing but wanted a lighter meal today. I will be back for the burgers and shakes. My meat eating friend loved the sandwiches and burgers shes tried!"
2/3/2021,20210203,5,3.9,Had a mixup where my order was taken by a different customer. Try re-fired my order immediately and hooked us up with some apps. All in all a good experience with some excellent vegan/veggie options.
2/6/2021,20210206,5,3.91,"I had the Italian beef, it was awesome! So was the Buffalo wings. I am very happy I found this place and will be heading back!"
2/21/2021,20210221,5,3.91,"I can't believe I haven't heard about this place before. I went for the first time today. Was greeted by very friendly people. But the reason for this review is their Patty Melt with the non dairy cheese. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best Patty melt I have ever had in my life. This is how a Patty Melt is supposed to taste. After each bite, I kept saying Oh My God.This is unbelievable. It tasted better than meat, juicy, grilled perfectly, toasted perfectly. I have decided to come here once a week to have a Patty melt. I have been to so many restaurants in the past and have ordered a patty melt when I had a taste for it and after todays nothing compared to this. Really best in the U.S.A. Sorry, other restaurants. and it's not salty. I am very sensitive to salt and this was seasoned perfectly. To the chef today, you made my day and please do not change your recipe and seasoning and how you make this. I'll be back next week! One more thing, it looks just like the picture on their website."
2/25/2021,20210225,5,3.92,Bad and Bougie smoothie is delicious!!! Also tried the gumbo & boneless Buffalo wings. Good flavors & will definitely be back to try more!
3/13/2021,20210313,5,3.93,"My #1 go-to spot for vegetarian food.I recently moved to Chicago from NYC and finding tasty vegan/vegetarian friendly options was difficult. Can't Believe It's Not Meat pop-up one day on my search and gave it a try. I am so happy that I did.The food is amazing! I always order the Philly Cheesesteak w/ extra cheese (dairy) and it is by far the best Philly cheesesteak I've had even compared to when I did eat meat. My other favorite is the Who betta burger. When my spouse and I tried it, we had to second guess ourselves if it was vegan. We took a double take at each other, at the burger, smelled it haha we almost made a complaint. That's how great it is!!! It was a funny moment.After writing this post, I am craving it."
3/15/2021,20210315,4,3.93,"I'm not a vegetarian. I actually love meat. I ordered the vegan Philly cheesesteak egg rolls and I literally couldn't believe it wasn't meat. I've always been able to tell with other ""impossible burgers"" but with these egg rolls, I had to double check the menu before letting my vegetarian friend have a bite because I was that convinced it was ground beef. My friend said she could tell it was missing the fattiness of beef but that it was very good. I could tell the difference with the vegan cheese but had no regrets. Aside from the non-meat of it all, the egg rolls themselves were good and decently filling. I liked the crunch of the egg rolls and the sweet chili sauce it came with. The fries were perfect. The only thing preventing me from regularly eating here is it's on the pricier side (~$17 for 2 egg rolls cut in half and fries) and it's hard/expensive to get delivered. The food also seemed pretty oily/fried so I would be very curious to see how healthy it actually is compared to non-vegan options. That being said, I'm definitely intrigued and would want to come back and try some of their other options!"
4/2/2021,20210402,1,3.91,"This is my second time at the Orland location and the second time that I was messed up. I ordered the Big Mik and each time I ask for no pickles. The first time I had it, there was 1-2 which didn't bother me too much but today, it was loaded with them. So much that the bun was soaking from the juice. I was unable to enjoy my meal it all. I honestly wouldn't give any stars for this trip but the lemonade saved it."
4/3/2021,20210403,5,3.92,"Anybody that is a McDonald's regular knows that, despite the consistency, no two McDonald's are the same. Some have under salted fries; others take too long to make your order but deliver on freshness.Lately, several McD's in the city have disappointed in their feature offering: the Big Mac. Whether too floppy, too much sauce, stale or some combination of these, I haven't had a good Big Mac in a while.I showed up in the middle of a Saturday rush at Can't Believe It's Not Meat, with two lines out the door, and chose the Big Mik, the Big Mac style sandwich. My partner chose the Shrimp Po Boy, and we shared a Bad and Boujee smoothie and cookies. The front person gave us a 25 minute wait window, so we went around the neighborhood for a walk.We returned at the end of the window just in time. A long time, but the first sight was worth it: a Big Mik with the classic triple decker sesame bun, chiffenaude lettuce, pickles and the special sauce. The po boy looked remarkable too. The fries looked and tasted like Popeyes Cajun fries. All is well.The Big Mik...after several disappointments, I am happy to say that it was the best Big Mac I've had in a while, meat or no meat. The veggie patties had some good, consistent and crispy texture, the sauce was perfectly balanced and even the lettuce was worth picking off the box. From beginning to end, it felt like the Big Mac I had been seeking all over town.This place dares you look at the food in disbelief that it's not meat. I choose to disagree. It's just as good, if not better, than any meat counterpart. Definitely making my way down here again!"
4/3/2021,20210403,4,3.92,"Ain't gonna lie, that Big Mik was on point. Definitely going here again for that and other entrees."
4/11/2021,20210411,2,3.9,"I have wanted to try this establishment for some time now & was happy to make the venture, finally. I took my son along with me for a quick lunch. We ordered the New Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls, Tacos, Cookie Monster Shake, & the nachos. It took approximately 25 minutes to receive my order, but we waited in the car & received a text to return, overall not too bad. My son loved his shake finishing it all & wishing we had more. The tacos were okay, as were the nachos. I think that's the problem. I get that meat substitutes are still slightly higher priced than meat & less healthy options, but $14 for three mediocre tacos with no sides, no pizzazz, nothing to note outside of ""its not meat"" & $13 for Not- Your- Average Nachos that were exactly that...average, is disheartening. My goal here is not to rip this business apart, but; as it stands, this is not restaurant-quality food, in my opinion. This is me stopping by Jewel, paying $8 for a pound of Beyond Beef & making nachos & tacos for my family. Finally, the Philly Cheesesteak Eggrolls were a disaster. There is no way around it. My guess is the egg rolls were cooked in advance & probably sat under a heat lamp. The won ton was gummy and difficult to eat. What further disappointed me about my dining experience is the sweet chili sauce poured over my egg rolls. Why anyone would think it's a great idea to pour this sauce all over the egg rolls that were not freshly fried will forever be lost on me. Furthermore, not everyone will appreciate the combination of mayo & sweet chili sauce. I, for one, found it to be somewhat off-putting. I honestly feel that this visit was a waste of $50. I can not justly recommend this business to anyone."
4/14/2021,20210414,5,3.91,Always a hit! Definitely can not tell it's not meat. I love this place! Nachos are fire the tacos and cookies too! That's all I've tried so far lol
4/24/2021,20210424,5,3.92,"O-M-G they came highly recommended by a friend upon our visit to Chicago. Asked staff for favorites and they did not disappoint. Hubby is picky and he even agreed that the philly's were awesome minus jalapeño (he don't do spicy) I forgot. Added Lasagna to go (vegan) of course and it was enough for 3 servings in one entree. We don't have any pictures as we ate in the car immediately before we realized it, . We will be back on our next day trip come May. Thank you"
4/25/2021,20210425,5,3.92,"I ordered the Philly eggrolls and the loaded nacho fries. Both meals were excellent. The loaded fries are too much for one to eat alone. I'm not sure if you could tell from these two meals that it was actually vegan ""meat. "" I will definitely be returning."
5/3/2021,20210503,5,3.93,First time eating here and I loved it! I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I would have never known those burgers were plant based and the cheese was vegan. Soooo good and worth the wait! Plus it's black owned! Smoothies are good too.
5/12/2021,20210512,4,3.93,Tasty food place! My Boyfriend said that the burger was one of the best veggie burgers he's ever had in his life!
5/17/2021,20210517,3,3.93,My friend has been wanting to try this place for awhile...finally found ourselves in the area on a beautiful day so it was a no brained for lunch. Things to know before you go:1) carry out only so unless you live close be prepared to find a spot to eat your meal.2) orders take about 15-20 minutes3) service was friendly 4) my friend enjoyed her Big Mik burger but it was nothing to go out of our way for5) I really tried to like the vegan Italian beef but the 'meat' texture was rubbery - kind of like squid/calamari and it just wasn't for me.Service was good so I suggest you try it for yourself and decide if 'vegan meat' is your thing. Nice walking around area
5/20/2021,20210520,3,3.92,"this place has really good food, i love the pizza puff, oreo milkshake, and big mik! i just wish the portions matched the prices. my burger comes out to $20 when i add extra stuff on it, still hungry afterwards."
5/24/2021,20210524,5,3.93,"Just like the title implies, you really won't believe it's not meat! Honestly, I thought they served me beef tacos.... the flavor and texture was so spot on. Everything on the menu looked amazing so I will definitely be back!"
5/26/2021,20210526,1,3.91,The food is good but the staff made me feel not welcoming a little unprofessional too young of staff. Love the hyde park area the service could be better.
6/1/2021,20210601,5,3.92,"When I was out in Oakland, I tried a spot called Vegan Mob, which was very delicious. I decided when I get back; I will try our Vegan restaurant called "" Can't believe it's not meat."" Yes, I can't believe it's not meat. I had the burger and fries, and It was so good. The flavor was mouth-watering. My brother had the giant burrito , and he could not stop smiling. He said it was better than any burrito he ever had. I have to say the burrito was huge. I recommend you must try it."
6/7/2021,20210607,5,3.92,"I love meat, but want to eat less of it. I finally tried this place and was pleasantly surprised! I had the Big Mick burger with fries and loved it. I won't try to compare the taste to a real hamburger. I'll just say that it was really good. The fries were well seasoned and crispy even after sitting in the bag for 10 minutes as I walked home. It was a bit expensive (about $20 including tip) and took 15-20 minutes, but those are the only small drawbacks. I'll definitely be trying other items on the menu."
6/8/2021,20210608,5,3.93,Amazing food every time I order. Can't wait for my next cheat meal! My favorite is the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls with extra sauce. The fries were absolutely delish also. Great portions also !
6/8/2021,20210608,5,3.93,"Food is amazing! I love the Philly Cheese Rolls, Double ""Who Betta"" Burger with cheese, Pizza Poof w/ Mild Sauce, and the Cookie Monster Shake."
6/14/2021,20210614,5,3.94,"Great spot for vegetarian/vegan eats & Probably the best in the Chicagoland area! We ordered online for carryout everything remained hot and tasted great even with the 30 min drive home. My boyfriend who is a meat eater said it even surprised him how tasty it was and he didn't feel like he missed the meat consistency like he usually does with other plant base / fake meat meals. Thank you Can't believe it's not meat team for giving me that ""meat"" fix when I have the craving :)"
6/16/2021,20210616,5,3.95,"Soooo I've been here like 4-5 time prior to me posting this review and firstly I must say I think everyone is agreement that the ""Bad And Boujee""Smoothie is the best menu item. Lol But moving on in my several visits I've tried the burger multiple times (not a fan of double patty, had my stomach ROCKIN) delicious though. The Philly cheesesteak was good, I also got to try my friends chicken nuggets and chicken tenders they were both chicken like. Also was able to try the pizza puff. I got it with regular cheese because I'm not a vegan, I've gotten all the above sandwiches with dairy cheese. All of the above were good. But the star of the party since I start going to this establishment has been the Bad and Boujee. It's like a piece of candy in a cup and you feel kind of sinful enjoying it as much as you do thinking ""this can't be healthy"". Go get yourself a Bad and Boujee and taste their unbelievably not meat options."
6/16/2021,20210616,5,3.95,"I had lunch with my friends on 6/16 and had a wonderful experience at Can't Believe It's Not Meat! Aniyah (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) is an excellent cashier and was very patient as we worked our way through the menu to make a decision. We had the burger, Brat, milkshakes and very Berry smoothie. All our food was delicious and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio. Maurice helped get our order out quickly and even made it possible for me to make a last min switch on my shake flavor. My friends were visiting from out of town and very grateful to have such a wonderful experience. Love this place and will be back! Shop and buy Black!"
6/26/2021,20210626,2,3.94,Horrible!!!!!!!!! The Italian beef was horrible! Tastes like bologna. Nothing 'beefy' about it at all. Taste or texture. The burger was sooooooo dry & barely flavorful. This picture is of after I ate. Waste of $40. The shake was good though. I wouldn't come back here at all
7/5/2021,20210705,5,3.95,"Can't believe is one of my favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurants. They have so many amazing food options! It's so exciting that they have childhood dishes that I grew up eating veganized. Some of my favorite items are the Philly cheesesteak eggrolls, pizza poof, patty melt, Buffalo shrimp, pizza poof, Cookie Monster shake, and soo many more to list! Chef Fab the owner always has amazing ideas for the menu, and I get so happy when she adds new items because you know they will be delicious. Pictures featured: Pizza poof, Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls, loaded fries, nachos, cheesesteak, lasagna, Italian beef, Buffalo shrimp (without sauce), patty melt and Cookie Monster shake. Food Instagram: @vegangirl_chicago"
7/8/2021,20210708,5,3.95,"My goodness this food is absolutely ridiculous! It is so freakin tasty!!!! Vegan? Nope unreal! This is absolutely the BEST vegan food I have ever had! We ordered:The Philly Egg Rolls The Philly SandwichThe Patty MeltThe Big MikThe Shrimp Po-BoyEpitome Berry Shake""Cookie Monster"" ShakeAll of it was absolutely delicious!"
7/16/2021,20210716,3,3.95,"Just ordered the burrito and it was cold. When I called them, they were not taking calls which was a big inconvenience. Overall, I didn't care for Big Burrito. If I would have had more time, I would have taken it back"
7/22/2021,20210722,4,3.95,"Will you wait for an eternity to get your food despite arriving 10 minutes after UberEats says ""your order is ready for pickup""? Yes. Will it cost you an obscene amount of money that will make you think ""I could have just gotten groceries""? Yes. Will it be worth it because the food is so good and sorta kinda healthy? Probably. I've eaten here a few times and I would say 70% of the time, the food is amazing (I especially suggest the Big Mick, which I probably had 3 times in one week when I 1st tried it). The only downside to this restaurant is that the food quality is a crapshoot. The other 30% of the time I've gotten cold fries, gummy sausages, empty pizza puffs, etc., which is really hard to excuse when the cost is so high.I still recommend this restaurant, just maybe check your food before you leave."
7/31/2021,20210731,5,3.95,"This place is absolutely amazing I drove from Indy to Hyde Park Chicago IL. I tried everything I could fit in my belly the food was just that amazing. First the place was clean, customer service was excellent and I even met the owner! She was absolutely a dear and offered to me ifI didn't like the food I could try something else. But we loved everything. We tried the chick'n wings and fries whatever the sauce was poured overThe chick'n & fries was amazing. They put a sugar can stick in the wings. They are well seasoned and tasty. Since I've been vegan this is the taste I've been looking forward to. My husband tried the Big Fish, I had a piece of his fish and yes it was all that and more. The chick'n sandwich was just delicious and flavorful. The desserts were rich and savory. But that's not it we went back to get a snack for the hotel we picked up the Philly steak cheese egg rolls and Chik'n nuggets. Both were very satisfying and perfect for a late night snack! We willfor sure be returning!!!"
8/1/2021,20210801,4,3.95,Very good food and friendly service. I've been vegan for years now and I've been waiting for a restaurant like this for years.
8/8/2021,20210808,5,3.96,There's nothing I can say but the title fits the name absolutely amazing I find myself craving a Philly cheesesteak and I want there's instead of the traditional philly spot
8/19/2021,20210819,4,3.96,"Whewwww this food was AMAZING have you ever had vegan philly cheese steaks egg rolls nom nom nom sooooo good! I ordered them for an appetizer but it's a full meal so I saved the rest for later, great snack. The Italian beef was good but I should of ordered the dip on the side it made the bread soggy and the sandwich really messy to eat. You better believe I'll be back to try more items on the menu. I love that it's in Hyde park it's such a vibe over there. The restaurant is small so there is no indoor seating they had a couple tables outside to eat at. Give them some time to put together your order we ordered online and still waited ten or so minutes but we used that time to walk around."
8/19/2021,20210819,1,3.94,I enjoyed it but something tasted weird and off. I got food poisoning 2 hours later. Worst 24 hours ever worse than when I had covid
8/20/2021,20210820,5,3.95,"I JUST HAD THE ROCKSTAR LEVEL VEGAN FOOD! The title of this spot is exactly correct! As I ate my food....scarfed down my food...I questioned whether it was vegan a couple times! It is JUST that good! I couldn't decide between the Italian Beef, Big Milk, or the Pizza Poof. Yes! I considered ordering them all. But I settled on the Pizza Poof. Why? Because I love Chicago style food and I have SO missed being able to eat pizza puffs for years since I gave up pork years before going vegan! The added feature of mild sauce made it even more worth it!Tip...if you are visiting and staying downtown...UberEats was much more affordable than actually catching an Uber to go to the place. Another tip...don't call to ask questions...no one would answer. Then I received text messages saying to text my order or question...but no one responded. (To management: Visitors to the city want to try things and may have questions. It would be great to be able to ask questions before ordering).Now back to the food! OMG! I ordered the pizza Poof and very Sauce they sold to be able to try them out. The epitome sauce is a creamy type of sauce (ahh...not my style), the sweet heat was like a sweet chili sauce, if you are from the Chi, just stick with the mild and Buffalo sauce. The pizza poof was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I got it with vegan cheese. It tasted like a pizza poof with some added leafy veggie. You can't go wrong with this one! I opened it up, poured mild and the hot sauce on the fries, sat there pizza poof on top and went to work! Will definitely be back! Hoping to try something else tomorrow before I fly out."
8/25/2021,20210825,5,3.95,"Finally got to have fully loaded nachos & ""meat"" lasagna!! Loved this vegan gem while visiting family in Hyde Park. Food was so tasty, plentiful & amazingly vegan!! Will be back on my next visit!!!"
8/25/2021,20210825,1,3.94,"I have been hearing a lot of good things about this restaurant, so I decided to try it tonight. I was in town on business, and I ordered my meal through Ubereats. I ordered the pizza poof and I must say, it was almost inedible. The outside shell was greasy and a little overcooked, and the filling had a very weird taste to it. I was very disappointed."
8/27/2021,20210827,4,3.94,"OK, I'm going to start with my biggest complaint, and that is that they don't open until 4 PM on Saturdays. This is by far my best day to get up to the city, but that opening time makes it tricky. In fact, I would have made the trip a lot sooner if they had been open earlier.But when my husband and I actually had a Friday off together, we were able to get up there and finally try this restaurant. I had the POPS BIG FISH SANDWICH ($13.95), a vegan fish fillet topped with red leaf lettuce, tomatoes, house made tartar sauce , and your choice of cheese. My husband had the Patty Melt ($13.50), a Vegan Burger Patty, cheese, grilled onions, and vegan mayo on grilled wheat bread. Both of our entrees were delicious. They both came with fries, which were less than impressive. We'd ordered online, and I'd requested a side of mayo, but there wasn't any included with our order."
9/2/2021,20210902,3,3.93,"This is the second time ordering from this restaurant. I want to love their food but it's mediocre at best. I got the drum sticks which were ok, fries were really good but I'm not paying for the side dish to be the star. I also got the lasagna or should I say the bow time time pasta drowned in tomato sauce with little to no cheese. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't what I ordered. I think I'll stick to other vegetarian/vegan restaurants and avoid the long trip to there."
9/28/2021,20210928,2,3.92,"I love the idea of the restaurant and was so excited to try it. Drove here from Indianapolis and stoped by. Parking nearby was not great, which is fine... it's Chicago! Happily walked there, and having no line was a plus! Customer service was not very good, honestly. Asked the gentleman working there if there were gluten free and soy free options and unfortunately, there isn't! So sad!!! I'm eat vegan cuisines regularly, but have food allergies. So sad to know they don't accommodate folks with these type of food restrictions. My sister happens to love their pizza puff and my other friends were able to happily choose. As for myself, I was so disappointed to learn that I couldn't have anything from there."
10/5/2021,20211005,5,3.93,Always crowded but for good reason. Food is ON POINT. My favorite are the philly egg rolls and the patty melt. Everything is delicious but be careful not to go too often it's not healthy . Happy to see black businesses thriving!
10/9/2021,20211009,3,3.93,"This only gets three stars because I like the concept, but it was overly priced and came out lukewarm. I wanted something fresh and hot for my money."
10/15/2021,20211015,2,3.92,"I ordered from this restaurant twice . The food is good however the customer service needs improvement. First , customers can only communicate with the restaurant through text messages (weird). Second, they sent me the incorrect order one time and when I texted the restaurant to let them know , I never received an apology or a response , resolution from them . Customer service will make or break a company . Anyway , because this restaurant lacks poor communication , I will never order from them again !"
11/15/2021,20211115,5,3.92,"Where do I start? This place, small as it is, packs a large punch. The philly cheese steak is nicely seasoned with all the appropriate toppings. It was great know that all the plant-based meat was made in-house using their own recipe. So no Impossible here....YAY! That knowledge alone elevated the food experience. Next on my plate was the lasagna. It was great in texture and has sweet-but-savory taste that left me wanting more! That said, the lasagna is a generous portion that can easily feed two people. The philly steak egg roll was sweet, innovative and exceptionally delicious! The Chicago Dog had all the great topping you can expect from this Windy City staple. Last but certainly not least, the snickerdoodle cupcake was a great finisher! Overall this place is truly 5 stars in taste and customer service."
11/26/2021,20211126,1,3.91,No employees wearing masks. Yelp won't let me post a short review. You have to wonder if they can't follow simple rules like wearing masks can they follow other simple rules like washing their hands after using the bathroom?
12/21/2021,20211221,5,3.91,Tons of delicious options for our picky vegan! We visited two different locations while in town and were not disappointed.
12/29/2021,20211229,5,3.92,"I may not like everything on the menu but I LOVE to see y'all thriving & if people don't like y'all business, they can just STAY AWAY. Folks in Hyde park love to run sh*t that's not theirs! The Philly is my favorite & the best Philly I've had even when I ate meat.. Period."
1/21/2022,20220121,5,3.92,"The best vegan/meat alternative in the entire city!! They live up to their name because in initially trying, I literally could not believe it was not meat. The food was tasty, the service was friendly, and I received my food promptly. I highly recommend 'Can't Believe it's Not Meat' for all your vegan or veggie needs! Or if you are simply in the mood for supporting a Black Owned Business. You won't regret it and also may actually prefer to eat here than places that serve meat lolI was met with so many options as their menu had sooo many meatless faves from pizza puffs, 'wings', burgers, and even 'hot dogs'. I landed on the 'Philly Cheesesteak' rolls. When I say DELICIOUS!!!! It was jam packed with flavor, the roll has a good crunch/crisp, it was nice and cheesy and again, I could not believe it was not meat! It taste better than some philly cheesesteak rolls I have had with actual meat. I also appreciated that in ordering you had an option of vegan cheese or dairy cheese. Absolutely amazing! I highly recommend. Go get you some, support black owned businesses!"
1/27/2022,20220127,5,3.93,I'm not a vegan but I heard great things about this restaurant. Omg I'm so glad I tried it I had the Big Mik bang bang shrimpPhilly cheese steak egg rolls washed it all down with a smoothie I will eat here again a must try for a Vegan or non vegan you won't be disappointed!!!!
1/30/2022,20220130,4,3.93,"As the name of this place says, I just can't believe it. Can't Believe It's Not Meat is one of these all vegetarian places that seem to be popping up everywhere lately. It has a few locations including this one in Hyde Park. High prices are the only bad thing you'll get. There's pretend versions of burgers, hot dogs, and more. Going through Hyde Park we searched for vegan options and this was at the top of the list so we headed here. It looks a whole lot like a fast food place. There's a counter to order at and they call your name to pick your order up. Line wasn't that long but it still was a kind of long wait to get food. The cooking process is slower than fast food so don't be fooled by the looks, they actually do real cooking here. We went and placed orders. For drinks we chose the shakes because these all sounded good. It's $7 for most shakes, and these have no milk. These are a pretty big size so it's a good price for these. I had a Cookie Monster Shake because it sounded like the best. It's made with Oreos, vegan ice cream, and vegan whipped cream. This was kick ass cool literally. I had a Hot Diggity Chili Dog. It's $10.50 each. This has vegan chili, choice of cheese, and onions. It's vegan if you substitute the cheese. This is an additional charge, and this is how things add up. Be careful what you add. That already expensive meal will cost even more. She had some fake chicken sandwich that smelled good. This was about the same price as a hot dog and some others. Expensive but she says it was good. The prices are too high but you can't deny people like eating this kind of stuff. Has so much vegan food to choose from. It has options that before were impossible to get, like egg rolls made without eggs, and pizza puffs. The prices are very high for what looks like fast food but believe it has much better taste."

The only way I could improve it is if I could bite directly into a cow.I do, however, try to make vegan and vegetarian choices when I can, and thanks to CBINM I could do it for every meal if calories weren't a thing. This food was AMAZING. I had a big stupid grin on my face the whole way home because of how good it was.I went with two friends who are vegetarian, but not vegan. The main reason they aren't vegan is because of cheese, but I think this food would make it a much easier transition.We had:- Boneless Buffalo Wings- Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls- Pizza Poof- Nachos- Cheese Sticks- Cookie Monster ShakeThe only thing I didn't really enjoy was the pizza poof - the seasoning of the ""beef"" just didn't work for me but the texture was very convincing. The boneless wings were good, but seemed like pretty standard vegan wings. The egg rolls, nachos and cheese sticks were SO GOOD! Their fries were also very good - both well cooked and well seasoned.We did choose dairy cheese where cheese was involved, but the cheese sticks were made with vegan jalapeno cheese and were amazing. I took some home to my fellow meat-loving partner and he loved them too.The Cookie Monster shake might be the best shake I've ever had - vegan OR dairy.We had wanted to try the buffalo shrimp but they were out of it. Definitely will go back to try it!The service was so friendly and welcoming. We didn't realize they closed at 9 until they started mopping the floor and while she didn't rush us out we of course hurried to leave because we aren't a-holes.Whether you're vegan or not, you should absolutely try this spot. If this is the direction vegan food is headed, I'm excited!*We actually went to the Old Town location but I don't see that location on Yelp. Also the website said they only have pizza at Orland Park but it seemed like they had pizza at OT."
2/3/2022,20220203,5,3.94,"Officially obsessed with this place! Truly incredible plant based meals that taste like the real deal. They have three locations in Chicagoland, and they are an amazing black owned restaurant. I tried the pry melt and Cookie Monster shake. AMAZING and I can't wait to go back to try more!"
2/3/2022,20220203,5,3.94,I thoroughly enjoyed this food especially The Philly cheesesteak. I have been having such a urge for that and I couldn't believe it wasn't me.. It's very good and tasty. I ended up eating the leftovers the next day and it was really good steel nice flavor and trimmings. I highly recommend.
2/4/2022,20220204,4,3.94,"I am all for Frankenfood if it helps preserve the planet and save animals, and was strongly attracted to a photo of these folks' vegetarian Italian beef sandwich in the online New York Times. I went out and scored one, and it was lovely, as were the staff. It was pretty pricey, though, and while it tasted fine I had the sense that it contained a lot of salt. Not sure whether the latter is inevitable with Italian beef, real or fake--it may well be. I plan to explore the menu further once the weather improves."
2/5/2022,20220205,5,3.95,Great vegan-friendly food with a welcoming atmosphere. The philly egg rolls are the a must!
2/9/2022,20220209,4,3.95,"I went to Hyde Park with my friends and we are searching for a place to eat. There is various spot to eat in Hyde Park but this spot did take our interests. We are so curious even when we were on the way to the place because just like its name we are doubting and at the same time to find a spot that doesn't have meat on their food. So, we arrived in the spot it is small and the atmosphere was really nice and casual. The staffs are very friendly and accommodating too. We are ordering and amazed by their wide selection on their menu with burgers, sandwiches and all and I cannot help but ask the staff if the food does not really have meat and the staff said yes. We ordered and while we are seated, we are still talking about the food and we are excited to see what does it taste and look like. Then, our orders were served. I got a betta burger and a cookie monster shake. I was like ""is this serious"" because the burger tastes so good that if I haven't known that it isn't meat then I would not able to know that it really isn't and that is how exactly it tastes like. My friend and I were amazed but at the same time definitely enjoyed the food. I recommend this lovely spot in Hyde Park. The only downside I can say that is the food is pricey and opposite to the usual and expected price for it."
2/11/2022,20220211,5,3.95,Chicago good made out of plants. Best way to describe. Trust...you won't know the difference.
2/17/2022,20220217,4,3.95,"The Buffalo Fried Chicken was delicious; I just wish it came with a spicier sauce option. It's very mild as is. The fries are yum. The berry shake is delicious but not thick, like I like my shakes. It's also small for the price point. Who Betta Burger was a sloppy good mess! I hate a dry burger. This was juicy with the right amount of sauce. I added bacon but discovered that I'm not a fan of their bacon. Chicken sandwich was delicious. The addition of the honey mustard really sets it off! Buffalo Chicken sandwich was also delicious. Buffalo Shrimp had good flavor but I disliked the rubbery consistency of the shrimp. They'd fare better with a yam based vegan protein shrimp. Even though I didn't love everything I had here, it's pretty freakin amazing for vegan junk food. There have been new additions since I last visited, so I'm excited to try more of their menu."
3/5/2022,20220305,5,3.96,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT MEAT! The burger was so convincing that I refuse to believe. I like the amount of sauce and toppings they add to their burger. The fries are flavorful and satisfying as well.
3/9/2022,20220309,5,3.96,"Ordered lunch from here. I had the ""Hold Up! Wait a Min!"" Philly cheesesteak, my colleagues had the ""Who Betta"" burger and Patty melt.My colleague enjoyed her burger and my other colleague said the patty melt was delicious but a bit salty.This was my first time ordering from a vegan place and wow! I could not tell the Philly cheesesteak did not have meat! It was topped with jalapeños, lettuce, and tomatoes. This was delicious and the next time I will try something else."
3/11/2022,20220311,5,3.97,1st time trying this place. Outside dining only. I tried the cheese steak. It was absolutely good! Can't wait to go back and try other menu items.
3/18/2022,20220318,2,3.96,"I ordered lasagna and the club sandwich. The lasagna has a very sweet red sauce, which for me is gross. They used bow tie pasta as the lasagna noodles. The lasagna was a miss for me. The sandwich was very greasy but tasty. I love their pizza puff, burger and Philly. I'm disappointed by what I ordered today. I should stick to the items I know for a fact are good. Very disappointing"
3/29/2022,20220329,5,3.96,"This was one of the best vegan spots I've been to in awhile. The food was so fresh, the staff were patient, and I loved it! Buffalo chicken wrap was so bomb!"
4/3/2022,20220403,4,3.96,"Ordered via a meal delivery app. I will address the food only. This is NOT healthy vegan food. It's fast vegan food. However, if you are looking for some decent chicken Buffalo wings, Dips like ranch and fries?! You found your new stop. Plenty of food. It was fresh tasting and fried. LoL sometimes ya just gotta go for it. I did. No regrets. Well played Vegan Chicago!!!"
4/16/2022,20220416,5,3.97,"I can only speak for two items on the menu and service, however it's enough to keep me coming back! The Big Mac was all that and the fries were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I haven't had a McDonalds Big Mac in over five years but this burger took me back. I ordered on line so that my food would be ready when the restaurant opened at 4pm When I arrived at 4pm, my food was HOT and ready. They also offer an assortment of cupcakes, cookies and brownies. I did not try any but they looked so good I will definitely try them next time. The prices were very reasonable especially for the quality vegan food they offer. Highly recommended"
4/19/2022,20220419,5,3.97,"I had the Philly steak egg rolls with fries and it was good. The place has been on my list to try , and it did not disappoint."
5/19/2022,20220519,2,3.96,"Today today today! I am hungry and wanted some with no meat so I knew I could get a nice size serving. Also something that is to my taste. Instead, I received half the size of the normal pizza proof and half the size fries. I just can't believe I'm getting half the food for the small price if not more."
5/25/2022,20220525,1,3.95,"Fries that I ordered in person were soggy, cold, and no one bothered to text to tell me my order was ready so I had to come back 45 minutes later to cold food. I am very disappointed and will not be coming again"
5/31/2022,20220531,4,3.95,"I love this places sandwiches. I'm so happy to support & see them thrive. However, I would order more if they added another side besides fries. This fast food is killing us and as a conscious vegan, a simple side salad or something other than fries will suffice. Please consider adding more healthier options to the menu. Much love & success."
6/5/2022,20220605,5,3.96,Can't wait to come back and try more eats! My husband and I split the turkey club and it was fantastic. Better than any club I've had. Would highly recommend for vegan and non vegan folks!
6/7/2022,20220607,5,3.96,Amazing food. We to Chicago to try vegan options. We are here every day we were in Chicago. Sometimes twice a day. The patty melt was my absolute favorite. Can't wait to go back.
6/8/2022,20220608,4,3.96,"I love coming here to indulge in some veganized classic americana grub, especially in the summer with their patio seating. My only complaint is that the food is expensiveeeee. I got a milkshake, a ""chicken"" sandwich meal and a strawberry lemonade and it was damn near 35$ after tip. whew. the strawberry lemonade was a little too sugary for my taste but still delish when cut with water. And the chicken sandwich!! You can tell by my face that shit was hittin after a long morning of skateboarding. It literally looks and tastes like crispy fried chicken, it's wild. Even my partner who isn't vegan enjoys it."
