1/30/2015,20150130,5,5.0,"We are lucky to be participating in Luella's friend's and family trial meal today. The official opening is Feb. 3. So excited to have this casual southern restaurant in the neighborhood (Ravenswood/Lincoln Square). Tried the Braised Short Rib Mac & Cheese, very cheesy and delicious, huge portion; Kale Ambrosia salad used baby kale and fresh fruit segments, toasted coconut added sweetness, served with goat cheese and toasted pecans, perfect lunch entree and large enough to share. Loved it. Crispy Catfish Tacos were heavenly. Corn flour coating was light and nicely spiced. Shrimp and Grits were amazing in a spicy New Orleans BBQ sauce. 2 huge shrimp and cream grits, perfect."
2/6/2015,20150206,5,5.0,"Wow. Can't help but eat and Yelp. Chicken is rock solid, waffles have my toddler son begging for more."
2/8/2015,20150208,3,4.33,"I really wanted to like this place but it fell short. They are new though so, hopefully, can make some tweaks. 1) The wait - In a small space, they need to figure out a system to seat people and accommodate waiting customers. We were standing in the middle of the floor for 20 minutes and the hostess finally moved us to the wall in front of the kitchen. This should be the system going forward.2) The portions are tiny! I ordered the catfish tacos and sweet potatoes. I am glad a got the potatoes as otherwise I would have been hungry in an hour. My friend order shrimp and grits and it was basically an appetizer.3) Flavor - Season your food better. A little salt and pepper can fix this problem. I put hot sauce on the fish and it made it more tolerable but for the price, this should not be necessary. The potatoes were perfect though.4) Roll your silverware. Picking it from a drawer isn't very sanitary.The staff was great so I will try it again but not on a Saturday night. I hope they can make some tweaks as this place could be a neighborhood staple."
2/8/2015,20150208,4,4.25,"We just tried this new restaurant for brunch and already want to back to try other dishes. It hasn't been open long but they seem to be working things out and the space looks really nice now. I had the ambrosia salad and thought it was a decent size for the price, especially considering the ingredients, and very tasty. The fried chicken was huge and juicy."
2/8/2015,20150208,2,3.8,"I'm from the South and the promise of some good southern food was enticing, but the tiny portions were surprising and disappointing. My 18 year old son ordered the french toast (an entrée) and it was basically an appetizer portion. His food arrived first and he is now sitting politely as we all wait for the rest of our food to arrive (25 minutes and counting) The fried chicken portion looks substantially larger. Just don't order the french toast if you're hungry.One order just arrived. 14 year old says the Pimento Burger is good.  Hubby says the fried chicken is good (and my sweet husband passed one of his pieces to my starving teenager! I'm still waiting for my salad... Salad just arrived, also very small, ""side salad portion"" that took forever to arrive. If they will work out these kinks, they should do well.Coffee is $4."
2/9/2015,20150209,1,3.33,"Surprised at any good review for this place. Won't be going back. They brought my extremely small Southern Benedict out without my partner's meal. After a few minutes, thinking his meal would arrive, I cut into the eggs...overdone. Sent back-they brought new one, just redoing the eggs. Pork was now cold. His burger arrived 10 minutes later...without the fries. Requested refund for mine after I sent back the 2nd time. Female employee (hostess?) came back, plopped down $12.02 in cash and said ""there you go."" No apology from any staff. My partner said his burger was just okay, nothing special. He had 2 bites left when the fries finally arrived. Frozen fries from a bag...not fresh. This unremarkable restaurant needs to step it up when there were a total of 4 other diners for a Sunday brunch at 9:45am. Ridiculous. Should get zero stars."
2/14/2015,20150214,5,3.57,"The hubby and I went for brunch with couple of our friends on a Saturday and had an excellent experience! We ordered a little bit of everything to share like it was recommended by the staffs and by far here are our favorites. 1- the banana pancakes. It was delicious, soft and just the right amount of maple syrup and banana on top. 2- the hubby had the chicken gumbo, at first I was a bit apprehensive since I'm not much of a fan of anything gumbo but when it came out, it was by far the best chicken gumbo I've had! I love the spices and it had just the right amount of hot pepper. 3- the French toast! Now there's something wrong with anyone who thinks Luella's French toast aren't good. The hubby and I don't order French toast from many place because not many restaurants can make it right. Our usual and favorite go to place for French toast is Mexique but we were really surprise and please with Luella's French toast. It tasted just like the one we were used too! It was so delicious! We finished it so fast like no one's business!4- the fried chicken. The chicken was buttery, soft and was well seasoned! It left us wanting for more! Oh and did I mentioned the sauce for the chicken was a great compliment to it! We grabbed some hot sauce from the counter thinking we will need it for the chicken but nope, we didn't. The sauce was a great compliment!5- the Mac & cheese. When we ordered it, our expectations were low, thinking it was going to be like any other but boy were we surprise. It was moist, well seasoned with chunks of ribs and very cheesy, and to top it off we love the fact that they use the soft shell pasta.6- The milk chocolate bread pudding. This should be put on the regular menu and not just the brunch menu. If you're a dessert lover like me, there's no meal without a dessert. Love the fact that it's soft, not too sweet, just the right amount of ice cream and strawberry cream sauce!I'm giving this place a five start cause it met all my expectations on the food, not only that for the fact it's counter service, they spaced out each dish to arrived at the perfect time so that we were not overwhelmed. The staff were awesome and very friendly. Lastly, not sure what others experience were but the silverware were rolled and the portions were well proportion. We also read a little about the chef and he came from a background of fine dining at the Conrad, so the portions will be a bit smaller because the quality of the food is better then what the average restaurant use. Plus don't forget this place is a counter service and the dishes are made when ordered. Also, the place had a very rich and homie ambiance and to mention we love the design, it was perfect for the southern theme. We definitely will be coming back again!"
2/14/2015,20150214,1,3.25,"I was excited to try a new spot in the neighborhood. It was a diastourous meal.Went in for brunch around 1pm on a Saturday. A very limited menu, and we were told we could not order off the main menu until 3PM.No waiter service, we had to get our own silverware and water.We ordered fried chicken, biscuits, fries and a coffee.For $12, we got 4 small pieces of chicken. 3 dark meat, and a half breast..It reminded me of the fried chicken you get in a Swanson TV dinner.Coffee was $4! Biscuits (2) small ones, were ok and the fries were under seasoned.We had to ask for ketchup, and butter for the biscuits.We spent $27 total for this meal. It was not worth it .I could have got a 14 piece at Popeyes for the same price, it would be better.Thank goodness Flirty cupcake is down the block. That saved my brunch."
2/14/2015,20150214,4,3.33,"We really enjoyed the food, though the service still needs to come together. We went for brunch on a Sunday. Not bad service, but seems like it was still a little disorganized. Will definitely come back and try some of their other dishes.The fried chicken was very tasty and they did a good job with the space. Hope they do well."
2/15/2015,20150215,1,3.1,"I was going to give this place 2 stars and then the food arrived and I thought okay maybe 3 but then this happened so it gets 1 star and that's only because 0 stars are not possible: - An order of fries was $4 and the portion was extremely small and not all the fries were cooked thoroughly - The girl who took our order could've been nicer, a smile and a hello would've been enough- The sweet iced tea it's definitely iced because half of the glass was ice. NOTE: Stir the tea before drinking it, the sugar sits at the bottom. - The waiters don't know where they are taking the food, you gave us a table # for a reason, learn how to use it. - Fried chicken is tricky to make, I get this, but if you are going to sell it in your restaurant, then please learn to cook it correctly. My husband took a bite and blood oozed out. It was very unpleasant to say the least. - The burger was strangely over cooked in the middle and undercooked on the edges, which is strange, please clean your fryer. To be fair, after letting the manager or owner or whatever they were know what happened, they refunded our entire meal. The least they could do. Needless to say we will not be going back."
2/17/2015,20150217,5,3.27,"This location went through some very sad versions of a Mediterranean restaurant, it seemed like they would do well but never did. The long, skinny and mostly dark room just didn't seem to be very inviting. The new owners got rid of the tile and put some warm wood on the walls. And they make you use the whole space by walking up to the counter in the back and ordering. I think that might just break the spell of isolated diners, you have to use the whole room.I was here for lunch on Saturday. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits which I thought was a little pricey at $22 so, not to be outdone, I ordered them too. The portion looked small but the shrimps were very large. It was a perfectly adequate meal and I'm glad it wasn't bigger as the sauce was delicious and I would have kept on eating until it hurt. All the staff were friendly but yes, you will have to get your own silverware."
2/18/2015,20150218,3,3.25,"The owner or manager replied promptly to this post. That was encouraging.  If they listen to feedback and work on fixing what's wrong, they can do well."
2/20/2015,20150220,2,3.15,"I hate to give this place two stars because honestly I expected so so much more from this place. I wish it was 5 stars and I wish it had blown me away. Decor:The place looks great! Honestly does open up the place, and feels like home! The music is also great! Creating a phenomenal experience. Service:Or lack thereof, It was a shame that it was counter service but that's fine. I couldn't see any drink options until after I had sat down at a table. I noticed the drink options were tucked away in a corner by the ordering station, it was honestly a shame. The person at the front, well while enthusiastic it would only last for a few seconds. I say this with great sadness that when I entered I didn't feel all that welcomed. There's supposed to be a southern hospitality that does hand in hand with this place that doesn't exist. At least not for me. While others received the most cordial reception and treatment during the meal. Food:I ordered three things. The Creole Fries, Chicken and waffles, and the Beignet.The fries, lacked that seasoning for me. These small dismal fries, started things off ehh. All the seasoning sank to the bottom of the bowl and frankly it was just black pepper and salt. That's all I got, and it was saddening. The Chicken and waffles, let me start by saying the waffles were great! They tasted great and were very soft, with a bit of a crunch. The chicken you would think would be equally as great.. wasn't. The cooking of it was great! The flavor lacked dramatically. Did you all add any seasoning to it at all? Something to balance with the sweetness of the syrup and waffle?The Beignet.... The staple of it all. Was well it was average. Lacked a special something. Really wasn't as great as I've had. It also lacked a certain flavor. The powdered sugar was all that stood out. Once The meal was over, the group and I had gotten up and thus approached 4 people to clean and clear a table... Mind you it was really only me eating and the others just tagged along for a talk. regardless, I hope to hear back and see if they'll work on what has been suggested by customers. Only then will I return to see if I update this. Thank you."
2/20/2015,20150220,5,3.29,"The She Crab soup is a freshly made and very favorable. I also really enjoyed the Kale Ambrosia salad is a fresh and tasty arugula greens with citrus segments and was finished off with candied pecans and coconut. Fresh and delicious! My entree was the Cajun Shrimp Po' boy which was very fresh served with french fries and delicious too! The service was great and the restaurant has a warm, friendly and cozy atmosphere too! I recommend Luella's Southern Kitchen you won't be disappointed!"
2/21/2015,20150221,5,3.4,"Delicious, delicious, delicious, and did I say delicious. My husband surprised me by taking me here since I did not get a chance to try shrimp and grits in New Orleans. The grits are a hearty cut, not you usual out the box grits, locally sourced. The shrimp was fresh good portion size with a flavorful creamy slightly spiced sauce. My husband had the chicken and waffles, all white chicken tenders seasoned perfectly with a crisp light breading. The waffles are a brilliant balance of dough and crunch. Fried green tomatoes are also something to try, well seasoned coating not to salty, just needs the tomato cut to be thicker. The accompanying remoulade is delicious slightly tart as it should be. It's BYOB, southern style sitting, good for couples and families, large tables. Service was very welcoming, our table was meticulously cleaned. Will definitely be back! I am telling everyone I know...best shrimp & grits in Chicago!"
2/21/2015,20150221,5,3.5,"This place made a big splash in Lincoln Square. Great brunch this morning. The Southern Benedict has perfectly executed poached eggs. Pancakes were well cooked and presented with flare - banana's foster style. Reminds me of NOLA and a little place we go to in the Marigny. Counter ordering like many fast-casual restaurants today. Staff was really friendly, too."
3/4/2015,20150304,1,3.35,"I am amazed that the owners/management haven't responded to any reviews, especially since almost all the poor reviews state the LONG wait for food (and dishes ordered at the same time arrive staggered). I wrote my initial review about a month ago and the restaurant still has the same poor reviews. How do they expect to turn a profit when they refund so many meals? Oh ya, by serving small portions at high cost.  I wonder how long it will be before they go out of business and a real restaurant that wants to please it's customers goes in."
3/5/2015,20150305,5,3.44,"I loved the food. They are a new restaurant trying to figure out what works best. Yes there are things that need to be improved, but what restaurant doesn't? I love the colors and the open space. And the wood in the wall. The staff is very friendly and they tried to accommodate what you want. The owner was really nice and friendly I ordered the fried chicken with the waffle, and because I'm not a fanatic of sweet chicken I asked them to put some spicy to it. It came out so good! I loved it! I was with a friend that is vegetarian and they made something for him out of the menu. Something with beats, sweet potatoes, and cream cheese. he really liked it (however they forgot to bring a fork with it.However I'm not fanatic of the concept of getting up and ordering the food in front , but I guess that's the concept? In my opinion I think it will be better if there is a waitress."
3/14/2015,20150314,3,3.42,"With much anticipation my hubby and I tried Luella's today for the first time, but it was a mixed experience. Much like other reviews, we were also a bit confused about the set up when we first entered; some signage or greeting would surely help with this. We caught on pretty quick though, ordered, grabbed our silverware & water, and found a seat by the door.The wait was pretty long for what we ordered (approx. 20 mins) but once I tried the boneless fried chicken & mac n' cheese it was worth it. On the other hand, my husband's burger was overcooked/not that flavorful, and the fries did not taste fresh. The food inconsistencies could just be a product of an off day, but I think the main thing is that we didn't feel very welcome or at home. The menu and concept could make this place extremely special, but the service and the way they do things don't necessarily reflect that. Plus, as my husband pointed out ""it was not an $11 burger"". I hope they do take some of this feedback and make some improvements. I would definitely give them another chance!"
3/15/2015,20150315,2,3.35,"I chose this restaurant based on the generally positive reviews. Visited on a nice Sunday afternoon pretty late in their brunch timeframe. Brunch ends at 3pm. Despite the nice day and the pretty good flow of foot traffic the restaurant was reasonably empty and, hence, pretty quiet. We ordered at the counter. The cashier was quiet and a little disinterested. It would have been nice if she'd explained that the mains did not come with any sides. Our food took a pretty good while to arrive despite the ""fast"" food vibe of the place. My order of andouille sausage quiche was a good portion for one. Unlike most quiche it was light on the egg (which I prefer) and had a lot of crust which was thankfully quite light and tasty. The sausage was really flavorful and the highlight of all I tried. A mound of salad greens was dumped on top but a little removal later and the balance was about right. My wife ordered fried chicken. It was four pieces and a little bowl of gravy served on a plate with no edges. This led to the fried chicken grease making a run for the edges. The chicken was good but not great. The batter wasn't full of flavor but they got the temp right. The chicken was properly cooked and pretty juicy. This is where an explanation of the portion and the lack of sides would have been ideal. Four pieces of chicken isn't a really great meal for one patron. A server bussed our table afterwards even though we were still awaiting an order of beignets. After a bit of confusion, that was sorted, and we were given spoons (?) and an order of three beignets. Unfortunately, they were a bit doughy and undercooked. Summary:Pros:Nice flavors.Simple menu. Reasonably quiet. Cons:Uneven portions. Counter service could explain better or ask questions of patrons. A little pricey ($31 for meal as described).All in all, with the wealth of great eating options in Chicago I doubt I'd return."
3/17/2015,20150317,5,3.43,"A couple of friends and I ordered from here on their opening day and while the food was solid we weren't blown away. Now that htye have been open a few weeks we decided to try again and we were very impressed! Portions were large, the food was delicious, and service has always been excellent. We had:-Chicken & Waffles - The chicken is seasoned and fried well. The waffle is a touch sweet which I really liked, it helps to set it apart. The chicken does appear to be both white and dark meat for those that may not like one or the other. -Mac & Cheese - My favorite! Large portion, very creamy, and tons of short rib! You will not regret ordering this-Grits: Didn't have it with the shrimp and it is amazing without. They should add this as a side item for those that may not want shrimp or would just like to try the grits. I have never had grits from a restaurant before so I can't speak to what good grits taste like but these are very creamy with good seasoning. -Catfish Tacos - I didn't personally have these but my friend enjoyed them and the portion looked large enough. -Fries - were seasoned well but I like my fries really crispy which unfortunately they were not. May have been a one time thing though. -Chicken Gumbo - Fantastic! Very well seasoned. Maybe could use a touch more rice but otherwise it was great. Luellas is definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!"
3/20/2015,20150320,3,3.41,"Saw this place on Good Day Chicago a while back and was waiting for the chance to try it. I was walking by on a Saturday afternoon and peeped in. I saw some empty tables and in I went for lunch. Well I was greeted at the front counter by the lady who after I ordered Chicken & Waffles tells me I can't order off the main menu until after 3pm, that only the right side (Brunch Menu) is availabile. That threw me off after craving chicken/waffles. (How can you not make chicken/waffles a brunch item? Waffles are breakfast, chicken is lunch??)People were behind me, I felt rushed to order so I went with the Fried Chicken. I also had a can of Sprite and my tab was about $15. Yikes! The place is new, I heard it was good, so i didn't mind the $15 tab at first. I sat down and the food did take a while to come out, even though the place wasn't that crowded. But I do understand that its made fresh, and not sitting under a heat lamp! Out comes 3 pieces of chicken on a plate with a bowl of gravy. You don't get any sides? For $12 for chicken, one would expect a couple biscuits with it or something. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was very good! But for a $12 plate, one would think they'd include a side or something. As I sat there waiting for my food, drinking my Sprite in the glass, the bus boy comes by and begins to pour water in my glass! oh man! I dealt with it. Then a while later again comes by and does the same thing! Overall, i want this place to succeed. I know it can! The food is very good, but I just think for the price they should include a bit more. Hopefully they may consider adding a side to some of the more expensive menu items! That would be key! I will probably be back as I live in the area........I still want to try their chicken & waffles!"
3/25/2015,20150325,3,3.39,"I actually went to Luella's on their opening night. While the food tasted good, they need to fix their service and portioning. I went with a party of four and every single dish came out at different times, with a 15-minute gap between the first and last dishes served. While the food actually tasted pretty good, there was a huge discrepancy in the mac and cheese dishes. I ordered a $15 ""brisket"" mac and cheese. The flecks of brisket were so tiny we thought the server forgot the dish! Someone at my table ordered a $4 kid's mac and cheese which was served in the same sized bowl as my order.I think I'll try Luella's again in a few months. Hopefully their kinks will have been worked out by then."
3/26/2015,20150326,5,3.46,"Despite some underwhelming reviews citing service faux pas, our experience at Luella's  suggests that perhaps some initial wrinkles have been ironed out. There was simply nothing disappointing - everything that we ate was delicious. I recommend the catfish tacos, the beets, and the Mississippi Mud pie. I didn't think the portions were large, but I was stuffed walking home. The staff were extremely friendly and gave clear instructions in regard to the counter service situation. Completely excited to return for brunch. We also hear some intriguing news regarding an oyster po boy on Tuesday . . ."
3/28/2015,20150328,5,3.52,"Delicious dinner! We came on a Saturday night and got the kale salad, sweet potatoes, chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. For dessert we tried to squeeze on room for the Mississippi mud pie. It was a bit rich for me but my boyfriend really liked it. Great little spot. Nice that it's byob. Also chef came by at the end- good personal touch!"
4/3/2015,20150403,5,3.58,Delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles & a super friendly staff!The FC&W is like dinner & dessert all rolled into one.
4/3/2015,20150403,5,3.63,"Great southern cuisine... I enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The menu was filled with tasty items that makes me want to come back and experience the Brisket Mac Cheese, Shrimp and Grits, and Chicken Gumbo. It's a BYOB establishment and I will be back during evening hours to experience the brunch on Saturday. I was impressed with the sweet tea which is hard to find in the north..... REAL SOUTHERN SWEET TEA....Thanks Darnell Reed for the vision and passion to share with others your culinary skills and southern roots."
4/5/2015,20150405,5,3.68,"Came here with my husband, sister, and cousin on Easter afternoon. We purposely waited until the brunch hours were over, smart move. Liked the BYOB and order & chill atmosphere... and especially liked the southern feel they shot for. Food was so bomb, my husband ate his shrimp & grits and then got up and ordered chicken & waffles... smaller portions of certain dishes but not all- my pimento cheeseburger was huge. They accommodated our vegan cousin with delicious mac n cheese.Finished with the desssert sampler- and daaahaaam it was good.Met the chef, total stud, with a good story & extremely proud of his family and business. Staff was diverse, from all over the place and seemed to work well together.We will definitely be back... if we can recover from this food coma."
4/5/2015,20150405,4,3.69,"As far as food is concerned, this would be a 5 star review. My bf and I were passing by and hungry, so decided to check out the place based on the posted menu. We had the chicken and waffles, the pimento burger and the fried tomatoes. All were fantastic. Specifically, the tomato batter was delectably seasoned while fried to a golden crisp, the burger is in the style of a thin patty (the bun was crazy soft) and the waffles were so good that I would happily eat them without the maple syrup or fried chicken (which is not to say that the chicken or maple syrup were bad, because I would also eat the chicken on it's own or drink the syrup)I'm dropping this down to 4 stars because the service was awkward. Friendly, but awkward. For example, we asked for a box, the server took the plate with the fries, which we thought he might be boxing for us with the rest of the food, but no, he tossed it (which was fine, just unclear what he was doing) then asked us if we wanted to keep the ketchup after he had tossed the fries. That said, the place is new so I'm sure they have kinks to work out, and as I said above, the food was delicious. We'll definitely be back, hopefully for dinner next time to check it out."
4/8/2015,20150408,5,3.73,"Southern cooking this far north and done right? Yes, this is the place. BYOB, good service and value for your money? Absolutely. I immediately got a family owned, really warm and inviting vibe when we walked in. I was amazed at what they did with the interior. The Mediterranean Grill before was an eye sore compared to this. Now it has hardwood floors and natural wood paneling on the walls adorned with art from which I think was Ernie Barnes which immediately reminded me of the cover art for the hip hop album Camp Lo - Uptown Saturday Night. Nice touch to whomever the interior decorator is. The music playing was a mix of old r&b and soul. I always dig a place that places careful attention to detail and in this context it's fitting. The service is pretty simple and straightforward. Go up to the counter, order, get a number, get silverware and water.. then sit down. They'll run the food out to you. We ordered the Sorghum flour biscuits, Fried Green tomatoes, Chicken and waffles and Pimento cheeseburger with fries. The biscuits were light,fluffy, delicious and bursting with flavor; served with a small side of honey. The Fried green tomatoes were greasy in the right way, yet the fruit inside was firm and fresh tasting. The Chicken and waffles were subdivided into slivers of four which is perfect for those who want to do tapas style dining, especially if you're a first timer. They were sweet, salty and tasty as hell. The burger was spot on, served with a mountain of spiced fries and what I suspect is house made ketchup. It's on par with burgers you'll find at Au Cheval or Little Bad Wolf. As good as it was, it was my least favorite compared to the others. The southern items are where it's at.Overall, this is fine southern cooking with the right amount of portions. Speaking of which, for those who say the portions are not big enough.. It's possible that you're not small enough for the portions. The food is fried and dense. If an app and a main entree doesn't fill you up then go to Popye's or KFC if you want to complain about ""value"". This is not fast food. This is obviously steps above it. I'll be back for brunch. I'm very pleased that a place like this is in the neighborhood and I hope they do well. Judging by the buzz and crowd that was there Tuesday night, I think they will."
4/10/2015,20150410,5,3.77,"Very nice place. The food is amazing. Prices are affordable. The staff are efficient and friendly. Nice location, right across from the Davis Theater and lots of interesting shops surround it. Can't imagine anyone not loving this place...."
4/15/2015,20150415,4,3.78,"Lucky to have a place like this open up in our neighborhood! My friend and I shared the Shrimp & Grits and Brisket Mac--both were delicious, and rich, and flavorful. Fresh brewed sweet tea, comfy dining room--can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."
4/17/2015,20150417,3,3.76,"Took advantage of this amazing weather by taking a stroll around Lincoln Square. This cute little neighborhood needs more recognition than it is currently getting, so what better way to attract more attention than a couple of new restaurants joining this German influenced area. Luella's is one of several new places that will bring great things to Lincoln Square.Nothing like some good ol Southern cooking to end the long week. While on my stroll, I noticed this cute little place was swarming with people, so I had to check it out for myself. The concept of this place is simple, just 3 easy steps. 1. Order in the front and get a number.2. Want water? Get it yourself. Water station to the right of the order station.3. Grab a table and wait for yummy food to come. Service: Work on the flow of the kitchenWhen my friend and I approached the front, we figured, Southern cooking = southern hospitality. Boy were we wrong, we got Southern bluntness. The server taking the orders simply told us orders were temporary suspended as the kitchen was currently backed up, in the meantime, take the menus, grab a seat, and they would let us know when they were back in business. This was the first time I have ever heard of such a thing, but being that they are a fairly new place, they haven't gotten used to the dinner rush yet. Food: Mediocre Luckily we weren't super hungry, but after about 15 mins, the server came to our table and led us back to the front to order. We got a little bit of everything: kale salad, bbq brisket mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, oyster po boys, and beignets. My favorite was the kale salad, which is kind of sad because I don't think kale salad is very Southern or even a part of comfort food. - Kale salad - all time fav! The citrus was so refreshing. Those candied pecans and coconut chips gave it a nice crunch. If I am not mistaken, I think they used Dang chips, which if you haven't tried it yet, definitely do yourself a favor and get some! - BBQ brisket mac n cheese - second favorite. Brisket could use more smokiness but the mac and cheese was delightful.- Oyster po boy - The taste is easily forgettable, and nothing special. The fries were pretty awesome.- Fried green tomatoes - Definitely not worth getting. Tasteless.- Beignets - Probably the most disappointing part of the whole meal. Definitely not how I remembered it when I went to Cafe du Monde. Incomparable. It wasn't very soft, just some ol fried dough."
4/18/2015,20150418,5,3.79,"It was my first time eating chicken and waffles, and thanks to Luella's Southern Kitchen, it will not be the last! I was with a group of 12 and everything we ate was awesome. The fact that it's byob makes this a very affordable spot for an easy and satisfying meal. Definitely get the chicken and waffles, brisket mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. Also, you can't leave without the beignets. Enjoy!"
4/21/2015,20150421,2,3.74,"Food is OK, but they're still working out service issues. It's ok if you're in the area, but it's not worth a special trip.I came here for Easter with two friends. There was a miscommunication with the chief hostess, but we eventually got a table. The hostess had a poor attitude, but thankfully the lead waitress was able to calm her down. The self service drinks and cutlery is an interesting quirk. Food came out lukewarm, but it was tasty. I specifically ordered a bread pudding to be brought out after I called for it. It was rushed out to me and stone cold. I walked back to the waitress and asked if the bread pudding was supposed to be chilled. To his credit, the chef immediately rectified the mistake and brought out a bread pudding himself. The server also apologized.Again, they have a good vibe and I hope they get things together. However, as a native Southerner, this isn't a place I'd go out of my way to visit again."
4/23/2015,20150423,4,3.75,1st. This place is very casual but it's nice. We walked in and went straight to the counter to order 1st then we were seated. It wasn't that busy so our food came pretty fast and was hot. This was our 1st time so we ordered a few different things and we all ate a little of everything. Our order:Catfish tacos... greatShrimp and grits... amazingButtermilk fried chicked... ok to goodFried Green Tomatoes ... ok to goodBBQ Brisket mac & Cheese ... amazing (get this!) Desert: Beignets... greatSo... the star of the show was the BBQ Brisket Mac & Cheese. it's made with huge macaroni noodles and a delightful array of cheeses (I'm so grown and fancy) with smokey and delicious brisket cubes. The brisket cubes add a smokey goodness that's sure to make you not want to share and the bread crumb topping makes it that much better. The surprise of the evening were the catfish tacos. I really don't know how to describe them... just try them. BYOB makes the joint even cooler. The service was great. I felt welcomed and we will be back. The menu is Ala carte so the bill can get a little high for what you're getting but it's worth it.This place takes credit cards (of course) but you can only tip in cash.Check them out.
5/3/2015,20150503,1,3.68,NEVER AGAINwe spent $35 and walked away hungry. The chicken and waffles consist of 3 small pieces of boneless chicken on 3 hard pieces of waffle which did not even come to one entire waffle. Is all ala carte and we had thinly sliced fried green tomatoes as a side dish. they were about eighth of an inch thick. we split one soda and that was our total meal. If you examine food cost it was at least a 400 percent markup and it did not taste like good southern fried chicken.
5/7/2015,20150507,5,3.71,"Out of work early on a Tuesday, this was the perfect place for a lunch stop. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Such a nice change from some of the other ""snooty attitude"" places around here. Check your attitude at the door, because (thank God) they've got no time for that mess in here! You order at the counter, then get assigned a table where your food is brought to you. You pick up your own silverware & water while you wait. I thoroughly enjoyed a STUFFED Oyster Po Boy sandwich - DIVINE! Great spicy/seasoned fries, and a yummy ginger ale that tasted refreshingly like ginger beer. It was a hard choice for me, because everything looked so darn good!! The weekend brunch looks FABULOUS - cannot wait to come back here with the Husband! BYOB if so inclined. And PLEASE - remember to drop a tip in the jar by the cashier station"
5/13/2015,20150513,3,3.69,"I will start off by saying that we went on Mother's Day with no reservation so this may have contributed to our experience.When we arrived there was a sign on the door that stated that they were closed until 4:00 p.m. No big deal as that was only about a 30 minute wait. So we left and came back.When we walked in we were told to get in line and place our order. However, as I looked around I saw other people securing seating first but we decided to listen to the hostess. After we placed our order, we were told there were no seats available. Ugh.The manager came out and took one of the ""reserved"" tables and gave it to us great. Well then we waited another 30 minutes for the food to arrive.I had the Gumbo but the portion was extremely small but tasty. My brother had the shrimp and grits. Which by the way they ran out of, hence the reason I HAD to order gumbo.It was an okay experience. I might try it again."
5/19/2015,20150519,5,3.73,"Folks don't seem to understand how this place works. You order at the counter, take a number and then find a seat and they bring it out to you. Lots of places do this - think about Smoque. BUT I think the food and presentation is so good here that people get confused and expect it to be a traditional sit-down spot. Maybe also because the counter is towards the back. I think maybe if the owners put a divider / rope near the counter, that might cue people to form a line and that you need to order at the counter.BBQ Brisket Mac and Cheese is incredible. Chicken gumbo is also excellent with a nice presentation. But really, everything I've tried is so damn tasty, and I have plenty more I want to try. Really glad this place opened up in Lincoln Square!"
5/22/2015,20150522,5,3.76,"The restaurant was very pleasant, clean and friendly. The food was delicious and the blend of flavors was very pleasing. The mason jars provided an authentic southern feel and the tea was very good. The GM was nice and asked about our experience. It is easy to find in a bustling neighborhood with easy parking.Kudos to the chef and staff and best of luck. I we will be back."
5/25/2015,20150525,1,3.69,"Came here because of the awesome reviews that I've read. But was thoroughly disappointed after visiting. Called to see if they were open on Mother's Day around 4pm. Got to Luella's at around 5pm. When we got there, there was a sign that the place has been closed for the day due to a party. WTF. When I called, no mention that the place will be closed due to a party. Travelled an hour to get here. Nevertheless, will not be back. Waste of time."
5/27/2015,20150527,5,3.72,"My daughter and I went to Luella's for Mother's Day Brunch the day after the restaurant had been featured by Steve Dolinsky on ABC7. So it was a bit crowded. We waited in line for about 30 minutes before being seated. I will admit that I didn't fully understand the concept of getting seated at a table, then getting up to wait in line at the counter, and then go back to your table for a waitperson to bring out your food.I had the Bourbon Chicken & Waffles which was prepared and plated in a unique way. It was very tasty (must be the bourbon!) My daughter had Shrimp & cream cheese Grits which were out of this world! We finished our meal with an order of beignets which were piping hot and (according to my daughter) as good as the beignets at Café DuMonde in New Orleans. Its BYOB which has been mentioned in some of the other reviews. We forgot to bring a bottle, but had time to dash up Lincoln Ave to grab one. Worth noting that non-alcoholic drink options are somewhat limited at Luella's (Tea, water, coffee and ???)Luella's is named for Chef Darnell Reed's grandmother and her cooking inspired some of his dishes  Heartwarming and inspiring story. I gave Luella's 5 stars because the food was magnificent, prices were reasonable, ambiance was modern and welcoming, staff was friendly and overall it was an very enjoyable experience."
5/29/2015,20150529,5,3.75,"Amazing addition to Lincoln Square - quick, casual, yet very, very good southern-inspired comfort food. The pimento cheeseburger is a winner and I don't know what they do to the fries (old bay seasoning?) but they're impossible to not finish. Very friendly service, and I love the set-up!Highly, highly recommend!"
5/30/2015,20150530,4,3.76,"First things first....they don't serve the brisket mac and cheese during brunch. I was verrrrry sad about that. That said, what a nice lil gem this place is! We had the chicken and waffles, which was delightful. The chicken was perfectly golden, tender and juicy and the waffles were, I'm pretty sure, homemade. We also had the brussel sprouts which were out of this world! Perfect amount of spice and just simply delightful. The blackberry hand pie with ice cream??? Just get it. That's all I have to say.Service was fantastic as well...from the sweet lady at the counter, to the awesome servers who brought us food and cleared our dishes. Im pretty sure the one guy reeaaallllyyyy liked my husband haha. We will most certainly be back to try that mac and cheese!"
5/30/2015,20150530,5,3.78,"This place is delicious and has great service! I ordered the Southern Benedict, but when it came out the you'll was hard. I hate complaining but this happens sometimes and so I said something. They took it back to the kitchen and made me new one. The cook, the manager and waitresses came out and apologized. It made all the difference. The Benedict was delicious! Thanks guys"
5/30/2015,20150530,3,3.77,"Hubbie and I searched for a dinner spot and we found Luella's. We enjoyed the car ride to the location, we live south and it was not so bad of a drive. We did have a bit of trouble in the neighborhood, there was a festival of sorts happening.....traffic was crazy. Upon reaching the destination we had a 2 block walk and it was well worth it.We especially enjoyed the chicken and waffles...bought a serving home :).The ice tea was not sweet, but I was o.k. with that.I recommend taking the drive at least once to enjoy what they have to offer."
6/3/2015,20150603,5,3.79,"Oyster Po' boy!Having lived in New Orleans for 3 years, I gained a strong appreciation for southern cuisine. The Oyster Po' Boy is one of my faves! I have yet to have one I enjoyed since moving to Chicago until Luella's. Awesome batter, great bread, tasty remoulade, and outstanding fries. I really enjoyed this meal! Keep up the great work!"
6/5/2015,20150605,5,3.82,"This place is incredibly accommodating and super friendly. We were greeted right away by who I assume is a manager at the register. She was very helpful and was joking around with us. It's clear they are very intent on making the diner's experience as enjoyable and comfortable as possible.My friend and I ordered a few different things. The oyster po' boy, shrimp and grits, and the chicken and waffles. After we ordered, I had a little emergency to attend to so my friend asked that we got everything wrapped up to go. They were more than happy to accommodate us. Just in case anyone who was working last night reads this, I'm sorry I left! It had nothing to do with your establishment or anything. I want to come back to Luella's again and again and I just couldn't do that without making sure you knew how wonderful I think this restaurant is.Everything was amazing. The remoulade on the po' boy was so flavorful and the batter was great. I loved how big the shrimp in the shrimp and grits was. And how many there were! I definitely finished that off no problem. And holy crap. The chicken and waffles were amazing. The waffles seemed to already be infused with maple syrup and the chicken was crispy and juicy. I had leftovers for breakfast this morning!I can't wait to come back to this place and try everything else on the menu. Thank you so much!"
6/13/2015,20150613,5,3.84,"Luella's really is as good as it gets! Had an amazing brunch! Great service, fantastic food obviously cooked with love. The eggs Benedict may be the best thing I have ever eaten, and the fried chicken was wondrous. Will be back with a bigger group, so we can try more dishes!"
6/18/2015,20150618,5,3.86,"Amazing. I have been there a few times and have loved every dish, but look forward to trying them all! Recommend the Beet Salad, Crawfish Etouffee, brisket mac n cheese, and the fried chicken on the waffles with bourbon syrup. Great hospitality too!"
6/19/2015,20150619,4,3.87,"The gumbo is amazing! Best I have had in Chicago. The bourbon chicken and waffles do the trick and the FISH TACOS, oh my God...you just have to try them. Fair prices and food that DOMINATED my tastebuds...in a good way. Oh they also have glass bottles of Cheerwine. Delish."
7/3/2015,20150703,5,3.89,"I love southern food. But often I walk away from it feeling overwhelmed and weighted down. So when my wife wanted to try Luella's, I was reluctant for this reason. What a Delightful suprise! Everything was great southern taste but light and refreshing.The Shrimp and Grits were creamy with a light roux or gravy that set this dish apart from all others I have had before. The Fried Chicken and Waffles were crispy, warm, lightly, sweet and simply the best tasting waffles I have ever had. Very well flavored. Kale Ambrosia was filled with plenty of candied pecans, fresh fruit, toasted coconut and a wonderful vinaigrette that tied it all together.Our only disappointment was with the Beignets. They were not the light airy pasteries I have elsewhere, but flat, heavy and too bready. With everything else hitting out of the park, I don't understand how they got this so wrong. Go back and try again and get it right. Everyone was very attentive and helpful and friendly. We mentioned the flat Beignets and the cook sent us another serving properly raised. Better, but I still would change the dough and add some dipping sauce."
7/10/2015,20150710,5,3.91,"Had the chicken and waffles, catfish tacos, soft shell crab po boy sandwich, fried green tomatoes, and beignets. We'd definitely return to try more.I liked that the chicken was boneless and made of dark meat and the waffles had a nice hint of bourbon. The tacos and seasonal crab sandwich were fresh, flavorful and cooked just right. The fried green tomatoes was mediocre, so I'd recommend passing on it.We got good service from the lady at the counter and notable great service by the Filipino woman that took serviced our table. Everyone was very accommodating, especially to my two younger children.I had asked who Luella was and the Chicago native/owner took the time to come out and personally explain Luella was his great grandmother from Mississippi and her relocation to Chicago."
7/31/2015,20150731,5,3.93,Never have I been to a restaurant and been given so much attention. I drive by here quite often I used to live in this neighborhood. Every restaurant in this space has moved. I hope that doesn't happen here. I had been to New Orleans before Katrina and know it's changed a lot. This place reminds me of the food I had there many years ago. The Gumbo is not very chunky like someone else has said here but it very flavorful. I ordered more than I can eat (yay leftovers).  First thing I had was the fresh brewed tea and they bring water to your table. Delicious with or without sweetener. I was there early and it started filling up fast. The Chicken and waffles was delicious! I also had the biscuits and ordered another to go. My friends had the Brussels sprouts which were excellent and the Brisket Mac and cheese flew off their plate so I had to order that to go too. The beignets were soo yummy I had a hard time sharing but I did. Overall i will be back to try everything on their menu I can't wait to return.
8/1/2015,20150801,5,3.95,"My husband & I were out biking last night and saw that this place had good reviews. We pulled up to check out the menu and were welcomed by the Aunt of the Chef/Owner, who happened to be sitting outside on the sidewalk enjoying the cool summer night. We were definitely not disappointed!We started with Fried Green Tomatoes, which were pretty near perfect with a light cornmeal crust and light remoulade sauce. I ordered the Gumbo, which was as good as any I've had. My husband ordered the Brisket Mac & Cheese which was AMAZING. I'm pretty sure I stole a third of it from his plate while he may/may not have been looking.It's BYOB, but since we didn't BYO, we ended up having some of the interesting southern pops they serve. I had a Cheerwine (yum) and my husband had a Blenheim HOT Ginger Ale (which is an experience for sure).Luella's is very casual -- you order up front and they bring the food to your table. We will definitely go back."
8/3/2015,20150803,4,3.95,"My mom and I met here around 11:45 on a Tuesday. There was only one other person there when we arrived, but by the time we left 45 minutes later, most of the tables were full. You order at the counter then take your drink and number to your table and they bring your food to you. The service was excellent - the guy behind the counter was able to give us a few recommendations and there was a girl walking around cleaning up, taking empty plates and making sure everybody was OK. My mom got the brisket mac and cheese - it was really tasty. It also wasn't an overwhelming amount of food that we had any to take home either, so that was nice! I went with the catfish tacos. The pieces of catfish were pretty big, the sauce and slaw on it was really good. Overall, we both left happy and full and would definitely recommend the place!"
8/15/2015,20150815,4,3.95,"An excellent new place for Southern (or Southern fusion) cuisine. Delicious, high quality, and sorely needed in our area of the US.The owner is the chef -- almost always a good sign. He has shaped a well-balanced menu with a wide enough variety to please practically everyone. My group ordered a large number of dishes to sample and share, and each one was better than the next. Great flavor, well portioned, priced fair.I prefer a full-service restaurant, especially when prices are above ""inexpensive"", but otherwise this place has real potential and would get 5 stars. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, even though you order at the counter and they bring the food out and that's it. A very positive experience. Highly recommended."
8/20/2015,20150820,5,3.97,"Mouthwatering goodness. I had the fried green tomato BLT with seasoned fries and the strawberry shortcake for dessert. The BLT is Nueske bacon, arugula and the fried green tomato with creole remoulade. I'm not a fan of traditional BLTs and my biased opinion says that this is 1000x better. The strawberry shortcake is a buttermilk biscuit with the perfect amount of chantilly cream and strawberry compote. The flavors were nicely balanced and not too sweet. Both items were absolutely delicious. Luella's is the perfect spot to indulge in some good Southern food."
8/20/2015,20150820,5,3.98,Shrimp and GRITS. Order them. Eat them. Love them. So glad they moved in! Can't wait to go again. Great sweet tea. Great Macaroni and cheese. Yum. Yum. Yum.
8/20/2015,20150820,5,4.0,"What a great meal! I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT and a a side of the Roasted and Chilled Beets. Both were absolutely incredible. The BLT was grilled perfectly with crispy, flavorful fried green tomatoes and thick bacon. The Beets were incredible. They were nice and tender and served with a cream cheese and balsamic reduction sauce, pistachios, and a drizzle of olive oil. Surprisingly, it wasn't heavy at all and very refreshing on a hot summers day. The Chef chatted with me briefly while I was waiting for my food, very nice guy. I could tell he takes a lot of pride in his restaurant and that shows in the meals they put out. I can't wait to go back and try some other stuff!"
8/26/2015,20150826,5,4.02,"As someone who grew up in the south and lived in New Orleans for years, I'm quite familiar Southern style cooking/food, I was excited to try Luella's shortly after it opened last winter. But I'll be honest: My initial impression was that it was good, but there were a few things that I wasn't exactly enthralled with. Flash forward to this week's second visit, and I must say I was so pleasantly surprised! There were vast improvements all around - especially when it came to the food. The biscuits were impeccable, and the she crab soup was nearly flawless. Rarely do I eat soup in Chicago that doesn't require a pinch of salt or a dash of hot sauce, but the she crab soup here is perfectly seasoned. The grits in the shrimp and grits are incredibly creamy, and the shrimp was spiced just right. The soft shell crab poboy was hearty and the cornmeal crust provided a great crunch.So, maybe it was an off day when I went earlier this year, but they've definitely fine tuned things and have now become one of my favorite go-to places in the square. I look forward to grabbing soup and biscuits from here when winter rolls into Chicago! To say I recommend Luella's is an understatement."
8/28/2015,20150828,4,4.02,"2 words (shrimp & grits) = 1 emotion (pure bliss). add 4 letters (BYOB) and you've got yourself a simple formula for a lovely evening.this is a fantastic addition to a neighborhood saturated with thai food and bar & grill places. (some great ones, but still.) the staff is lovely and the food is spot on. though everything i've tried is delish, it's shrimp & grits all the way, baby."
8/29/2015,20150829,5,4.03,"The food was absolutely amazing, the shrimp & grits, southern benedict, milk chocolate bread pudding. Definitely a must stop, I will be back soon.Chef Darnell is making everything from scratch, you certainly can taste the quality of home made biscuits, smoked pork belly and ice cream..yummy!!"
9/12/2015,20150912,5,4.05,"Spoiler Alert: I ate some grits.I don't hang out in Lincoln Square much, so the one day that I passed by Luella's Southern Kitchen, it stood out. Given the location, I figured this was a restaurant pandering to those who don't know anything about Southern cooking proper. Surprise!Shrimp and grits. Beignets. Sweet tea.Coming from Mississippi, I know a thing or two about real Southern cooking and Luella's gets it right. They're from Greenville, MS, so it's understandable. I never like grits as a child. The shrimp and grits at Luella's changed that for me. I waited until I am almost 50 to have some grits that I like. The beignets may not be exactly like the ones you get in New Orleans, but they don't disappoint. These are considerably better than some ""attempts"" I've had at some restaurants. And the sweet tea accented with figs took me back to Mississippi.I can't speak for any other items on the menu. What I will say is that the one thing I found disgusting growing up has become the one thing I love from what I ordered. I will go back to sample some other menu items. I don't think I'll be disappointed."
9/12/2015,20150912,5,4.06,"Delicious...great service...we had 9 in our party and they accomodated well. We waited for biscuits but it was well worth it...shrimp and grits, and crab poboy were deeelightful...thanks to Turis for great dining in Chicago on our vacation!!!!"
9/23/2015,20150923,4,4.06,"Really excellent counter-style food from Mississippi. A very welcome addition to the North Center/Lincoln Square neighborhood. I had the catfish tacos, which were very delicious, but a bit lean on the portion, particularly compared to other places doing fancy tacos (for instance, Antique Taco). For that reason, I had to give it a four out of five, but the staff is great, the french fries are divine, and I'll definitely drop in again."
9/23/2015,20150923,5,4.07,"This place is great. The decor is calm and inviting, the food is outstanding and filling, and the people friendly and efficient. I went for brunch and ordered fried green tomatoes, chicken & waffles, and a buttermilk biscuit. The waffles were crispy and tasty, and so was the chicken, though I'd probably much rather they were served separately-- I generally prefer savory separate from sweet, but that's a personal thing. The tomatoes and the biscuit were perfect. I'll be returning soon to try more of the menu."
9/30/2015,20150930,5,4.09,"Wow, this place was -great-. How have I missed it for so long? My husband got the praline pancakes, and despite his initial misgivings about nutty pancakes with blueberries added, he really enjoyed them.I got the chicken and waffles, and it was probably one of the tastiest pieces of fried chicken I've ever eaten.Coffee is from La Colombe and is excellent, and the beignets, while not as sweet as I would have liked, were still a wonderful end to a great meal."
10/1/2015,20151001,5,4.1,"This place is seriously good eats! I'm loving that there's an alternative southern joint aside from big jones to pop up around the hood. It's a nice but casual environment. We've been here once for brunch and tonight for dinner. Everything was on point. The brisket Mac and and cheese...so great! Their pimento, griddled burgers are so flavorful and seasoned Cajun fries...Amazing. Also got their red beans and rice and a side of greens. The perfect meal."
10/2/2015,20151002,4,4.1,"My husband and I went to Luella's before a movie at Davis. It's the kind of restaurant where you enter, order at the counter, and they bring you your food. I ordered the kale ambrosia. I LOVED this salad. I'm not a huge kale person, but it was delicious. The citrus flavor and the nuts and cheese were just perfectly balanced! My husband ordered the brisket Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was good, but the brisket didn't really have any flavor. I liked the decor inside- the color scheme was yellows and blues and some nice wood beams. The decor was very southern in its feeling.Overall, it's a good stop before a movie and don't miss the kale ambrosia!"
10/4/2015,20151004,4,4.1,"Surprisingly delicious!! I will admit I was a little suspicious when my friends and I arrived at the location. It has a store front vibe and looks like a burgers and fries place with a cafeteria like setting. In fact you have to go up to the cashier and place your order and then seat yourself. (The food is brought out to you) So hesitantly I obliged my friends and we ate there. So glad that I did... The food was yummy!! And very well plated albeit on the small side. We ordered shrimp & grits, I had the chicken and waffles, we also ordered the Chicory coffee French toast to share. Lastly, we ordered the Mac and cheese which was fiyah!! Such yummy goodness!! The shrimp and grits were very flavorful and I appreciated the size of the succulent shrimp. The French toast..... Left a bit much to be desired. I felt it had promise (being a self proclaimed French toast connoisseur) but my friends were not fans of it. I think they were a little too generous on the coffee part and is was over soaked. I think they are on to something, it just didn't taste that way that day. Anyway, the chicken and waffles were good but I have had better. The chicken was very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside but the waffles needs some work. The service was good and we had a very sweet waitress/cashier that offered to take additional orders with out making us go back to the front counter. Overall, a great eating experience and I am definitely going back!"
10/6/2015,20151006,5,4.11,"This place is fabulous. I love the at-home feel when you get here. The people who work here are so nice. Very relaxing. The food, um yes. The food is solid. Everything tastes like it's made from scratch. That's why even though you wait a little longer, it is so worth it. And who cares if you wait?! Meals don't always need to be rushed. I recommend the gumbo, chicken and dumplings, fried chicken and biscuits of course. And the decor and music is super fun! Please come. A great addition to the Square."
10/6/2015,20151006,5,4.12,"I just tried this place for the first time and it was very delicious. There were three of us and we ordered several items to share:Collard Greens (savory and tender)Cornbread (not amazing, but definitely tasty)Roasted beets (fresh and delicious)Shrimp and grits (plentiful well-seasoned shrimp with cheesy creamy grits)Short Rib Mac 'n Cheese (my favorite thing - super savory, creamy, tender meat)Chicken Gumbo (typical, perfectly decent gumbo)Pecan Pie (not overly sweet, you could actually taste the pecans!)Beignets (fluffy and sweet)It is counter-style ordering - so you order and then go wait at your table. The food came out somewhat randomly, and some of it did take quite awhile. This was all totally fine, as we were just sharing everything and none of us were in a hurry. The guy who brought our food was pretty funny and joked with us, and the owner/chef even came out at one point to see how we liked the food. He mentioned that they'd just changed the menu. so I don't know what the menu was like before.Bonus is it's BYOB. I'll definitely be back! Also, we went on a Wednesday at 7:30 and we snagged one of two tables available. I imagine on weekends there may be a wait."
10/7/2015,20151007,2,4.09,"Service: the woman at the register was very kind, friendly, and informative. However, the food runners and bussers didn't really seem to have it togetherFood: we travel to the low country every spring and my wife's family has roots in NOLA. I realize it's hard to replicate, but everything was fair to poor. Catfish - plain, just cornmeal, no seasoningCrawfish Etoufee was barely edible, very fishy tasting, and soupyFried green tomatoes - were fair, nothing amazingThe She Crab soup was the lone winner. This is not the place to find flavorful southern food."
10/13/2015,20151013,3,4.08,"Luella's is a nice addition to the Lincoln Square neighborhood. The food was good, the ambiance comfortable. The menu is compact, but has choices that should please any palate.We liked the kale ambrosia salad -- and who wouldn't, with its pineapple, coconut, candied pecan accents? Fried chicken was OK: crispy & tender, though a bit salty, with too much rendered fat trapped under the crust. Shrimp & grits featured delicious fresh-tasting shrimp; however, the cream cheese grits were too far over the top in terms of richness. Food arrived ~15 minutes after we ordered at the counter.This is a no-frills place. BYOB is a nice thing. Staff was friendly and checked on us periodically. Since there is no waiter service, everything arrives at once, no coursing -- a minus for me. Ditto the no reservation policy. Prices are reasonable. Luella's is A-OK. I'll be back to check out other dishes, I'm sure."
10/25/2015,20151025,5,4.09,"Wow. I'm a fried chicken maniac. This stuff is top notch. Also had the kale salad with grapefruit, pineapple and toasted coconut. A great fresh dish to go with the debauchery. Red beans and rice with some kielbasa in there were excellent. Mack and cheese is sensational with a great cheese sauce and bread crumbs. Perfectly flavorful with a touch of salt. And the beignets...oh the beignets...I will be back again and again and again."
10/31/2015,20151031,2,4.06,"Food was good, but service was weird/ uncomfortable .We ordered the coffee, andouille sausage quiche and chicken & waffles.As we sat down and the server/buser delivered the coffee. Instead of just saying the good ole ""hello"" or ""good morning "", he said ""ni hao "" ?!?!!? Just because we're Asian he started greeting us in messed up Chinese. It made the rest of the meal very uncomfortable.Food was decent but damn, I definitely won't be back again"
11/1/2015,20151101,3,4.05,"Ate at Luellas last night. I had the infamous fried chicken and greens, with extra sides of mac n cheese and cornbread. I had read so much about the fried chicken, I couldn't wait to try it. It was good, you could definitely taste the brine, but it fell short because there was absolutely no salt on the chicken! Clearly the brine does not include salt and the nice crispy, batter on the chicken didn't either. I found it funny that the waitress immediately asked me if I wanted hot sauce. I don't normally put hot sauce on fried chicken, because if it's good chicken it shouldn't need it, but after eating a piece, I changed my mind and requested the hot sauce if only for the salt. The mac and cheese was ok, nice choice of noodles, but the noodles sat in a very watery-like cheese sauce that didn't stick to the noodles very well - meh. On the other hand, the cornbread, greens, and sweet tea were awesome. I got the feeling that they were still getting things together as the service from the staff, while extremely nice and courteous, seemed very uncoordinated. With time, I'm sure they'll get better. All in all, I enjoyed it and will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes - seems promising."
11/1/2015,20151101,1,4.01,"PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: DO NOT COME HERE.Food was pretty average and the servings were pathetically small for the price (about $12 for a tiny bowl of collards and two dinky eggs Benedict). The brunch menu was pretty limited as well. Perhaps most disappointing was the service. You order at the counter but they don't seem to know how to make the system run smoothly, or maybe there just wasn't enough people working. Either way, two of our meals (out of six) arrived FORTY MINUTES ahead of the rest so the two of us whose food arrived in a timely fashion awkwardly finished before the others' meals even arrived at the table. On top of that, the food was cold from sitting on the counter waiting to be delivered. There was not even an utterance of an apology or acknowledgment of this hugely significant delay or horrifically rude service, and they weren't even particularly busy. It probably goes without saying at this point, but I would not recommend."
11/8/2015,20151108,5,4.02,"Chef Darnell cares about the food he makes and it shows. His love for southern cooking shines in this ode to Grandma Luella; outstanding fried chicken that outshines all the competition (The Roost, Honey Butt Chicken), greens like momma makes, hearty shrimp and grits with shrimp the size of your head and the excellent kale and watermelon salad that cleanses the palette and leaves your taste buds singing. Fried green tomatoes were on point. Keep putting that soul into the food brotha, it's makes me feel good!"
11/11/2015,20151111,5,4.04,"Charming addition to Lincoln Square.  At the door, we are greeted by a warm ambience of walls laden with pine board .  It's all counter ordering here, which suits this casual, cool and low maintenance eatery.We had the short rib mac n cheese, shrimp po boy, red beans and rice and finished our meal strong with pecan pie topped with sweet potato ice cream.  Everything was fresh, perfectly spiced (the fried!) and flaky. We will return and recommend highly!"
11/11/2015,20151111,5,4.05,"The wonderful smells lured us in from the sidewalk. The cornbread, burger, and fries were delicious. Customer service and atmosphere were great. Very relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely be back."
11/18/2015,20151118,2,4.02,"Went to eat here once. It has a weird vibe about it. I never had southern food but i was expecting some real, heavy portioned southern food but i was really disappointed that it wasn't. I ordered the fried fish tacos which was good despite not being enough to feed a toy poodle. The price for the small portions is ridiculous. It just steers people away to MUCH better options right next door, like taco in a bag or the daily diner which i love."
11/20/2015,20151120,4,4.02,"Great, quick spot for Southern food cravings. I stopped here over the weekend for brunch and enjoyed the Southern Benedict and my husband had the Chicken and Waffles. We had great service and cleared our plates! The place was packed with locals by the time we finished up so it's not a spot to linger and catch up with friends. It's a small spot so after eating we got up and gave our table to a couple waiting.We'll be back! Yum!"
11/25/2015,20151125,2,4.0,"Hones review: good not great though like I wouldn't come again or recommend to anybody the service is awk u order n grab ur own utensils. They ran out of Mac n cheese how u gonna run out of what ur known for that's like if kfc ran out of chicken no Bueno what I really didn't like is that they were rushing us to finish like I get it that it's closing soon but that's rude as fuck like I'm not sleeping over like they would take dishes away without us being finished really ruined my experience. Wheres the southern hospitality good service is what brings customers back n there still alot of people there too not like we were the only ones there. Wish there was she crab soup i saw it on check please n they dont have it. All in all if ur gonna come get the shrimp n grits. Still on the look out for the best southern restaurant if u want the best fried chicken go to longman and eagleGumbo: really good was mostly soup though like gumbo should be really full with meat. It was flavorful but nothing like omg this is the best soup I've ever had. There was no depth of flavor. I like that they pour it in the bowl that's coolCat fish tacos: it looked amazing but didn't taste the way it looked. They were good tacos too dont get me wrong, just the cat fish wasnt seasoned good. The condiments werent that great either it could have been an amaizin taco if it was executed properly the slaw should either be heavenly vinegared or mayonnaise based n the sauce should be an amaizin aioli adding heat would be a good idea. Glad they added lemon though Biscuits and jam: i was so surprised cause usually there dry n flavorless it was so warm and buttery perfect texture wasnt hard like a rock or crumbling if u touch it. I wish there was an additional flavor. The jam was amaizing like i was licking the jar that it comes in. It was the perfect combination of sweet and sour. The sauce went perfect with the butteriness the biscuits. I wish there was more sauce given Fried chicken and collard greens: it was so moist. I never had chicken breast this moist. I didnt need a knife at all. The issues were the actual fried chicken wasnt that flavorful like it was good but like not as great as long man and eagles fried chicken. It was crispy but was really greasy to the point where there was a plateful of grease on the plate. The collard greens were really good not bitter at all. The gravy was the actual problem. It was all lumpy n the flour wasnt cooked long enough so all u could taste was uncooked flour.if chicken and waffles are ur best seller then sell it all throughout the day not jus at brunchShrimp and grits: i never had good shrimp and grits untill now wow they were spectacular. The grits were so good not hard not to runny, perfect. The flavor of them were sooooooo fucking good i cant describe it jus order it and be amazed. The shrimp were also good but i wish the shrimp were seasoned better they were just plain shrimp. Also one wasnt cleaned. The sauce was to die for all in all i would come back here just for this. The issue was there was so much rosemary. Like all u could taste is rosemary n it wasnt chopped properly so u would be pulling out big chunks of rosemary out of ur mouth no bueno lolPeacan pie with sweatpotatoe pie: must order delish. So rich omg i was in heaven while eating this. Best peacan pie i ever had really wass great. The issues were the pie crust was falling apart like really having difficulty staying together n wasnt that flavorful. The ice cream was way to frozen i hate frozen desserts they dont taste as good as they could when that happens. It was really good ice cream though just dont over freeze itBeignets: we didnt get to eat these because they were kicking us out. When we got home they were already to soggy due to all the grease reAlly was bummed out"
11/27/2015,20151127,5,4.01,"I tried this place for the first time tonight for dinner, and I will certainly return. You order and pay first and they bring the food to your table. We were a table of six, so we tried a lot of items. Everything is homemade, even the bbq sauce and the jam. The shrimp and grits was flavorful, creamy with the perfect amount of spice. I also loved the beet salad because it has both warmed and chilled beets. My friends raved about the gumbo and the catfish tacos (the tacos were a special though.) The pecan tart with sweet potato ice cream was balanced and not too sweet. However, we all agreed that the biscuits with jam was the best item we tried. Honestly, those biscuits were other worldly, just try them, trust me. The brunch menu looks great and I can't wait to try it out. The best part of my experience was meeting Ms. Luella, she was a warm and inviting lady and a wonderful hostess."
11/28/2015,20151128,4,4.01,"Along with everyone else in Chicago, we went to Luella's after seeing it on Check, Please! I was worried about portions but fear not: even I couldn't finish everything on my plate. As everyone raves, the Shrimp and Grits are wonderful--I think there were five shrimp in there! The shrimp po' boy and fries were really good too. My only gripe is what others have noted; dishes came out at different times which isn't ideal when your party isn't sharing everything. The service seemed a bit disorganized but everyone was friendly. I think it's a tad overpriced but I would go back."
11/29/2015,20151129,2,3.99,"Luella's has been on my list for a couple months to try. After seeing it on Check Please, it pushed me over the edge to go. Sadly, I was very disappointed in my experience. We arrived at 10am for brunch. The super friendly staff that I was expecting was sorely missing. I'm guessing the family members we all off, and this shift isn't up to snuff. We ordered first of all customers, right at 10am. Our first dish did not arrive until 10:30. A 30 minute wait isn't acceptable. At about 10:15 an employee sauntered in and promptly went into the kitchen. I'm guessing his time was more important than ours or his fellow employees and this lead to the unacceptable delay. Ridiculously when food did arrive my wife and I got our meals and my already yelling toddler got even louder as his didn't. His food finally arrived a good 5-7 minutes after ours. I can forgive bad service if the food is good, but sadly the problems continued with our food. On a positive note the shrimp and grits were great. The beignets were good but too big and sugary to eat more than like a quarter of the serving size. My complaints come with the other two dishes. First of all, my son's french fries, besides absurdly the easiest thing to make coming out last, we're boring and not seasoned. There was a touch of salt, but the salt was to big to stick to the fries and there wasn't enough. Decently crunchy but literally no flavor. The chicken and waffles were even worse. I love southern food and have had this dish dozens of time. This was literally the worst. How do you mess this up, you might ask? Well first of all the chicken was not seasoned at all, lacking all flavor. The batter was nice and had a good crunch. The waffles tasted like an eggo and there was not enough syrup to soak up either the chicken or waffles. Disaster.I had very high hopes and walked away disappointed on multiple fronts."
11/29/2015,20151129,4,3.99,"I quite enjoyed the food here. It was quick and easy and made for great carryout. I ordered chicken dumplings, red beans and rice, gumbo, and a few other things. I really enjoyed it all and will definitely come back."
11/30/2015,20151130,4,3.99,"I'd swear I wrote a review for this place already, but here we go. We were at the local German Day Parade party and decided that as good Wisconsinites, we couldn't bring ourselves to spend $7 for a brat. So out came the trusty Yelp app and a short walk later, we were in southern food heaven. I'm mentioned in other reviews, but I'm a bit of a NOLA snob, but I'm also usually super-grateful to get a bite of home. The food here was a welcome respite in the chaos of that day and also just really good and filling and made me feel cozy and at home. Husband had the gumbo and I had the mac and cheese and we shared. We also had fried green tomatoes to start. Everything was well-seasoned and balanced. It all just felt like being in your pajamas in front of the fire. I'm a sucker for a real, actual beignet and they lived up to my expectations. I love fast casual - we were in and out in less than 30 minutes, but had a great meal and were prepared to go face the beer-soaked masses. Others in our group ended up gulping sub-par gyros later in the night and it just reinforced what a good decision this meal was."
12/3/2015,20151203,5,4.0,"Really excellent..! We went at 11:45am weekday lunch. We were the second table. By 12:15pm, all the tables were taken..! Not to mention the phone was ringing for pick-up orders.Regardless, it was excellent and the portions were right on the money. We started with skillet cornbread; and, then we shared a shrimp and grits and 3-piece fried chicken and greens entrees.The cornbread app was great..! Moist, moist, moist..! The shrimp and grits was delish as well. The shrimp were tender and the grits were creamy and had a slight texture to them - not like mushy style. The fried chicken will make you get up and dance..! It's that good.We're gonna go again, a weekday lunch, which is fine with us (maybe a little calmer considering what others have written). It'll be the shrimp po'boy and the chicken and dumplings. Of course, the cornbread skillet..!"
12/6/2015,20151206,1,3.97,2nd time the waffle machine has been down in 5 visits . Unacceptable considering chicken and waffles are the best item to order. I also don't wanna hear that we are busy as the reasoning for waffle machines going down and not having the domestic southern soda .
12/7/2015,20151207,3,3.96,"Good fried chicken addition to the neighborhood. Limited seating, which is fine. But cannot order until a table opens up. I had the chicken and biscuits which was good but not bib gourmand good. Didn't have sides, but would not go out of my way to come here. Service was disappointing and food was good, but not great."
12/9/2015,20151209,5,3.97,"What a great addition to the Lincoln Square neighborhood! Everybody is as sweet as can be and every dish I've tried has been out of this world- love the shrimp and grits and just today I had red beans and rice with collard greens- as good as any I've had in New Orleans and that's saying something. Haven't tried the fried chicken yet, but have heard it's superb. Plus they always have tasteful R&B playing on the stereo."
12/13/2015,20151213,3,3.96,"I should start by saying that my wife and I grew up in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee. That means that we can be a little more critical of ""southern eats"" than the average Joe--but we're also a little more enthusiastic about them.So, we were excited to try Luella's. We went for a late lunch on a Friday and were surprised that there were 6-7 tables of diners at an off-time. Must be good! We were also surprised by the fact that it was approx. 97 degrees inside. I mean, we were sweating!The place seemed casual--wood paneling, kitschy southern charm, etc. The waitress brought us menus and came to take our order about 5 minutes later. She didn't mention any specials or anything off-menu, but we later found out that the menu posted above the cash register had different stuff than the menus we'd been handed, and we missed some things as a result.We ordered fried chicken, shrimp & grits, and beignets. Oh, and we got sweet tea, of course!The service was nice, but it was very, very, verrrrrrrrrry slow. From what we could tell, there was only 1 waitress working, but there were 3-4 other employees in the back. I'm not really sure what they did the whole time we were there--bus tables? Plate stuff? Expedite? It didn't seem as efficient as it should be.We saw a lot of people asking about their food, and stuff seemed to be coming out at a snail's pace. It took a good 30 minutes for us to get ours.The shrimp & grits was pretty good, if not a little aggressive with the rosemary. The fried chicken was a solid ""C."" It was greasy and the batter fell right off. It came with a smoked gravy, which was delicious, but the bowl literally had like 2 tbsp of gravy in it. The greens lacked flavor.We'd ordered the beignets with the rest of our food, hoping to avoid a long wait after our meal, but it took another 20 minutes after we'd eaten for them to come. They were good--a little dense--but good. Our bill was $38 for lunch, which I thought was a lot for small-ish portions and such a casual vibe.I'm always happy to see a southern restaurant open in Chicago, as it reminds us of home. But I'm not sure we'll give Luella's another try."
12/17/2015,20151217,5,3.97,"I love the soul food. I've had the chicken and waffles, chicken gumbo, beignets, fries, fried green tomatoes, braised short rib with mac, and the seasonal teas! Obviously the food is good since I've tried enough items on the menu."
12/19/2015,20151219,5,3.98,"OK, THIS IS THE SECOND Time I'm reviewing this resteraunt. Thanks computer (smh). OK the short version of what I said B4. I had Buttermilk Fried Chicken with smoked Gravy,and Collard Greens!!!... OMG da Greens FIRST, were the best I've EVER tasted. Extremely, perfectly, tender. I had Short Rib Mac and Cheese. I had a problem getting to the Fried Chicken because the Short Rib Mac and Cheese was SO,SO good!!! I also had Cornbread and HoneyButter!!??! You can't get honeybutter often anymore. I grew up on the stuff. Ya don't know whatcha missin'.The chef and Owner Darnell came over to check on me. and was well attended to by my waitress Kesha"
12/19/2015,20151219,1,3.95,"After watching Check Please, my best friend and I decided to come here to celebrate his birthday. The portion of each order was extremely small, both of us were still hungry after the dinner. I had a Fried Chicken and he had a Shrimp & Grits, and our bill total is about $38.00. I have a high hope about this place, but I was very disappointed. The service was not impressed at all. Both of us decided that we will not come back here again because there are better southern food restaurants in the Chicagoland where we can get better food, better services, with the same price. It is just my experience tonight."
12/19/2015,20151219,4,3.95,"It's cafeteria style. We had the shrimp & grits, gumbo, collard greens, and fried chicken. I would recommend all of them. I would skip the beignets. I thought they were too thick and bland. Overall the food was very good. Service was good too."
12/20/2015,20151220,1,3.92,"I really wanted to like this place. Went once when they first opened and it was decent, but very slow. Regretted not getting the chicken and waffles so had wanted to give them another chance. Sunday at noon, it was full but not packed. Placed our order and waited. And waited. And waited. In the ensuing 25 minutes we watched every other table get served the same dishes we ordered with a hungry, crying one year old. We had asked about our order and told it was coming, only to find out it was never put in. Instead of an apology, we got an excuse.If it was possibly to give negative stars we would.Had to cancel the order and went to Monty Gael's instead. We know they serve food there reliably. Now enjoying some cheese curds."
12/21/2015,20151221,2,3.9,"Very disappointed in this place.  Thought it would be a great addition to the neighborhood, but the service is very sporadic.  Menu has some interesting items on it, but they need to add more things that can function as quick aps if they do not increase the speed of their operations; otherwise, you could be sitting for a very long time with nothing to snack on.The place is relatively new, so hoping they can fix their operations and improve the customer experience."
12/25/2015,20151225,5,3.91,"REAL SWEET TEA.My fiance, a born and bred Chicagoan, did not understand my Florida girl cravings for sweet tea. ""I had it in Georgia, it's disgusting."" Luella's changed his mind.I've had the gumbo, buttermilk fried chicken with collard greens, and the chicken and dumplings. My dude has had the red beans and rice and the short rib mac n cheese (which I got to try bites of, heavenly!). We've arrived at night at dinner time usually, around 7pm or so. I'd say food took about 10-15 minutes to come out, so I haven't been plagued by these long waits like other reviewers. Seems to be hit or miss.Service is SO friendly, especially considering you pay for everything and tip up front before you get your food. It's always busy when I come here and I can see why. The ambiance is home-y, everything is incredibly delicious (**see details below) and the portions are huge for what you pay for.**Skillet cornbread did take a bit longer to come out than other items but that's plainly stated on the menu, and is very much worth the wait.All of the food was perfect. Breading on the buttermilk fried chicken was just the right amount of crispy, the short rib in the mac n cheese practically melts in your mouth, the best collard greens I've had since Florida (and the only ones done right), etc. The only odd one out in my opinion was the chicken and dumplings. The presentation is kitschy and cool, but it lacked flavor. I probably could've fixed this myself with a few dashes of salt (I don't salt anything, ever) but there was just something missing. Still, dumplings were good consistency and chicken was very tender.Give it a try and maybe show up around dinner on a weekday for the first time."
12/27/2015,20151227,4,3.91,"After seeing Luella's featured on the PBS show Check Please I wanted to visit. So. Flippin. Good. So good that I didn't even take pictures of my food and dove right in. Nom Nom! My wife and I started our dining experience with a order of corn bread (which takes 15 minutes to bake). The corn bread was fluffy and flavorful. We then ordered the Shrimp and Grits and Chicken and Waffles (apple cider flavor) off the weekend brunch menu. They only serve brunch on Sat/Sun between 10am-3pm. The Shrimp and Grits were delicious with a very creamy texture and was just the right amount of food for two people to share. The chicken and waffles stood out as well, with the chicken not being too dry and with the overall flavor having just the right amount of sweetness to it. Finally, we paired the meal with sweet tea (free refills). Every item was worth the try. My two cousins who dined with us ordered the exact same dishes and they left satisfied. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Chef Darnell for the flavorful food. We'll be back!"
12/30/2015,20151230,4,3.91,"All around great dining experience. The staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is laid back and ""homey"" and the food was delicious. I got the Forever Braised Shortrib Mac & Cheese, which was very good and filling. The breadcrumbs were a nice touch, but I do think some barbecue flavoring would have made this dish AMAZING. I also got a side of cornbread, which was delicious.As this place is BYOB and the environment is casual yet vibrant, it seemed like a great place to bring a big group of people to hang out/feast. Especially since the quality/quantity of food you get for the price is a bargain. I'll definitely be back, especially for brunch to try the chicken & waffles!"
12/31/2015,20151231,5,3.92,"We absolutely loved Luella's. The food and service were both excellent. The first time we went was a Saturday evening and the wait was long (over an hour) and they don't take reservations except for parties of 10 or more. We decided not to wait. We came back on a Tuesday evening and there was no wait around 6 PM. Since it was our first time there, they were so helpful and made recommendations for things to try. We started with the corn bread. It is a sweet corn bread, which is what I like, but not too sweet. Its baked in a cast iron pan and the bottom of the bread has a nice crust. I had the BBQ shrimp and grits and it was amazing. The grits were so creamy and the BBQ sauce on the shrimp was really good. My daughter had the fried fish and collard greens and those were also very good. The breading on the chicken was crispy and the chicken was very juicy. My husband had the gumbo and it was also very good. He thought it was better than gumbo he had anywhere in New Orleans.They were so friendly and kept checking on us and asking us how it was or if we needed anything. Best of all, its BYOB, so they had the best beer in town.We will definitely be back."
1/1/2016,20160101,5,3.93,"My visits have been limited to Sunday brunchin' and each time, we have loved it. If you plan to dine with those loving Southern cooking, this will be a treat. Their shrimp and grits is seriously one of the best offered in all of Chicago. Since the first time I tried it at Luella's (9/2015) I've been ordering it around town. I'd found some interesting additions to it, but nothing that compared or came close in texture / flavor. While I've been able to dig their food / brunch. I'm not so crazy about the ""a la carte"" dining experience. It's a self service kind of place. Orders are placed and then you navigate to a table. Every new order must be paid for before it hits the table. Depending on the time, customers may have to grab their own water, condiments, flatware, etc. I think they once said, doing that helps keep operating costs down. If they operated like a traditional sit-down, I'd probably try them out for other meals or more often."
1/5/2016,20160105,5,3.94,"Stopped by for Tuesday lunch (always so crowded otherwise)...loved it, 3 of us split the fried chicken, the cornbread and the legendary shrimp & grits. Wish I could say one was better than the other, I can't, all AMAZING! Super nice staff as well...."
1/12/2016,20160112,4,3.94,Went here with my family on New Years Eve and I must say the food was super super tasty! We had a little bit of everything as everyone wanted to try everything. We ordered -the brisket Mac and cheese//rich and decadent and totally satisfying!-the shrimp and grits// the prize here. Perfectly cooked shrimp and the creole-risqué sauce has the perfect amount of creaminess and spice. The grits are thick which I prefer. -the pimento burger// pimento sauce is tasty and the burger was cooked well but nothing that I would order again.-shrimp po boy// huge sandwich with lots of shrimp! Tasty but not spectacular-fried chicken// SO. MOIST. It was honestly amazing and I'm still confused as to how it's kept so moist. It's delicious! And the crust is super crunchy and amazing. Comes with a gravy that no one was crazy about but you'll forget it's there. - chicken and dumplings// pretty bland but I'll chalk it up to it was probably the last bowl of the day on a holiday the broth needed to develop a bit more. - the cornbread with honey butter. Super cakey and moist great starter! The honey butter is way better than the one at honey butter fried chicken! Ended with the beignets which let meTell you we had to take home along with a lot of other things because we were stuffed! Super yeasty and perfect. Messy but powdered sugar is never neat.Staff is super sweet and pretty handsome in the kitchen and a super cute place. I'll definitely be back!
1/15/2016,20160115,5,3.95,"Where do I begin!! The food was so delicious! Textures, flavors, portion sizes all spot on. We tried braised short ribs Mac n cheese, beignets, shrimp po boy, and beet salad. Can't think of any flaws. Highly recommend Luella's! I'll be back again."
1/18/2016,20160118,5,3.96,Luella's Southern Kitchen is absolutely wonderful! I am from the South and have not had food like I had at Luella's since the last time I was IN the South! The fried chicken was mind-blowing. The collard greens....oh my god! The shrimp and grits were unbelievably good! Eat at this restaurant!!!
1/21/2016,20160121,5,3.97,"Love this place! The poboy, gumbo and shrimp and grits are my absolute favorite! The staff is super nice. We had the sweetest, prettiest waitress! Also, the food is awesome and it's BYOB!!"
1/21/2016,20160121,5,3.98,"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have 5 stars. Absolutely amazing food, service, and energy! My girlfriend and I ordered the Fried Chicken, Greens, cornbread, and short rib Mac 'N Cheese. Let me tell you....I haven't had southern food this good served in the Midwest is a LONG time!! This might be my new favorite restaurant in Chicago!"
1/25/2016,20160125,4,3.98,Luella's is a bit of a hidden gem in Lincoln square. Went for brunch on Saturday and everything was very good. While I didn't have them two friends raved about the shrimp and grits. The southern eggs benedict was super yummy and my andoule sausage keish was scrumptious. The only thing was wasn't ask that good were the beignets. Big and too doughy. Nothing to write home about. Plus: it's BYOBNegative: they don't sell any juice so we could make mimosas. Must remember to bring our own next time. Also one bus boy was a little strange. He kept interrupting us to ask weird questions which ruined the mood a little. He even tried to see if we wanted to rent a house in the neighborhood. Nope. We just was to eat and enjoy our conversation thanks. Overall still a pretty good spot. Check it out!
1/30/2016,20160130,4,3.98,"This is my fourth time here but first time having brunch. Had the French toast, it was light and full of taste didn't even need syrup."
1/31/2016,20160131,5,3.99,"Went there for brunch this morning with a group of six. We lucked out and the big 8 person table was open so we were able to sit right down. You go up and order and they bring your food to you. We got the beignets, which were huge and delicious! I had the Southern Eggs Benedict, which was amazing! Everyone else had that or the Chicken and Waffles, which they said were amazing, as well. The service is super fast and the food was great, so I'd highly recommend trying them out! They're a great addition to Lincoln Square :)"
2/1/2016,20160201,5,4.0,"Chicken & Dumplings heavily salted, peppered and seasoned. Moist chicken. Cute retro music playing. Tons of people there on a Sunday night.Order at the back and they'll bring it out to you.BYOB"
2/4/2016,20160204,5,4.01,"Dahm! Buttermilk Fried Chicken with spicy gravy and collard greens are a must for your first visit. Add biscuits to the order and you're set for lunch and dinner. Fast casual works well, but don't take a table until you order. They celebrated their one year anniversary 2/03/16. Certainly need a revisit for their shrimp and grits. Friendly owners, Kim is granddaughter and Chef Darnell is the great grandson of the beloved Luella Funches. Love supporting a generation honoring their family and her recipes. I could only do a 1/4 dark and I dumped the gravy over one of the two biscuits. I'm looking forward to leftovers! The skin and its texture is amazing. You could put the skin on a bun and make it a meal. The collard greens are fantastic and I found myself slurping up the juices. Fresh made raspberry preserves accompany the fresh made biscuits. Catfish tacos are on my radar too."
2/21/2016,20160221,4,4.01,Chicken & waffles were amazing. Pimento burger was pretty great too. Mud pie not so much. Kind of frustrating that they don't offer full menu during Sunday brunch because chicken and dumplings looked delicious.
2/26/2016,20160226,2,3.99,"I picked up a shrimp po boy to go tonight and was very disappointed. I have ordered from here before and was very pleased with my shrimp po boy. It is not an inexpensive sandwich to begin with but I loved the first one so and it had plenty of tasty gulf shrimp. Not today. What I got was a baguette sparsely filled with some sort of breaded shrimp mush. Never before have I had a shrimp po boy where shrimp were cut in half lengthwise AFTER they were breaded and fried. As in all of my other po boy sandwich experiences, the shrimp were whole shrimp tales as seen in photos posted earlier. Also, after I paid for my $16 w/tax sandwich, I said thank you and got no response of any kind. What the heck happened? I seriously had a hard time identifying the meat as a shrimp tale. So sad."
2/29/2016,20160229,5,4.0,"I enjoy this restaurant and Big Jones but each for different reasons. Both have very good food, but Big Jones offers a somewhat elevated take on Southern classics while Luella's offers more of a traditional version that is just perfectly prepared. Big Jones offers some nice cocktails while Luella's is BYOB. All in all, I would say that Northsiders should consider themselves lucky to have both restaurants so close. Forced to choose, I would probably pick Luella's 75% of the time and Big Jones 25% because Luella's matches my preferences of Southern food more so than Big Jones and is more reminiscent of the food that I love to have when visiting Charleston, SC."
3/1/2016,20160301,3,3.99,"I wasn't that impressed with Luella's. This place is counter service and has a really simple menu of southern food. Most things are a la carte, or rather, there aren't many dishes where you get a protein + starch + veggies, which is rather annoying since most everything on the menu is $10 - $15. My wife and I had the fried chicken w/ collard greens + chicken and dumplings. The fried chicken was incredibly greasy and even though it was tasty, it was so greasy and heavy that it wasn't the most enjoyable thing to eat. I must admit the collard greens were great. As for the chicken and dumplings they were nice and peppery (like really peppery) but were good rather than great. I'm tempted to go back again to try some of the other dishes, but I'm not in a rush. This place seems better for lunch than dinner, and I was a little turned off by the price for counter food, and not really getting a full, balanced meal."
3/3/2016,20160303,5,4.0,"I saw them on Check Please! and had to make the trip to the North Side to check it out. I have been back twice since. I wish they were closer to me, I'd be a regular. The shrimp & grits are out of this world and so is the fried chicken. Their homemade biscuits are also delicious. I guess they have become my new reason for coming to Ravenswood. BYOB"
3/5/2016,20160305,5,4.01,Stopped in for dessert . Loved the beignets! I highly recommend. Ps the chicken looks magical here .
3/7/2016,20160307,5,4.02,"My boyfriend and I found this place on accident. I am so glad that we decided to try something new that day. The food here is just as good if not better than the food I had in New Orleans. The shrimp and grits, catfish, and short rib Mac and Cheese are my favorites. They have so much flavor it is insane. I could literally eat those three dishes every day for the rest of my life and be satisfied. The staff is always friendly, warm, and inviting. The chef always greets you from the open kitchen upon arrival. He also comes out later to see if you enjoyed your meal."
3/10/2016,20160310,4,4.02,Another Giftie transaction that went well. My boyfriend and I went in here about an hour before closing but they were still very happy to serve us and have us eat there. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and recommended we get the fried chicken and biscuits. When it arrived to the table it also came with collard greens and gravy. The portions were great for sharing and the food was very tasty. The restaurant was clean and they were playing some great jams. Overall great experience.
3/16/2016,20160316,5,4.02,"Found this place on Giftie App, its pretty killer Southern Food. The chef/owner Darnell is a very, very bad man. Like as in Michael Jackson he's dangerous like a ""smooth criminal."" This food should come with a warning label as its highly addictive. Consider yourself warned... and be sure to get the hush puppies."
3/17/2016,20160317,4,4.02,"I thought the food was really good. Shrimp and grits was filling and delicious. The biscuits were warm and buttery. The beingets were good, I think they would be better a bit smaller. I know they are technically sweet and should be served after a meal but I like to dip them in my coffee first. They also have a good local coffee brew. The reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 is because of the service. They forgot my sweet tea and the biscuits came way after we finished our shrimp and grits, so we were almost full. Then the beingets came out 15 mins after the biscuits. So what could have been an in and out meal turned into like 45 mins of waiting on biscuits and beingets, seemed kind of silly. I will come back for sure because I support local small businesses and the food was really good."
3/19/2016,20160319,5,4.03,"Mouthwatering fried catfish creole, shrimp and grits, and beignets so fresh and hot...just stellar food. Eat here!"
3/20/2016,20160320,4,4.03,"My husband and I ordered here for the first time tonight and we both very pleased with our food. My husband got the fired chicken and said after almost every bite ""this is so good."" I got the shrimp & grits and was equally pleased. We ordered picked up our food and don't exactly live close so I was worried it might not transport so well but everything was really good. The slight surprise was the portion size, specifically for the chicken. For $14 I think my husband was expecting more than three pieces...but he did get three pieces of really great chicken and wasn't by any means still hungry.Overall we will definitely be back in the future"
3/23/2016,20160323,5,4.04,"Huge fan. I've been there about a dozen times now, and I take people here whenever I can. Last time I was there with friends, the chef came out and talked with us for about 10 minutes--and that was after our meal of shrimp po' boy, shrimp and grits, catfish, and a special St. Patrick's Day dessert of fresh donuts with Bailey's and Irish Cream dipping sauce. By the end of the night, my friends were raving.They serve Baker Miller grits (the best in the city) and I love the counter service + BYOB model. It's so laid back and easy. It's a perfect addition to Lincoln Square.EDIT: They brought back their brisket mac and cheese! You should eat all of it immediately."
3/24/2016,20160324,5,4.05,"THE best southern kitchen (next to my mom's kitchen) that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at. I don't eat grits, but I'm going back to order me some MORE those things we FANTASTIC!"
3/27/2016,20160327,5,4.05,"Luella's is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Hands down.Chef Darnell has a deep understanding of the food he is creating and you can taste the love and time he puts into his meals in every bite. The chicken gumbo is my favorite meal - I've had it probably 10 times since I've been going here. The mac and cheese is very rich and hearty and is probably my second favorite. Their sweet tea is delicious, and every month or so they have a new seasonal sweet tea and they are always very refreshing and different. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. They all greet you when you come in and truly embody the idea of southern hospitality."
3/29/2016,20160329,4,4.05,"PROS- Friendly table staff- Food arrived quickly- Very tasty foodCONS- Prices high for a counter-service restaurant- Small portions- Very heavy foodHaving lived in the South, I appreciate good Southern comfort food. So we went to Luella's on Easter Sunday evening and ordered the fried chicken, brisket mac 'n cheese, gumbo (which we split) and a side of corn bread. All came out fairly quickly and tasted great. Part of the reason it tastes so great is that Southern food uses a lot of butter, grease, lard (and love) - but I have a feeling Luella's doubles what most typical Southern recipes call for because their food was EXTREMELY heavy. Well, heavier than normal for Southern comfort food, I should say. It didn't taste bad by any means - it tasted great - but after eating the side of corn bread, which came out first in a tiny skillet, we felt a little full. When the rest of the meal came out, I was surprised how small the portion sizes were, given that our total order for two came to $43. To me, that's high for a ""place your order at the front counter"" restaurant. But because the food was so heavy and filling, we didn't leave hungry. I'd go again, but can't go too often. My belt and wallet couldn't take it."
4/7/2016,20160407,4,4.05,"I am having fantasies about the Shrimp po' boy and can't wait for the oyster po' boy. I've not had bad food here. I'm a displaced Cajun, so this is as good as I have had up here. You're still gonna get better in someone's kitchen, but I'll take this when I'm needing a po' boy fix and don't feel like cooking...oh and a shrimp and grits fix too."
4/9/2016,20160409,3,4.04,"We arrived at 5 PM on Saturday we figured it wouldn't be too crowded. The food was delicious from the shrimp and grits, the biscuits. To my frustration the chicken and waffles were only at brunch. The disappointment was the fried green tomatoes they were paper thin. The service staff was very nice but how you got your food was the Night mare. You stood in line payed for The food you wanted a server to bring you the food but it came at various times 20 minutes eating time 60 minutes waiting for the food.get it together or get a bigger place."
4/13/2016,20160413,5,4.05,"Seriously...just work your way through the entire menu. Sure you may have to spend an additional hour at the gym a day...but, like all worthwhile things in life there is a price to pay! I will suggest that when it comes to Luella's menu, you should pay that price!"
4/16/2016,20160416,5,4.06,I love Luella's. It's a great place for brunch or lunch. I recommend the Shrimp & Grits - generous portion and incredibly flavorful. I'll be back soon!
4/16/2016,20160416,2,4.04,"We went for Brunch on a Saturday. The place is a small comfy place. I ordered the quiche, which was probably the worst thing on the menu. We also ordered the Chicken and Waffles, which were great. The French toast was very delicious. I personally should've went with my first choice... Shrimp and grits!!!"
4/19/2016,20160419,5,4.05,"Omg this place was amazing. The chicken was juicy on the inside with great flavor. We had the chicken, grits, cornbread and brisket Mac n cheese. Everything was SO good. My fiancé and I left the plates clean. We'll definitely be going back."
4/20/2016,20160420,3,4.04,"Fried Chicken dinner, comes with greens. Yum, Yum, Yum!!! Perfectly crispy, tender and juicy (even the white meat). You can opt to add a drizzle of honey and/or hot sauce, I topped it with a little of both and made it taste even better! The greens were also good, a little smoky, not salty, not mushy either. Added some hot sauce to it too and it was delish. Fried Green Tomatoes--would take a pass next time. The cornmeal crust slid off of every slice. Ick. It wasn't very flavorful and I've had better elsewhere. Beignets--Although they looked very pretty, I also didn't think they were that great either. I have fond memories of Beignets in New Orleans and these didn't cut it. They were nice and airy, but no kind of flavor, even the powdered sugar seemed bland. Service. Very friendly and smiley but it took soooooo long for our food to come out. This was midweek, early dinner and there were only a few other patrons. I did see a few folks come in for delivery, but otherwise no other signs why it should take so long. So be prepared to wait. BYOB--that should you enjoy your wait a bit."
4/20/2016,20160420,5,4.05,"Amazing!! I almost didn't write this review because I don't want folks to flock to this place. I came here with my boyfriend for a quick lunch before he went to work. We ordered the catfish, shrimp and grits, fried green tomatoes and side of Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked to order and absolutely amazing. You have to go the front to order and they bring your food to your table when it's ready. The iced tea was Delish!! The owner came out to speak with us and she was so accommodating and nice. We will be back!!"
4/23/2016,20160423,2,4.03,"Skillet cornbread and desserts are good but, not worth a trip. Portions are small for the price. You don't get your choice of side and substitutions are not allowed, even if they are priced the same. Big Jones is a better choice if you're looking for Carolina style southern cooking."
4/25/2016,20160425,5,4.04,"WONDERFUL fried southern goodness with butter and honey! That is how I would describe the food here at Luella'sWe visited tonight for a friend's birthday dinner. The four of us didn't need to wait in any lines or for any tables at around 6:00 on a Monday. To start off, I think the ambiance achieves exactly what it intends to. It's very casual, ""hole-in-the-wall"", cozy style is done in a clean and well put together way. It's no-frills counter service, but great service all the same. Very different from a lot of restaurants in this category nearby. I could not decide what to get because everything sounded amazing. Between us two couples, we ordered fried chicken with collards, brisket mac n cheese, the shrimp poboy, the fried green tomatoes, and corn bread (and sweet tea! much to my husband's delight). The prices were definitely higher than I expected with the more fast-casual style, but after experiencing the amazing food, it seemed more reasonable.As soon as we sat down to wait for our food, we noticed a BYOB sign, and two of us ran to the nearby liquor store off western to get some drinks to enjoy with our meals. We will remember that next time!THEY SERVED A HONEY POT WITH THE FRIED CHICKEN. The breading was seasoned deliciously, and the chicken was sooo juicy. The po boy & fried green tomatoes were good. The cornbread was amazing. I loved everything and was just so happy in southern heaven. I will definitely be back, and can't wait to try the brunch!!"
4/27/2016,20160427,3,4.03,"***Luella's serves satisfying Southern / Cajun dishes like shrimp and grits and beignets; I did not love it as much as I wanted to so this might be a restaurant to seek out if you live in Chicago but not necessarily a must experience for visitors who have limited time and thus only a few places to experience in the city***Luella's is a Southern / Cajun restaurant that is just outside of Downtown Chicago. It has a friendly vibe, reasonable prices and an order-at-the-counter approach that makes it the kind of restaurant you can come back to again and again. They have a lunch menu, a brunch menu and a dinner menu, and while some dishes overlap, the menus allow for relatively different experiences. I opted for a dish that seems to be featured on all of their menus, which was the shrimp and grits.This was a classic preparation with a generous heaping of creamy and cheesy grits topped with boiled shrimp and a lightly spicy Cajun BBQ sauce. The highlight was the grits. While I would have liked a stronger flavor, it did provide a great base for the dish. The sauce was also good and provided noticeable pops in flavor to a dish that did border on the under-seasoned side.There was a very generous serving of shrimp though I felt the shrimp was okay but not great. I would have preferred a more seared shrimp to give it a more contrasting texture as well as a stronger flavor.I also opted for beignets, and these were definitely a very classic and authentic preparation. That being said, with authentic beignets, all the flavor is in the powdered sugar while the fried pastry is more on the bland side with a great pillowy lightness and airiness to separate it from most fried dough. Personally, I would have preferred more sweetness in the dough to make it the kind of dessert where every bite is delicious and consistent, but I think beignet purists will be perfectly satisfied with the beignets here (while the beignets were mostly light, there were a few dense spots).Service was friendly and quick (a good neighborhood restaurant vibe).Prices are not too bad. While Luella's might cost more than your typical order-at-the-counter restaurant, it does not take too much money to get a generous and filling lunch or brunch here.There were elements of Luella's I really liked and everything was at least in the okay to satisfying range. I think some of their other dishes might be more to my liking, but even considering that, if you enjoy Southern food and live in Chicago, I think Luella's is definitely worth checking out.I am not sure what the parking situation is. The CTA train station is very close and just a few blocks away. The CTA station stop is Western on the Brown Line."
4/27/2016,20160427,5,4.04,"Great southern food. Good service. Many try to do "" home cookin"" but they get it right here"
5/1/2016,20160501,4,4.04,"We came for a family dinner the other night after my mom heard the good reviews about this place. I'll just run down the positive and negatives of my experience at Luellas.Positives: -The restaurant allows you to call and reserve a table on the day you are coming (might only be allowed for larger groups, but not sure)-The cornbread is amazing, and I really mean that since I normally don't like cornbread that much in general. Even though it takes 20 minutes, it is totally worth the wait. -The biscuits were the perfect density and were delicious -For the most part, everyone had positive things to say about their fried chicken (exceptions will be listed in negative section). Fried chicken dish is 4 pieces and comes with greens.-The mac and cheese had a nice thick cheese sauce that was full of flavor. -crawfish etouffee was filled with lots of crawfish-You must try the beignets because they are some of the best in the city and aren't greasy-The restaurant is Byob so your bill will be lower, and you can bring one of your favorite wines or beers to drink.Negatives-In my opinion, I feel that the restaurant is not a good place for larger groups (We were a group of about 10). It doesn't seem like the kitchen is equipped to handle a large volume of orders. For example, one of my family members that got fried chicken had a piece that was still partially raw. They did make her a new piece that was fully cooked, but it took another 20-25 minutes until that piece came out. -Service was slow, but I know that has been mentioned before in reviews-We had some kids with us, and a couple of them got burgers. When ordering, the host didn't ask how we wanted the burgers cooked, so we assumed that they would be cooked well done (we shouldn't have assumed this). The burgers were runny pink inside and the kids refused to eat them because of this. -I really think that the restaurant should consider hiring a couple more waiters/waitresses so this could be more of a traditional sit down restaurant vs. having to go up to the counter yourself to order. -The fried green tomatoes were flavorless and not very good. My take on this restaurant: If you have a very small group and come during a non prime time you may have a pretty good meal. Otherwise, if you have a large group that you want to enjoy a relaxing meal with, it would be best to go somewhere else."
5/3/2016,20160503,5,4.05,"Been here a couple times but always forget to leave a review. This place is awesome, everything on the menu was fantastic! The southern Benedict and the chicken and waffles couldn't have been any more perfect"
5/4/2016,20160504,5,4.05,"I tried almost everything on the menu. No disappointment whatsoever. The mac n cheese is on point. If you feel like something hearty, the chicken gumbo will satisfy that and the fluffy beignets are the perfect ender."
5/11/2016,20160511,5,4.06,"The food is incredible! We started our dinner with the She Crab soup. The presentation was amazing, but the flavor was out of this world. Silence fell over the table as everyone took their first taste and lasted until all of the bowls were empty. Made from scratch Buttermilk biscuits with homemade jelly were perfect with our soup. I had the Shrimp and Grits, simply amazing! We also had Crawfish Etouffee and a Shrimp PoBoy. Everything was made with such attention to detail and amazing flavors. Finished our meal with the Buttermilk pie. I highly recommend Luella's, this has become my new favorite restaurant and I can't say enough about how wonderful the food is!!"
5/20/2016,20160520,5,4.07,"I've been to Luella's several times now, and I have never been disappointed. The first time, I went with a few friends, and ordered the jambalaya (deep flavor, beautiful presentation, I could have had two bowls). A friend I was with, who is from Alabama, was ashamed to tell us that the grits he got at Luella's were better than his grandma's :DThe chef himself came out to talk to us and he was so attentive and eager to talk about his vision for the restaurant. Not only was the food amazing, but I'm so happy to have met him and hear firsthand how passionate he is about serving delicious, inventive Southern food. I can't wait to go back--especially for brunch. I saw bananas foster french toast on the menu and I HAVE to try that!"
5/22/2016,20160522,3,4.06,"I tried Luella's at the suggestion of a coworker. I came on a Sunday afternoon but didn't realize the only menu available was brunch. I ordered the chicken and waffles and sweet tea. The tea wasn't very sweet, and in fact seemed somewhat bitter. The portion of the chicken and waffles was rather small which was a little disappointing. The syrup was served on the waffles and chicken which was a little much considering syrup makes the waffles a little soggy. The chicken seemed seasoned ok but the syrup took away from it. Lastly the service from the lady who took my order at the counter was not great. The man who brought my food was nice. Maybe I'll give this place another try during the dinner menu."
5/29/2016,20160529,5,4.07,"What a delicious meal! It was totally worth the drive. We had the Shrimp and Grits, Fried Green Tomatoes and Sweet Tea. It is also really comfortable and has nice design touches (wood walls and artwork.) We also met the chef/owner. He was warm and welcoming and asked us about our meal. We will be back to try more of his delicious food."
6/2/2016,20160602,5,4.07,"One of the best Southern restaurants I've visited n Chicago, AND it's BYOB! The food was consistently good. My date and I split phenomenal cornbread (5 stars! honey available upon request), collard greens (very good although not the best I've ever had. Only 4 stars), gumbo (4.5 stars), grits (5 stars! the best I've ever had, even though I lived in NC for two years), freshly pan-fried catfish (5 stars!), and beignets (4 stars. Cafe du Monde still wins). Servings are quite generous, pricing is very reasonable, and the staff is friendly. Be prepared to take your time--good food takes time to make and eat. I'm counting down the days until we go back and eat our way through the rest of the menu."
6/3/2016,20160603,4,4.07,"This place is always packed on the weekend. You order in the counter and then grab a number and a table. We ordered the fried chicken and crawfish etoufee and side of corn bread. The fried chicken was really flavorful and I love the crispiness of the breading. The crawfish etoufee was buttery and was just seasoned enough. Not salty at all. The corn bread was very moist. Like I was mention, I love supporting local businesses. My fiancé and I shall be back on a non busy day. It was fingering-licking good."

Lucky for us, the big 8 person table was unoccupied so we had no wait. Ordered corn bread, chicken & waffles, collard greens & fried green tomatoes. The corn bread was fantastic, made fresh to order so a 20 min wait, but well worth it as it was fluffy and light and delicious. The chicken was fried to perfection, juicy with crispy skin. Unfortunately the waffle were soggy and the whole dish tasted very one note. Also ordered the sweet tea, which was NOT refilled ever, and it was too sweet with hardly any tea flavor. Definitely wasn't worth a special drive up north for."

We had a the Shrimp Po' Boy which was really good, the biscuits which were amazing, the Shrimp and Grits which were amazing, and I ordered the special seafood gumbo yet was rung up for and given chicken gumbo (I didn't notice). It was good yet I was expecting seafood so that was a little bit of a let down. i didn't ask for a replacement.Overall a great experience and we'll be back."

We were immediately greeted by a friendly staff and ordered a shrimp po boy, mac and cheese and two chicken dinners. While we waited for our food to be prepared we enjoyed the sweet tea (free refills!) and the great music they were playing. We all agreed that the food was delicious and we will definitely be back. As a parent of 2 younger kids, I also really appreciated how welcoming the place was to children."

6/26/2016,20160626,3,4.08,"I really wanted to like this place more, but don't understand their business model. The food and prices seem more in line with a full service restaurant, but you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. If you want to order anything else, you have to go back up to the counter. The food was good (chicken & waffles and shrimp & grits) and the portions decent, but the plating on the shrimp & grits was odd. It was served in a small bowl, with 6 tail-on shrimp on top. When attempting to cut the shrimp, it sinks to the bottom of the bowl, so you can't see what you're doing and have to fish it out. I then had to make a pile of tails on the table, since there was no edge of the plate to rest them on. Odd. Overall I'm not in a rush to go back. I wish it had been a different experience."
7/1/2016,20160701,5,4.08,"Omg!!! Walked in to this hole in the wall place, wood floors, ok decor, and became instantly enveloped with great smells and sweet, sweet blues! Ordering was fun as the lady is so nice and her little girl was helping with the order and later brought our sweet teas! This was just an exclamation point experience! I had shrimp and creamy grits and sweet tea and fried slightly sour green tomatoes. Tasting the grits made me seriously almost cry. I became so overwhelmed with memories of growing up in Atlanta. Reminded me of a tiny fried chicken joint downtown Atlanta with soul food, cracked seats, and heavenly biscuits. The grits had just the perfect amount of cayenne and cream cheese with perfectly cooked spicy barbecue shrimp.  The buttermilk biscuits just flaked and melted with crunchy edges and the homemade strawberry blueberry jelly on the biscuit was sweet and spicy and omg. Just like my Grandmaw's biscuits. My family LOVED THE GUMBO. And the crawfish etoufee was perfect. We had beignets so hot from cooking they burned and the powdered sugar melted all over my fingers; they were light and so amazing I died! Service was smiling and sweet!"

7/14/2016,20160714,2,4.08,"I was very disappointed in my experience. You have to pay before you eat and then wait a million years for your food to come out. I tried to order corn bread after I ordered my food, but the cashier told me it would come out after (it's supposed to take 20 mins). Food took way longer than that. The shrimp and grits were like under-cooked oatmeal and grits! Super hard and bland...where's the cheese? Still looking...the shrimp were tasty though.My friends Mac and cheese was way better. I would order that again. But then again I don't know if I'll be coming back :("
7/14/2016,20160714,4,4.08,I simply love this place as well. Southern food at its best. I love the shrimp & grits. The kale ambrosia is a must try you will fall in love! The gumbo is my favorite as well. Can't forget the wonderful staff :)

We ordered from the brunch menu....shrimp and grits, Nashville hot chicken and waffles, Southern Eggs Benedict, cornbread and beignets. The restaurant is BYOB. Cost $75 for 4. Plenty of food, feel refills on ice tea... Sweet tea was super sweet! Great location and service. Will be back for more southern cooking."
7/22/2016,20160722,5,4.09,I have been so disappointed by yuppie fried chicken this summer that I hesitated to order it at Luella's. I'm glad I didn't give up on my beloved yard bird because this chicken restored my faith!It's crispy. It's juicy. It's just the right amount of hot. And I come with a pot of honey. How cute!Most impressive to me was the side of collard greens. I love greens and I've rarely had better than these (aside from my own of course :)). They are tender but still have t store and have just enough acidity. Just a sprinkle of Crystal and I thought it was Thanksgiving. Yum!Fried green tomatoes were also stellar and I even liked the sweet tea. Can't wait to come back for brunch!It's a small space and you go to ththe counter and order and a person brings it to your table. Friendly and fast. BYOB too.
7/25/2016,20160725,5,4.09,Absolutely Fabulous...flavorful food that set my taste buds on fire beats out that other place (wishbones) hands down ! All Hail Luella's Southern Kitchen
7/27/2016,20160727,4,4.09,"The food was amazing!! Only problem is no way to leave a tip for the servers on the receipt. Don't carry cash around on me .The restaurant is clean, quiet and relaxin. Have to come back for the brunch on a Sunday!!"
8/1/2016,20160801,5,4.1,"Unreal food. Shrimp and grits top notch, fried chicken and collard greens were amazing, ended the meal with beignets but could barely eat because I was so full. It's BYOB with no corkage fees, you also order at a counter and they bring the food to you. I will dream about this meal. Literally so so good. I was pleasantly surprised."
8/5/2016,20160805,3,4.09,"We made the trip up north to Lincoln Square. To preface my review, my family is from the South, I lived in GA for 5 years, and am a frequent visitor of New Orleans. Now I know no outside food is going to taste like what your Grandma cooks, but I do have a palate for southern cuisine. :-) I had:sweet tea- meh. Needed a lot of help. It probably tastes fine for northerners but not true southern sweet teafried green tomatoes: OK. very thin slices though and the breading fell offshrimp and grits: Good. Nothing tops N.O. shrimp and grits but this was a very close second My sister also ordered the greens. Now, reading is fundamental and she should've read the description prior to ordering, but who still cooks greens with pork now a days?? We do not eat pork, so that was her fault.Overall, I liked it. It was hot in there. The staff were very nice and courteous. This will probably be a once a year trek for us"
8/5/2016,20160805,5,4.1,"Luella's food is delicious! I expected a good experiencence, I did not expect to be blown away!! The fried chicken and collard greens are the absolute best that I've had outside of some family members' kitchens. Lots of homemade food wishes it could be this good. My family is southern, so I never expect anything as good or better than home, I just have southern dishes at restaurants out of convenience. Not the case here...the food is fantastic! The beignet are also delicious and I BYOB'd Prosecco to make the meal even more enjoyable. Looking forward to my next visit. Oh, and the staff was great...makes you feel right at home!!"
8/8/2016,20160808,4,4.1,"The food was good, I had the roasted beet salad. My only complaint is where is the air conditioning on a 90°F day. But, other than that everything else was excellent."

We did not understand their process so we sat there a while trying to figure it out. I didn't want to serve myself water or anything else. What do you have a wait staff for? I don't mind tipping but I would like to have some service to tip for. And then we asked for salt and pepper and they came back and took it like they only had one shaker. I would recommend the food but can't say much for the service. I hope they improve their service, and make the whole dining experience pleasant!"

8/14/2016,20160814,3,4.07,"Came here last week with the hubs to try out their southern cooking. I was so excited to try it but wanted to pop in there relatively early. We decided to hit up Luella's a little over an hour after opening. Man it was busy. Its quite small of a restaurant with minimal seating. It looks like your in someone's kitchen/home. Its very hot in there too with a big fan close to the cash register and kitchen. The owner's aunt is at the front desk with a nice smile and lovely hospitality. We ordered the shrimp and grits and the gumbo to dine in. Unfortunately, we couldn't spot a table as it was jumping for the limited seating. I saw a long table and apparently, the lady sitting there was waiting for 3 more people. We were offerred a teeny tiny by the window two seat table but you really don't have any room to move and the sun was glaring through the window making it more uncomfortable. Sadly we decided to take it to go. While we waiting, it was taking a bit of time but it didn't bother us. What disappointed me was my eyes were noticing people starting to clear up and leave in very small increments. I didn't want to change our mind again and attempt to get back into a table as those tables were getting filled as people were exiting and entering. I also didn't want to annoy the team cooking our food. NO biggie really. There was one server who was so on point, I was so impressed with him making sure people were busing tables, his waitress was handing out the dishes on time and that people could be greeted as they come in which wasn't happening untli you get to the register. He was a sight to see and although getting the orders done and placed, he had an easy way about him. Loved seeing him in action. While we waited some more, this particular server waiting by the dishes and telling the kitchen what orders he was still waiting for came by the hubs and I and apologized for the wait. It really wasn't a big wait, just enough to wonder if our order was put in. He was so nice and they offerred us to try some fried green tomatoes while we waited. I was starving so I said of course. Hubs doesn't like tomatoes so that plate was all mine. Food: Fried tomatoes were tasty and fried in a cornmeal type of batter and a teeny dollop of a sauce on it. It was outta sight. I love the balance of the tomatoes acidity and tang which was great after having that first cruncy battered bite. When we went home: Hubs has been to New Orleans a few times. He said the gumbo was the real deal and so damn good. My shrimp and grits was delicious. The grits were so rich and creamy and the shrimp were HUGE with a smokey flavor to it. PLUS there were more than just 2-3 shrimp. This dish had huge shrimp in it in the 5-6 shrimp range. I swear!! no joke. Delicious. This serving is enough for two people in my opinion unless you have a huge appetite. I had part of it and saved the rest for breakfast and damn it was great even reheated. I was so content and happy with the dish. We plan on going back and ordering their famous fried chicken with greens or their fried chicken and waffles when offerred. We are determined to sit in the place and have dinner in the restaurant."

8/19/2016,20160819,4,4.07,YUM - just YUM3 of us tried... Biscuits - YUM... Cornbread... YUM.... Fried Green Tomato appetizer...ok - the romelaude was really good the friend green tomatos - 3 on a plate were just OK. Shrimp and Grits.. YUM... but I only had 4 shrimp in there. The Brisket and Mac and Cheese. Wow - I had some there and then ended up with the take home in my fridge and it was EVEN BETTER the next day. The meat was so freakin tender. The mac and cheese perfect flavor. The 3rd in our party shared her corn bread with us but not her friend chicken.. what's up with THAT! she promptly boxed up the parts she didnt eat for lunch the following day. Boo she doesnt get to come with us again. She did share the greens that came with it. OHHH YUM. We went on a early hot Wednesday night. There is no a/c but the fans did OK. It's a family place and they work hard to make you feel at home. I wanted beignets but there was no room for dessert. We shall return. Most likely with Ms Fried Chicken because she turned us on to the spot.
8/20/2016,20160820,1,4.06,"Food without good service is medicine - if you are sick and need medicine this is your place. Placed order at 10:34 am, paid for it in advanced waited & waited and finally at 11:09 it arrived luke warm. The grits have no texture at all you would not know they are a grain. Buttermilk chicken had very little batter or crunch and was soggy with grease. The service was sub par instead of being called a kitchen they should call it a cooking school where they are try to learn to cook and be hospitable. Not an easy place to get to and not worth the aggravation."

8/28/2016,20160828,5,4.04,"My girlfriend and I went to Luella's on a whim on a Friday night around 7pm. The place was fairly full but we were able to order and find a table immediately. The staff at the counter were very nice and talkative, though my girlfriend is a talker so she tends to draw everyone out. We ordered shrimp and grits for her, fried catfish for me, and we shared an order of cornbread.Food took a bit (15-20 min), but we weren't in any rush and the place was playing 60s and 70s soul over the speaker system to keep the guests entertained. As someone who's lived in the south I do have opinions on what southern cooking should taste like, and both of us were quite impressed. The catfish may have been the best I've ever had, especially with the sauce they put on top. The grits were incredibly creamy, and the shrimp was apparently excellent (so good she wouldn't share with me. The cornbread was perfectly done and could be eaten as is, no butter needed. The food is not cheap, but it's definitely worth it.We got to chatting with one of the women clearing plates and found out the place was family run. Good story, great food, definitely coming back."
8/30/2016,20160830,5,4.04,"One of the best meals I've ever had. We went around 6 pm, Saturday, and easily got a table for 6. Not too crowded.Ordering at a counter is a little strange, especially when you have a larger group. And if you decide you want something after you've ordered, (like fries or something, since none of the dishes have sides) you have to go back up and start a new ticket. That being said, the awkwardness is totally worth the food. In my party we had, brisket mac and cheese, shrimp and grits, gumbo, and fried catfish. I tried them all and they all were good. The grits, my god. Like buttah. And the catfish, so crunchy but tender inside. And they put this creole sauce on everything that I want to bottle and put on all the food I eat from this day forward. Go."
9/2/2016,20160902,5,4.05,"Oh man, where to begin? First, I'd like to apologize for not coming here sooner, especially since I live in the neighborhood & walk by Luella's often. That was a foolish move on my part. Second, the food at Luella's is hands down the best southern comfort food there is (my apologies to Memphis and Nashville--you gave me great BBQ but Luella's wins). Third, the Michelin Guide named it as one of their places to eat in their 2016 Guide. If Michelin thinks this is worth it, you know it's good. Fourth, get the fried chicken and the Brisket Mac & Cheese. The chicken was crispy, hot, juicy, and came with a side of the tastiest greens, as well as honey for the chicken. The Brisket Mac & Cheese was just enough to make you feel good inside but not sick. The macaroni was perfectly cooked, the Brisket tender as can be and the sauce was not just macaroni in a bechamel sauce. We wanted the beignets but did not have room for dessert. Next time, though.Luella's is BYOB & there is no corkage fee. The menu will have new editions after Labor Day 2016 so keep your eyes open for that."
9/3/2016,20160903,5,4.05,"Freshest food I've ever had at a restaurant. Everyone is so friendly! The chef came out during our meal and asked us how everything was. I got the fried chicken and my friend got the shrimp and grits, and they were both amazingggg!! Wish it wasn't so far up north, but it's only a few minutes away from the Western Brown Line stop!"
9/3/2016,20160903,5,4.05,"Had brunch today at this great addition to the neighbourhood.  Chicken & waffles...beyond great and I am not bigfan of chicken.  Biscuits with house made jam... delicious. Fried green tomatoes...wonderful. We are already looking forward to our next meal at this family owned, welcoming establishment. Keep in mindit is BYOB."
9/7/2016,20160907,5,4.06,"I enjoyed everything I ate - fried chicken, shrimp & grits and the biscuits! I think it's one of the better southern food places in the city- service was great! I will be back to try the po boys! Michelin guide recommended - a well deserved distinction!"
9/10/2016,20160910,5,4.06,"This was the best tasting meal I have had in recent memory. My family found it on Yelp after a book reading nearby. We love shrimp and grits and will order it any chance we get. So when they saw it on the menu it was a sealed deal. The staff was welcoming of T'Charlie (my service Pup) and sat us swiftly. We took a moment at our table to look over the menu and were treated by a very friendly staff member who was able to offer suggestions and answer our questions. The ordering process is casual (order at counter first, sit later) yet the atmosphere is nice enough to impress a first date. It is BYOB if you would like to bring some wine. However the Sweet Tea was so on point I would never want to drink anything else with my meal. I tried both the classic sweet tea and the Fruit Sweet Tea. I preferred the classic. The tea itself tasted like fresh homemade Sun Tea my grandma makes. We ordered the biscuits to start. There are two options, the kind we ordered and the Skillet version. No regrets here. Look at the photo I posted for reference. My hesitation with biscuits is that most of the time they have a very dry feeling and I smother them with butter to counter act the dryness. This was not an issue here. The biscuits were the best biscuits I have EVER HAD. I chose to use the butter and marmalade they were presented with but they could have been eaten with out and still have been the best I've ever had.Next came the Gumbo. Served and poured table side. They brought out the rice in a bowl and poured the gumbo in front of us. It was delicious. Tru ordered the Mac & Cheese with braised short ribs. The cheese was very light almost like a bechemel sauce. The ribs complimented the sauce nicely. Our only mistake was letting T'Charlie have a taste of the short ribs. I generally reward his good behavior with little samples from time to time. But he was cuckoo for the ribs. I've never had him obsess over food like this. I can't blame him though it was pretty darn tasty. Then came the Shrimp & Grits. My mouth is watering thinking back on the experience. The grits were a steel cut equivalent version of grits. Did I detect a bit of cinnamon in the mix? The shrimp was cooked and sauced to perfection. Better than we had at our favorite spot in New Orleans. If I lived in Chicago this would be a weekly occurrence. Sadly the fried chicken we ordered was accidentally served to the wrong table. By the time we noticed we were full from everything else. The food runner apologized personally for the mistake and was quick to see we were refunded. I was surprised when I saw the chef walk out of the kitchen to issue the refund. Turns out the chefs Tyris & Darnell are the co owners. Our food was prepared by Chef Darnell. Bravo sir. Bravo."
9/13/2016,20160913,5,4.07,"This is one of the BEST brunch spots I've been to! The food was absolutely amazing!!! And the service was fantastic. We had the chicken and waffle, biscuit, French toast, and shrimp and grits. I don't even like grits and I couldn't stop eating it. The biscuit was so delicious!!! And the chicken was so flavored (we got the Nashville version)."
9/18/2016,20160918,4,4.07,"I have to say that for the Northside...this is rally good soul food. I personally love the biscuits! They are freshly made to order. I didn't care for the chicken and waffle but if you order chicken and biscuits-what a Combo! I also really enjoyed the the fried green tomatoes. The service is great, the people are so friendly and so sweet( Lavelle if I spelled his name correctly, he was wonderful. Speaking of sweet, the sweet tea is delicious, a cold crips sip of love severed in a mason glass that takes you back generations. I comment on that because many people really don't make sweet tea correctly. The shrimp and grits is delicious, however I would recommend ordering the shrimp and the sauce it comes with on the side. The greens were nicely chopped and full of flavor, not greasy or to to peppery. Soul food with a modern twist is what I call this place."
9/18/2016,20160918,5,4.07,"Delicious food, great ambiance, staff is chill and nice. Perfectly executed brioche French toast, and so very happy I ordered corn bread. Thank you."
9/24/2016,20160924,5,4.08,"Darnelli's the epitome of a Southern gentleman. He worked with us to provide a deliciousseminar dinner for our guest from Japan. Everyone raved about the smothered chicken,the greens, chilli arancini, candied yams were all yummy! The peach cobbler was justthe right dessert to top off the great dinner. Delivery was on time in spite of all the construction going on. The delivery man was friendly and very helpful as well! Thank you!"
10/10/2016,20161010,3,4.07,"My first experience with Luella's was at the Lincoln Square Apple Fest, and their small portions were delicious! I knew after teasing myself with the taste sizes, I would inevitably wind up back there for a big girl portion! I met for Sunday brunch with a fellow Yelp Elite. The place is a lot more dark than I'm accustomed to for brunch; typically restaurants are aiming for bright and airy. We waited a full hour for a table though we were quoted 30 minutes. They had a large (birthday) party dining, so I understood the delay. When a table was finally ready, we were lucky enough to get a bright window seat. I would consider myself thin, but I had to squeeze to fit in the spot between the table and the window... and as the afternoon went on, the sun on back made me start to experience a small glow on my face and neck (aka, yes, a girl can sweat haha). When you're ready to order, you leave your seat, and order at the counter, where they give you your number and have you sit down at your table again. I decided to go with the pancakes because I kept seeing the kitchen pump them out while we were waiting for a table. While good, they weren't amazing. My friend ordered the Benedict, and the poached eggs were very tiny and missing a lot of their white. It presented as far more biscuit than toppings. I didn't love the collard greens either. We split the beignets, but at this point I was stuffed to the max and couldn't eat much more. A couple of bites allowed me to know it was tasty, but a lot more doughy than I've experienced at other places. I would be interested to try Luella's again, but this time for dinner. Although brunch didn't make me want to run back anytime soon, that dinner menu looked pretty good. PS- it is BYOB, so plan accordingly. :)"

10/12/2016,20161012,5,4.07,"Wow is one word to describe this cute, modern soul food heaven! My mother and I went to Luella's last night for a sit down dinner to break up the week. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and excellent customer service.We ordered the fried chicken and collard greens with a side of skillet cornbread which was to die for! The chicken was so crispy and melted in your mouth. The skillet cornbread was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside, just like my grandmother used to make it. Such a nostalgic moment eating this dish. Lastly we ordered their sweet potato pie. I highly recommend dining in at Luella's. I can't wait to try their brunch!"
10/15/2016,20161015,5,4.07,"If you haven't gone to Luella's yet, I have just one question for you: ""What the heck are you waiting for?"" This place is by far the best southern food place that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at. The staff goes out of their way to ensure you have what you need and are always willing to give tips on what you Light enjoy.This has become a regular spot for me. I had the fried chicken & greens the first visit, epic is all I can say! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and so juicy, and the breading stayed on. The greens were outstanding as well.Second trip I had the gumbo. I've been to Commander's Palace in 'Nawlins, and Emeril should be taking tips from these guys. So good I had it again tonight! The Brisket Mac N Cheese is so so yummy! Great flavor and sticks to your ribs. Just delicious. The corn bread is worth the 20 minute wait, as it's made to order. It comes out piping hot in a Lodge cast iron dish. Perfectly made, just the right cross between savory & a hint of sweet.  The biscuits and jam....""shut the front door""! This is what I would want as a last meal. We were surprised with the Sweet Potato Pie tonight. I've had some in the be past, in the south and up here in Yankland. Never really been impressed, but Holy Cow (Cubs reference as they are winning Game 1 of the NLCS as I Yelp) this stud was just delicious. Crust was perfect. Topped with brûlée marshmallow fluff.....yummy yummy yummy!I can't say enough about this place. Auntie and her crew are all so humble and it's clear that they just care about preparing great food and ensuring your dining experience won't be forgotten!'I may just go for brunch tomorrow!!! Bravo team, Bravo!"
10/16/2016,20161016,2,4.07,"Terribly disappointed. The Nashville Chicken and Waffles is a disaster. Ordered the beignets and that was even worse. Under-cooked, center with raw dough, and greasy. When we showed the manager, he said, ""that's how they are supposed to be"" - really?!? Fruit tea was good, but... Had hoped for so much more."
10/17/2016,20161017,4,4.06,"Very comfortable, casual restaurant. Order at the counter, pay right away and grab a seat. The staff is warm, inviting. The food -- we had brunch on Sunday morning -- was so good. Biscuits, chicken and waffles, brioche french toast. All wonderful. Their brunch menu lacks some of the ""staples"" -- if you're looking for traditional scrambled eggs, bacon, that kind of thing. It's soul food, a little spicy, a little savory. The coffee was great. All in all, it was a nice brunch. A little higher price than I'd normally pay for breakfast, but I wasn't hungry again until nearly bedtime!"
10/21/2016,20161021,1,4.05,"Waited over an hour to get our food. Comical: the note under the cornbread on the menu said ""please allow 20 minutes"" but they should have just prefaced the entire menu with a caution that the everything was going to take a decade. I get that it takes time to prepare good food but there were tables that were seated after is that were served before us. Multiple tables. Not to mention all the grubhub orders that were flying out the door. When we finally had a server come with plates to our table, they only managed to get one of the orders right. Not a very good system to keep your customers happy. I love good food as much as the next gal but the wait was not worth it. I would give less than 1 star if it was possible."
10/23/2016,20161023,5,4.06,"Amazing! Mac and cheese was delicious, the meat was fall apart good. Got dessert and the bengeit were also delicious. The woman who took our orders and the man who brought our food were incredibly kind. Fantastic service all around. Will return and recommend."
11/2/2016,20161102,4,4.06,"Get there after 8pm for limited to no wait...If not, you'll wait 45 mins for your food, easy....I Loved Everything! Brisket-mac-n-cheese, crispy fried chicken, greens, corn bread, and shrimp&grits....I moved to the burbs so getting to the city is a trek...But for Luella's, I'm always down."
11/3/2016,20161103,5,4.06,The atmosphere is relaxing and stylish. The smells coming from the kitchen are terrific and teasing. The food that is brought out to the table exceeds the smells and tastes fantastic! The staff is courteous and attentive. Don't pass up the opportunity to try the beignets....they're amazing. A great find. Looking forward to my next visit here.
11/4/2016,20161104,5,4.06,"Whoa. We just ate here and whoa, it was the best meal since, like , a long long time. We just had a couple hours to eat somethin before picking someone up in the middle of the (somewhat early) night at the train station. I was starving from self-induced deprivation during the day. We ordered 2 gumbos and s shrimp po boy to split. We had brought our own born yesterday beer from Lagunitas and that also was pretty dang great. But wow. Just wow. I have had some of the best gumbo in Chicago and even New Orleans. Luella's may just be number 1. We also had the gigantic shrimp po boy. The shrimp were amazing and did NOt have that slight taste of ammonia which most shrimp seem to. They had a breading which included some cornmeal and sheesh, if was great. We both simultaneously had the brilliant idea to dip the po boy into the gumbo and ba bam! Was truly divine and only 30 something semolians."
11/13/2016,20161113,4,4.06,"This is my second time coming to Luella's Kitchen. The first time was for their dinner menu and this most recent time it was for brunch. No matter what time you come, you can expect the same quality food and friendly service.The first time around I got a brisket and I just finished the Benedict plate. My husband got the spicy chicken and waffles. Both were really good and that spicy chicken had a lot of kick to it.I'm happy to have found Luella's Kitchen here in Lincoln Square. It's a great addition to the growing community of restaurants we have in the neighborhood. If you should find yourself on Lincoln and Wilson, be sure to stop in"
11/16/2016,20161116,5,4.07,"Attended this evening with 2 friends.Very nondescript restaurant, BYOB but they do have a selection of sodas. Food is Amazing!! You order at the back counter, they give you a number and it gets delivered to your table. We ordered Buttermilk biscuits to start. They're baked fresh and come with homemade jam and honey butter. I was actually eating them plain, they were that good.Also ordered Shrimp & Grits, especially creamy, Buttermilk fried chicken and spare rib Mac n cheese. OMG, all heavenly dishes. Desert we're the beignets. 3 come in an Order. Will definatly return to discover more deliciousness"
11/17/2016,20161117,3,4.06,"BYOB!!!Popped in for a quick bite before a concert at Old Town. Bring your appetite, or someone to share. We each got the fried chicken not realizing how ample the serving was.It was a tad salty for my tastes but still yummy and worth a future visit. Great vibe with all the staff, you can tell they like working with each other.BYOB!!!"
11/21/2016,20161121,3,4.06,"The Saturday we visited this place something was wrong with the oven so they weren't able to make the skillet cornbread and a repairman kept coming in and out of the restaurant trying to fix it. There was also a local street apple festival going on at the same time where they had a food stall so employees were also coming in and out carting food to the festival.It's a type of place where you walk up and place your order first then grab a table. It wasn't too busy when we arrived. Hubby and I both ordered the Chicken and Waffles, but I asked for the sauce on the side since the nice lady at the counter said it was pretty spicy. Hubby regretted not doing the same since it was pretty spicy, even for him, and the sauce made the chicken skin soggy and seeped into the waffles subsequently making them soggy. I really loved the waffles! They were crispy and dusted with pearl sugar which reminded me so much of Belgian style waffles. Sooo good! The chicken was just okay. We ordered a side of Braised Collard Greens to share, but were miffed not to be able to try their cornbread. The sweet tea was really sweet, and I had to dilute it a bit with water, but as sweet as I would expect back home in NC."
11/26/2016,20161126,5,4.06,The short rib mac and cheese is amazing - like I will crave it for a week amazing! You also must try the sweet potatoes. The staff could not have been nicer. They explained things to us (we were first timers) and they were right on top of keeping the table cleared. We had a baby with us and they were great with her too!Can't wait to go back!
12/4/2016,20161204,5,4.07,Everything I ordered was Delicious!!! Starting with the homemade biscuits oh my the biscuits will melt in your mouth they are definitely made from scratch warm flaky and amazing!! I moved on to the po'boy shrimp sandwich which was seasoned to perfection with a crusty french baguette ohh lala!! I'm a mac and cheese snob their dish was good but I preferred the other two picks better. If this place were closer to me I'd b a regular do yourself a favor give it a try!
12/7/2016,20161207,5,4.07,This was our 1st visit and we were completely satisfied! We ordered 4 dishes.....yep 4!* Buttermilk Fried Chicken* Rib Meat Mac & Cheese* Cajun Shrimp & Grits* Chicken GumboThese 4 dishes are definitely winners!
12/13/2016,20161213,5,4.07,"So many times I have visited Southern restaurants in Chicago, and so many times I have been disappointed. As a southerner, my judging standards are high when it comes to these types of restaurants. So imagine my surprise when I went to Luella's and they hit it out of the park! Everything I have tried at Luella's has been so spot on and delicious that my judgmental nature was silenced. Everything I have tasted has been delicious but I highly recommend the shrimp and grits. The grits at Luella's are some of the best I have had in my life. The chicken and waffles, the mac and cheese and the beignets are all delicious, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. In addition to to the fantastic food, the service at Luella's is truly five star. I recently had brunch that lasted for hours with a group of friends, and the staff was so nice and friendly. They chatted with us and they were great! They didn't rush us, or make us feel like we needed to leave (which happened recently at Hutch, boo!). When we ordered more food they made great recommendations and let us sample an item. That's great service! Luella's is truly a five-star establishment."
12/17/2016,20161217,5,4.08,"Is it possible to be hugged by food? Becuase that's how I felt after coming here. You really understand the concept of comfort food more than anything after trying this place, I came in feeling hangry and left with the biggest smile on my face. The prices are decent and there is enough to feed two people with each dish, it may not look like enough but it is really filling.- The Braised Short Rib Mac & Cheese was AMAZING! Thick in cream and cheesiness, the meat was soft and blended really well, though I wish there was more of it. It's a must!- I was hesitant to try the Fried Chicken since I thought it would be along the same lines as KFC/Popeyes. However, it was unlike anything I've ever tried and the best fried chicken I've ever had. It was not greasy, subtle spices that were enhanced by the frying process and super crunchy.- The Shrimp and Grits were pretty good too. The shrimp was thick and the sauce was amazing. I have never tried grits before, it was worth trying even though I may not be a big fan. If you like grits I would suggest trying this. - First time trying Beignets as well, I've been wanting to try them for a long time and was excited to see that this place had them. They are big and doughy in the center, and they do not skimp on the powdered sugar. Served hot and not oily either! You get three (two large + one medium), one was slightly undercooked but the staff took care of it immediately and brought us a new one that was perfect.I look forward to coming back here again!"
12/22/2016,20161222,4,4.08,"Scrumptious soul food, prepared and served by friendly, helpful staff . Way too many s-words in that sentence...Special treats are numerous artworks by the former Official NFL artist, Ernie Barnes, an ex-NFL player. You've seen them on the opening of the Chicago-set ""Good Times.""A little pricey, but worth it. Unfortunately the bland signage doesn't entice passersby, to the visual and taste treats inside."
12/24/2016,20161224,4,4.08,"We were a group of ten newbies and enjoyed everything from short rib mac and cheese, fried chicken, biscuits, shrimp and grits, chicken gumbo, catfish and the BEST beignets ever! Wonderful customer service as well. They played the background music way too loud to have a conversation."
12/30/2016,20161230,4,4.08,"I was craving Louisiana style food and Luella's was appealing so I decided to try them out. 1st of all I wish they were closer to downtown, downtown needs southern style food restaurants. OK let's start with the food, we ordered their fried chicken, greens, gumbo, corn bread, Mac and cheese and beignets. The fried chicken was excellent nice and crunchy on the outside but nice and tender on the inside, so delicious I can still taste it as I am writing this review. The GREENS OMG one of the best greens I have ever had at a restaurant absolutely mouth watering. The gumbo was nice and hearty very tasty. The corn bread was good but I wish they had a bigger skillet, the portion is small lol. The mac and cheese was not good at all so that is one of the reasons they are getting 4 stars, it was lacking cheese and it tasted like store bought mac and cheese. OK the beignets are nice and big not bad at all but they are not the best. The service on the other hand is another story, yeah the place is small but at least have one waiter or waitress just one please. Standing up and going to the cash register between meals is not nice.

You seriously feel like you are in New Orleans and not in Chicago when you come here. I love that. Not only because of the atmosphere and hospitality but because of the FOOD.The chefs know what they are doing here and you will not be disappointed. Just know that you walk in, order and then sit down and they bring your food to you. Water is help yourself to the right of the cashier. So come, get stuffed and then stuffed some more with some beignets!!"

1/15/2017,20170115,4,4.09,"My first experience with Luella's was at the Lincoln Square Apple Fest, and their small portions were delicious! I knew after teasing myself with the taste sizes, I would inevitably wind up back there for a big girl portion! BRUNCH: 3 starsI met for Sunday brunch with a fellow Yelp Elite. The place is a lot more dark than I'm accustomed to for brunch; typically restaurants are aiming for bright and airy. We waited a full hour for a table though we were quoted 30 minutes. I decided to go with the pancakes because I kept seeing the kitchen pump them out while we were waiting for a table. While good, they weren't amazing. My friend ordered the Benedict, and the poached eggs were very tiny and missing a lot of their white. It presented as far more biscuit than toppings. I didn't love the collard greens either. We split the beignets, but at this point I was stuffed to the max and couldn't eat much more. A couple of bites allowed me to know it was tasty, but a lot more doughy than I've experienced at other places. DINNER: 5 starsMy boyfriend (a southern food aficionado) and I settled on Luella's for dinner on a Saturday evening. I was actually shocked there was no wait at around 7pm (especially after waiting over an hour for a table at brunch a couple of months back!). I had my eye on the Short Rib Mac & Cheese which was flawless. It was incredibly rich and decadent, so although the bowl looks small, it's the perfect portion; tons of meat, the cheese is sinful, and the noodles were the cutest shape! My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken, which was three different pieces (leg, thigh and breast) and collard greens, and he was also in heaven. We split an order of biscuits, which came out steaming hot served next to the tastiest homemade jam. I'm so glad I gave Luella's another chance even though I didn't love brunch, because dinner was superb! AMBIANCE: 4 stars A little disorganized and chaotic, but nothing terrible:-It's VERY loud in Luella's, much more so than I enjoy for a restaurant. -BYOB, so plan accordingly. :)-Order at the counter, grab your number, and have a seat at the table of your choosing-Grab your own water, silverware and napkins to the right of the ordering counter-So nice to see a family working together to make a business happen; they were all wonderfully kind"

1/23/2017,20170123,5,4.11,"This cute. cozy place has been on my list since it was featured on Check Please! As per another review it really does ""feel"" like a warm hug. Very welcoming staff, service. I truly felt like I was in my Great Grandmother's kitchen in Sidonia TN. On to the food. A bit expensive, but from what I could tell everything made to order, cornbread was great, served in a small cast iron pan. My guest and I both had Shrimp and Grits, they were out of Gumbo by 630 pm Sunday night, which is understandable considering brunch on Sundays. Hands down best grits I've ever had, and I do occasionally make them at home. The shrimp were very large, tail on fresh tasting. My guest also had the sweet potatoes. I don't like sweet potatoes, at all. But if all sweet potatoes were made this way I'd be a fanatic. Nice, caramel, roasted, w a to die for sweet glaze, which when I return I'd probably order for myself. I was a little disappointed about the dessert choices, the blackberry hand pie shown on online menu was nowhere to be found. Beignets, and Sweet Potato pie, didn't entice me. If you're looking for a very low key, warm, comforting dining experience you won't be disappointed."

Since it was fairly early, we decided to split the fried chicken dinner and a side of biscuits. They were out of the biscuits, so I got the beignets instead (zero complaints there, it just means we'll make another trip to try the biscuits!). The chicken was absolutely spectacular - the best either of us had ever had. Even the collard greens, which I'm not usually a fan of, were really tasty. The skin was crispy, the meat was flavorful all the way through - it blew my mind.The beignets came with a mesquite-type honey. I preferred it without, but my partner liked it quite a lot. They were amazing - fluffy, buttery, tons of powdered sugar.We would recommend Luella's to anyone. Wonderful atmosphere, cool staff, outstanding food."

I would also challenge the service level to ensure guest are followed up on better once they receive their food. The food is hot, fresh and is made to order causing longer waits which is doable when the right items come out. With a bit more focus on service & making each guest feel special you will be great!

2/16/2017,20170216,2,4.13,"My girlfriend had been wanting to go for a while so I chose to take her there on Valentine's Day. Huge Mistake! The ambiance was loud with what seemed like a huge table of college kids. We were quite confused as how to order since we came in and just sat down without being greeted. We sat there for 10 minutes before someone told us to come up and place our order. Come to find out, they have ran out of all the dishes they advertise besides fried chicken and shrimp w/grits. I was very upset with this, as it had just about ruined the vday dinner. Luckily, my gf was tipsy and loves shrimp so we got that with the fried chicken and collard greens. 35 minutes later, our food arrived. The chicken was not very good at all. I love fried chicken, but this chicken was pretty bland and had to be doused in hot sauce. The greens were tasty but came in a small cup I wouldn't consider a full sized side dish. The shrimp and grits came with 4 medium-sizes shrimp. For a $16 dish, 4 shrimp doesn't cut it. I guess they were running out of that too. On the positive side, its BYOB so we had plenty of wine to lift our spirits. The waiter was really nice and patient with us as he took pictures for us in many different poses my gf requested. The decor was nice and I like the whole 'southern family restaraunt' vibe they give.All in all, I won't be returning any time soon. If I want southern style meals, there are much better places in Chitown."

I'm from Memphis, Tennessee, so I know fried chicken. And when I say this was the BEST fried chicken I've ever had in Chicago.......BELIEVE ME :-) yummy"
2/17/2017,20170217,5,4.14,"Awesome southern food, super nice staff and a no nonsense, casual restaurant. Love this place. Probably my favorite gumbo and I've tasted many. Thanks Luella for setting us up with such tastes food!"
2/18/2017,20170218,5,4.14,"My wife and I heard about this place from the Celebrate Black Owned Business week. We were so happy we did. Luella's is simply amazing. I am rarely impressed with restaurants nowadays as I have started cooking more. We ordered the fried chicken, shrimp poboy sandwich, and beignets. Chicken was phenomenal, very juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside just as you would want. It alsi comes with a pot of honey. Poboy was a 3.5/5. Great ingredients, but a little too much bread for what is sandwiched in between. Beignets were HUGE. Very different from the Louisiana ones we have had, but holy molly they were delicious. I actually like them better then the ones I have had down South. The fruity sweet teas were refreshing as well. We went for dinner, but the brunch menu looked even more appetizing (somehow). We are looking forward to returning"
2/20/2017,20170220,4,4.14,"They were good but not worth the long drive and long wait we experienced. We could only order from the brunch menu on Saturday before 3 pm. I tried the shrimp and their cream cheese grits, it did not suit my taste. I did enjoy the braised collard greens and cornbread."

2/22/2017,20170222,3,4.14,"I love soul food, especially soul food inspired by the Creole influences of Louisiana. My friend and I came here for dinner. We ordered the braised short rib mac and cheese, fried chicken and collard greens, a side of glazed sweet potatoes, and the skillet cornbread. The braised short rib mac and cheese was amazing. The meat was tender and well-seasoned. The mac and cheese taste liked it was homemade, not out of an easy mac box. The fried chicken was good. It came with a side of honey that you drizzle with a honeycomb. Very cute. However, I was disappointed that my fellow Black folks seasons the flour/breading, but didn't season the chicken. Fried chicken 101: always, always, always season the flour and season the chicken separately, then mix together. I was unimpressed with the sweet potatoes. They were clearly cooked too long. The cornbread was definitely an acquired taste. The cornbread had the taste and texture of a pancake, more so than traditional cornbread. I loved the decor of the place. Very quaint. Now the downside. They take 1 hour off in between brunch and dinner on the weekend to prepare, so pay close attention to their hours. I feel this place is overpriced. $15 for two pieces of fried chicken and a small side of collard greens? $5 for a small skillet of cornbread? $5 for a small side of sweet potatoes? They need to bring these prices down. And this cannot be stated enough. When you walk in, you have to walk to the counter and place your order first. Do not sit down first. It's weird, but hey, that's their system."
2/23/2017,20170223,5,4.15,"Brunch experience:Incredible beignets (so big, and pillowy, and warm and sweet, wow!)Delicious nashville hot chicken and waffles (chicken is not spicy hot, but every flavorful. The waffles are just sweet enough to counter the savory chicken. The portion looks small but it it rich so you dont feel like you are missing out)Amazing collard greens (perfectly seasoned, not too salty or greasy, I am a fan!)My only complaint is that when it gets busy noone is available to come around and refill coffee. I wish there was an option to buy a carafe or something for the table so you dont have to go looking for someone to bother for more, otherwise, really fantastic place. So good."
2/24/2017,20170224,4,4.15,"If you're looking for that buttery Southern taste, look no further than Luella's. The cornbread melts in your mouth, and the collard greens are perfection. The grits are cheesy and the perfect consistency. The staff at Luella's has a warm energy and vibrant smiles."
3/1/2017,20170301,5,4.15,"OMG, we got the chicken and waffles and it was perfection! HOT, spicy, sweet, crisp, tangy, everything it should be! A most def to get and share. It would have been nice to have had a vegetable side come with. My husband and I got chicken and waffles each, he wanted the Cod but it was brunch menu items only he cod was on lunch and dinner, even though it was 2pm on Sunday. Our 7 year old got the kids mac and cheese and that was amazing also creamy, fresh, and so ever tasty. We also got a side of the corn bread, that was moist ( hate that word) warm and delicious! A must try and keep going back about once a month. Side note, this is a place where you order and then get seated, which I dislike. When I eat out I like having full service. Wish I knew that before, there was a wait. We went on Sunday about 2pm. Again this is a personal preference, not bad mouthing their choice of service, the food was impeccable. But again would have liked to know this before hand."
3/2/2017,20170302,5,4.15,"Whoa. We just ate here and whoa, it was the best meal since, like , a long long time. We just had a couple hours to eat somethin before picking someone up in the middle of the (somewhat early) night at the train station. I was starving from self-induced deprivation during the day. We ordered 2 gumbos and a shrimp po boy to split. We had brought our own born yesterday beer from Lagunitas and that also was pretty dang great. But wow. Just wow. I have had some of the best gumbo in Chicago and even New Orleans. Luella's may just be number 1. We also had the gigantic shrimp po boy. The shrimp were amazing and did NOt have that slight taste of ammonia which most shrimp seem to. They had a breading which included some cornmeal and sheesh, if was great. We both simultaneously had the brilliant idea to dip the po boy into the gumbo and ba bam! Was truly divine and only 30 something semolians."
3/4/2017,20170304,5,4.16,Fabulous!!! Everyone in our group of 14 shared their food. Every meal was super tasty and well seasoned. I'll been back in the last week can't get enough. Well priced 2!!!
3/9/2017,20170309,5,4.16,"Wow, just wow. Will break this down to a few different key points:The restaurant - Nice place, wood on the walls and painting decorate them. The colors are nice and the restaurant is inviting. The bathrooms are clean and elegant. You order up at the register and then sit when they bring you your food. I went on a wednesday night and it was busy, so I can only imagine what it will look like this weekend when i go for brunch. The food - The real reason we are here, the food is AMAZING. There is a menu of about 20 items, I tried 5 of them and each one on their own is worth making a trip out here for that item alone. Everything was so delicious, and the chef came out and explained that everything on the menu is made from scratch, this is evident on their pie crust. I tried things I would never like in another situation; sweet potato pie, after 1 bite, I had to eat it all! Food is very reasonably priced as well.The Service - Was able to get the chef to come out to us and talk to us about the restaurant, very humble and friendly chef! The waitress was so nice and even went out of her way to get us a knife to cut our oranges for our drinks. Everyone was extremely friendly right when you walk in. If you are in the area, go! It you are not in the area, plan a visit soon. I saved the best for last, the spot is BYOB, and they provide cups. Will be back as often as I can make a trek out there."
3/12/2017,20170312,3,4.16,This place we order on grubhub because they don't take orders over the phone so we did ... food was late by and hour and a half but no fault to the restaurant... we order many things like chicken and cornbread all was really good no complaints... just wish the portions were a little bigger floor the price .. very expensive but good food
3/18/2017,20170318,5,4.16,Living in southern states gave me a chace to taste all types of food. This place is outstanding!!
3/21/2017,20170321,2,4.15,"In spite of the fast-casual ambiance of Luella's, I'd been looking forward to returning to further sample their menu. On this weekday evening, though, I was disappointed in the cooking, and the service was even less-polished than on my prior visit.The closest thing to a high point of the meal was a kale ambrosia salad; it was tasty and generous. Hot tamales were dry and lacked in flavor beyond saltiness. Similarly, chicken gumbo had decent chile heat, but was dominated by salt and an overdose of black pepper. Collard greens were also way salty. This was one of the rare meals I did not finish because the food was not at all appealing.I don't get why they can't course a meal. As happened on the last visit everything comes to the table at once, so the hot food gets cold while we're eating the salad. Sad.I think I've had enough of Luella's. There are better options in the area..."
3/22/2017,20170322,5,4.15,"Maybe I just got lucky, but I was blown away by the gumbo and corn bread. While eating this delicious food, a strange calm set over me, as a Buddhist monk might feel after a deep meditation. Except I did no thinking and all eating. Better deal!And, if my brother is a connoisseur of anything, it's mac and cheese. He gave it five stars. Loved the food, loved the location, loved the easy going setting, loved the music. It's all good!"
3/26/2017,20170326,5,4.16,"My boyfriend & I found this little spot after a quick yelp search for brunch & we are so glad that we did. There was a small wait but it was well worth it. I ordered the shrimp & grits & he had to have chicken & waffles plus pancakesThese are the best grits I've ever had in my entire life! They were so creamy & good, I could eat those every dayOMG! The fried chicken was the best I've ever had in my life, it was so good my boyfriend hugged the waitress!All of the staff was nice and accommodating & it's black owned! Not to mention it's BYOBWe will definitely be returning!"
3/27/2017,20170327,3,4.15,"The chicken and waffles was very tasty, but also very spicy! The staff was very nice. The interior of the restaurant is too small, and a line to order at the counter on a Sunday afternoon stretched toward the door in the middle of the diners. Overall, definitely worth a try!"
4/4/2017,20170404,3,4.15,"A group of us came here for brunch this past Sunday. We discovered it was order at the counter service and didnt really find much that was appealing on the menu. Not that there wasnt options, but just not a lot that appealed to us. We sat and waited for the food, and when they brought out one of our entrees, they notified us that because we ordered in pairs, our food would come out at different times. Thats fine...but 10 mins goes by and tables around us who came in after were getting their food....the same food we ordered. So why not ours first? Food wise, it was ok. The chicken and waffles were the highlight. Moist, flavorful. But everything else at the table was ok but nothing great."
4/11/2017,20170411,5,4.15,"Tasty food and friendly atmosphere. The chicken and cornbread is a must try. The atmosphere is appropriate for adults, but kids would be comfy here too sharing with their parents."
4/12/2017,20170412,4,4.15,Very nice atmosphere had lunch and will have to come back for there brunch/ breakfast menu. Had the sift shell crab poeboy which was good. Also had fried chicken which was perfect. There was a smoked honey on the side that was a major delicious surprise
4/23/2017,20170423,2,4.14,"Let's start with the positives: The Nashville Chicken and Waffles was truly excellent. Now the rest: Silly, inefficient check-in process, slow like molasses order-taking, indifferent servers, food came out cold after a loooong wait, Eggs Benedict below average, sitting on top of a not tasty corn pone thing.This review is a plea to the owners to get some advice quickly and turn things around. So much promise but such poor execution."
4/25/2017,20170425,1,4.13,"If you're a going to take forever when it comes to making a meal.. don't be smart about it, and make new menus that say everything will be cooked to order, or each dish take 30 minutes..."
4/28/2017,20170428,5,4.14,Was wicked hangry when I entered and left happy. Got the brisket mac and cheese. Cheese was creamy and flavorful. The brisket was tender and didn't have that smoky BBQ taste because it was in cheese it was tender though! They have sweet tea which I was pretty excited about!! Can't find sweet tea often in Chicago. The receipt didn't have a place for a tip and I don't carry cash so I couldn't tip but will definitely be back!
4/29/2017,20170429,1,4.13,"Wanted to try this place for my mom's birthday. As south siders, we were excited to see an authentic, real- deal soul food place up north- VERY RARE- and decided to take a chance.Coulda had a V8 instead...We ordered the popular fried chicken entrees which, for the overblown $15 price tag, were undercooked and tasted as if it were fried in very old grease. Came with the stingiest portion of the bitterest, blandest greens ever. Also, the gummy, microwave- reheated mac- n- cheese w/smoked brisket (which was actually burnt at the tips) was not worth $12 either. Perhaps the cooks were having a bad day, but I work too hard to have to pay $43 for unappetizing, inedible food. Threw EVERYTHING - YES, EVERYTHING - away and ordered a pizza instead. Also that pricing MUST be for the *""North Siders""... smh.*North siders: if you want real soul food, be brave and venture to the actual south and/or west sides of the city. It won't cost as much, the food will be seasoned and taste better, and it's not as scary as you think!"
5/6/2017,20170506,1,4.12,"I went here after watching a review of the restaurant on tv. I was not impressed. First off the set up and service is inefficient (I hate this). We waited over 20minutes in a line just to place an order. Oh and there was two different lines but no one directing you to which line to be in. You can't sit at the tables until your order is placed. The lady running the line was very rude (maybe it was a bad day), she was literally yelling at people in the wrong line. We placed a to go order and was told 25minutes. We came back 30minutes later to pick up and was told we never ordered, then demanded to see our receipt (fine here it is, where's my food). Then told us we had to wait another 15 minutes for the food. I wanted my money back but by boyfriend is willing to be more patient than I, so he silenced me prior to my telling them about their service. The food was average, not bad but not the best. We had the fried chicken, it was just ok (I could've had Popeyes). The shrimp and grits are good. I love biscuits but again could've had Popeyes (no I don't own stock in Popeyes) or Daley's or Peaches. The blackberry cobbler was not impressive either. All and all I know now that I won't go back."
5/12/2017,20170512,5,4.12,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The server was friendly and the owner herself came to chat with us a bit. My family and I ordered the dinner course and the serving was huge! Not to mention, their food was delicious. It had nice presentation too."
5/18/2017,20170518,5,4.12,"Came here with my mom on Mother's Day. The food was awesome. The service was great. The staff was very friendly and inviting. We had the chicken and waffles, southern eggs Benedict, and the fried green tomatoes. All were amazing!!!! We will definitely be returning soon!!!"
5/20/2017,20170520,4,4.12,"I had ordered take out. I called ahead knowing it's going to be busy. I ordered the brisket Mac and Cheese as well as the Fried Catfish Tacos. They told me 25 minutes. I got there in half an hour but still had to wait another 15 minutes. They were very apologetic though and offered me a beverage while I wait. Only thing is as I'm sitting by the kitchen waiting I hear the kitchen manager telling the chefs to make my food. So that meant my food was being made as I got there. If that's the case, please just tell me next time it will take 35-40 minutes instead. Just be honest with the time and don't make people wait. Normally wouldn't have a problem but I was rushing to put something in my stomach before heading to a kid's birthday. Portion is a bit small for price but food was overall good. Will definitely come back and try other things on the menu."
5/21/2017,20170521,5,4.12,"I'd been craving biscuits and gravy for like a week and so I decided to give this place a try. I sat looking at the menu for like 15 minutes deciding between skipping the b&g altogether and getting the chicken and waffles or shrimp and grits (they look so good!!!) I decided to stick to my guns and order the biscuits with a side of eggs and sweet tea. Now, I'm from the south, I think I know whether or not food will be good based off the tea. Chile, that tea was good! It wasn't syrupy sweet but also not unsweetened. So I sat and read while I waited (about 10 mins) for my food to come. My biscuits and gravy were served in this cute little pot and from first glance I was nervous bc I've never tried it with the andouille sausage. That nervousness melted the moment I tasted it. Wow! Amazing flavor. If I didn't go alone, I damn sure would've screamed but I didn't want to elicit any stares from other patrons. lol it was amazzziiing. The biscuits are so flaky and golden and just damn good! It has a little kick to it which I needed bc the spring has my allergies on 100. Overall, reallygood. Will definitely be back!"
5/23/2017,20170523,5,4.13,I went to this place for the first time last night its a really cute little place I ordered the shrimpd and grits which were very rich and creamy and cheesy. It was delicious and then I got the cornbread and the biscuits . And Beignets for dessert fresh hot and lots of powdered sugar delicious!
5/28/2017,20170528,4,4.13,"Summary: When in doubt, mac & cheese.My friend & I went on a Saturday night minutes before a rush. Here is what we learned:1. The 2-seaters by the window are reserved for children or persons shorter than 5' 3"" and weighing less than 140 lbs.2. The biscuits and seasonal (blackberry w/lemon zest) jams are winners in flavor. I think the dough was slightly overworked, resulting in more chewy biscuits than my preferred tender biscuit.3. Mississippi hot tamales are OK. They're bland without the buttery sauce and the texture of the beef (pureed) was unappealing. If the beef was shredded, the mouthfeel would be greatly improved and contrast nicely with the masa.4. Collard greens: yes...! Sorry, grandma.5. Fried chicken: (don't judge us... we were in a huge sampling mood) It tasted very herbal, as if a lot of rosemary was in the marinade. Friend didn't like it, but i appreciated the juicy crispness.6. Fried green tomatoes: perfect! Sliced thick enough for flavor & thin enough to avoid a soggy crust. Remoulade was the cherry on top.7. Beignets: sorry, Cafe du Monde. These are way better.And lastly, eat the damn Bbq brisket mac & cheese... even if you're lactose intolerant. Service was friendly, decor was minimal & pleasant. I will return for brunch."
5/29/2017,20170529,5,4.13,"I had the ultimate experience at this restaurant the service was great the food was great the atmosphere was awesome everything was five stars.I would totally be back I have to go for lunch this time me and my best friends went for brunch. I seen a video on Facebook and noticed that the owner was there and was cooking in the kitchen one of the waiters asked for him to come over to our table, he came out and spoke with us and that was so awesome that made my experience over the top . Can't wait for the south side location"
6/3/2017,20170603,3,4.13,"3.5 really I've been in a hunt to find the best fried chicken in Chicago. Luella's isn't even close. We ordered the shrimp and grits. Very good. Had more texture than your typical grits but the cream cheese made it very rich and sorta heavy. We also got the Mac and cheese. It is good. But it's VERY good when you have some of the brisket in the same bite. I strongly recommend you pull/cut the brisket into smaller pieces so that you get that flavor through out. The fried chicken was hot. Fresh and an excellent crisp. But you know what else it was? Bland. I hear southern and I expect every a nice peppery flavor, or borderline spicy. This was neither. I had to add hot sauce just so it tasted like something. Service is good. Ambiance is nice. The counter service doesn't then pack you into awful seating. If someone I know wanted to try it, I'd go. But in my quest for great chicken, I have many more places to try first."
6/5/2017,20170605,1,4.12,I traveled out to Luella's to get the Mississippi Hot Tamales listed on their website menu and on their sign out front. The girl said they didn't have tamales.I left.
6/8/2017,20170608,5,4.12,"Oh. My. Goodness.I ordered the Chicken and Waffles for brunch and it was AMAZING. There was a literal mountain of fried chicken which was so juicy and had just the right amount of Nashville hot. The waffle mixed with that chicken and a bit of syrup was just about the tastiest thing you'll experience north of the Mason-Dixon line. Hands down the best chicken and waffles in the city!Biscuits, cornbread and french toast were all really good too. But seriously, get the chicken and waffles. And be prepared for a Southern style food coma afterwards."
6/18/2017,20170618,5,4.12,"So far so good! I tried the shrimp and grits with the seasonal sweet tea (watermelon) . It was so good! My friend had the Nashville Chicken and waffles, she enjoyed her meal. The owner, Darnell was really nice! He came over to see if everything was ok. He gave me a refill on my sweet tea. This will be one of my go-to restaurants!"
6/22/2017,20170622,5,4.12,"We go or get food from Luella's every other weekend. The Nashville chicken and waffles are amazing. Food is much better if you eat there, but sometimes it can be a bit of a wait (so we take it to go)"
6/23/2017,20170623,4,4.12,I really enjoyed my lunch at Luella's today. The space itself is very nice; the long skinny wooden corridor reminds me of avec. Super friendly woman working the counter and I really enjoyed my friend green tomatoes and tamales. I appreciate being able to support a solid African American-owned small business and I'll be back.
6/24/2017,20170624,4,4.12,"Love the food, good chicken! I just don't like the long wait for the food but it was all worth it at the end!"
6/25/2017,20170625,4,4.12,"Luella's is a great place for brunch and I'm looking forward to coming here again. We got the Nashville hot chicken and waffles and the Corn bread with honey butter. The chicken and waffles were so good. I wish the hot chicken was a bit spicier but nonetheless very well made and came second to the real deal hot chicken from Nashville. There are a lot of places that try to do chicken and waffles and just come short. Not this place! Their waffle was perfect too, on the thinner side but the perfect texture and sweetness. The corn bread was easily the best corn bread I've ever had. And it's perfectly complimented with the honey butter. I'd love to come back again to try more items on the menu."
6/30/2017,20170630,4,4.12,"Best chicken in a while! Wish this place was bigger though!they had waffles with chicken, it was bomb, i wish we had a luella's here in California"
7/2/2017,20170702,2,4.12,"I wanted to try this place because honestly who doesn't need new brunch places. Upon entering, I was already disappointed. The inside is VERY DARK... like almost hard to see dark- and when the menu is written on the back super dark it was hard to read. I really wanted shrimp and grits, but was informed the grits were not ready yet-at 12:30pm. Who doesn't have grits available for prime bunch time on a Saturday. They said they were out of the hot chicken, so I went for option 3- the biscuits and gravy(added egg), my brunch partner for the day got the southern Benedict. Silverware, water, and seating was on your own. We got a tiny table by the window to get as much light as we could, and grabbed the utensils needed. Water was warm, no ice was available. The place wasn't packed, I think 5 tables we occupied, so there was no reason for bad service or lengthy food waiting.We waited what seemed like far too long for our food, and then the biscuits and gravy came out. The Benedict didn't come out for another 7 minutes (I timed it on my phone). The Benedict was clearly half put together and they were not poached. The b and g was really good, but I'm super sad because the whole experience was a downer. I'm hoping this was just an odd occurrence, but considering it was a Saturday I worry about any other times to go there."
7/7/2017,20170707,5,4.12,"Fried chicken was great!! Not dry, which is rare for a lot of restaurants sadly. Well seasoned and marinated. I will be back to try the shrimp and grits whenever I get the opportunity."
7/9/2017,20170709,5,4.12,Chicken and waffles is amazing!! Service and wait list procedures need a tweak. But hey being busy shows its worth the wait.
7/18/2017,20170718,3,4.12,We went to Luella's before a concert and did not have to wait and immediately were seated. Your entire group has to be there to be seated. Our service started out rocky. Our waitress having a rough night. After speaking with management everything was better. Now to the food. I am a southern guy! I always give restaurants featuring southern food in the Midwest the side eye. Honestly I was not blown away by the fried chicken or sweet potatoes. Everything on the menu is a little pricey. The pull for this restaurant is location. Will we return? Probably not. There are other more authentic southern restaurants in Chicago.
8/3/2017,20170803,2,4.11,"I went here multiple times for Breakfast because this is my favorite meal out of the 3 meals were suppose to have daily.Their pancakes are some of the best i ever had.Their coffee french toast is a must try.Their waffles is one of the chinks in their armor unfortunately.I think it was the apple cinnamon ones i had and they were inexcusably hard to chew.The chicken that came with these waffles was better by default.I forgot what i had for dinner there once,but it was pretty good as my debut visit though.What kind of ""southern"" cooking restaurant does not have omelettes????? The owner of this joint did tell me that more breakfast stuff was coming to his menu and i hope he didn't LIE to me about that."

8/5/2017,20170805,4,4.11,"So, here we go!!! At first it wasn't what I expected a little smaller than the website depicted. The restaurant was clean which is always a plus especially the bathroom!!! The restaurant was very comfortable and inviting. The dinner menu was very limited and I thought there was so much more that could be done here. With great surprise, the food was FANTASTIC!!!! The collard greens were off the chain!!!! My wife loved the gumbo and the cornbread. My one disappointment was the Beef Brisket Mac & Cheese. The menu read that it was made with a Mornay Sauce; however, I did expect there to be some cheese throughout to give it a true Mac & Cheese feel. The Creme Brûlée needed more pizazz with the presentation and a deeper dish. Sometimes when using a shallow dish and caramelizing the sugar, the heat causes the custard to have a mouse-like texture. Overall my experience was great and I would recommend this restaurant!!!Bon Petite Cher!!!"

8/16/2017,20170816,5,4.13,"My first experience resulted in a flurry of Instagram pictures and personal recommendations to friends and anyone who would listen. The buttermilk biscuits and homemade jam transports you into an indulgent and simpler time with the first bite that is sustained in every buttery subsequent jammy bite. We ordered the chicken and waffles off the brunch menu. After the first bite, we looked at each other, put our forks down and paused for a moment in complete silent awe. The fried chicken was the perfect balance of flavors; rich and decadent, savory and sweet, but never feeling like too much. The chicken was juicy and plump. How even the white meat was juicy and not dry is a talent that should be praised. It is the best chicken I've had in years and certainly the best fried chicken I ever had. Dine-in service was a little slow but soon forgotten, because of the courteous nature of the entire staff and the sublime taste experience. The second stop-in was a to-go order. What I thought would be a simple (but no doubt delicious) biscuits and gravy blew out of the water all other previous experiences. The Andouille sausage was ever present and delicious in a gravy that was perfectly proportionately draped over the cheddar biscuits that instead of overpowering resulted in perfect marriage of flavors and textures. Again, extremely courteous staff experience and kudos to the waiter doning a Sox hat on the Northside"

It was difficult to choose between shrimp and grits or fried chicken but the chicken won, this time! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, tender, and juicy. It held up well as leftovers also. Started with fried green tomatoes, they could have been sliced a little thicker and perhaps used a little more remoulade. I would definitely visit again as I must try the shrimp and grits."

8/27/2017,20170827,5,4.14,"We came here on a hot tip that they had amazing chicken and waffles. This is the truth.Now to step back, in many respects our trip here was not set up for success. We had a newborn baby in tow, it ended up taking at least 20 minutes to drive here, and we sat down around the same time as a slow-growing table of 10, 15, 20 people. Our order ended up getting lost in the shuffle and it was more than half an hour after ordering at the counter that we finally got our food.But when that food arrived, oh how all was forgiven! The chicken and waffles are made with an excellent Nashville-style hot chicken -- thick battered, crunchy, and spicy and perfect for standing up against an onslaught of syrup and sugar and dough. The waffles themselves weren't overly sweet either, and nicely toothsome. The other sweet-savory combination we tried was the brioche french toast with some of the home-made sausage, which was also excellent though in a different direction of excess. The french toast resembled a giant piece of cake covered in bourbon sauce, and it was great with both sausage and chicken, although frankly the portion was overwhelming, even for two of us. I know I complain sometimes when long delays or bad service make it hard for me to enjoy a meal. But Luella's is a reminder that amazing food is still the ultimate touchstone of eating out, and sometimes food can be so amazing that nothing else matters."
8/27/2017,20170827,3,4.14,"While my kale salad and my husband's burger were very good, we had to wait 40 minutes for our food. DON'T COME HERE IF TIME IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. We were left with 10 minutes to eat before making it to a movie across the street. We couldn't leave because you are forced to pay when you place your order. The place was not busy and there were 3 people visible, apparently working in the kitchen."

But Luella's is a reminder that amazing food is still the ultimate touchstone of eating out, and sometimes food can be so amazing that nothing else matters."
8/27/2017,20170827,3,4.14,"While my kale salad and my husband's burger were very good, we had to wait 40 minutes for our food. DON'T COME HERE IF TIME IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. We were left with 10 minutes to eat before making it to a movie across the street. We couldn't leave because you are forced to pay when you place your order. The place was not busy and there were 3 people visible, apparently working in the kitchen."
8/28/2017,20170828,5,4.14,"Luella's has become my ""go to"" spot for a good ol' fashion southern brunch. Outside the time I lived in Louisiana I don't believe I have ever seen boudin on a menu. It is delicious and so is the chicken & waffles, and shrimp & grits. I definitely need to check them out for dinner. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended!"
9/6/2017,20170906,5,4.14,"If you're a going to take forever when it comes to making a meal.. don't be smart about it, and make new menus that say everything will be cooked to order, or each dish take 30 minutes... Well I tried it again, it was good"
9/7/2017,20170907,5,4.15,"My name is Brian and I am a buttermilk fried chicken addict. If I see it on a menu, I am going to order it. There are variations of what exactly buttermilk fired chicken is. For some it is just a batter, for others it is a short soak, and still others it is hours in that bath of whatever buttermilk does to chicken that makes it so, so, so much better than other kinds of fried chicken. Luella's chicken meal is one half of a chicken, that is two more piece than I care to eat in one sitting, but I can't believe I ate the whole thing! That chicken is strait butter. The crust is super crisp and flaky, fried to golden goodness, makes you want to pick up the flakes that hit the floor, it is so tasty. The inside is just buttermilky tender and juicy, you will need an extra napkin. Absolutely no need to bring your good teeth here, you can gum it up if you have to! Because they do the full soak here. It had to be at least 8 hours in that buttermilk judging from the how tender the chicken breast was through and through. And the collard greens is the business too. Nice pot likka, and not too 'stemmy', although not all the stems have been removed, they was just a little stingy with the greens (a serving should be at least 6 ounces, maybe 10). They were nice and flavorful collards, tender, but not stringy or bitter. Great greens.The only reason they I didn't give 5 stars is because I got no reception on my phone (petty, I know) and there was no wifi to compensate. Wait, I had to give the fifth star on the beignet because it was a balm, a warm blessing, the pastry equivalent of walking into your home at the end of a cold day. A certain joy. Why are you still here. Go there and eat. (I heard great things about the shrimp and grits, and the Po boy too).Go already!"
9/7/2017,20170907,5,4.15,"I was unprepared for the goodness of the food and atmosphere. Motown music playing in the background, Ernie Barnes art on the wall and the best southern food, from scratch coming out the kitchen. The service was great too. I had shrimp and grits...the best ever! Thank you to the cooks and wait staff. I'll be back and bringing friends!"
9/21/2017,20170921,5,4.15,I've been here a few times and each time really impresses me. I'm from the south so I love me some sweet tea and theirs was perfect. I had the pimento cheeseburger which was absolutely delicious. No complaints at all. _I've also had their shrimp and grits which are equally amazing! Would highly recommend!!
9/21/2017,20170921,5,4.15,"This place was awesome! I took my mom here for her birthday. Everyone was really friendly and the food was great. We were able to bring our own drink, and mixed with the homemade sweet tea, it was delicious! I appreciated the vibe when entering the establishment and I can't wait to visit Luella again! I had the jimbalaya and cornbread. A+!"
9/22/2017,20170922,5,4.16,"I didn't realize how much I love Southern food and southern cooking until Luella came into my life.The food here is simply amazing, I've tried several dishes from here and have not been disappointed. From sides to desserts I have enjoyed it all plus they have a seasonal fruit tea that's so sweet and delicious.I follow them on all social media because the menu changes and I'm always excited to see and try what is new."
10/1/2017,20171001,3,4.15,"Brunch and dinner menus here, but have only had time to grab a meal in the morning. Menu is small but seems to have some popular standbies, including biscuits and gravy, shrimp & grits, and one of their headliners, the chicken and waffles. The chicken is great. A comfortable level of spice(not quite 'what the cluck' hot but still enough to be flavorful), and the skin is crispy while the meat is still succulent and juicy underneath. They give you a half chicken with the order(thigh, drumstick, breast, wing), a top of a waffle along with some bourbon maple syrup. While the chicken is great, the waffle is less than spectacular; it was fairly soggy by the time it got to me, which is unfortunate because I tend to prefer thicker waffles with crispier exteriors when it comes to my chicken and waffles. Some other brunch items also looked good, including the sweet potato pancakes and French toast, though I think next time dinner is in order, with gumbo being first on the list. Food is good here, though not perfect, and could be a bit cheaper. 3.5 stars"
10/4/2017,20171004,5,4.15,Woke up on a random Wednesday craving grits. A little searching and stumbled on this gem. Awesome spicy but just right. Cornmeal fried shrimp po'boy. Best remoulade I've had since living in New Orleans. And Cheerwine. Will be back.
10/5/2017,20171005,4,4.15,"I had the fried chicken and collard greens. The food was VERY good, but I'm giving this four stars for two reasons. First, the price was way, way too expensive for the amount of food I got. I ended up paying $17.50 for a small cup of collard greens and like 2.5 pieces of chicken. Second, the atmosphere was kind of bizarre. There was no music playing, and you have to walk up to the cash register to place your order. The food took so long to cook that it would've made more sense just to have full service because we were sitting there waiting for such a long time for our food. I'd eat here again if the prices were a little lower."
10/6/2017,20171006,5,4.16,This place was heaven on a plate the chicken and waffle and shrimp and grits were Delicious. Friendly service and BYOB!!!!
10/9/2017,20171009,5,4.16,"This is truly a gem! The food is amazing, the music is amazing, and the service is amazing! We ordered the shrimp and grits, the fried chicken, the Mac and cheese, the cat fish tacos, and the best corn bread I've ever had in my life!!! The beignets were the perfect ending to a fantastic dinner."
10/18/2017,20171018,4,4.16,"Nice place. It's one of those places where you order your food, get a number, and sit at your table and wait for your food. When you pay for your food, adding a tip is an option but I declined because I didn't think that you tipped for that type of place since all they do is bring you your food. Water was self serve and it's BYOB so they're not doing much in terms of serving. I went with a friend and we both had a bowl of gumbo each then shared an order of cornbread and shrimp and grits. Omg the shrimp and grits were soo good. Grits super creamy and shrimp perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I definitely recommend that one. The gumbo was really good too. They bring it with a bowl of some rice and pour the gumbo over at your table. It was heavy and had a lot of flavor to it. The corn bread was corn bread, in a good way. I love corn bread and this did not disappoint. All in all it was a pretty heavy meal but we wanted to try things so we got a few. I'd recommend corn bread, gumbo, and shrimp and grits, but if you were only to take one of my recommendations I'd say the shrimp and grits for sure. I'll definitely be going back to try more of their food. The service there ended up being really good (very attentive, asking how things are, asking if we needed anything, clearing the table as we finished things etc) so we just left cash on the table as a tip. Good option if you don't want to tip upfront for what you don't know."
10/23/2017,20171023,4,4.16,"Their food will 100% satisfy your southern cravings! But let me start with service, because it's the kind of place where you order and pay up front, then they bring out your food. The guy who took our order was fine, not super friendly BUT quite pushy. He recommended us the buttermilk biscuits and seasonal jam, to which we said we're ok, but he kept pushing it and we felt super pressured, so we gave in...but honestly, that was pretty annoying. Other food we got was the chicken gumbo, braised short rib mac n cheese, and a side of collard greens. The flavors are all there! My gumbo is amazing, not too salty, the Andouille sausage is just the right spiciness, I love it. Hubs enjoy his mac n cheese also. Collard greens are definitely a must have, the little pieces of ham hock are to die for. AND last but not least, the biscuits and jam were delicious. Now...the portion and price are not that great, it's actually expensive, in my opinion. For $13, the mac n cheese is pretty small. There wasn't enough jam to go with the biscuits, like we needed at least one more thing of jam. And I'd personally love more rice in my gumbo. The fact that the collard greens cost just as much as the gumbo, I was expecting a bigger serving size for sure...That said, it's BYOB, so always a plus! The location is awesome (never realized Lincoln Square is so nice). Fast service, good food. I think 4 stars are fair!"
10/23/2017,20171023,5,4.16,"Up there with Roister as many favorite fried chicken. The mac and cheese, greens, and beignets were also delicious. Super friendly. Great music. Will definitely be back to try other stuff."
10/23/2017,20171023,5,4.16,Such amazing food and great service!! The shrimp and grits are the best!! Don't forget to BYOB!! The Mac and cheese and the greens were amazing too!! You know what just do like we did and order one or two of everything to try!! I can't wait to go back.

I try not to indulge in this kind of rich comfort food all the time...but when I get a taste for it, only Luella's will do! Brunch and dinner menus are both wonderful.Try: the Southern benedict or chicken & waffles at brunch; the fried chicken & greens, gumbo, mac n cheese at dinner. Cornbread and beignets anytime.Plus it's BYOB!"
11/6/2017,20171106,3,4.17,"I went to Luella's Southern Kitchen a few weeks ago with a party of eight on a Thursday night and had a good and bad experience. The star of the show was the cornbread in a small cast iron skillet it was cooked perfectly and just popped out of the pan, it had a really nice crust and worth the 20-minute wait. Biscuits and cornbread are $5.00 each as a side dish.I tried the lady's Jambalaya sitting next to me but I thought it had way too much heat as in ""cayenne heat"", she said she is going to take half of it home and make some rice to thin out the heat taste. Jambalaya is ""Market Price"" at $18.00 the day we were there, I would rather order the Gumbo for $8.00. I had the Shrimp Po'boy, the shrimp was good and had all the fixins' but it was just a little too dry for me, I wish they would put a little more sauce on it. Overall the portions are small in my opinion.Enough of the criticism. On the brighter side, the people that work there are very nice and accommodating, they are a combination of cashiers and bus staff. You have to walk up to the cashier and pay for your drinks and food and then they will deliver it to your table. Some of our guests had to wait quite awhile for their food, I felt uncomfortable eating in front of them. In general, I liked the place and the staff but they need to work on the food and timing. I would probably not go there again but try another Cajun place instead."

However, it was a little salty for my taste. I also ordered a side of children's chicken and fries which was cooked to perfection. I was also interested in the greens but did not purchase because of the ham hocks in the greens. I suggest maybe turkey or no meat in the greens which is more appealing to many more people. Overall, I truly enjoyed the dining experience.A.Lewis"

11/11/2017,20171111,5,4.18,"From my phone call to the restaurant to confirm they were handicap accessible to my arrival the service was warm, welcoming and accommodating. When we arrived a table had been reserved for us that allowed for easy wheelchair access for my Aunt. We ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffle, Brown Sugar and Bourbon French Toast, and the Shrimp and Grits. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had! The shrimp and grits had an amazingly delicious savory, rich gravy. The French toast was cooked to perfection and VERY flavorful. We got beignets for dessert and they were served hot out the fryer. I'll definitely come here again. Additional plus, they're Black owned AND BYOB!!!"

11/13/2017,20171113,5,4.17,I came here with my girlfriends for brunch. I ordered the chicken which was very tasty. I loved that it had a kick with the sweet and hot sauce that they put on it. I loved that it's was byob. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I also had beignets for the first time here. They were amazing!!
11/16/2017,20171116,5,4.17,"OMG I was about to walk down the street to just get a sandwich and this place just pulled me in and it's the best decision I've made all month! I had the chicken gumbo and sweet potato pie. They poured the gumbo over the rice when they brought it to my table - sure made my quick work lunch feel fancy! So that was nice but then I took and bite and I was blown away. This is what gumbo's supposed to taste like- that dark, deep gravy and chicken and sausage that is so tender and juicy. I generally unconsciously rush through lunch but this was so beautiful that I savored every single bite. And then they brought out the pie. Let's talk for a minute about a counter service place that courses your meal for you -amazing! Pie is one of my favorite foods and I have had it all over this city and this is 100% the best. Better than Hoosier Mama, better than Bang Bang. The sweet potato is so lights it's almost a mousse and the crust is perfectly balanced with that texture that's not too crispy and not mushy. And have I mentioned the homemade marshmallow fluff on top that they toast? And the bourbon caramel sauce around the edge?  Actually, never mind, don't go order the pie, more for me! Seriously - please go eat here because if this place ever went out of business I'd cry. OH - and they cater!!!"
11/24/2017,20171124,5,4.18,Best southern food I've had. I enjoyed everything here from the food to the service. Felt like home.
11/27/2017,20171127,4,4.18,Luella's is a gem on Chicago's northside. When I went for Sunday brunch and I love the fact that you order at the counter then they bring the food to you. You don't have to wait for a waitress to bring your check after you catch the itis that is sure to come after you finish your food.The restaurant is pretty casual and even though you don't necessarily have a waiter waiting on you they do a good job of checking in to see if you need anything after they bring your food. Looking forward to the next brunch at Luella's!

Family run business that has a good atmosphere, personable staff and great fried chicken. I'll be back to try a few other dishes."

12/13/2017,20171213,4,4.18,"Stopped in here for a quick snack. It was pretty packed in here at around 8pm on a Saturday. You wait in line and order at the counter before taking a seat. You pay first (and also tip?--kind of weird since you haven't experienced the food or service before you sit down). The food is brought out to you, so no worries. Prices are kind of up there for portion size and what you get, but this is Lincoln Square/North Center and there aren't many options nearby for this kind of food, so there ya go. I just grabbed some chicken gumbo, and shared some beignets and sweet potato pie with my friends. They also have pop in bottles that you can buy, and free water near the napkins and silverware. Service was very prompt and friendly. I thought the chicken gumbo was tasty. The spice was pretty good too. Gumbo is my favorite type of soup, and I've had it in many places, as well as I've made it before. I would have preferred a darker roux base, as well as for it to be a bit thicker or to have some okra in it, but it was still decent. Also, I prefer seafood gumbo, but that is my own personal preference. The beignets stood out--they were pillowy fluffy sweet treats of deliciousness. I got through 75% of one of my pieces, and realized that I was pretty stuffed. They come three to an order, and that is more than enough to share with one other person. The sweet potato pie can also be shared--it was sweeeeeet. Too sweet for me, actually. The marshmallow fluff on top was a nice touch, though. Again, my personal preference, but I prefer my sweet potato pie to be less sweet and have the sweet potatoes themselves make up more of the taste. Luella's is good. I'm glad there's an option on the North Side for Southern food. I'm lucky enough that I can get the same kind of cuisine from my family or from other nearby restaurants, but if I am in the area I would totally stop by again."

I can't wait to go back to try that fried chicken and waffles!!"
12/17/2017,20171217,5,4.18,"My favorite food in the city. My absolute favorite. The gumbo is arguably the greatest dish in the history of the world. Really don't mean to exaggerate. Try the gumbo, then argue with me. I'll win."
12/23/2017,20171223,4,4.18,"My general manager raved about this palce near her home. She insisted I try it out if I was in the neighborhood. I am a foodie & love eating at small restaurants. She went so far to print out the menu and bio of the chef! Said to try the shrimp and grits with any side. I chose mac n' cheese with some super sweet tea. Everything was delicious but a bit pricey.I've begged my close friend Anthony Graves who is a cooking genius to try this place since he has mastered News Orleans style cooking. Hats off to the chef but during my visit you seemed focused but overwhelmed. Please check out Anthony Graves of Gary, IN on Facebook. Those pics of food on his page is 100%.him. Same age, hunger and passion for food. I told him you guys need to meet. Hopefully he will listen because I observed 1 too many customers walk in & out because of the crowd. Overall, food was tasty."
12/28/2017,20171228,4,4.18,Very good southern food at a decent price! I had the shrimp po boy which was great! I saw a few people munching on Mac and cheese though and that looked heavenly. If I ever make it back that might be the entree to sample.
12/28/2017,20171228,5,4.19,"This place is dope. I came with a large group at around 7 during a weekday and there was no wait, the food was great, and the staff/owners were warm and welcoming. Tldr: worth a visit, definitely visit if you want good southern food, or good food period.Now, some specifics:Positives:- Fried chicken. I always feel like there's a price point and quality point where if it's not markedly better than Harold's friend chicken, you shouldn't bother. This chicken is not one of those. The batter and chicken tasted great and, most importantly, the meat was super tender. The white meat was so tender I was legit shocked by the quality. The addition of the smoked honey took things to another level. One of my favorite fried chicken places in the city, probably better than some of the more popular places.- sweet potato pie: I was expecting just a tiny slice for the price, but it was a pretty sizable amount with caramel and marshmallows... Not terribly sweet pie filling, which is a plus. Enjoyed this a lot.- corn bread: this was probably standard corn bread. Not bad but not mind blowing. Just right.(Not really) cons:For the price, you would hope that the food is more elevated than your normal fried chicken/fast food place. Luckily it is. No real cons to speak of.All-around great dining experience"
1/1/2018,20180101,5,4.19,"We came here with a craving for chicken & waffles, not knowing that it was only served during brunch service, but we definitely did not leave disappointed. The woman taking our order is what made our night by making us feel right at home and giving us customer service that will definitely bring us back. Also, I love fast casual restaurants, because you get the perks of both counter and table service, with enough privacy to enjoy your meal but knowing they still care to make sure you're happy.Everything was phenomenal but the real star was the fried chicken, especially paired with the smoked honey. We also had the biscuits, crawfish gumbo, and beignets. Collard greens were not our favorite, but didn't take the hint to sub for fries just in case."
1/9/2018,20180109,5,4.19,"Fried chicken, shrimp and grits, cornbread, biscuits, and catfish tacos are all STUPID GOOD. This place isssss my favorite Lincoln square restaurant without a doubt. It's too, too good. The food is special and so thoughtful, and beautifully homemade. Not heavy or greasy, just an explosion of flavors and textures and delicious fresh ingredients.Service is friendly and fast, and the prices are great for the generous portions and the fact that everything is so delicious. This is absolutely worth your time and dollars! Give it a shot and try that chicken"
1/16/2018,20180116,5,4.19,"A review I posted on Facebook on the 10th of December 2017:""My wife and I went here today for brunch, and we both strongly regret that it took so long to get around to it. I expected this to be very good by what I'd read online, but my expectations were absolutely blown away. The two people working the counter and attending to the tables were very nice and seemed legitimately concerned with our satisfaction. They have a beautiful vintage refrigerator behind the counter where they keep carafes of fresh lemonade and iced tea and some other things, which gave me a charming, homey feeling.Oh, but when we got our food, man. It is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had at a restaurant in my life. I had the Nashville hot chicken and waffles. The waffle was a thin, dense waffle in a more Belgian tradition, and the chicken, while a little greasy, was moist and flavorful. So good! My wife had the Benedict, and the smoked pork belly was just amazing. It was perfectly tender, not at all chewy, and it was clear it was smoked with real hardwood, not just smoke flavored like Canadian bacon. The biscuit (which I understand is also in the biscuits and gravy) was flavored with fresh cracked pepper, and had a dense, spongy consistency. There is a lot to be said about a nice flaky biscuit, but this really hit the spot. Though not listed on the menu, the Benedict came with a side of collard greens, which were perfectly cooked, not fibrous or stringy, and seasoned with a little bit of fatty pork. Everything was honestly perfect. I am very judgmental, having worked in restaurants for almost twenty years, and the combination of truly good, flavorful food and a commitment to service was almost overwhelming. I am used to having my expectations dashed, and while we spent a pretty penny on our food, what we got was beyond worth it. I think we might return next week for dinner.""I enjoyed that everyone seemed to have a pride of place, which was reflected in the quality of the food, the service and the artwork in the restaurant."
1/29/2018,20180129,1,4.18,"Me and my husband have been wanting to try this place since they opened. We also wanted to love it. However, we finally went here at 6:00 pm with a party of 4 on a Sunday. The setup is odd because you have to go to the back and order, and then, sit down. Immediately we were told that they were out of biscuits and beignets. Really? We were also told that the dinner menu was our only option. The menu is not nearly as big as I expected. I didn't see what I wanted which, was catfish as an entree on the menu, only catfish tacos. Nope. However, the guy said he'd give us menus and take our order at a table after they cleaned off a table to accommodate us. We agreed because there were people trying to check out in that small crowded area. They left me and my party standing near the entrance for 15 minutes to clean off a table which, they never cleaned. It wasn't even busy, just dirty tables of food and no one was being served, just paying their bill. I think I only saw the cashier/waiter and a cook in the back working. Of course, me and my party was irritated by all of this and we just looked at each other like, wtf. We looked at the menu a couple more minutes and the lonely waiter still zipped past us without clearing a table as we stood nor acknowledging our presence. There wasn't much left on the menu to choose from that we really wanted other than fried chicken and collard greens but, we decided to leave and seek dinner elsewhere...maybe Big Jones or Pearls. They didn't seem to care that we left. How sad."
2/5/2018,20180205,1,4.18,"THIS PLACE SUCKS. Farcry from Southern food. Their menu is awful, the food tastes super bland, and the serving sizes are so small! This is the worst restaurant in Chicago. Ive had better food from IHOP. Go to Taco In a Bag instead."
2/6/2018,20180206,5,4.18,"Incredible food made me feel like I was in NOLA. Cat fish: amazing. And it's BYOB, so feel free to bring some wine or beer for an awesome meal."

2/8/2018,20180208,5,4.18,"Went here for brunch a few weeks ago and loved it!! Their daily lunch menu didn't really impress me much, but brunch was spectacular! I tried the pimento burger and substituted the beef patty for their breakfast sausage and it was amazing!! Really filling and the cajun fries were a nice touch. Definitely coming back for brunch!"

I highly recommend the burger, catfish, and biscuits. I need to try their cornbread next. I'd love it to be larger and full service to enjoy the experience a bit more (I'm not a huge fan of first come first served seating), but all in all the food was fantastic and the staff was very friendly and helpful."

The Nashville fried chicken and waffles was by far my favorite thing. The chicken was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of heat, and the waffle was fluffy albeit very flat. The shrimp and grits were probably my least favorite thing we tried (the shrimp was deliciously seasoned, however, the grits was super runny and didn't add to the overall flavor of the dish). The people working there were also very friendly and accommodating! Quick to refill my coffee and even gave us an extra beignet (which was delicious, too)!"

3/5/2018,20180305,5,4.17,This is my favorite restaurant ever. I went yesterday and had chicken and waffles and beignets and shrimp and grits. And I am going back again today. I am visiting from the Bay Area and this is better than anywhere I've been so far in Oakland. I am in love!!
3/6/2018,20180306,3,4.17,"Ok let me start of by saying that I had high hopes for this place as my husband said people raves about it on Facebook, don't get me wrong the food was great...... hold on let me start from the beginning. Parking is super crazy on weekends you will drive around looking for paid parking as streets behind restaurant are permit parking so be ready to drive around a bit (it's the city so I wasn't really bothered by the parking) we came in for Afternoon brunch on Sunday. We arrived at 1 and finally sat down to eat at 2:15 to only have our food at 3:19. The restaurant is quite small not too many tables but enough to hold a crowd. You walk in and you have to wait to be seated the wait time can be very long we waited almost over an hour for our table. People coming in for take out will walk out before you even get your food! The waiting space is a narrow alley that is shared with the waitress making there rounds to pick up food. Not very comfy as you have to stand the whole time. Only one small chair that can seat about two people at a time. Finally our time came and we had to place our order right before we sat down. Prices seem very fair to the amount of food you get but I have to say the shrimp and grits is way over priced for the amount of food you get . We sat down about an hour after ordering the waiter came by to offer us free dessert as the food was not ready. (Have you ever been so hungry that you got full all at the same time that was me) we had some sweet tea which was free refills. The sweet tea was so delicious!!! Our food finally came and I have to say it was worth the wait. I had chicken and waffles and my hubby had a burger we ordered a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese is a pure waste of money in my opinion, it tasted like box Mac I was expecting southern Mac that has lots of cheddar cheese that was baked. Unfortunately we ended up throwing the Mac and cheese away $8 down the trash I have to say the only complaint I have about my food is the dense waffle (I'm used to super fluffy waffles I feel like this one is super super dense and can be very heavy on your stomach after eating) it sucks that I was only able to eat a little bit of my food the wait was so long I got full again. Final thoughts: Food 6/10 Restaurant cleanness 10/10 friendly staff 10/10 wait time 2/10. Would I be back again.....maybe and maybe on a less busy day like Sunday only for the chicken with out the waffle."
3/9/2018,20180309,5,4.17,"Omg! This place was so amazing I just fell in love! The food was outstanding and I'm grateful they brought a little of the south to Chicago! The buttermilk fired chicken was on point, the Mac and cheese was perfection, and the greens where like eating my Grandfather's!!!! Also the service was 5 Star! Plus Every man working in there was FINE AS HELL! nothing better then enjoying an amazing meal with eye candy like that! Thanks for a great experience!"

When I went to pick up my order all of the workers just kinda stared at me which was awkward. And I didn't want to be that person screaming ""HEY I'M HERE TO PICK UP MY FOOD"". Eventually a nice young woman did come over and hand me my food. The fried chicken was good, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Greens were descent, nothing spectacular and the serving was very small. The biscuits were huuuuuuge and amazing. Make sure you get extra jam for them."

3/11/2018,20180311,1,4.17,"I am an uber driver and have heard of this place repeatedly .Let's start with the bad customer service as soon as you walk in, the only person that was at least remotely personable was the cashier, an older woman. No one else in this restaurant said anything. we ordered our food to go and as we paid for it and the cashier pointed out that we can tip ?! before we even got our food? Yea ok. Not gonna happen.It was $40 for 3 pieces of chicken, some greens, tasteless Mac-n-cheese a small spoonful of some weird grits that had the strangest consistency, the best way I can describe it is they took whole hominy and half-blended it. So the grits were more like chunks of corn with husks in it. As we sat and waited for our food no one acknowledged us in any way to even offer us a glass of water. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt , but horrible customer service plus mediocre food at BEST equals 1 Star . I don't understand how this customer service and customer interaction even flies in such a great neighborhood with great restaurants . I honestly feel that people up here just don't know good soul food. But I'm really concerned that no one smiled or even offered a "" hello how are you ?"" This place would dO SO much better with even the SLIGHTEST amount of friendliness . And of course taking their menu back to the basics . Do not BOTHER ! Go to the south side to PEARLS place ."

3/13/2018,20180313,5,4.16,Amazing food and staff were very friendly and knowledgable. Good made to order so takes a little longer than usual but I it's a byob place so I was preoccupied in conversation and enjoying my own wine. Would come back here.
3/14/2018,20180314,5,4.16,"Sometimes I think of the fried chicken here, and the mac n' cheese, and I get a bit *sniff* choked with emotion. On both occasions I have dined here, I have ordered WAY too much food and I have eaten all of it, and then I have rolled across the street to the Davis and tried not to sleep through a movie. There is no table service -- which I don't usually love -- but it's also BYOB so that balances out. Everything is super fresh delicious, served with a side of hospitality and reasonable prices. Enjoy!(And if you see a lady crying a little into her fried chicken, it's cool. She's actually very happy.)"
3/18/2018,20180318,2,4.16,"Food is delicious but the service is terrible. Aside from waiting forever to order food we were held upfrom ordering when it was our turn for someone they knew from elsewhere in line to come forward and order before us.  The group didn't know what they wanted so we continued to wait while they asked questions and figured it out. On a positive note, food was very good but we had half of it served and waited over 20 minutes for most of the rest of it To be served and then another 10 minutes for the final dish.  Some of our table was finished before the final person received his food. Overall, good food, slow and inattentive service."
3/23/2018,20180323,5,4.16,The food was exceptional. But beyond that the atmosphere was welcoming and the staff treated us like regulars. Everyone was friendly and informative. I will definitely return to check out some other menu items. We had and would recommend:Shrimp and gritsFrench toast Nashville hot chicken and waffles Regular chicken and waffles Beignets I wish I could remember names but the lady at the counter taking our order was so nice and so was our server and the owner came over to chat with us too!
3/29/2018,20180329,3,4.16,"Setting: pretty cool. Not much lighting. I appreciate the sign in the window notifying you to order at the counter before sitting. Service: was pretty cool. The cashier was nice and made great suggestions for it being my first time. The bus boy (I assume) with the locs is very handsome and checked up on us periodically to make sure everything was going well. The Food: the greens tasted like the glory brand. The chicken tasted okay and came out piping hot! The macaroni was good, I wouldn't say award winning but it was good. My friends chicken gumbo would have been delicious if it was at least warm."
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.16,"Best chicken and waffle I ever had in my life. 4 of us got the same thing and we all agreed with that.The chicken is not fatty, yet the crispest it can be, and juicy in the inside. Ah, I want more!Service is great too, true southern hospitality. I will definitely come back"
4/8/2018,20180408,4,4.16,"When we got to the neighborhood, we immediately got overwhelmed by all the options in Ravenswood. But Luella's held her own! The Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles was delightfully seasoned, but still tender. While the menu is limited, it's definitely worth giving it a try because of how on point their flavors are. I also really enjoyed the shrimp and grits - it was very unique in how good it was was. I do think it would be hard to go with a group, so keep it smaller. I was a fan and definitely see myself revisiting this spot. It just might be delayed because of low menu options."
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.16,"I'm a big fan of Southern food and Luella is easily my new favorite spot for authentic southern comfort food. Went in for brunch on a Sunday morning. The place is nice and inviting. We ordered the Nashville hot fried chicken and waffles - the combination of the heat from the chicken and the sweet waffle was simply amazing. We also ordered the biscuits with gravy, the French toast and the award winning Mac and cheese. Loved each and every dish - one of the best brunches I've had in the recent past!"
4/9/2018,20180409,4,4.16,"We just got back from a trip to New Orleans and were looking for a place to get our beignet fix in Chicago. I could only find 4 places that made them to order in the city and Luella's was one. They did not disappoint! We went on a Sunday to take advantage of their brunch menu. I got the Nashville Hot Chicken + waffles and my gf got the Sweet Potato Pancakes. Both were large portions and quite heavy... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's southern comfort food! Just know what to expect. The chicken and waffles were terrific. Chicken had super crunchy skin that stood up to the hot sauce and syrup. It's not that spicy, and I wouldn't necessarily call it ""Nashville Hot"", but it's definitely tasty. The sweet+savory+spicy is delicious. (It definitely leans a lot towards sweet, especially with the waffle.) Now let me say something about that waffle... it's so good. Crispy edges, pillowy center with bits of apple(?) and sweet potato pieces throughout. I could have used a bit more heat or acid to cut thru the sweetness of the entire dish, but I will be ordering it again and ask for some hot sauce. My favorite chicken and waffles I've had in Chicago.I had a few bites of the sweet potato pancakes and they were both fluffy and chewy. Better texture than your standard buttermilk pancakes but tasted pretty much the same. The allspice butter was terrific however and tasted like Christmas. Maple syrup was better than your run of the mill stuff (maybe because it was warm), but nothing super fancy.Last thing... service was a bit slow but EXTREMELY FRIENDLY. Just like in the south ;) Loved the woman working the counter, who happened to be Luella's granddaughter. She went to every table, talked to the customers, and was incredibly warm. Definitely going back!!!"
4/13/2018,20180413,5,4.16,"I went here for my birthday for lunch. I ordered the shortrib Mac & cheese, shrimp & grits, buttermilk biscuits and beignets. Everything was fantastic. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and spicy. The cheese grits were well prepared. The Mac & cheese was heavily sauces and the shortribs were flavorful. I'm definitely going back to try some of the other dishes as well. Highly recommend this place."
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.16,"This is probably the best fried chicken I've tried in Chicago. We stopped in for dinner on Saturday (early around 5pm), the place wasn't too crowded. We were able to get a small two person table near the front of the restaurant. When you walk in, you have to order first and then find a table. We ordered the fried chicken and an order of gumbo with a side of skillet cornbread. The total price was around 31 dollars and it was worth every penny. The food took about 20 minutes to come out and we were just able to sip the beers we had brought with (did I mention is BYOB). The fried chicken was greasy and crispy at the same time. A little bit of salt on the skin and it was perfection! The gumbo had the perfect amount of heat for me. I don't usually eat spicy food, but it made me feel like I was in New Orleans and enjoying life. The skillet cornbread was also on another level, it came out sizzling and it was the perfect time to add some of the honey butter on top. All in all, this is a new favorite of ours and we can't wait to go back at check it out. Next we plan on trying our brunch! Get to Luella's and enjoy!"
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.16,"Everything we ordered was fresh and very very good. I had the Nashville Chicken & Waffle, my wife had the Shrimp & Grits , my younger boys shared the chicken strip/nuggets with Mac & Cheese... EVERYTHING was good. Friendly Staff, I will visit again. Keep Up The Great Work!"
4/16/2018,20180416,3,4.16,"Went to Luella's recently and ordered the following:Fried Chicken with greensCorn BreadFacts: The chicken is the best chicken in Chicago. It's better than Harold's, Gus's Big Jones, Popeyes, KFC, your mother, or anyone in your family that thinks they can cook. It's that good. I repeat this is the best, fried chicken in Chicago.Meh: The Collard GreensThis needs work. Like I received more meat than greens and I still didn't have much flavor. Plus where is the pot likker? I sincerely believe these greens come from the can and are Collard Greens from Glory.Double Meh: The CornbreadThe cornbread tastes like Jiffy cornbread made in cast iron. For authentic cornbread like your mama makes - Big Jones wins in this category. I will be back to try other items on the menu but I will pass on the collard greens and cornbread."
4/18/2018,20180418,5,4.16,"Can't get to the South for authentic fried chicken and greens? Then make your way to Luella's Southern Kitchen in Lincoln Square.I've been wanting to come here for quite sometime now and Luella's did not disappoint.My friends and I, had a great lunch: fried chicken, greens, tamale casserole, biscuits and the most delicious corn bread I ever had. The recipes are authentic and the inspiration of Great Grandmother, Mrs. Luella. Don't go, RUN, to this little piece of the South in our great city. You won't be disapointed!"
4/21/2018,20180421,1,4.16,"The food was over salted and the staff less than friendly. Honestly, I don't see what the fuss is about this place. No one even came round for me to talk about my oversalted southern Benedict. Only redeeming thing about it were the collard greens."
4/23/2018,20180423,5,4.16,I had the shrimp and grits. The seasoning was spot on! Will be going back to try the gumbo! Awesomely Done!

The owner has such a great attitude and despite it being a seat yourself type of place they are very attentive and have great service asking you how you are doing. Everyone in our party got the chicken and waffles, and I also got the brown sugar and bourbon french toast and we had an array of beignets and biscuits. Can you say CARB CENTRAL? All the food was great, the chicken was flavored great, it was Nashville type of fried chicken and thus VERY spicy. The french toast had the great brown sugar and bourbon sauce and was perfectly plush. The beignets were fluffy in the center and had a crisp outside. The place is also BYOB so we brought things to have some mimosas with our meal which is a great plus!"
5/4/2018,20180504,4,4.16,"Amazing mac and cheese! This place has some of the best southern food in the city. Service is super slow, but I'll wait ;D"
5/5/2018,20180505,2,4.16,"This place may not last so long and is indicative of the types of places that exist around this area. The food was not too good. Tried the Nashville chicken and waffles which was gooey and sugary and guess what else? $17.00. Ha. That's all you really need to know. Nice people working there, probably because they realize how difficult it is to make it opening up this type of restaurant. Food was not great and ended up with resultant upset stomach with other various unmentionable issues."
5/15/2018,20180515,5,4.16,"Went to Luella's on a Saturday for Mother's Day Weekend Brunch. Our group of 4 got there close to 2 and did not have to wait for a table. You order at the register, tables are first come first serve, and your food is brought out to you. On Saturdays and Sundays you can only order from the brunch menu until 3, which isn't a complaint, just a heads up. Based off Yelp reviews, I ordered the chicken and waffles for myself and beignets and mac & cheese for the table to try. I'm just here to reiterate that the chicken is authentic! I am so skeptical when the majority rave about how good fried chicken is...but I can second that motion!! And the waffle honestly tasted like an extension of the fried chicken in the best way possible. Others at the table ordered shrimp and grits and the cajun seasoning explodes in your mouth on the first bite. I personally thought the shrimp and grits were a little on the small side, especially in comparison to the large serving of chicken and waffles, but really tasty, nonetheless. Our beignets came out as our dessert and they were worth the wait! Three come in an order so we ordered two and were still fighting over the beignets. Easily the closest you can get to Cafe Du Monde in Chicago. The mac & cheese though wasn't quite my type of mac & cheese. They're shells instead on macaroni so it's probably just preference. When I'm there again, because I will be back, I won't be getting a side of mac. Which is fine because there is plenty to choose from! Also, they're BYOB so need I say more? I think Luella's is great for small groups, under 6 people, because more and seating may be a challenge. Also affordable, for four people our bill was $90 total. And their payment structure makes it easier to pay for your plate and not have to hassle with splitting the bill."
5/16/2018,20180516,5,4.16,"Loved this restaurant! Went here with my family for Mother's Day and the food was so good! The staff was so friendly and very accommodating. My favorite was the mac and cheese and the grits, and I never liked grits until I came to this place. The chicken was so spicy that I loved it even more. Highly recommend this place for some good southern food. My family also really enjoyed our time there. We will definitely be back!"
5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.16,"Came here for brunch and will be returning very soon. Some of the best chicken & waffles I've ever had. I got the spicy version, and that they were. The waffles were so full of flavor. The shrimp and grits were very good, but I've had better. I don't want that much cream cheese for the choice of cheese in my grits. The biscuits were phenomenal. My friend had the sweet potato pancakes, she's a vegetarian, and was very happy. But if you're not a vegetarian, make sure you try their chicken and waffles served only at brunI'm interested to come and eat dinner here and try other things on their menu! Also, their sweet tea. Cute atmosphere, very homey and comfortable. The service is great. It's small in there, and they get a wait, for good reason."
5/23/2018,20180523,5,4.16,"Omg! Their food is so delicious!! Yummy south comfort food. I had the fried catfish, Mac and cheese and beignets as a pick up order. A bit on the pricey side but man was it worth it! I'll be back!"
5/24/2018,20180524,4,4.16,"Good southern food. We had the shrimp and grits, shrimp po'boy, greens, biscuits with jam and beignets. Food was solid, customer service was great and the atmosphere was nice. It's a small store front with a warm feeling. The music added to the vibe. I live over 30 minutes away and would definitely take the drive for this place."
5/25/2018,20180525,5,4.16,I found a restaurant that can really make everything I like perfectly. The greens remind me of my grandma's. And the Gumbo takes me back to my favorite restaurant in Neworleans.
5/26/2018,20180526,4,4.16,"not sure exactly why, but for over a month i have had the MOST INTENSE cravings for catfish. i've always been a huge fan of catfish. when i was younger i rembember going fishin' at the lake and bringing home the catfish we caught and cooking them up for dinner. even now when i go back home to visit, i try to find time to fish and eat catfish. tl;dr i stopped into luella's and had some incredible mississippi catfish. it was tasty as heck and just what i had been hoping for. sad that mine didn't come out with any hush puppies, but it was tasty just the same. this is one of my favorite little spots in lincoln square GET THE MAC AND CHEESE"
5/27/2018,20180527,4,4.16,"This place is a fine example of love in your food. The chicken was off the chain! You could tell that it was brined, marinated, and cooked fresh. The shrimp and grits were delish! Like I've never had grits that were that texture. Amazing! The hummingbird cake was a cross between a coffee cake and a banna bread. My only complaint was the waffle. Not really the right taste or consistency. But overall. So good! Looking forward to a dinner service!"
5/27/2018,20180527,4,4.16,"My verdict is four stars hands down. But chicken is amazing. Wasn't too crazy about the waffle. It didn't have the consistency that I like with chicken and waffles, but not bad. Beast & All-Stars my dish work definitely shrimp and grits and the crunchy chicken. Hummingbird cake was already good well. It was very soft, not-too-sweet, a little rich, but satisfying. It feels good to walk in the face and have someone welcome you and check on you. Your meal. I'm definitely returning with my motorcycle crew."
5/30/2018,20180530,5,4.17,"I went to Luella Restaurant and was very satisfied with my food. Shrimp and grits, Beignets, and cornbread. Just delicious!!! I will be back real soon with the family!!!"
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.17,"Best fried chicken hands down! Beignets also amazing! Friendly, fast service. Can't say much more because I'm still in a food coma."
6/7/2018,20180607,4,4.17,"The Chicken, greens and beans are absolutely delicious. They are very friendly and helpful. The only downside is that the prices are a tad high. I went for lunch and it was about $25. I will absolutely go back though."
6/10/2018,20180610,5,4.17,"Great place, best beignets! Delicious breakfast, great Columbian coffee while listening to cool music."
6/16/2018,20180616,5,4.17,This is my favorite restaurant ever. I went yesterday and had chicken and waffles and beignets and shrimp and grits. And I am going back again today. I am visiting from the Bay Area and this is better than anywhere I've been so far in Oakland. I am in love!I'm going back to Chicago soon and I can't wait to go back here- just saw my review and remembered and I'm all excited!
6/18/2018,20180618,3,4.17,"Stopped in for brunch on Saturday afternoon. I didn't realize the full menu wouldn't be available at this time, so I'll have to come back and try some of the dinner items. Let me start by saying the servings are absolutely massive! I really enjoyed the french toast -- it was so fresh, the slices were thick, and it was not too sweet. I also tried the Nashville hot chicken & waffle. This was disappointing -- the chicken was pretty salty, and the waffle got a bit lost in the dish, as the chicken was overpowering. After passing by Luella's so many times, I was expecting more, but I haven't completely given up on them yet!"
6/22/2018,20180622,3,4.17,"Expected to be greeted with a friendly ""Southern Welcome"" but was ""welcomed"" with silence from the young man taking our order. If you're having a bad day, stay home. No matter how good my food may be you've put a damper on my experience. Customer Service needs a serious revamp in order for businesses to survive or have repeat visitors. I think this is a lost art. Do better."
6/22/2018,20180622,5,4.17,I am a self-proclaimed fried chicken connoisseur and this is the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life! The chicken was crispy and not greasy. Even the breast was moist and tender. Collard greens were on point. Cornbread and biscuits are excellent - get both. This is the place of fried chicken dreams. Food service was great - everyone was so polite and accommodating. This is not a place to miss.
6/22/2018,20180622,5,4.17,"Stopped in today for a bite to eat having never been or reading any reviews, just by looking at the menu and was totally blown away. best fried chicken and collard greens i've ever had. got some benets to go. will def come back for brunch!!"
6/22/2018,20180622,3,4.17,"I had the four piece chicken dinner. The chicken is cooked in a very tasty batter! However, I was very disappointed that they give you very little greens hardly to taste as a portion. The biscuits were good but for the price overall is too high. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant."
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.17,"OMG! This place was absolutely delicious. I have never been to a breakfast spot that was so delicious. You will not regret coming here. If you have a sweet tooth for morning breakfast, definitely order the maple bourbon French toast. That first bite is amazing. My boyfriend ordered the spicy fried chicken and waffle which wasn't that spicy than I expected. Definitely coming back here to try other foods on there menu. Not breakfast food but lunch/dinner wise."
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.17,"Super good and friendly service. For brunch, the Nashville hot chicken and waffles are excellent. Dinner, get the fried chicken with smoked honey and greens. The best, freshest fried chicken I've ever had. Other greats include shrimp and grits, biscuits and jam, and the hummingbird cake. Oh and sweet tea, get the sweet tea, too. Just went tonight and it was packed around 8pm, not bad at 7pm. Really a wonderful gem in the neighborhood wish them the best and many years of success."
6/27/2018,20180627,5,4.17,"Great food! Great service! Collard greens were perfectly seasoned, not too salty and very flavorful with ham hock. Chicken arrived hot and crispy. Biscuits heavenly."
6/28/2018,20180628,4,4.17,"Luella was just what I needed. It's definitely a twist on your regular soul food fare because it influenced with creole style. All my food was fresh and prepared nicely to take home which is nice because sometimes you just want to have a nice meal in the comfort of your home. The staff was friendly and made sure to update me on the progress of my order. This is my second time here and I will definitely come back. This time I tried the creole catfish with arugula, jerk mac and cheese, greens and the cornbread. I expected the mac to have a little more kick but it was still good and creamy. The fish was probably my favorite and it pair so nice with the light dressed arugula. It portion was nice which I was hoping for so I could take some for lunch the next day."
6/29/2018,20180629,5,4.17,"Still the best, after all these years. Great Southern cooking, fresh ingredients, made with passion. The Po Boy selection varies between shrimp, oyster, and softshell crab. ALL are incredible; large portions w/yummy seasoned fries. The fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk and fried to perfection. Shrimp and grits? Come here for these. My true love are the collard greens - truly the best I've ever had. You can't go wrong with any selection on the menu. You get what you pay for - the BEST."
7/1/2018,20180701,4,4.17,This has been on my list of places to go to for a while. My sister wanted a soul food restaurant that we haven't been before to celebrate her birthday. I suggested brunch at Luella's and she was sold. We were a group of 15 so I was worried about how everything would go but the staff was great.The majority of the group had either the buttermilk or Nashville chicken & waffles. I had the shrimp & grits. We all enjoyed our meals! Will definitely come back to try the dinner menu.
7/1/2018,20180701,5,4.17,Went today for brunch and loved it. The food was amazing and the service was great.We had Shrimp and Grits and Biscuits and Andouille Sausage Gravy. Both were incredible and filling. We also had the sweet tea and beneits for dessert. The prices are very inexpensive for the quality of food and they had a great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!
7/2/2018,20180702,5,4.18,"I had been wanting to go to Luella's for some time and finally made it there this past weekend. All I can say is that it was well worth the wait! The hospitality and service were exceptional and the food... so good! If you haven't had the opportunity to go, I highly recommend it."
7/7/2018,20180707,5,4.18,"Amazing, creative, high quality food. Cute and understated interior and a crafty menu."
7/9/2018,20180709,4,4.18,"I can't remember where I first saw or heard about this place but I've wanted to come here for quite some time now.The decor and atmosphere are warm and inviting with excellent natural light coming from the big windows at the entrance.The staff was welcoming and treated me like regular on my initial visit. Luella's has become a much stop spot on my trips back to Chicago.The food is delicious and has the southern home cooked flavor. You feel like you need to try everything on the menu to make sure you're not missing out on something. A few of my favorites as I've made my way down the menu;The Chicken Gumbo had the perfect amount of heat for me with a good dark roux. The chicken itself has a good flavor and moist.The Mississippi Tamales have a great zest. Once again, not too spicy, something everyone should be able to enjoy. The braised beef is tender and seasoned well. The corn dough has been dry on one, but the chili is good and helps keep the corn mix moist.The Creole Catfish is another signature dish at Luella's. That sauce is to die for, and the catfish is cooked and seasoned thoroughly.For sides, you can't go wrong with the Collard Greens and Buttermilk Biscuits and Jam. These both hold up on their own, so have you try them.Like I said Luella's has become a must stop for me when I'm Chicago."
7/16/2018,20180716,5,4.18,"Upon arriving at this hidden gem with some friends we didn't know what to expect since we basically looked it up and it looked good. When we walked through the door I had mixed feelings, but after walking in and looking at the menu I starting leaning more towards liking this establishment. A women came in and greeted us, very nice woman, not sure if she's the owner but she was very attentive. Now I ordered the smoked jerk chicken Mac and cheese, and the creole catfish and my friends ordered the shrimp and grits, and chicken gumbo as well as the Mississippi hot tamales and my good was perfect, I loved every bit of it and my friends were all equally happy. In fact my girlfriend wouldn't stop eating my catfish because it was so good. Great atmosphere, great food, great service, and it has that warm southern feel to it, I will be back!"
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.18,"We were visiting from out of town and my daughter wanted some soul food. We checked Yelp reviews and saw this place was highly rated. After eating there I can see why. My daughter loved it so much she wanted to go back. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was perfect for a date night. I will definitely return. We had the gumbo, Mac n cheese, greens, fried chicken, Hummingbird cake and Beignets. Everything was delicious."
7/21/2018,20180721,4,4.18,"Friendly service with delicious southern food. The wait was a little bit longer than expected however the food was worth the wait. We had the shrimp and grits, biscuits, and cornbread - all of it tasted good and leftovers reheated were delicious too. Would definitely visit again!"
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.18,"Wow just wow! We came here for brunch on Sunday @ 10am. Since there are no rezzies, we wanted to get here at opening to snag a table for 9. Luckily, we were one of the first patrons and had no problem getting a large table. Quick note - no waiter service, so you place your order first, grab your silverware, napkins, water and bring back to your table. They may have been short staffed today since we also had to go back up to the counter for coffee refills and if you want cream, they'll pour it for you at the counter. The lady at the counter was very sweet and welcoming. Let's get down to bidness and talk about the food! The fried chicken was ahhh-mazing! Crispy, tasty, juicy - how do they do it? Even the chicken breast was juicy. The shrimp and grits had a lot of flavor. Hubby got that but I think I probably ate 1/4 of his grits - they were that good. I got the bourbon French toast and my daughter said it tasted like gooey butter cake. It was very buttery and just the right amount of sweet. My youngest got the pimento burger and wished that there was more cheese on it. We also tried the biscuits and the corn bread. Both were good but the biscuits were a bit dry. Overall, we were blown away by the fried chicken, shrimp and grits and the bourbon French toast. We can't wait to come back to try the dinner entrees."
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.18,All i can say is GOD BLESS LUELLA. the fried chicken with smoked honey and collard greens is to die for. If I were to have fried chicken at one place for the rest of my life at chicago it would probably be here. Then get that chicken smothered in hot sauce nashville style on a waffle for brunch and I could die happy. So damn good. Their French toast is amazing too.
7/28/2018,20180728,4,4.18,"Omg! This is quality food! I ordered honey with fried chicken and collard greens. Also ordered corn bread with honey butter. Very delicious! My husband ordered gumbo and he said it was flavorful. My nephew ordered pimiento burger and was very impressed as he doesn't normally see that in other restaurant menu. Would I come back? Yes, I would!"
8/2/2018,20180802,5,4.19,Best chicken I've had in my entire life. The honey. The greens. The Mac & cheese. The beignets. It's an experience. Thank you.
8/5/2018,20180805,3,4.18,"Went on Sunday- brown sugar french toast: very dry as if it was not soaked enough in egg mixture- southern benetict: very under seasoned, the sauce had little to no flavor- fried chicken and waffle: flavor was fine- beignets: standardAtmosphere was niceStaff continued to walk by asking if we were done about 5 or so minutes after we got our food"
8/7/2018,20180807,5,4.19,"I actually stopped in here to get out of the rain, and boy, am I glad I did. Ended up ordering the shrimp and grits with iced tea, and it's the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. Incredibly creamy grits, yet with just the right texture. The shrimp were meaty, perfectly cooked, and served in the most amazing savory gravy! (I'd really like to get that recipe.) The staff were friendly and helpful.It's a very comfortable casual eating place - go up to the counter and order and then they'll bring it to your table when it's ready.I want to try the buttermilk chicken next."
8/8/2018,20180808,5,4.19,"The best and most flavorful gumbo I've ever had, could not stop eating it. SO good. The beignets were soft on the inside with a nice crust on the outside and were quite tasty. It's true, the customer service was a bit belabored, but it seemed more that the front register person was overwhelmed (not rude or anything). I recommend this place highly. Thanks, Luella's!"
8/16/2018,20180816,4,4.19,"Not a cheap menu but worth the buck. No line no wait. Food was prompt and hot. The absolute best shrimp and grits. Oh my, what a delicious piece of creole catfish, crunchy and flavored, about 8 oz. The customer service was great. Easy to find parking, clean facility with great music. This spot tops it off as a BYOB & there is a liquor store 3 blocks away. 1 star was lost because the beignets weren't astounding. The arugula salad that comes with the catfish has the most disgusting dressing on it, please substitute that side or decrease the price for that dish."
8/16/2018,20180816,5,4.19,"DO NOT COME HERE! There are few enough seats as it is, and Luella's is just too popular!I would eat here every day if I lived closer. And if it wouldn't make my heart leap out of my chest. I'm tired of the old bromide about food being ""made with love,"" but it's true here. It's like you went to your grandmother's house for dinner -- assuming your grandmother is a wonderful old southern lady.I'm a fan of shrimp and grits, and Luella's do not disappoint. The portion seems small at first, but the more you eat, the more you realize it's just enough. The shrimp is perfectly cooked, the grits are creamy, and the sauce is amazing. The fried chicken, on the other hand, is huge. Half a chicken, crispy, crunchy, and juicy, served with collards and a pot of honey. The mac n cheese used to come with braised short rib but now it comes with jerk chicken -- either way it's amazing and incredibly filling. Whatever you order, get some biscuits or corn bread -- you won't be disappointed.It's counter service, which fits in perfectly with the style of cooking. You wanna pay for food, or you wanna pay for nice linens and fancy servers? I thought so. You order at the counter and pick up your own utensils and glass of water. When your food is ready, someone in the family will bring it out. Your food is ready when your food is ready. You want it fast or you want it good? I thought so. Don't hassle the woman at the counter. She's dealing with you and with Grubhub and with the kitchen. Treat her like you would your cousin, unless you don't like your cousin, then treat her better."
8/17/2018,20180817,5,4.19,"Luella's has the best shrimp po' boy I have had outside of Louisiana! The french bread is always crisply toasted and fluffy. The shrimp is perfectly seasoned and the remoulade sauce is dynamite. I have ordered from there many times and have always been completely satisfied with my meal. The beignets are quite good too, usually piping hot even after delivery time. They could use a little more sugar but we always add are own. I plan on having some this weekend, can never go wrong with Luella's!"
8/21/2018,20180821,5,4.19,"Love! Been here a couple of times for both eating in and take out. All the items ordered were great and not to mention friendly service too! My favorites are the gumbo, ambrosia (please excuse my spelling) salad, and beignets. Luella's now my frequent visit spot in Lincoln Square neighborhood - no frill , just great southern food!"
8/23/2018,20180823,5,4.19,"Shrimp and grits better than grandma makes! I'm definitely going back next time I'm in the neighborhood to try the fried chicken. The owner was kind, and the food was great! Enjoyed the sweet tea. Will try the beignets next time!"
8/26/2018,20180826,5,4.19,"The SHRIMP AND GRITS! Get them! Oh my... so delicious, cooked perfect, flavors on point. There aren't enough words to describe how amazing this dish is. I would order again and again. Also tried the gumbo, cornbread (delish) and chicken w honey (insanely good!). Highly recommend if you are in the area!!"
8/30/2018,20180830,4,4.19,Best southern food I have had so far in Chicago! The service was very friendly and attentive. The shrimp and grits were on point packed with flavor I didn't need to add anything to it as it was seasoned perfectly! My only suggestion would be that they have a few more options on the menu. But I loved it and it was AWESOME that the place was BYOB!!!!
9/1/2018,20180901,1,4.19,One of the longest wait times! My husband and I waited over an hour for our food! By the time it came I lost my appetite... so disappointed.
9/9/2018,20180909,5,4.19,Food was fantastic and the small space had a nice vibe to it. I had the tamale casserole and a side of collard greens. Portions were on the small side but very tasty.
9/15/2018,20180915,5,4.19,I decided to try this place out after reading reviews. It did not disappoint. They make their corn bread to order. Fantastic little place an the food is hearty.
9/17/2018,20180917,5,4.19,"Ended up coming here because the original place we were gonna go to happened to be close. Probably the best stroke of luck I've ever had because Luella's is amazing, definitely the best fried chicken in Chicago. It's a little pricey but way way worth the price. It's absolutely made fresh to order and the taste speaks for itself. No meat will be left on the bone here. Someone in our group also got the Mac n cheese and the Mississippi tamale and both were very good. But of course the chicken was the shining star. Will be coming back and will be telling everyone i know about this spot"
9/18/2018,20180918,5,4.19,"Southern comfort on the north side of Chicago. The shrimp po boy was delicious and heartwarmingly nostalgic. I think the breading on the fried shrimp was cornmeal or cornmeal mix. When I was younger, my grandmother always prepared fried fish in cornmeal. But, I digress. We also had the smoked jerk chicken mac and cheese. My best friend said ""it tastes like they threw the mac and cheese on the bbq grill."" And, she totally loved it. I took a small sample (because my lactose intolerance won't let me live my life to the fullest) and had the same sentiment. We had beignets for dessert. Now, I must say, if you've had the tasty treat from the famous spot in New Orleans, you may be biased. I didn't prefer the beignets, but my date loved them. However, Luella's is so cute. It has a southern charm that's really hard to duplicate in big cities."
9/20/2018,20180920,2,4.19,"I was a customer back when this place first opened and it was fine until I started getting overcooked food and undercooked food. It's been at least a year since I last ate here, but tonight I decided to give them another chance....my shrimp po'boy is horrible. Dry and extremely overcooked with about 10 fries to accompany it for a total of $25."
9/21/2018,20180921,5,4.19,"Ummmmmm, yes please and thank you! Being a South sider I was hella skeptical of coming to the North side to get some soul food, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the shrimp and grits and wanted to order another 'round, but I had no place to put it. The only downfall is it's not that may seats for us to dine in but we lucked up. Also, I am sad to report that they tried it with the mac-n-cheese and for the culture I can't support their gentrified efforts of mac-n-cheese. Other than that I will come back but not for the mac!"
9/29/2018,20180929,4,4.19,"A fun little southern joint that will hit the spot if you're in the right mood!I ordered the following for takeout:- Buttermilk fried chicken- Skillet cornbread with honey butter- Hummingbird cake The highlight was definitely the fried chicken. Very flavorful seasoning, and delightfully juicy. It made me wish I had eaten it fresh, in the restaurant. Next up would be the hummingbird cake, which was a donut-style cake, which was a fun little treat. Cornbread was decent, but I have to wonder if it would have been better had I eaten in the restaurant, where it would have been served in a skillet.Didn't have a chance to look around the restaurant since I was just quickly running in and out, but it looked pretty cozy, and the cashier was very friendly."
10/3/2018,20181003,5,4.19,"This is my newest addiction! The food here is so amazing and good to my soul! Surprisingly, despite the growing demand here the staff is so sweet and accommodating and does not get frustrated by customers who are rude or don't follow the seating rules. Love this place! Highly recommend it!"
10/5/2018,20181005,5,4.19,We decided to check this place out and I'm so glad we did! We ordered the following:Fried chicken with collard greensFried Catfish with arugula saladside of Mac and CheeseBoneless fried chicken with friesBeignetsEverything was super delicious! We will definitely be coming back!!
10/14/2018,20181014,5,4.2,"We came here as a Birthday gathering among friends on 9-29-18 a Saturday evening. In our party, there were 5 adults. The birthday girl and I had the same meal which was the Creole Catfish very good because I love catfish, the sauce was too spicy for my delicate taste buds. Thank goodness for the arugula side salad which helped tone down the burning and the birthday girl was nice enough to share her buttermilk biscuits which were so large the jam & honey butter also helped tone down the burning. We also had the sweet tea & water along with our meals. I have never eaten Creole food before so trying to find something to eat that is not too spicy. So I decided to have the catfish knowing that wouldn't be too spicy it was the Creole sauce that put it over the top and I didn't want to insult the chef's cooking by complaining. My sister had the Chicken Gumbo and she loved it, the other two gentlemen both had the Buttermilk  Fried Chicken and they also loved their meals. The portions come on small size metal trays our table was nice we sat up in front and it started to get busy. I will be back because we were so full that we didn't stay for dessert. But I wanted a slice of the cake. So, I'll do that on my time. I loved the food I'll be back to try something else."
10/14/2018,20181014,5,4.2,"The best shrimp and grits ever! The grits are so creamy, shrimps are cooked to perfection and the sauce is to die for. Run by a lovely family this place is a must for those who enjoy southern food. The biscuits and cornbread are heavenly and made fresh. Oh and the ice tea was just yum. A must visit!!"
10/15/2018,20181015,5,4.2,"First off let me start by saying I love restaurant that specializes in southern foods. The first dish I tried (creole catfish) was amazing so I tried another meal from the menu. Next was the shrimp and grits and the Mac and cheese. The grits were perfectly creamy as I learned they should be on my recent trip to North Carolina. The shrimp were huge and the sauce absolutely delicious. Every table I passed when I entered had the fried chicken. The owner (I'm assuming) came out and spoke highly of the chicken sooooo I ordered that too. I owe that owner an apology. She saw my reaction to the first bite and heard me say ""*%#¥ that's good"" lol. We both laugh as we exchanged the quick glance before adding their smoked honey to the chicken. That's not it... I had the cornbread, beignets and hummingbird cake. Wow, wow and WOW!!! Like I said in the beginning, I LOVE restaurants that specializes in southern foods. Everything was a hit! Last but not least, the homemade sweet tea somehow just went well with EVERYTHING. If I had to make a suggestion for just one meal to have on your visit from everything I had it would be:-Shrimp and grits -Sweet tea-hummingbird cakeSN: I didn't eat everything I ordered. There were of leftovers taken home."
10/20/2018,20181020,5,4.2,"This place exceeded my expectations by far ! I've never had French toast as good as it was here , I seriously didn't want to share it lol. The staff was very respectful and polite and the atmosphere was just right. EverythingI had here was great and I'm very glad I finally decided to stop in. Thank you"
10/21/2018,20181021,4,4.2,"While browsing IG BlackPeopleEats, I came across an offering for a 4 course meal for Sweetest Day. Although I do not celebrate the day, I thought it would be a great deal for a girls brunch. They provided a sample menu of some of their top sellers...-Beignets-Shrimp and grits-Brown sugar french toast-Buttermilk fried chicken with savory wafflesThe food was off the chain and the chef was very nice. Keep in mind this is a BYOB and we did not know that, but thankfully, as soon as we found out, we were able to walk around the corner to buy some champagne.I highly recommend this place and will definitely come back."
10/27/2018,20181027,5,4.2,"Decided to check this place out and decided to place an order for a Shrimp Po'Boy Sandwich. I also placed an order for Beignets to come out after I was done with my sandwich. Well the sandwich turned out great, shrimps had perfect amount of seasoning and the dressing and toppings were just right. The beignets came right after and were absolutely delicious. Service was also very attentive throughout our total time here and I will definitely be back soon."
11/2/2018,20181102,3,4.2,"Nothing to write home about!I've wanted to check them out for a few years now. I'm never in the area, but while out costume shopping last wknd I decided to drop in. We arrived about 1pm on Saturday, they had a full house. The place is small, 1 side was filled w/a large party, the other side was for tables for the patrons that weren't with the party. We walked in clueless as to whether we get seated then order or order and sit. There weren't any hostesses to help. So we walked to the cashier and she explained we order then sit. We reviewed both lunch & dinner menus, decided we wanted dinner entrees, only to be told they were only on the breakfast/ lunch menu until 3pm. ROLLS EYES, but lucky me I still got the regular fried chicken that I wanted from the dinner menu, but we couldn't try the catfish. So my friend settled for the shrimp & grits. After about 20 mins or so the food comes out looking delicious. It was freshly prepared. Kudos there. But it was BLAND CITY. I had to salt & hot sauce everything I touched. My friend felt the same about her shrimp & grits. She also felt the portion was very small for $16. For me its definitely 1 of those been there done that kind of place. I wouldn't go back, unless it was to try the biscuits & gravy & I'm sure it ain't worth the 1hr drive. Service was a 4. BYOB is a definite plus!Clean facilities."
11/2/2018,20181102,5,4.2,Saw this place on TV. Had to stop in and so very glad that we did. They change around the menu every 3 months. Do not know why -- this one is fantastic. Got the jerk man and cheese to split. That did not work out so well. It was a fight between us to get the last portion in the pan. This place is a must.
11/3/2018,20181103,5,4.2,"I've heard amazing things about Luella's and it's rated as one of the best restaurants in Lincoln Square so of course I had to try this out! Since the Budlong just closed, I have to find somewhere else for my fried chicken craving... RIP Budlong... And Luella's did the trick! Luella's is a fast casual style restaurant with a decent amount of seating. It's about the same size as Crisp in Lakeview. I ordered carry out on Friday around 5:30pm and there wasn't many people there. I ordered the Fried Chicken and the Mac and Cheese as a side. The Mac and Cheese was $8 as a side, but the portion size was huge. There was a ton of flavor, it was not overly rich where it makes you sick to your stomach, and it was hot & creamy. The Mac and Cheese had a good amount of pepper in it so it was has a little kick to it for it's southern fare. The fried chicken was very good! It was juicy, crispy, and the portion was fairly big. I was happily surprised that my food was hot when I got home. It's about a 7 minute walk from Luella's and I got there about 5 minutes late. So that was a nice surprise for takeout. Luella's was pricey as I paid $26, but you pay for what you get. And I thought the quality was very good! I will definitely be eating at Luella's more often!"
11/3/2018,20181103,1,4.2,"This was my second visit in about two years. The first time I found it just okay. This time was very poor. The shrimp po' boy was so salty and garlicky that I gave up after a couple of bites. It was also way too much bread for a po' boy. The gumbo was thick and had a nice spice to it and a good portion of chicken and sausage. But the flavor was muddy and bland. The biscuit was okay but, like the whole meal, unpleasantly salty (and I like salt). Why they don't serve butter with the biscuit is odd and sort of in keeping with the general stinginess of the service set up. Also, very sticky table. And the window table is fixed to the floor, so it's nearly impossible to get into the chair on the window side. Lastly, the meal cost nearly $40, crazy prices for comfort food with a low level of service. I hope they make some changes and keep going, but I won't be back."
11/5/2018,20181105,5,4.2,"Holy. Cow. THIS is some authentic southern food. We came in, and it immediately felt like a warm, comfort food vibe that we were looking for on a cold, rainy Sunday night. It is a walk up counter where you order and find a place to sit. We ordered the gumbo and the fried chicken as well as the jerk mac n cheese. We took one bite of the mac n cheese and were in heaven. It was smokey and so cheesy made with a thicker type of pasta called orecchiette. The pasta was so rich and creamy that is was almost similar to the thickness of a gnocchi. The jerk chicken was so tender and flavorful, we were literally drooling over it. It came with a cripsy fried pork rind on top that added some crunchy texture to an already delicious dish. The gumbo was excellent. It comes out with a plate of rice and they pour the gumbo on top. It was seasoned perfectly and not too salty. It came with a good portion of sausage and chicken to accompany the creamy broth. The fried chicken was definitely a stand out dish. You could tell they take the time to bread the chicken as its ordered because it is so perfectly crispy and not soggy in the least bit. whatever seasoning they put in the bread crumbs is absolutely to die for. On top of that, they serve it with smoked honey in the cutest bumble bee hive pot, that just adds that extra sweet layer on top of the chicken, really bringing the dish full circle. We couldn't stop raving about how good everything was. it was hard not to finish it all even though we were STUFFED. we will definitely be back here."
11/8/2018,20181108,4,4.2,"I've been to Luella's twice for brunch and there's a lot to like. For my second visit, we strolled in around 2:55pm and it looked like they were about to close, but we were seated and fed without even a hint of attitude.Here's what I've eaten/tasted:Biscuits and gravy - these were delicious and a great value at $9. I couldn't discern all of the different seasoning, but there was a hint of spice that complemented the other flavors. Very very good dish.Side of biscuits - the biscuits on their own were very good too. They were softy and flakey and buttery. Beignets - I loved them, among my favorites in Chicago.Cornbread - very good.Chicken and waffles - the chicken on its own was a winner but the waffle temperature was off. If the waffle had come out hot, the dish would have been a lot better.Shrimp and grits - I didn't taste the shrimp, but the grits were good although a little too salty.Pancakes - not bad, but not my favorite. I wouldn't order them again.So though there were a few missteps, on the whole I've enjoyed the food a lot. And they've opened a location in Bucktown!"
11/11/2018,20181111,5,4.2,PHENOMENAL!!!! Went there for dinner and had the fried chicken with collard greens and honey and the jerk chicken Mac and cheese with a side of biscuits with jam! Everything was so so good! If you're looking for family made fried chicken...this is your place! Absolutely bomb!
11/11/2018,20181111,4,4.2,"Originally saw this restaurant on IG and the review was positive. Had brunch with a small group on Sunday at 10am, we were trying to avoid the anticipated wait in line. However, it was raining pretty heavy so there wasn't a long line out the door. I had the waffle and chicken. Waffle had a good taste, had to ask for more syrup and the chicken was ok. Also ordered the cornbread with honey butter MY OH MY that was the best!!! Nothing like warm cornbread but topping it off with the honey butter was EVERYTHING! I will return in the future to try out other menu items."
11/17/2018,20181117,3,4.2,I went on a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded. The customer service was very good. The biscuits were very good. Some of the dishes were over salted but overall it was a good experience.
11/22/2018,20181122,5,4.2,"Went on Thanksgiving, and they had a special Thanksgiving Menu set. Got their Turkey with gravy, topped with an over easy egg. Came with a biscuit and collard greens. Thought it was fantastic. I'm from Texas, so quality southern cooking is hard to come by in Chicago, but Luella's didn't disappoint. Definitely going to return to check out their regular menu."
11/26/2018,20181126,4,4.2,My sister and brother in law rave about this place and it's good Love their biscuits and butter Then ordered grits with Shrimp with gravy It was really good with great buttery texture and excellent taste Loved the great taste and superb service there
12/5/2018,20181205,5,4.2,Came here with a group for Supper Club. We had almost everything on the menu and loved every dish. Just fantastic.
12/9/2018,20181209,1,4.19,Jerk Mac n cheese tasted funky. The chicken was fatty and the noodles weren't fully cooked. The sides with the fried chicken were very small. Definitely not worth the $50.
12/10/2018,20181210,3,4.19,"We were really excited to try this place because the pictures on their website and Yelp looked soooo good, and being from Texas, we miss good Southern food up here. When we arrived the place was packed, it smelled fabulous, and as we were trying to decide what to order the couple behind us said, you can't go wrong, everything is amazing, so all good signs. We were, unfortunately, let down with the outcome. To start with the good, the cream cheese grits were, in fact, amazing, the mac n cheese (plain side) was really delicious, and the biscuits were buttery and soft. The burger, however, was incredibly overcooked and dry. The patties tasted like a bad fast food burger. It was a huge let down because the picture is so beautiful on the website. The shrimp po-boy was overall really nice, the bread was perfect po-boy french bread, super soft and flaky, the remoulade was tasty and the shrimp were as well. Unfortunately, the shrimp were also pretty overcooked and rubbery, and the breading all fell off, which really takes away from the whole sandwich.Additionally, the food took a very long time to come out and we heard two other tables also asking how much longer it was going to be. They had a TON of takeout orders while we were there, so I wonder if they just got slammed in the moment, or don't appropriately accept takeout orders at a good pace to coincide with how many guests they have dining in. I also wonder if because they were so slammed, it affected the quality of the food because they were trying to juggle too many orders at once, therefore overcooking our items. Overall, I can find great biscuits and mac n cheese at other restaurants whose entrees we know are excellent, so we probably won't be inclined to give this place another shot. The only item that may draw me back specifically are those cream cheese grits... because dang, they were really good."
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.19,Great brunch spot. Bring you own mimosa stuff. We brought A jug of Orange juice and 3 bottles of champagne. No fees!!!! The shrimp and grits are amazing. The best I've ever had. Benedict with pork was very tender and yummy. The chicken and Waffles are a huge portion and spicy!!! Not for those those who can't tolerate heat. I would say a 6/10 for spiciness. Small place but accommodated our group of 6.
12/11/2018,20181211,5,4.19,"I can't believe I didn't write this review the moment we walked out the door. I certainly intended to - it was that good! We ate at Luella's this weekend and the experience was amazing. The food was fantastic - maybe the best Mac and cheese ever and I'm basically a connoisseur lol - but beyond that the service was incredible. Our dining experience started with a crabby 7 year old. Luella's staff took notice and asked if they could bring him a PBJ biscuit while we waited for our food in an effort to cheer him up. The young man who did this also talked to him and tried to get him in a better mood, then told me he has an 8 year old so he understood. Instead of my crabby kid being a burden they tried to help us out. Later another worker stopped to talk to my 5 year old about soccer after seeing him run to the bathroom. The food is the incredible southern home cooked family fare that I certainly love, and the environment felt like home. Every staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We're so excited to have finally tried Luella's and will without a doubt be back in the near future. That cornbread is calling my name!!"
12/12/2018,20181212,5,4.2,"Great place!!! It's definitely more of a casual place, but it's cozy and great to bring friends to. The food is absolutely delicious and they let you bring your own bottles of wine or champagne without charging you any corkage fees. (Sometimes these can be $50 or more) The shrimp and grits is by far one of the best I've ever had and so was the the chicken and waffles. Food is a bit spicy if your sensitive to spicy food, but I'm not, so it was a plus. I also like that everything is self service and that the food comes out quick. 5 out of 5 stars. No complaints."
12/20/2018,20181220,4,4.2,"I came here on a Monday with a group of friends because it had been while since I had indulged in my love for fried chicken. This time I was craving something slightly more bougy than Popeye's.The food here is amazing and I feel like all their southern dishes were on-point! The highlights:   - Fried Chicken - crispy, juicy, and large serving sizes. Exactly what I was looking for! Shrimp   - Shrimp and Grits - just the right level of creaminess. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, not overdone (which is so easy to-do).   - Cornbread - This was so unexpected. Cornbread's one of those seemingly mundane things, but Luella's blew me away. I am still thinking about that golden crispy crust!The service was fast and it was pretty easy to find seating (this was for a group of 5 on Monday @ 7 pm). I definitely want to come back and try out other things on the menu! Plus it's BYOB!"
12/21/2018,20181221,4,4.19,Great place for some quality southern food! It's a casual restaurant where you are free to seat yourself after ordering and paying at the front counter. The jerk chicken Mac n' cheese is amazing but I was a bit disappointed by the gumbo which was served lukewarm.
12/22/2018,20181222,5,4.2,"This is my second time coming in and I have done takeout both times since I am within a 5 minute walk away. So this review continues to be for ""food only"". I placed an order online and got there right at 12:50pm and it was a packed house. It looked like a party of like 10 people on the left of the restaurant and seating for other guests on the right. Like all of the other reviews say, it's a fast casual place where you order at the front, grab your utensils and a seat, and wait for your food. It looked like they were actually serving out the food and you didn't have to go up front to grab it. So it's like a Nando's Peri Peri or Green Street Smoked Meats. But the place is BYOB. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles to compare to what I will be having in Nashville next weekend. The chicken and waffles were amazing and I think they are the best I've had in the city so far! To compare, I have also had chicken and waffles at Longman & Eagle, Fork, Hutch, The Delta, and AJ Hudson's (meh). The chicken was hot, juicy, and spicy. The spice was not nearly as spicy when compared to a Hattie B's (Nashville), Southern (St. Louis), or the Budlong's. The liege waffle was heaven and almost candy-like. You can definitely taste the caramelized sugar and butter so it was pretty rich. Price is still pretty expensive, however, they serve a large portion of food and the quality is there. There are so many items that I will have to try like the catfish, pimento cheeseburger, shrimp n grits, french toast, southern benedict, and biscuits & gravy. Southern continues to be one of my go-to places in Lincoln Square!"
1/2/2019,20190102,5,4.2,"I grew up in the south, love southern cooking, and this is some of the best I've ever had. The biscuits and jam are the best I've ever had. The brisket mac and cheese, chicken gumbo, cornbread, and catfish are all contenders for the best I've ever had in their respective categories. The chef here is phenomenal. A true cook that simply knows how to make any dish well. We hired him for our wedding, because we're addicted to this place, and the guests wouldn't shut up about the food. We asked him to come up with some appetizers for our cocktail hour and he whipped up several things that never appear on his menus, some of them (like muffuletta) I don't usually like but when he made them it was incredible. Also he's simply a nice guy, supporting his family, he takes his staff to New Orleans annually to connect with the food, it's just a fantastic place to eat and a fantastic group to support. Do yourself a favor and eat here (and then check out his Luella's Gospel Bird chicken spot, too)."
1/6/2019,20190106,1,4.19,"Came to Luella's on a Sunday afternoon and it was a DISASTER from start to finish. First of all, the cashier didn't get our order right. I distinctly said shrimp and grits and he ignored me because he thought I was still trying to choose. If he wasn't sure, he should have asked me after we finished our order. Why would I not order any food?!! He should have at least double-checked. My husband noticed that shrimp & grits wasn't on the receipt so I went up to order it and it took AGES for just TWO people in front of me to have their orders taken before I could get up to the register. We then sat down for the LOOOOOONG wait for our food. We are still waiting right now in fact, as I write this review. It has now been 25 minutes since we placed our first order. We ordered coffee which we got right away, but we also ordered beignets and boy, it sure would have been nice to have them with our coffee!!! But instead we are sitting here like idiots with just coffee and no beignets. AND NO FOODA server also tried to bring us two orders of fried chicken and waffles. Neither of us ordered that dish. When we said it wasn't what we ordered he left and then returned with a manager who seemed insistent. I had to show him our receipt (sorry, RECEIPTS PLURAL) to prove that we didn't order that. No apologies were made for trying to bring us the wrong food. No one has updated us on our orders either or why they are taking so long. Ok., our food has FINALLY arrived. What irks me is that this type of service issue is SO easy to deal with. Set the expectation that it will be a 30 minute wait for the food and no one would be upset. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MOREThe beignets we were eagerly awaiting arrived with the food... or so we thought. At first, they put down 2 orders of them (we had ordered only 1). They then tried to leave us one of them, but another server or a manager said they were designated for another table. They said ours were coming out soon. That was 10 minutes ago and we still have no beignets and we are now nearly done with our food. The food was decent, but what does it matter? We will NEVER be back.Oh, and the prices do not justify the food AT ALL and certainly not when you factor in the HORRIFIC service. My husband was so hungry that we went to Taco In A Bag next door afterwards which was phenomenal, cheap, and FAST. I'm not saying food has to come out right away. But there's no table service at Luella's. When you don't have table service, you set the expectation that food will not take that long. I honestly have never had an experience this horrible anywhere and I don't understand all the positive reviews here. Do yourself a favor and go get a taco in a bag instead. Go ANYWHERE else!!"
1/18/2019,20190118,4,4.19,"Really good and fresh food but I miss the way they used to serve the side of mac & cheese. Not a fan of the way they are serving it now, baked and topped with cheese, which I know sounds even better but it simply isn't. I used to treat myself to the old mac and cheese with bread crumbs almost every week if not twice a week."
1/23/2019,20190123,5,4.19,"I don't understand some of these reviews on bland food. The food here is anything but bland. My foodie gals and I came here for brunch over the weekend and we left frog style - full on bloated and full from all of the deliciousness that we just ate. We ordered most of the dishes so that we can all share and relish in the awesomeness of all the food. This is by order of what I personally loved:Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles - the is amazing. Just the right amount of heat (but can be too hot for some people, my mom included). The chicken was juicy (mind you I had a thigh) and the crispiness on the outside was just delicious. The waffles get soggy, but they still have that awesome hot sauce on them so they're still good no matter what. Shrimp and Grits - We ordered two of these and thank god we did because we killed both of them. The sauce was a bit salty, but I didn't mind. The grits were fantastic, I am usually not a fan, but these were great. I guess mixing in cream cheese is what makes them yummy/ The shrimp tail shell is still on, so that's my only complaint. You have to use your hands to really get all the meat if you want to. Boudin Breakfast Sausage Patties - real sausage. absolutely delicious, you can taste the fennel throughout. It comes out looking like 2 meatballs and not flat patties, but they were so good so I didn't care. I could easily have ordered eggs and these two balls of joy and would have been happy. Beignets - fried dough with powdered sugar. They were lovely poofs of doughy goodness. You cannot go wrong with this. A sauce would have been nice, but they come nice and fresh as they are too. Sausage and Biscuits - this number is spicy and salty - two of my favorite combos, so I wouldn't mind. The few bites that I had were great, heavy, so I don't know how someone can eat all of it. Eggs Benedict with collard greens - love me some collared greens. I only had one bite of this since out of all the dishes it seemed kind of boring. It tasted good though, and the collared greens were great, but I wouldn't order this again just to eat for myself.French Toast - this tasted amazing ... but SWEET!! I don't know how anyone can finish this off and not be diabetic. It's great to share though, have a bite or two and be done and not diabetic! Service was great! I snapped at two of the waiters for trying to take away our chicken and waffles right away when there were a few waffle pieces left ... DUDE we will eat it!! HA. BYOB so yes we dabbed in some spirits, it's okay, it was brunch and after a heavy meal .. it didn't do anything :D You order everything at the back of the restaurant then grab your utensils, water and have a seat. What's nice their POS system easily allowed us to split the check and we paid one at a time. I would come back here in a heartbeat, AHHH love me some southern food."
1/26/2019,20190126,4,4.19,"11/10/18 French toast and fried chicken were awesome! Waffles had too much alcohol taste Simple atmosphere, okay seating, wasn't super busy1. Brown Sugar and Bourbon French Toast - housemade challah, bourbon maple2. Chicken and Waffles"
1/28/2019,20190128,5,4.19,"Food and service were spot on. We had a party of five and we each ordered something different. Everyone reported that their dish was fabulous. I had their hot chicken and waffles, French toast, and beignets. A bit gluttonous but so worth it. I highly recommend a visit."
2/6/2019,20190206,4,4.19,"I ventured with my husband to check out this North Side gem. My husband and I were warmly greeted when we walked in. You order your food at the counter and take a number and seat yourself. We went on Saturday around 5pm the crowd was picking up but we had a place to sit. I had:Sweet Tea- Tasty. 5/5Fried Chicken with Collard Greens- The breast, thigh wing portion was seasoned well, juicy, but the leg lacked flavor and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The collard greens lacked any flavor my husband said that Glory greens would be better, they had meat in the greens so I am confused as to where the flavor went it tasted like air, I was disappointed because I love greens and I expected flavor- would order again but very hesitant! Decent 3/5Corn Bread with Honey Butter- Was just ok, I wish I got the biscuit instead, I look for crispiness, flavor, and maybe sweetness in my corn bread and this corn bread missed the mark somewhat. It comes in a cute small cast iron skillet with honey butter on the side. Would not order again at a $5 price point I have had tasty $2 corn bread. OK 2/5Shrimp and Grits- organic grits with cream cheese and juicy tasty BBQ shrimp, it was good but not slap my mama good. I would order again but I wanted more flavor, more grease, the portion size was smaller than expected for a $16 price point. Grit have a different texture than regular grits. Decent 3/5.Beignets- Tasty and would order again. 4/5Hubby had:Chicken Gumbo- The roux was pretty tasty, I am somewhat of a gumbo snob my people are from Louisiana so I love a good and flavorful roux. The gumbo to rice ratio was a little off but my husband enjoyed it and said it was spicy and was sweating lol. I tasted it and it was delicious with good flavor This gumbo was a 3.5Biscuits with Homemade jamSweet Tea- He liked it tastyMac and Cheese side dish- Wasn't very seasoned it was just ok, does not have traditional macaroni noodles the cheese sauce was ok but this is not traditional baked artery clogging mac and cheese like grandma used to make- would not order againOverall it was a great experience and I would stop by here again"
2/9/2019,20190209,5,4.2,"I went on a busy Saturday evening and there was a small wait for a table and then small confusion about my ticket making it to the kitchen BUT the customer service was amazing and all the extra time just let me try majority of the yummy items on the menu. It's a slightly limited dinner menu but I like that because that means the chefs have the opportunity to master a few dishes instead of juggling 50 different entree options. Flip through my photos but heed my advice. GET THE SHRIMP AND GRITS. I almost didn't and I would have been devastated. I don't care if you don't eat grits they are mixed with cream cheese - creamy and delicious - and the sauce on top is divine. The Mac and cheese is to die for. The jam that comes with the biscuits I literally sucked off my fingers. It's delicious. Everything else was delicious but those were all notable. It's a BYOB restaurant. *we also received the catfish as a bonus dish and you eat the arugula, crab salad, and catfish in one bite. The batter was seasoned and crispy fried hard how a good piece of fried fish should be!! It was delicious."
2/10/2019,20190210,1,4.19,"Waited over an hour for our meal. Fried chicken and pimento cheese burger. Never apologized or even approached us regarding the long wait. Others came In after us and got their food. Maybe we fell through the cracks. Didn't feel like complaining then but thought I'd just let people know that if it happens to you then don't be surprised. Food was average maybe because of the experience but there are a ton of other ""soul food"" restaurants we can frequent. Won't be going back."
2/11/2019,20190211,3,4.19,"It was date night with the wife we were suppose to go to the boiler shrimp house in Skokie, the wait was an hour so we decided to venture out into the city I've driven by this place many of times, so we decided to go there, they ran out of chicken gumbo, what I wanted so I decided on a shrimp po boy and my wife got the fried chicken, and Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was good, the po boy was dry no flavor and also the Mac and cheese was bland again no flavor . Overall it was alright, a little expensive for not so good food."
2/13/2019,20190213,4,4.19,"Just go! You will not be disappointed. We were craving some good ""ole"" cooking. Everything was to die for- we indulged in the fried catfish, chicken, collard greens and beignets. Don't forget to sop that chicken in the honey ;)"
2/16/2019,20190216,4,4.19,"This place is very clean, nice music and a great atmosphere. The food is very good. We ordered the catfish, jerk chicken, corn bread and fried chicken and shared between the three of us. Although the corn bread wasn't good, we were also given biscuits on the house, Delicious!! Portions were very small especially $24 for one piece of catfish, no need for a take home container. The staff is friendly and inviting. Also, it's a BYOB! Parking not bad we actually found free parking. Overall very good and I'll go back."
2/24/2019,20190224,4,4.19,"The Pimento Burger was the best burger I've ever had. Buttery, toasty brioche bun, egg sunny side up, pimento cheese, double patty of Slater Farms dry aged burger. The fries are a bit over seasoned for my liking, but my date enjoyed them. I would like to come back with a bigger appetite and try the beignets."
3/4/2019,20190304,5,4.19,"Came here for brunch and it was such a cute restaurant! Staff was all so accommodating with our orders. My family and I can be kind of particular with our food! The staff was great and friendly! The food took about 45 minutes but the time flew with good company and it was worth it. The food was delicious. Chicken was juicy and crispy! The GRITS are bomb! I was craving grits and they came through. I added cheddar cheese but it even tasted great without the cheese. The sweet tea is perfect, not too sweet! The greens were also on point! Good quality food/flavors!"
3/9/2019,20190309,5,4.19,"Luella's is by far my fiancé and I's favorite restaurant in all of Chicago! We used to live in the area and would sometimes eat dinner and wake up the next morning and get brunch. Whenever we have friends in from out of town we take them to Luella's as well and they are completely blown away! We love the staff and the vibe of the restaurant. It's BYOB which is AWESOME and the food is simply the best we've ever had.When you go, you MUST go for brunch and you MUST get: Nashville hot chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and shrimp and grits! Eat your heart out and take home the leftovers. You won't be sorry"
3/10/2019,20190310,2,4.18,"The Pros:Customer ServiceIce TeaGritsBiscuits and JamThe Cons: The shrimp & grits were so SALTY it gave me a literal headache. It was hard to eat. The grits were nothing less than amazing and wish I just got the shrimp and grits without the sauce they pour over the top. The Mac and cheese had no flavor other than salt, salt, salt, and more salt. I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't worth the money or the hour drive"
3/21/2019,20190321,5,4.19,"SO GOOOOOOD. My mouth is literally salivating as a type out ""buttermilk fried chicken"" my goodness. That chicken was made by GOD herself I kid you not. The outside was perfectly salty with thee most phenomenal CRUNCH baby. When I took that first bite the chicken juice ran down my chin and I've never been less bothered by a bodily fluid before. The sweet tea was nice, fresh, n' perfectly sweet woweee. And that sweet and smoky honey? SWEET NECTAR FROM THE ANGELS UP ABOVE. The queen bee is SHOOK. On top of all this, the service is amazing- don't ever hesitate to come. I promise you will not regret it."

3/31/2019,20190331,1,4.18,"I'm doing this review SOLELY based on service and not food as I did not stick around long enough to order. Following are the reasons why:1. Walked in, was not greeted nor acknowledged by the staff. The place, while it had some dine-in patrons, was not what I would consider busy as there were various tables vacant. 2. There is a counter located in the back where you place your order. (Had to figure this out on my own as it was my first time here.) While standing in what I assumed was as a line to order, the cashier who was on the phone (maybe taking an order, not sure) simply said, ""I have a waitlist"". Up until this point, I still have not been offered a ""hello"", ""I'll be right with you"".... no sort of acknowledgement other than the cashier. I proceeded to add my name to the wait list anyway, although at this point I already felt uncomfortable being here. (I should highlight that the wait line is queued directly next to the expedite window where food comes out when ready.) There were two cooks that I could see and three order tickets. There was also an expeditor. For those unfamiliar, this person organizes food orders once ready so they can be delivered to corresponding tables which were being served by two wait staff.There was a huge lack of urgency. The expeditor should have been in the kitchen helping the cooks get orders out instead of standing there watching and waiting for food to be ready whilst casually being on his cell phone texting. This I could see as I'm sitting in the designated waiting area, literally behind him.The food looked amazing but decided not to stay and find out as the process was moving like molasses and up until this point, the customer service was subpar.I work in food industry, and by sitting there while I did, could see a variety of different ways for staff to be more efficient and speedy overall. If you are only interested in the food and don't care about service, wait time, etc then yes, I recommend you come kill an hour or two waiting here. Otherwise, I'd skip it.Ended up going across the street to Carbon Arc, was greeted immediately upon entering. Chicken and biscuits there were delicious.

4/1/2019,20190401,5,4.18,"Luella's is one of my go-to places in the whole city. You get the same quality each and every time. Each dish is packed with flavor and stays true to southern food roots. Chef Darnell takes lots of pride in presentation. I've ordered take out several times but always prefer to sit in the restaurant! It's a very casual experience with absolutely top-notch food. Shrimp and grits are a must-have. I also love the shrimp po-boy. Despite its huge size, it's somehow surprisingly light and crisp. The Gospel Bird recently opened and is just as high-quality!"
4/6/2019,20190406,3,4.17,"Luellas is an interesting venue. I would tag it ""Cajun "" more than southern comfort. I had the shrimp and grits. I was good but it didn't wow me. The Mac and cheese was pasta with cheese out the box and browned in the oven. My wife had Gumbo; once again pretty average. They had run out of collard greens which may have tipped my score upward . We probably will go back again. I want to taste a few other items. Luellas is in a great neighborhood . I liked the bare bone format of the venue. It is clean and the servers and cashier were friendly and helpful. However I don't think the locals are connoisseurs of "" Southern comfort "" food."
4/11/2019,20190411,4,4.17,"Came here for brunch with friends and our kids - 3 adults, 2 toddlers, and a baby. We sat at the long table with benches. Our food took what seemed like forever - especially with hangry antsy toddlers. But the food itself was so good (although very heavy - but we ordered all carbs). The Nashville Hot Chicken was delicious with the perfect amount of heat, and the waffle had some crunchy caramelization goin on. Shrimp and grits was good with the slightly spicy shrimp and the super creamy grits. Biscuits and gravy was a classic winner and the andouille gravy gave it a kick. To end the meal, we had the beignets, which were nice and fluffy!"

After one evening I was craving for a southern fried chicken. I ordered Gumbo (my all time favorite when I visit New Orleans). Fried Chicken and Beignets to go around $30++.Sad to say but my first time experience is a big disappointment.Our of 5 star here's my review per food.Gumbo - 3 Star. For some reason there's a flavor that's missing.Beignets - 3 Star. A little pricy for 3 pcs. The dough is a little flavorless. The powdered sugar is the only thing that put flavor on it.Chicken - 1 Star. Very oily and burned. I have to throw half of the chicken. I attached the pic.Overall is just 2 star. Will I come back? No. Will I recommend? No. Sorry. I hope you can improve these things or else you won't survive Lincoln Square area.

My son was so pleased with his French toast that he asked to meet the Chef lol... Chef Darnell came out to shake his hand and then came over to greet our table and thank us for patronizing! As an added bonus they were giving out freshly made pralines to all the mothers for mother's day and they were delicious too! The food was delicious, the staff was very pleasant, and the bathrooms were clean! So impressed with this place! I could eat here again and again and I plan to do just that!"

5/13/2019,20190513,3,4.16,"I came here yesterday for dinner with my companion. The place definitely had a nice Mothers Day crowd, yet we still were able to be seated in a timely fashion. You have to go up to the front counter and order your food, which was not a problem for me or my guest. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with greens and I also ordered the skillet baked cornbread. I'm telling you that food was delicious! The chicken was juicy down to the last drop, oh and the cornbread was buttery and fresh out of the oven. My guest ordered the grits with shrimp and the dish was quite filling. The shrimp where loaded with flavor and so we're the grits! We both had sweet tea, that came in mason jars. What more can you ask for on a Sunday evening? A good old fashion-style southern meal, with a young cooking staff with skills like they were born back in the day! We will definitely be returning.."
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.16,The food was really good! I had the Nashville chicken and waffles and it was sooo good. I like spicy food and I can tell you that it had a bit of heat. Nothing a few sips of water couldn't handle. The batter was sooo good and the waffles didn't need any additional syrup. I would definitely recommend this place again!
6/3/2019,20190603,3,4.16,"This review is for the shrimp &grits (16$) and beignets (box of 3 for 5$).I think it's definitely overpriced. The shrimp and grits came with 4 shrimp smh. The grits aren't grits that I'm used to but tasted good. Overall 8/10 for this item. But definitely NOT worth 16$ especially with the portion for to-go. Not sure if portions are different for dining in.The beignets were okay, I they we're filled with anything and I think would have been better if they had chocolate or raspberry inside. 6/10The menu is very very small for brunch which is on wknds. Meanwhile they're open for only dinner on weekdays. Not a lot of seating though, about 10-12 tables but wasn't super busy when we went Saturday morning"
6/14/2019,20190614,3,4.16,"Luella's! Came in around 11 on a Sunday and got a table ok. Short menu, but good choices to pick from. Our food was yummy- I had the chicken and waffles and my friend the French Toast. Our biggest issue was that they forgot our meal. After waiting about 40min (I had read the wait time was long but we started seeing other people who came in after us getting served) we asked and they had in fact forgotten. They were super apologetic and our food came out promptly after. Like I said, good food, rich, couldn't finish the whole thing. Definitely felt a little heavy, but I think that's what you get with this menu."
6/27/2019,20190627,5,4.16,"There's a reason why they call this food SOUL FOOD. I was in Milwaukee for a week and decided to take a day trip to Chicago. The drive was about an hour an a half away and I had to make a stop here. I heard great reviews from friends and thought why not try it for myself right? As soon as you walk in the Motown music calls you in and your already in a great mood. I was greeted right away and I decided to order the fried chicken plate with greens, side of Mac and cheese, and side of corn bread. I waited patiently for my food to arrive and as soon as I saw my food I was ready lol. The chicken is so flavor able and cooked with the right amount of crunchiness and the inside was not dry but perfect. The greens were great as well and the Mac and cheese is out of this world. The corn bread was good but I felt like it could be a little sweeter. Other than that this meal was so good, large portion and the ambiance of the place makes you feel like your at home. Next time your in Chicago make your way here this place will not disappoint!"
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.16,the biscuit was soooooo good !! the cornbread wasn't bad but the biscuit was surprisingly my favorite (and I don't like biscuits so the fact that I really like this biscuit versus the corn bread is saying a lot)but you have to try their dirty rice oh my god this is so good you have to try it they have veggie sausage in it and I swear to you it sounded like it would taste horrible but the way that they cook the sausage I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference to be honest and the way that they brown it and dice it up and mix it with the rice is out of this world if there are two things or name that three things that I would get on my next trip is definitely the biscuits; The mac & cheese; The dirty rice: and I would also add on my next trip is the chicken and the collar greens I didn't have the chance to try it on this trip but on the next trip I will.
7/13/2019,20190713,1,4.15,"I had high hopes based on the previous ratings. However, we asked a person who was leaving as we arrived and she said that ""they must have a new cook because it is nowhere where it used to be."" I wish we would have heeded her recommendation. Here's your turn: try somewhere else."
7/17/2019,20190717,3,4.15,"I soooooo wanted to love this place! I'm glad to have tried it but we won't be going back. Biscuits and jelly were good but crumbled all over when you tried to eat, lobster Mac was best part, chicken was a little chewy, burnt on the bottom but very moist, greens I was definitely not a fan of. Plates were old and gross, table was sticky, floor was greasy and it was $80 for 2 orders of chicken and a Mac. I have heard more about the brunch and could have been my mistake going for dinner instead of brunch. I'm bummed and will be heading back to The Roost."
7/18/2019,20190718,5,4.15,"Marvelous, marvelous, southern food. Ambrosia kale salad is my face. Love it with an ole country ambience."
7/28/2019,20190728,4,4.15,"If you have a hankering for some good Ole fashioned standard fried chicken then you have found the right place. This joint right here is more of a traditional sit down and chow down type of place versus a quick fried chicken fix.Buttermilk Fried Chicken - ah the classic fried chicken. The chicken was juicy with a crispy exterior that has that satisfying crunch as you bite into the chicken. Looking for more flavor? Well you can grab some honey and drizzle it all over the chicken. Bonus points for coming in a legit honey jar. Score of 4.5/5Mac & Cheese - Something tells me the Mac is home made or custom ordered as it comes in a larger size and has more bite to it than a regular Mac & cheese. The flavor was oh so good but sadly it came in a small portion for a side that costs $8. Guess you are paying for the quality. Score of 4/5 cause of the price lBeignet - If you have ever been to New Orleans, you would be familiar with this staple. Nothing much to comment here since these ones pale in comparison but are a servicable choice. Score of 3/5"
7/28/2019,20190728,4,4.15,"Everything we got here was plated so cute! The cornbread and mac and cheese came out on their own little skillet and I personally loved the cornbread. My friend thought it was just okay. I also loved the mac and cheese because the bottom part touching the skillet got a little crispy closer to the end. Another cute touch was the honey pot that came out with the fried chicken. The breading on the fried chicken wasn't the best I ever tasted, but it tasted good with the honey drizzled on top. Parking-wise, we were able to find a free spot within the block, but there is also lots of paid parking available close-by."
7/28/2019,20190728,4,4.15,"I was surprised at how good everything was here.Staff- There were only 2 or 3 people staffing the restaurant and there was a bit of a wait. I would suggest more staff to ensure a better experience but everyone was helpful and kind.Food- Ordered the following:Shrimp and Grits- Grits was creamy and melted in your mouth and the shrimp was cooked just right. Skillet cornbread- The cornbread was soft and had great flavor. I didn't enjoy it being in a skillet because we kept picking at it and the bottom part was stuck to the pan. Buttermilk Chicken with Collard Greens- Chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside. I had no complaints whatsoever. Collard greens were a great pair to the chicken and it completed the meal. Sweet Tea- It was not too sweet or bland. I really enjoyed it and would have loved to refill my cup. Pricing- For 2 people (we shared) we spent about $43, which is not bad.Parking- Paid street parking. Overall, this place was really good. I would come back and recommend this to friends."
8/13/2019,20190813,5,4.15,"The fried bird here is amazing. Really good flavor and juiciness. We got the lobster mac, the gumbo and the biscuits as well and all were good but none remarkable. The chicken is special though. Gotta get the chicken here. Also I love that they have crystal hot sauce- it's got no heat but I love the flavor. The classic vinegar, pepper and salt recipe. I digress. If I lived in between here and big Jones I would be in heaven. I'm also a huge fan of Luella's gospel chicken. I might even prefer it. I wish Luella was my mom."
8/19/2019,20190819,2,4.15,"Where can I start... my friend and I came to Luella's for dinner and was very unimpressed. Firstly, they were sold out of their gumbo which was as confusing because they opened at 5pm and we were there at exactly 5 and the resturant was completely empty. Next, we ordered butter milk fried chicken, salmon croquettes, and New Orleans bbq shrimp. The fried chicken was fried lightly and covered in greasy , all of the food was bland and lacked flavor and taste the shrimp was the best thing on the menu yet still very mediocre . I will not go back."

8/25/2019,20190825,4,4.15,"Luella's Southern Kitchen is a cute small restaurant located about 15 minutes away from my place. Black owned establishment selling amazing food! I found this place through Instagram posts and yelp reviews and I HAD to try it out. I ordered the French toast and my mother ordered the Nashville chicken and waffles. My French Toast was perfect!! It came out in a hot skillet, with a maple sauce, whipped cream, and a couple of peaches on it. It was hot,  the bread was soft and it tasted soooo good. It was perfect. Literally everything you want in French toast. My mother ordered the Nashville Chicken and Waffles. The Nashville Chicken was very flavorful! It was spicy but not too spicy, had the right amount of kick. The waffle was a little bit burnt. Not too bad but it did have a little burnt after taste. That was the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars. All in all, I'm DEFINITELY coming back! The food is so good! I want to get the French toast again. The Nashville dish was great. The chicken was fantastic. The only eh part was the waffle that was a tad bit burnt. I'm positive next time it'll be perfect. Can't wait to try it again."
9/1/2019,20190901,5,4.15,"This place might have the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. I was recommended to check this place out by a family member and I was not disappointed one bit. They have a nice, simple menu with great choices to make a selection from. My first time here, I had the Fried Chicken and Waffles, WOW, the flavor in the chicken and the sweetness of the waffles was amazing and 2nd to none. I also had to try their biscuit and there were no complaints to give about that either, tons of flavor and it was a huge biscuit too! My wife enjoys the Shrimp and Grits because the Shrimp is extremely flavorful and well cooked. The grits were creamy and seasoned really well.The look and feel of the restaurant is like walking into a kitchen down south in the country and the staff is great too.There is really nothing bad that I can say about Luella's, the food is amazing. Most definitely making this a place to come back to often."
9/15/2019,20190915,2,4.15,"I went in with high hopes. On a Sunday lunch period, it started with a 25 minute wait. That didn't bother me nearly as much as waiting for an hour for parts of the order to come out. The front of house is confusing. I get counter service to order and delivery to the table, but to have the food come out in different times over 20 minutes seems to me that the back end is wagging the dog. One huge nit-pik and I know it is becoming a standard, is tipping for service at the counter. If service is bad, do I get part of my tip back?The food is good, but again, it had issues. The Mac and cheese tasted like it was broiled in an oven that had been burning something. The burnt taste was infused into the Mac making it inedible. The waffle was good, but the only thing that made it a waffle was the shape. The chicken and beignets were great. Maybe next time we will have a better experience, but this time it was subpar."
9/16/2019,20190916,5,4.15,"Came across this cute little spot and I must say- Simply amazing!!!!!! I love to eat so I basically ordered almost the entire menu and it's Safe to say everything was hit. The staff was amazing and the Manger Levelle was just on Pinterest and almost ! Customer satisfaction is everything to me, so when I can get amazing food and great customer experience you have me as a customer for life.Best thing on menu was them GRITS( The just melt right in your mouth) Highly Recommended spot!"
9/21/2019,20190921,4,4.15,That's a wonderful place for a great southern meal. The fried chicken is definitely the star of the show. And the cornbread is a fantastic showstopper. And wash it all down with a sweet tea.
9/21/2019,20190921,5,4.15,"Luella's is a solid spot. The chicken is fire, the Mac n cheese, and the biscuit with housemade jam. I'd recommend Luella's for anyone looking for a more intimate experience. The price is kinda high but that doesn't mean good food and service shouldn't be compromised."
9/30/2019,20190930,5,4.15,"First time here and it was AMAZING! Nice restaurant with lots of seating. Tried the Nashville hot chicken and waffles $17 and it was amazing! The amount of flavor on the chicken was tasteful and the seasoning wasn't over season which I like. And the waffles with the chicken was an amazing combo! There is no parking lot, just street parking so depending on the day you might have to park and walk to the location. I will definitely come back to try the dinner menu!"
9/30/2019,20190930,5,4.15,"You know when something tastes so good, it almost makes your toes curl? Their shrimp & grits will do that to you. Lordy, lord, lord! And that's just the one dish..."
10/5/2019,20191005,1,4.15,"Well well well... drove from the west suburbs to check this place out. #1 for 2 eggs it cost 5 dollars, for starters. #2 we waited for our food for over 30 minutes, the biscuit came out within 5 minutes after we sat down, so we couldn't eat it with our food. #3 the biscuit was dry, #4 THE FOOD WAS SALTY..we had to send back the $5 eggs, and they reimbursed us for another order of salty eggs. People were looking around like where is our food. When I went to the restroom, the cooks were saying we running out of salmon, we are running out of corn. I should have followed my first thought and went to another restaurant. $53 dollars for 2 ppl for breakfast is ridiculous, especially if the food is not good. NEVER WILL I BE BACK"
10/6/2019,20191006,3,4.14,"This is my second time eating Leulla's the first time in the restaurant for brunch the second time delivered from postmates. The food is pretty good! The second time I ordered the chicken. It comes with greens. The chicken was OK, a bit salty but overall the outside is very flavorful and flaky. The greens were delicious but came in the tiniest container, like a sauce container which was pretty disappointing. Not a true side. The Mac & cheese I ordered as a side came in a huge container but I couldn't eat much of it, it was over salted. The final side I ordered was the cornbread with honey butter. No complaints on that! Delish!"
10/19/2019,20191019,2,4.14,"Sorry to write a negative review - I don't often do this.For weeks I had been looking forward to treating some dear friends from Misissippi to dinner at this restaurant, and finally the day arrived. It took us almost forty-five minutes to drive there on a Friday evening. We arrived at about 5:20pm, and were the first customers in the place (they open at 5pm).There are eight main dishes on the menu, and guess what? When my friends ordered, they were told that the first three things they asked for weren't available! No Chicken Gumbo, no Salmon Croquettes, and no Shrimp and Grits - and this, on a Friday night. We were even told that they didn't have any Buttermilk Biscuits. I was feeling very embarrassed to have dragged my friends half way across the city. How can you not have biscuits, I asked.That being said, everything we did order was very good, and so was the service. Midway through our meal, one of the servers brought us a tray of freshly baked biscuits on-the-house - he said they took about thirty minutes to bake. That was a very sweet gesture, and much appreciated.Still, whoever manages this place should make sure that all of the items on the menu are available."
10/26/2019,20191026,1,4.14,"It started off bad, no one greets you as you enter. I felt lost on what to do, it was my first time at the restaurant. I had read great reviews. I chose it for my birthday brunch, I walked to the back of the restaurant where there's a counter to order. I slipped and fell on the long plastic mat they have at the entrance and down the middle of the room, which has no traction. I should have left then, but I wanted to try the food. I was told there would be a 25 minute wait. They had broken chairs along the wall, and not enough chairs for the available tables. My party and I waited, another party whom arrived after was seated first. Hungry and sore, I left with my party after an hour."
10/28/2019,20191028,3,4.13,"I ordered the gumbo and settled for the cornbread. I had wanted to order biscuits but was told it would take 30 minutes which was a bummer because I really wanted to try the biscuits. The gumbo tasted good however I am giving it a 3 because I found small bones in my gumbo! While I understand that bone-in meat makes it taste better, please be careful when chopping the meat beforehand. If you could have de-boned properly, I wouldn't have found so many small bones in my mouthfuls of gumbo. Luckily, I am an adult but fear a child wouldn't have been able to spit out the bones. Just saying for safety's sake."
11/2/2019,20191102,4,4.13,"All I can say is get the fried chicken! It was really good came out fresh and hot and seasoned to perfection. The greens were really good. We also had the mac and cheese with meat (short ribs) I think. The mac was good but lacked flavor to me. The beignets of course was dessert and they were exactly what I needed after my meal, lil fluffy pillows of delishesness. Kind of far from my hood but if in the area definitely a must stop for me!"
11/3/2019,20191103,4,4.13,"If you're looking for some no-frills, home style soul food, Luella's has your ticket. We stopped by late on a Sunday morning to grab some brunch. It's too bad we couldn't order off their dinner menu, because that shrimp po' boy sounded really good! Anyways, given they're famous for fried chicken, we went with the chicken and waffles and also ordered a side of biscuits and Mac and cheese.The chicken was really the star. Hot, crispy, and complemented nicely by a little sweetness from the maple syrup. You get a whole half chicken with an order, which is good because the entree alone was a whopping $17! The waffle was cold and unappetizing, it had a strange flavor (definitely not like a typical Belgian waffle). The biscuits were also really incredible, soft and buttery with a nice tart berry jam on the side. The Mac and cheese was a little too heavy and rich for my taste, I was pretty much done after two or three bites. But overall, an enjoyable meal.TL;DR, get the fried chicken and the biscuits!"
11/3/2019,20191103,4,4.13,"This was a definite mixed experience. We came for the chicken and it was, indeed, amazing. Maybe even the best I have ver had. However, the service was kind of a mess. I got the distinct impression it was an off day for them. When we arrived we were told we needed to wait to place our order at the counter and would be called when it was our turn. Ok, that was a little odd but I figured they were controlling the seating and making sure they had a steady supply. After 15 mins we were called to order, and then given a seat. We ordered the Hot Chicken and Waffles, the regular chicken and waffles and an order of Mac and cheese. We waited. And waited. Orders came out for other tables that had been there long before us but they came out one and at a time instead of the whole table's orders at once. So some people were eating while others waited. Same happened for us. About 50 mins after we ordered the regular chicken and waffles came out. Then 5 mins later the Mac n cheese and maybe 10 mins later the hot chicken and waffles arrived. The poor manager looked really harried and it appeared the kitchen was way off filling orders. She did check on us and apologize but didn't offer any compensation. The regular chicken was fine, the Mac and cheese tasted as though it had been baked in an oven where something had spilled and burned. It was inedible even though we were starving by the time it arrived.Now, the hot chicken and waffles was epic. It was worth waiting an hour plus. And if I went back, I would be sure to go when I wasn't desperately hungry. The chicken was crispy, juicy and flavorful all the way through. The heat in the seasoning was perfect and the syrup on top added that sweetness. The waffle was unexpected and I really like it. It was a drier bready waffle with savory seasoning. It was perfect for absorbing the chicken juices and syrup and stayed crispy throughout the meal. It was excellent. I will definitely give it another try and be Prepared for the wait but I'll explore other places first."
11/4/2019,20191104,5,4.13,"The food is so good! Ordering is easy at the front counter Refill your own water glass. Coffee was good Came on a Saturday morning around 10:30AM and didn't have to wait too long for everything to come outGot the Benedict, not a looker but it was tasty. The shrimp and grits were amazing. The spice level and flavors were noteworthy and the grits were so creamy. Also got a side of Mac n cheese, which had a nice creaminess and cheese flavor. It had a good broiled/ baked layer on top."
11/8/2019,20191108,1,4.13,"OH boy. This place is absolute GARBAGE. Yup deleted my last review. I want you to make sure that you know that this place is GARBAGE. Not only is it grossly overpriced, but the biggest upset that Luella's has the offer it's guest is that it's food is completely UNauthentic. I'm writing this review based on experience that I'll never forget. Of all the restaurants I've ever reviewed on yelp this is definitely the worst one I've ever been to. The cornbread sucked there honey is very low-quality, the collar greens are for McCann, the breading on the chicken is tasteless and greasy, There was no flavor to my meal except bitter disappointment. You will be mad that you came here. I hope this place goes out of business because it is not southern"
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.13,I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Everything I ordered was beyond amazing! The ambiance was nice and I can't wait to go back. If you want really good southern food look no further.
11/17/2019,20191117,5,4.13,Nah no cap this food good as hell. Chicken is fall off the bone. Crust is very golden and crispy. And the greens goin crazy. Aw yeah and the iced tea is
11/21/2019,20191121,3,4.13,"The food was delicious. I had the salmon croquettes and potato salad. Great flavors and textures. But confusing as to whether the potato salad was supposed to be cold or hot. When I asked the server, was told it's supposed to be cold. But served on a hot platter along with the salmon, of course it turns warmish. A bite or two remained cold and the inconsistency was disconcerting. Portions were adequate but not particularly generous. Price seemed really high for a counter service establishment. I had ended up there by googling ""oyster po'boy"" while out in my car. On arrival, found po'boys are no longer on the menu. Despite that fact and the pricing, I stayed to eat. I enjoyed the food but with the cost, it's unlikely that I'll go back."
11/25/2019,20191125,5,4.13,You've got to check this place out. This is authentic southern food. I had the shrimp and grits and was just blown away. The best I've ever had. Every component of this dish was spot on. This place is on my permanent to do list when in Chicago.
12/4/2019,20191204,5,4.13,We are not worthy!!!! Best food best service best best best!!!!!!!!! This is some of the most delectable southern food you can find in Chicago.
12/19/2019,20191219,4,4.13,"The soul food here is quite good.The chicken is excellent - very juicy, with a lardy, doughy crust that has a nice crunch but is not particularly crisp. It is a bit steep at $18, but you do get 3-4 large pieces. It only comes with collard greens, unfortunately, but you might be able to swap out another side, like cornbread.The waffles are also excellent - they have a malty, savory element to complement the sweetness that I have not encountered with other waffles. Plus, the order comes with 3-4 big pieces of chicken, just like the regular order of fried chicken.The mac'n'cheese is thick and creamy and delicious, and the biscuits are fluffy and ethereal.The shrimp and grits is also excellent, with creamy delicious grits and a nice spice kick to the shrimp.It can get crazy on the weekends, but they will take reservations for large parties."
1/6/2020,20200106,3,4.13,"The food has no seasoning. I'm surprised this is a black owned southern, soul food restaurant. The greens lack flavor and are minced so small that it looks liked canned spinach. The gumbo lacks flavor and just plain ol salt.The baked Mac n cheese was nice. The fried chicken was hard and again, no seasoning.The wait staff is SOO nice! Very warm atmosphere. However the lack of basic seasoning that I expect soul food to have isn't at this establishment."
1/11/2020,20200111,5,4.13,"Great food..**Pros**The baby brother is so polite, good looking, and attentive.I almost felt like a celebrity!!! Staff Syrupy Sweet - Salmon Croquettes and Cream Cheese Grits =Amazing.Mac n' Cheese = Delici - o- sos!!! Fried Chicken = Mouth wateringly...Tasty!! (If that's a word, lol)Shrimp sauce = beggin' for more!!!Beignetsssssssss = fluffy goodness .. yummmyLast but not least....The music was Everything and more..I was truly entertained. Reminded me when I was a little girl and my mother would have the Dusties playing on V103.. I love this place!!Koodooss!!!ConsCollard greens has pork added to it. Including the biscuits and corn bread.I wasn't able to try those items..( super sad)But will definitely bring my CTA crew back with me... Kisses!!Mina"
1/19/2020,20200119,5,4.13,"This place is a hidden gem. I recommend the chicken and waffles. I also tried the breakfast cheeseburger, the fries were the best fries I've ever had. The service was amazing, all the staff members were so thorough and kind. This place is also BYOB. We didn't even have to wait for a table. We arrived around noon on a Sunday. I will definitely be back to try the French toast and biscuits and gravy."
1/26/2020,20200126,3,4.13,I ordered the chicken and waffle and that is precisely what I got. The chicken is good. It was crowded so I won't say much more. I left there with a feeling of indifference and I really don't have much more than that. I'll try it again someday I imagine for at least the chicken
2/2/2020,20200202,3,4.13,"Visited here with my family and must say the menu isn't very long I had shrimp and grits which were pretty good. The salmon croquettes were also good. Things you should know is that the greens are made with a lot of pork meat. If you don't eat pork don't order the greens. The fries are Cajun style and extremely spicy. I can check this one off of my list but don't have to go back. Oh and as far as the atmosphere, they play really nice old school music. It's a small place and not fancy at all."
2/10/2020,20200210,4,4.13,"Dear Luella's, It's very cruel and complelely unfair to make a wickedly good shrimp grits to serve to the people. Don't you know that people get hooked? Don't you know that people want to lick the bowl clean?! I love the shrimp and grits there and it's even better the next day, if you have self control and have leftovers!"
2/15/2020,20200215,5,4.13,Food was so delicious. The only think id say they would need is a house drink. Like a homemade lemonade
2/28/2020,20200228,4,4.13,"Well I have been dying to try this place and 4 stars is saying something. Only Negative - $5 for cornbread considering the portion was a disappointment. I needed more to go with my greens which were so so good. Cornbread was so good it could have been a dessert. right balance with a little sweetness that was just enough. There were three of us and we all ordered something different so we could try just about everything and everything was GOOD! the sharing part not so much. Its easy to be greedy. I thought the chicken was expensive but its a nice healthy 4 piece portion. A better bet might be the chicken with a waffle (same price point) As we were eating, we saw the chicken and waffle with a sauce (Nashville hot). All kinds of food porn there, getting it next time. Except to whine when your food is all gone (sadness, sniff, sob)Also not a lot of tables but its a short visit. if you are there an hour, I would be surprised its a short wait but you can always eat in the car."
3/21/2020,20200321,5,4.13,"THE MOST DELICIOUS FRIED CHICKEN my hubby and I have ever had! The shrimp and grits is delicious as well.  They also have great customer service, particularly the Head Chef/ owner Darnell. Please support this minority owned business especially during these difficult times restaurant businesses are experiencing!"
4/17/2020,20200417,5,4.13,"The people who run this place are some of the nicest I've come across. You can tell they put love into their food. The menu maybe small but everything they make is top notch! Love the place for the people, the vibe, and the fantastic tunes they play. Keep it coming Luella's - we're here for it!"
5/11/2020,20200511,1,4.13,When you try to support a black business amd it goes wrong. DO NOT ORDER FROM LUELLA'S SOUTHERN KITCHEN. Horrible customer service. Had a pick up ordee for 4:45 only to get the order at 5:30 with no apologies or offer something to drink for waiting. Then you continue to lie and say that the order will be up in 15 minutes. When i asked to speak with the manager the owner yelled at me from the back that i need to stop asking if my food is ready. Never again will they get my money.The gumbo was bland. The cornbread was dry. The chicken was greasy. The worst i have had since I started cooking. Save your money folks.
6/7/2020,20200607,5,4.13,Ordered for delivery. Got the Mac and cheese and the biscuits and home made jam. Both were INCREDIBLE. Highly recommend.
6/8/2020,20200608,5,4.13,"I've lived in Chicago my whole life and have been going to restaurants as a little kid for family outings over the years. Eventually you reach a point where you start to pay attention to the details of your restaurant experience. From the unique/delicious menu offerings to the sweet/helpful staff, this place is truly memorable.I never knew I loved Southern style food and I would catch myself thinking about how lucky I was to have this restaurant just minutes away from my apartment. Do not hesitate to try this amazing restaurant!"
6/10/2020,20200610,5,4.13,"So good! Black owned and amazing! Get the shrimp and grits, I promise you won't be let down!!"
6/27/2020,20200627,4,4.13,"Our takeout experience was very good. We ordered our food thru Yelp and paid online and the food was ready as soon as we arrived. Everything was still hot and fresh. My husband ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles and I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken. As a side we ordered the Mac and cheese and for dessert beignets. The buttermilk chicken was seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crispiness. The Mac and cheese was very creamy and I could taste more than one cheese which gave it such an amazing flavor. I loved that they didn't use regular macaroni but instead used what we call as Italians orecchiette pasta. The beignets were the absolute highlight. They literally melt in your mouth. The only dish we didn't love was the Nashville hot chicken. There was a lot of seasoning but we were looking for a little more spiciness. Also unlike the buttermilk chicken, it wasn't nice and crispy. So we will stick to the buttermilk chicken next time...it's just a more classic taste. We also want to try the shrimp and grits next time around"
7/6/2020,20200706,4,4.13,"4.5 stars. I got the biscuits and chicken gumbo. Both were great. The biscuits were warm and soft, and the jam was yummy too. I'd never had gumbo before, and I'd describe this as a somewhat buttery (?) and thick chili. Definitely would order from here again!"
7/10/2020,20200710,5,4.13,I ordered takeout on Easter Sunday. I wanted the chicken and waffles but they ran out of waffle mix so I got the Nashville Chicken instead. It was great. I had collard greens and cheesy grits for my sides and they were excellent. I topped of my meal with beignets for dessert. I'd definitely return in the future.
7/11/2020,20200711,5,4.14,"I wish I could give Luella's 1000 stars because they would deserve it. I know their food will be even better once I can sit down and have it fresh from their kitchen, but even driving 10 minutes with the takeout, it was a game changer.My mom and I split the fried chicken dinner (which comes with smoked honey and greens), a side of Mac and cheese, the biscuits and the cornbread. Can I pick a favorite? No. Will I struggle to not get every single menu item from now on? Yes.The fried chicken is the best I've had since I lived in New Orleans over a year ago and it immediately tasted like I was transported to the swamp (in a great way). I expected it to be a little soggy when we got home but it still crunched when you bit into it. My mouth is watering and I just finished eating it. The greens are so tender and melt in your mouth. The mac and cheese is very good but the greens stood them up a little. The biscuits and cornbread are perfect, as well. The biscuits are so soft and light and the cornbread is PERFECTLY sweet (not rot your teeth sweet like some I've had) and some with their honey butter. Honestly stop reading this review and place an order right now. They have limited hours right now with all things COVID, and you need to order online or call for pick up, you can't just walk in and get a carry out order. I cannot wait to go back! Thank you, Luella's for healing my soul with your incredible food."
7/11/2020,20200711,4,4.14,The buttermilk fried chicken is excellent. The macaroni and cheese is also excellent. Recommend it to everyone who likes southern cooking.
7/14/2020,20200714,5,4.14,"Highly HIGHLY recommend the shrimp and grits. It's ridiculously flavorful and creamy. Simply can't recommend it enough. My mom loves the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, she requests it for takeout all the time. She says the Nashville Hot Chicken is also quite good and has a tender, juicy inside with a ""a delightfully crispy crust."" Love this place!!!!! Go here!!!"
7/18/2020,20200718,5,4.14,"We'd heard amazing things about this place, but it took us far too long to jump on it. Food was amazing. We had biscuits, brisket nachos, mac and cheese, and the burger. So good and so excited to try the chicken and waffles next time."
7/20/2020,20200720,5,4.14,Always good and really streamlined pick up during this world mess. So glad I could get my shrimp and grits fix! I'll definitely be back.
7/21/2020,20200721,5,4.14,"Get the buttermilk fried chicken. Best fried chicken I've ever had. It's easy to do good fried chicken, but Luella's is in a different league. There's definitely some Harry Potter stuff going on back there because the fried chicken is impossibly crispy even when delivered (did not think this was possible before I tried Luella's). I've had the chicken and waffles which were good, but the fried chicken in the chicken and waffles is not the same as the buttermilk fried chicken, to my disappointment. If you are like me, and deep fried foods are a rare treat, make it count and get the buttermilk fried chicken at Luella's."
7/25/2020,20200725,4,4.14,"Thanks to the pandemic, Luella's is only offering carry-out. I ordered shrimp and grits, along with a cup of gumbo. Each was full of flavor. I will return when I can enjoy the meal on-premises. Minus half a point because they neglected to include any utensils with my order."
7/27/2020,20200727,3,4.14,"One of the best takeouts I had during the lockdown so I was expecting the same quality a few days ago. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case - most of the food was cold and greasy. The gumbo which is my all time favorite was especially greasy and gave me a bad stomachache. Takeout is always a hit or miss with more misses lately. I'll give them a try again when the doors open up for dining but no more takeout for me."
8/11/2020,20200811,5,4.14,"Ate there pre COVID but their chicken and waffles were amazing! I would imagine everything else on their menu is as good. You can tell the food is home cooking, that's been passed down through generations. Glad a taste of the South has made it's way North. You can't go wrong with Luellas."
8/13/2020,20200813,5,4.14,Fried chicken This came with collar greens and 3 pieces of chicken with honey. It was amazing! Best fried chicken we've ever hadMac & cheeseThis was cheesy and cooked perfectlyShrimp & gritsAmazing. I had leftovers. This came with plenty of grits and perfectly seasoned shrimp
8/14/2020,20200814,5,4.14,"(Nashville) Chicken and waffles: Awesome. This was my favorite thing we ordered. The syrup was thin but it worked so well. The chicken was cooked perfectly, nice and crunchy on the outside, juicy chicken inside. The chicken juice got into the waffles while it was being delivered which made that waffle taste that much more. Next time I order it though, I might not get the Nashville one. Pimento burger and fries: Also very VERY good. The patties were pretty thin and the bacon was thick. The fries have a nice garlic flavor. We probably won't order this one again because we want to try out other stuff too! Cornbread: Perfect balance between cornmeal and cake-ie-ness. It wasn't gritty and the perfect amount of sweet. Would definitely order again. Collard greens: It's easy to get lazy about collard greens but Luella's knocked it out of the park. It was way better than expected. Highly recommend. Mac and cheese: This was ""meh"" for me. It was a pretty standard Mac and cheese. Probably wouldn't order again but that's fine because I want to try other sides as well. Also a BOB!"
8/20/2020,20200820,4,4.14,Food was good but it was no longer hot when it arrived. Grits had the texture of cornmeal but had a very good flavor. Buttermilk chicken was good. Should offer greens without pork. Don't know how to spell it but dough pastries with powered sugar were good. i'm
9/4/2020,20200904,4,4.14,"I'ma keep this one short. The sides are ok, some better than others, but. ..the Fried Chicken is bangin'. They must be frying in lard or beef tallow. I tried my luck at emailing the chef for the recipe. He was nice enough to direct me to a video of him preparing. The problem is he didn't give any specifics. The chicken is good enough to buy even if I could duplicate at home. #SupportLocal"
10/6/2020,20201006,5,4.14,"I apologize early but there will be NO pictures. My husband and I devoured the food before I remembered to take any. Luella's is a very nice little spot offering amazing comfort foods and good portions. Whenever my husband and I visit Luella's, it's usually on a Sunday. It's a bit far so we make a day of it. On our last visit we ordered two orders of the fried chicken, which is enough for leftovers. Yay, that means I don't have to cook the next day. The chicken is fried perfectly; flavored all the way to the bone this is a good sign that a brine was used. The crunch also held up through our drive home. They include a side of smoked honey to drizzle over the chicken. Can we say ""finger lickin good""! We ordered one skillet corn bread and one side of biscuits with jam. Omg! We ate the cornbread on the first day and biscuits and jam with the leftovers. Please reheat in the oven, NOT the microwave. If you preheat your oven first it doesn't take long. The macaroni and the the greens were also good. The star of the show on this visit was the shrimp and grits. So far the best I have eaten to date. The grits were very rich and cheesy. (Cream cheese) The shrimp were perfectly seasoned with a gentle bite and the creamy sauce just kicked the flavor up another notch. We also ordered the cheer wine! If you haven't visited Luella's, it won't disappoint."
10/17/2020,20201017,5,4.15,"Outstanding restaurant by an outstanding chef. I highly recommend the macaroni and cheese as well as the fried chicken. I've tried many places in the city, but Luella's is the best. I also had a small party at Luella's and my guest thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
10/27/2020,20201027,5,4.15,"Luella's has been one of my favorite restaurants since I appeared on an episode of Check Please in 2015, and they were one of the spots for our episode. This family-run southern masterpiece makes you feel warm, like you're in their home trying recipes that have been passed down. The pimento burger is the kind of secret I like to keep from my cardiologist. The shrimp and grits never disappoints. The watermelon salad is also delicious, but I can tell my cardiologist about it. Obviously you need the beignets every once and awhile for dessert, even if you look like you just did c*ke in the bathroom every time; get the blueberry hand pies the rest of the time. Support the Black owned businesses that make Chicago culinary what it is."
10/31/2020,20201031,5,4.15,"I've probably written less than five reviews since I started on Yelp, many years ago, but I needed to give some love to Luella's Southern Kitchen. I got two of their specials recently, the Jerk Fried Catfish and the Chicken Po'Boy and I can easily say they were among the best meals I've ever had. I also got cornbread and direct quote my from my wife, ""This is the best cornbread I've ever had"". If you can, please check this place out, you won't be disappointed."
11/16/2020,20201116,5,4.15,I found out about this place on a black owned business list and have been stalking their Instagram since this summer. We had a shitty day and decided to drown our sorrows in some southern cooking and WHAT a great idea it was!Chicken & waffles -- best I've ever hadBeignets -- best I've ever had (including cafe du monde in New Orleans)The French toast was really good too. Corn bread was good. I immediately texted my family and told them they needed to come here next time they were in townCant wait to dine in person after the pandemic is over!
11/23/2020,20201123,2,4.15,I don't know what the fuss is about this place. It was expensive and the food took a long time to prepare for take out. The hot chicken was super salty. Biscuits were good.
11/26/2020,20201126,1,4.14,"Pre-ordered the Thanksgiving brunch plate which was supposed to serve 1-2 people. Was really excited about it. I'm not sure on what planet this would serve two people--this meal was meager for one person. I even questioned the size of the containers the employee handed to me when I came to pick it up. Shockingly small.See pictures, and note that I'm a petite woman with fairly small hands. I paid $33 for this disappointing take out, which was supposed to be my Thanksgiving meal. There was another meal option, but this is the one that sounded the most unique and tasty. Whatever the shrimp was stuffed with was gross. Had to spit it out. Duck was okay, but small and not a lot of meat. Quiche was pretty good, though ice cold. Square dumpling thingies were gummy and flavorless. Sticky bun tasted like an old, dry cinnamon roll with caramel and nuts on top (pecans were good). There was no green bean amandine to be found...unless that was the bit of green stuff hiding under one of the weird dumplings?Long bus ride to get there, then opted for a $16 (+ $2 tip) Lyft on the way home so my food wouldn't get cold. Didn't help, as everything was pretty much less than lukewarm already. Really bummed. This was my first time dining here and I won't be back. Was really looking forward to this today since I couldn't be with family and friends and it's been such an awful year. Ended up having to purchase other food at Jewel-Osco later."
11/26/2020,20201126,2,4.14,I love supporting local businesses and glad they got 400+ orders for Thanksgiving but this was a subpar meal by far
11/26/2020,20201126,1,4.13,"My husband and I have loved Luellas for a few years now. Every time our family comes into town we make it a priority to bring them there. When we found out about the pre-order Thanksgiving meal, it seemed like a no brainer. The thanksgiving meal we received was an absolute joke. The portions that we received were next to nothing. It was shockingly small. The menu stated each meal would feed 1-2 people. We ordered TWO sets of meals, and if we combined the meals it would still not have satisfied one person. To make things worse, most of the food was ICE COLD. Really? Now we have to figure out something to eat for the rest of the day. I understand that these are hard times, but if you could not provide what you advertised, you need to give people their money back. My husband and I won't be back here and that is unfortunate because we really used to love this place. We love supporting small businesses and it made me sad to have to write this review."
12/19/2020,20201219,5,4.13,Amazing! First ever review of a restaurant on Yelp. Luella you deserve it. Shrimp and grits and corn bread. Bravo
12/20/2020,20201220,5,4.14,"I'm not sure what just happened in my body, but it was spiritual. Literally had to put my fork down mid eating to write this-- it's that good. Will absolutely be back. I want this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Thank you."
2/24/2021,20210224,5,4.14,"I am absolutely in love with the French toast! It was much better than I expected. I simply could not get enough. I ended up finishing off my leftovers before I made it home. If you ever get the opportunity to visit, please try it! The beignets were also very good. It's apparent how thoughtfully curated the recipes are because the food is well prepared.The staff was super friendly that I did not mind the wait time. The restaurant was clean and Covid friendly. There are indoor and outdoor seating options. Phenomenal food and presentation! I highly recommend!"
3/5/2021,20210305,5,4.14,"I love soul food! It's in my top 5 favorite types of food! Yesterday, I found out that there was a Soul Food restaurant on the north side, I was surprised! Most of the best places to get Soul Food is on the west and south side of Chicago (just from my experience) The food was amazing! The atmosphere was both comforting and very decorative! I had some very delicious unsweetened ice tea while I was waiting for my food. One of my favorite dishes is Chicken and Waffles and I had the ""Nashville Hot"" made into the chicken. Absolutely amazing! The chicken just comes off with very little resistance. The waffle batter was so delicious that it tasted like the syrup was already on it. That rich honey taste! Definitely in my top favorite 5 favorite soul food restaurants! If you're in the North side, you don't have to travel for to get a taste of home cooking! Highly recommend this place!"
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.14,Have a wonderful dinner with my wife here. Connected I was Fried Chicken in the mac and cheese. Very happy and well worth the wait
3/20/2021,20210320,3,4.14,"Their food is 5 starsGetting their food/ doing business with them is 2 starsCurious why? See below.I'll start by saying this is a place where bad service or frustrating logistics will NOT stop me from eating here.We've done pick up several times before dining in last week so this will be a summary.Best fried chicken I've had in Chicago. Their French toast is decadent and amazing. Pretty much everything we've had from here has been superb.So why 3 stars? They're restrictive, the cash biz app is meh at best to work with, minimal to no delivery and the one time we dined it (which I'll expand on) was frustrating as hell.Sunday brunch at 10:30, no French toast available- after seeing it all week on Instagram, strike 1. We arrive and the young lady couldn't care less, sit wherever and walks away. No explanation of how ordering works or anything. So you use the app again and pay as you order - so no pacing of the meal. So we order, whatever, NBD.I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of eggs, my better half orders the pork belly and a waffle. As mentioned, food is awesome. First thing that comes out is my eggs, by themselves... and we wait. Then the pork belly and then the waffle... more waiting, and then my biscuits and gravy show up - eggs are cold. Whatever. I'll note, we both got eggs and mine were cooked perfectly and her's were way over. The pork belly benefits more from that runny egg so if you were going to hit one and miss the other, you got it backwards this time.We eat, we're happy, we need coffee refills. I flag down the wandering soul that is our server, ask for more coffee and she seems to have an existential crisis of whether we can have more coffee and how to accomplish such a feat. So she brings new cups - cool, then stands by as we try to finish the last sips of our first round.So all that to say - the food is amazing and worth it, I'd have pushed a little kid down to get to their food, but the delivery (in house and otherwise) needs some improvements.I get it's Covid time, and I won't interject personal feelings there ( it is what it is, get over it.). But if you're going to take the hands off approach, I suggest a visit to small cheval for the best burger in town and take some notes. Put condiments out and for coffee, make it self serve and hand someone a cup when they order it. Others are doing it, it can work. Also, don't run out of French toast by 10:30 on the weekend."
3/20/2021,20210320,5,4.14,Collard greens and throw your eggs on top *chefs kiss* Amazing. Sister got chicken and waffles (main reason why we went) and she was floored they were delish. Coffee with biscuits and jam to top it off. DEFINITELY coming again.
4/8/2021,20210408,5,4.14,Delicious! Came here for brunch. Had the chicken and waffles - Nashville hot style. I'm not a huge fan of waffles but they were delicious! Seating is limited so be sure to make reservations. Service was quick and the food was hot.
4/11/2021,20210411,5,4.14,"I follow them on IG and was so excited to give them a try. The vibe is kind of nonexistent since it is a very small restaurant with not enough lighting and thick kitchen smoke. They could really benefit from a lighter color paint and an open window, BUT who really cares about a vibe when the food is out of this world! Finally got a chance to have brunch today and everything my husband and I ordered was phenomenal. I also really enjoyed and appreciated the chef coming to our table to ask about our experience. That personal touch really means a lot to me, and not enough restaurants do this. The prices are extremely reasonable for the portion size and quality. I cannot wait to go back and try dinner!! Definitely recommend!"

4/12/2021,20210412,3,4.14,"This used to be my go-to spot for fried chicken when I could justify spending $17 on 3 pieces on some of the best chicken in Chicago, but now it's $18 and, though the chicken is still absolutely cooked to perfection, the flavor isn't there, and just hasn't been the past few times I've ordered. It's been downright bland. I'm heading back to The Chicken Hut."

5/4/2021,20210504,2,4.14,"This was my first visit, and I was excited to have a first post vaccine meal with a friend. We ordered the fried chicken plate, a side of cornbread and a side of mac and cheese, and the gumbo. What a disappointment! The cornbread was very good, everything else ranged from okay to bad. Granted, the mac and cheese wasn't terrible, per se, but rotini pasta instead of elbow pasta just felt like the chef was making an uncomplicated dish more than it was. The gumbo was okay, though the chicken gave it a distracting mouthfeel, and as the soup cooled, the sausage started getting grainy. The absolute biggest failure was the fried chicken and the greens. The chicken looked delicious on the plate and the first bite had an immensely satisfying crunch--but there was absolutely no flavor. We both said afterwards that we should have known by the lack of grease on the tray. The greens were soggy and also lacked flavor, and not even the addition of hot sauce could save it. On the upside, the Covid-19 service was nice: you had to have a reservation to dine in, and you ordered and paid at the table using a QR code. The staff was attentive and kind, and the bathrooms were very nice. I just wish the food had lived up to our expectations."

5/7/2021,20210507,2,4.13,DON'T come in if you don't have a reservation. We drove 40 mins to get here only to found out they don't take walk in and it takes an hour to place to go orders even if you are there in person. Either order on delivery app or make reservations. The staffs were not helpful didn't try to help us at all. Huge disappointment. Won't come again.

5/13/2021,20210513,2,4.13,"Not worth the price. We spent $50.00 for 1 chicken and waffles 1 chicken and fries 2 sweet teas. We waited for this place to open for dining so we could try, we tried and won't be back.  They place was so smokey from the deep fryer, the chicken was super greasy, we didn't get the drinks till we were halfway through our meal. Service was OK but slow."
5/14/2021,20210514,5,4.13,Always delicious! I love the shrimp and grits as well as the biscuits. The establishment is pretty small. I am not sure they take reservations.
5/26/2021,20210526,5,4.13,"Bomb fried chicken and biscuits! I rarely venture further than that on the menu, but the grits and beignets are excellent too. Can't wait to dine-in with the full menu. Worth the price and the wait."

5/27/2021,20210527,2,4.13,"I've visited here twice and have been underwhelmed both times. Most recently, I had the Nashville Hot Chicken and my guest had the Salmon cakes, which she really liked. The chicken was not better than decent IMO. Underseasoned, pretty bland really. And DO NOT pay $5 for the fries! They are the bottom of the barrel cheapest frozen fries possible, worse than any fast food place - and expensive to boot!The staff is friendly, but frankly not well trained. They really needed to check in with us a few times, rather than have us have to flag them down. I'm a former server myself, fyi, 16 years in the biz. A well-trained server will always check in with a table a few minutes after they get their food - long enough time for everybody to try everything, but not so long to keep people waiting if there is a problem. We had nobody check in as ask how everything was until we were done eating.I can live with poor service IF the food is great. It isn't, not in the two meals I've had here. I doubt I will return for a third try."

The dishes came served on a cast iron skillet, they were warm. I have to say the service was a little slow, however there is a lack of restaurant workers. Plus, we are still dealing with the pandemic so, I won't complain much about it. Just be patient, support a black owned restaurant and enjoy your food!"
6/12/2021,20210612,4,4.12,"This place gets a 4.5 rating from me! This is a small place with not much light. With the kitchen being right there, you will definitely see the thick kitchen smoke while dining in. We went for a Friday dinner and we had a reservation but the place wasn't too crowed so it I guess you could get a place without reservation maybe? They have indoor seating and there is minimal contact with the staff. You get to order using your phone from your table and even pay through the website. So easy to order food and avoid contact!!We ordered the Nashville fried chicken and waffles, Nashville fried chicken and collard greens, buttermilk fried chicken and grits, buttermilk fried chicken and Mac n cheese and unsweetened iced tea.Nashville fried chicken and waffles - loved the fried chicken but the waffles were just meh. Wasn't a huge fan of the waffles! I regretted getting the waffles. Should've just gone with a side of greens.Collard greens - who knew a veggie side would taste better than fried chicken!!! I could just have a bowl of the greens for dinner.Mac n cheese - I didn't taste this but it did look cheesy and yummy. My five year old nephew enjoyed eating it.Grits - this was my first time trying grits and loved it! Again, would just have a bowl of grits and greens for dinner. Fat just makes everything taste better lol.Bonus : All their dishes except the beignets don't have eggs! Even the fried chicken does not have eggs in their batter. Perfect for egg allergy peeps who wanna have so good Mac n cheese and fried chicken.The food was definitely good! The portions are pretty big. We did have leftovers! Like a lot. You get three fried chicken pieces per plate and that's a lot! The price is a bit on the pricey side! 18 dollars for three fried chicken pieces and a small side. But I guess the price was reasonable for the portion and quality of the food! Will definitely visit this place when I crave for some good Southern food!!!"
6/15/2021,20210615,5,4.13,Always amazing! The shrimp and grits is top 3 I've had. French toast is to die for! You can't go wrong on this menu.
6/18/2021,20210618,4,4.12,"Hands down best chicken and waffles I've ever ever ever had! Seriously! Waffles were just perfect and not soggy. The chicken was just the right amount of salty with the syrup. Oh man it was wonderful. Highly suggest eating at the restaurant it self. Only reason I took a star off was bc we waited about 1.5 hrs to get our food. Make reservations before hand, like we did, but it just took a while to get the food to us bc there were so many people ordering and I think they may have prioritized take out instead of dine in. So aside from the long wait.... It was worth it. If you end up dining in, and it's taking a bit to get your food... talk to the waiter... they sped up our order after we told them it took took too long."
7/3/2021,20210703,1,4.12,"I was very excited to get some southern food today but they did not suffice. We ordered shrimp and grits, Mac and cheese, greens and Cajun fries.. everything was left 75% full when we left. Very disappointed"
7/15/2021,20210715,5,4.12,"Damn....I am a fried chicken fan. It's my happy place. My favorite food group. It's almost always my choice of birthday dinner out. It has to be real southern fried chicken and must come with greens, cornbread and Mac n cheese. At a minimum. Luella's made all that happen for my birthday this year. We ordered all of that and here is how it went:Fried chicken - super crispy and not at all oily or greasy. It came piping hot. It takes about 15-20 after you order for it to be delivered and it is so worth the wait. It was exactly the perfect cross of crispy juicy salty savory. Greens - excellent greens. They were just a little spicy and made with ham. A little too much meat in the greens for me but I'm gonna order it again next time so...Cornbread - this is OMG real cornbread. Like you can still get real crunchy corn in this bread. Also delicious. Mac and Cheese - this was truly amazing. The cheese was the best tasting I've ever had, and I make pretty good Mac n cheese. Overall I'm very impressed. Not gonna tell you about the crazy ""you have to order and pay on your phone even tho your eating right there but their web site wouldn't work blah blah blah"" because none of that matters. This shit was good and I'm going back."
7/24/2021,20210724,5,4.12,"Unbelievable. So incredible impressive. The portions were unreal - so big. The fried chicken was so seasoned and delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and we both were blown away. The gravy was amazing. The sausage was cooked to perfection. I was so hungry, I couldn't even take a picture. But you will not be disappointed. Additionally, this place was BYOB which was so fun. We brought two bottles of Champaign and orange juice and they were so cute with their setup! They gave us a bucket of ice for the bottles and orange juice and adorable cups for it. Top notch!"
7/29/2021,20210729,4,4.12,"I was blown away by their food and would highly recommend checking Luella's out! The chicken and waffles were the best I've had! The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside but moist on the inside. The chicken was cooked perfectly, incredibly tender and flavorful with a great crispy skin. And their light maple syrup really brought the dish together! I'll definitely be ordering this next time I go to Luella's. My partner got the Shrimp and Grits, and even though he was super full, he was scraping the plate by the end! The shrimp was super flavorful, and the grits had a great texture. I'm a huge cornbread fan, and absolutely loved their skillet cornbread! There wasn't anything specifically special/different about it, but was a simple dish done well. And we couldn't leave without trying the beignets, which were light, fluffy, and delicious. Very worth saving space for this dessert!The biggest down side to Luella's is their overall service structure and pacing of our meal. We made a reservation, but it's a seat yourself type of restaurant with an online ordering portal that places you in a queue mixed with other online (non seated in the restaurant) orders. We ended up needing to wait almost an hour for the food due to the influx of online pickup orders, and unfortunately the food all came out at different times. I had finished my dish (chicken and waffles) by the time my partner's shrimp and grits came out, which was a bit unfortunate. I understand that kitchens get busy, but it doesn't make for a great experience when the restaurant itself is relatively empty, making it feel like a longer wait."
8/8/2021,20210808,2,4.12,"Sigh* where do I start. I had to try this place with a friend because it was coming highly suggested from the internet, so we popped in on a Saturday for brunch. When I arrived the restaurant was fairly quiet and not many people inside. It was explained that we have to scan the code at the table and order from our phones. The menu was very basic and some of the items that I saw in other reviews weren't on the brunch menu. I was torn between the shrimp and grits or the chicken and waffles. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles with side of beignets and my friend ordered collard greens with ham hocks.It took about 35-40mins for our food to be brought to the table. We were given a WARM bottle of tap water as a refreshment while we waited. I had to go up to the front to ask for a some colder water, only to be given another delicious bottle of WARM tap water. There was no ice given and the only beverages on the menu were soda and tea. I had to go to the front to ask them for extra plates, extra napkins, a cup for my friend straw etc. customer service is a fat 0.Now onto the food...The chicken was DRENCHED in syrup and super soggy. And extremely hot. The waffle had ok flavor but dry since most of the syrup was put on the chicken. Most places I have chicken and waffles the chicken is crunchy and juicy and rich with flavor. I was really disappointed because I came there with my stomach rumbling so loud it would have been heard in Japan. I didn't even finish half of the food. Plus it was burning the skin off my fingers trying to hold it to bite into.The portion size is good and would fill you up if you could actually eat it.My friends collard greens didn't have any meat in it except for 2 little pieces and she said it didn't really have any flavor. This portion size is more like a side dish.The only saving grace were the beignets! They were AMAZING! You tip when you order your food which I don't like. If your like me and tip based off the service your given I suggest bring cash and tip after your meal. The place was not that busy until right when we were leaving for the food quality or service.I was duped by the reviews or maybe I came when the cook wasn't having the best day. All in all I would not go back. It is not worth the price whatsoever."
8/10/2021,20210810,5,4.12,"Fantastic fried chicken and greens, and their biscuits are huge and come with delicious homemade preserves. We live in the neighborhood and go as often as we can. They also make their own popcorn -- better than Garrett's!"
8/12/2021,20210812,5,4.12,Food is a solid 5. There's not many places like this in Chicago and they deserve all the love they can get! My only little complaint is the self-ordering system they have set up. It's a bit of a pain. Luckily we came in as a walk-in but reservations are recommended. Food takes some time but is worth the wait. Ohhh and the sweet tea - YUM! Waffles taste like cake and the Nashville hot is perfect!! We'll be back!

Brisket was plenty with good flavor Overall good meal however I watched an older black couple watch the staff and kitchen cooks for 6 min and got up and left. Don't blame them. Everyone was Mexican working at the restaurant? We Support Black owned restaurants that provide jobs for us when others don't. I've never seen a black cook at a Mexican restaurant.
8/22/2021,20210822,4,4.12,I have literally been waiting to find time to visit this restaurant for two years!! A friend of mine told me about it and it's a long way from where I live so it takes over an hour to get there. And Covid hit and they had to close down for some time. Anyway...I made my way there yesterday! And it was worth every minute of the drive! Everything was incredible!! I mean EVERYTHING! I only did 4 stars for the fact the parking is horrible. The fried chicken is hands down the best fried chicken I ever had. Waffle was amazing! The smoked honey is their secret sauce and it's amazing! Grits are unbelievable! I could go on and on! Everything was extremely good. I recommend everyone take that drive!
9/16/2021,20210916,5,4.12,Food is so amazing! I had the salmon croquette dish. The flavors are great. The Brussels sprouts had a nice smoked flavor I couldn't even tell how they did it. And the butternut dumplings were a wonderful addition. Service very friendly. Came in from St Louis. Highly recommend.
9/21/2021,20210921,4,4.12,"This southern restaurant is located in Lincoln square. It's a nice neighborhood to park and explore or window shop before or after brunch. They are open 10-8pm Saturdays & Sundays, 4-8pm Wednesdays-Fridays and closed Mondays & Tuesdays. Reservations was made but I think one could have dinned in without one. The chicken and waffles is a must have. That's the crunchiest chicken I have had since @oldladygang in ATL. If you don't order anything else it's ok. Lol. Salmon Croquettes was also ok but a tad bit underwhelming compared to the Chicken and waffles. The Corn Bread was ok, wasn't as good as @pearlschicago which is definitely the best I have had in Chicago. Mac and Cheese was also ok, also not the best I've had. Lastly, the beignets which was good but a little too sweet for me. I'll definitely be back even if it's just for the Chicken and Waffles. Would also like to try the shrimp & grits, biscuits & gravy as well as their collard greens. Brunch came to about $30 per person which wasn't too bad. Ambience was casual and customer service was great. Overall, I'll give this place a 4/5"
10/9/2021,20211009,5,4.12,This is my first time here. I ordered the chicken and waffles for brunch. I just say that this is the best fried chicken I've ever had!!! I'm from the south and wanted sweet tea...very good sweet tea! I'll definitely be back when I'm back in Chicago.
10/17/2021,20211017,5,4.13,"This review is based on catering. Thank you for your timely and great quality food during my last major work event. We ordered online which was 3-4 weeks in advance with no issue. The order was the three pans of the jerk chicken, which I had myself - it was great! The food was delivered in a very professional manner. There was a heat box, the delivery person had on gloves and apron, with a hat. This means they take their food handling very seriously. I received a phone and text confirmation during the process. I didn't need to check up on the order. The food was great and everyone enjoyed it. The food was served and remained hot for the entire event. Thank you!"
10/24/2021,20211024,3,4.12,"Lately Luella's is looking rundown and out of business. The store-front is dirty and in need of a major cleaning. The windows and door have half peeled stickers, bad signage. The interior could use plants or some more decor to make it look more inviting. If the first thing the customer sees looks gross and unkempt, what does the back of the house look like? The food is good, but I'm leery of ordering since the actual restaurant has gone downhill in cleanliness."
11/12/2021,20211112,4,4.12,"I love this place. They are open for brunch and dinner. It's very low key quiet neighborhood gem. It's good ol southern soul food and I haven't found a better soul food tea in Chicago! It's homey and family style and about $20-$30 per per person. Their menu is seasonal so it changes, but there are some house favorites- the fried chicken and waffles is the best in town. The shrimp and grits are heavenly- so creamy and good. You should partner any dish with the cornbread it's goes with any entree. The salmon croquettes were not my favorite but decent. I didn't like the flavor of the croquettes or the sauce.They also started offering popcorn and I was very excited to try but sadly I was disappointed due the the very strong and over powering cheddar flavor. The caramel is good but i don't think I'll get popcorn there again.Overall I almost never have a bad experience and I recommend to anyone who likes soul food to check them out."
11/13/2021,20211113,5,4.12,"Amazing! Had the shrimp & grits, mac & cheese, and chicken & waffles. 10/10 would recommend, left happy and full"
11/20/2021,20211120,5,4.13,"Amazing food!! Seriously amazing. I have been about four times and have never had anything I didn't like. The Hot chicken and waffles are amazing, the shrimp and grits are delicious, the biscuits and gravy I can't even describe how good they are and I don't even typically eat that kind of food. If you have not been- go! NOW! :-) Very friendly people working there too."
11/22/2021,20211122,5,4.13,"My daughters friend brought his order by 2 days ago. He offered me some and I almost massacred his plate. Now this is some excellent soul food. The chicken was seasoned to the bone; crispy on the outside juicey on the inside and that was a breast. The mac n cheese was cheesy, buttery and baked like it should be. The greens were tasty as well. I have been trying go order from again, they were closed. This may be my answer to Thanksgiving. :)"
12/29/2021,20211229,5,4.13,This good was amazing!!! The chicken was The shrimp and grits were so freaking good. And the beignets were as good as the ones in New Orleans! This place is a must!!!
1/4/2022,20220104,5,4.13,"Needs to be added as a Chicago staple. The food was that good. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so my boo and i ordered chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, and a side of cornbread. Literally every single thing was good. It's rare when the takeout is good so we will def go in person next time we are in Chicago."
1/29/2022,20220129,5,4.13,"I stopped into Luella's without a reservation while walking around the neighborhood, and was immediately seated and given an explanation of how their menu works. I was there by myself, and ordered the fried chicken with collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread. I had leftovers for DAYS.The fried chicken was three giant pieces of chicken-the best I've ever had. Crunchy and perfectly juicy and just delicious. And that smoked honey?? They should sell that on its own, or make a smoked honey popcorn. It's insane. The collards were perfect-I could have eaten several bowls of those by themselves. The macaroni and cheese is the best in the city. My kids devoured the leftovers when I got home. As my server said, the cornbread is life changing, and it is. The restaurant is small, but that just means you feel like you are being welcomed into somebody's home to eat. If you want Southern food, don't go anywhere else, come right to Luella's. Ms. Luella Funches knew what she was doing in the kitchen, and her grandson, Chef Darnell Reed, is doing her proud with every dish he cooks.I cannot wait for my next meal there."
2/2/2022,20220202,5,4.13,This place really hit the spot. I got their mac and cheese and it was extremely flavorful. It was creamy and rich and was a very fairly sized portion
2/14/2022,20220214,5,4.13,"This review is well overdue... we originally dined in YEARS ago for brunch with friends and it was divine. I returned shortly afterwards for dinner with a friend. Since then, my husband, and now daughter, try to order out as often as we can, with their family meals during holidays over the pandemic a happy and delicious one! Sadly, our caterer went out of business due to the pandemic, so we now request a hummingbird cake for our anniversary cake every July - if you haven't had one or a slice from one, do so ASAP. The Easter family meal made our pandemic Easter complete, and most recently, the Super Bowl meal was equivalent to the halftime show! Any of their jerk chicken, this time wings, is unreal. Mac and cheese, off the charts and best I've ever eaten... and their pralines, our current favorite dessert. Go out of your way to support this family owned business - Chef Darnell Reed is a gem in the industry!"
2/20/2022,20220220,3,4.13,This is my go to brunch spot. It's byob. Being your own orange juice and champagne. This time I ordered the shrimp and grits. I was a tad disappointed. The shrimp was very salty. The corn bread was moist and sweet. The chicken and waffle was excellent as always. Service was very friendly and great.
2/27/2022,20220227,1,4.13,"Went to Luella's this morning for a brunch with family and friends. Upon entry into the establishment, we were informed of items not being available due to their pop up location at TimeOut Market. Okay we said (despite the fact that we arrived when the restaurant opened). Ordering system was great and actually one of the best systems I've seen since the pandemic began however, that the actually delivery of food was horrible. Once your order is placed, you're told where in line your order is. Within an hour, my order went from being 6th in line to 5th. It was five in our party, with the following placements in line: 3,4,5,6 & 9. Everyone's order came out staggered, with the first two arriving an hour and a half after placing our orders. The third one came out 10 mins later, the 4th order 15 mins later and part of mine came out 25 minutes after the first orders were delivered to our table. 10 minutes after half of my order came out, an order was brought out but it wasn't what I ordered. I explained to the waiter that I ordered the salmon croquettes with just cream cheese grits. He said he would go back to the kitchen and be right back. Upon return, he told me that the croquettes I revived w/ hollandaise sauce atop eggs over easy with a side of greens is the only way they served croquette. Again I explained that on the QR menu you scan, two versions of croquettes are available to order. He says he'll be right back and comes back with the grits on the same plate as the wrong order of croquettes. I again say that's not what I ordered and that I won't be eating the food. He comes back a few minutes later to show me on his iPad that on their end, that's how croquettes are served and ""no other other way."" I acknowledged what he said and then asked my cousin for her phone to show him the two types of croquettes their menu offers; he looks at it, takes the food back and in 8 mins is back with what I originally ordered. That was close to 12:30PM- we initially sat down at the restaurant at 10:10AM. Also, my sister never received her biscuits and when she inquired about it and was told that they ""went out"" and she explained it was never received, the young lady was adamant that it was. The waitstaff had actually took the order to the wrong table (the people behind us). She was refunded but it was the fact that my sister wasn't believed when she said this. The food was okay but the slow service, along with the order mix-ups made our time here not enjoyable as a previous experience."
3/11/2022,20220311,1,4.12,"It hurts my heart to give this rating/review tonight. I usually enjoy my meal when I order from this restaurant but not tonight. I guess it was too close to closing. I ordered Salmon Croquettes with Angel Hair Pasta and tomatoes. No angel hair pasta in the container at all. Instead, some tiny white potatoes and some type of baby leaves. I'm so disappointed."
3/14/2022,20220314,5,4.12,"We couldn't decide what NOT to get after looking around at other tables, so we splurged on sharing three entrees and happy we did. I can't exclaim enough how much I loved the chicken and waffle--best I've had. (And I'd like to say I've tried many around the city) Very friendly staff. Ordering and payment is a little unorthodox via QR code, then food is brought to your table. It gets busy so plan for that"
3/18/2022,20220318,5,4.13,This place is amazing and I can't wait to come back. I had the buttermilk fried chicken with the Incredibly flavorful and tender greens. I also ordered the max & cheese. Don't hesitate to order it! My only regret was I was too full to order another serving! I'll be back soon and I'll be recommending Luella's to all my friends.
3/19/2022,20220319,2,4.12,"What can I say? Between them making you to pay first or the comedic 35-45 min wait for just simple chicken and waffles, I was underwhelmed. While the chicken itself was good, the waffles left a lot to be desired. They were soggy and filled with crystallized sugar bits. Although I will say that they had good shrimp and grits but will never be visiting this place again when I'm back in Chicago."
3/21/2022,20220321,5,4.12,"Updating my review from 2 years ago and this place is still ridiculous. The chicken is unbelievable, definitely my favorite in the city and honestly possibly better than any I've had in the south. Lobster Mac is no longer on the menu which is unfortunate but it's replaced by baked Mac which is awesome. The shrimp and grits are incredible. Top notch corn bread with honey butter. I still wish Luella was my mom."
4/3/2022,20220403,3,4.12,"I wanted to love Luella's. I came for Sunday brunch with a friend and everything on the menu looked amazing. But their service was disappointing. Our server was very attentive but the kitchen service was lacking. After ordering, it took about 10 minutes to get our coffees and then an additional 35 minutes to get the first dish we ordered. Yep. 45 minutes for the first plate. And then 5 more minutes for the rest of our meal.The food was amazing. We got a biscuit with gravy and chicken and jalaepenos and then a french toast dish. I forget the names of both and their online menu doesn't list their brunch menu unless you're looking during brunch hours.Their ordering system is kind of annoying. You order from your phone but it doesn't seem to be an efficient ordering system because it required a decent amount of instruction on how to use and pay.Overall, I want to say I'll be back but honestly I'm not sure. I normally don't spend more than an hour at brunch (unless it's boozy) and the fact that it takes almost an hour to get your food almost ruined the entire experience."
4/16/2022,20220416,4,4.12,"Overall a good experience for chicken and grits, but would caution people against the Nashville style chicken.Pros-Food was made for each order and not precooked - kudos!Great fried chicken Grits were authenticGood service Cons-Greens were little bland for my taste...salt and pepper would have helped. But my wife like the greens...Nashville Chicken was disappointing since it was not the true Nashville style...they used sauce. Recommend getting regular fired chick with sauce on the side."
4/22/2022,20220422,5,4.12,"I try to go to Luella's every chance I get and it just never fails me. Since there were six of us for dinner last night we pretty much ordered everything on the menu and it was all wonderful. First time trying the fried green tomatoes - where have these been all of my life. We can also recommend the fried chicken, grits (of course) collard greens, gumbo, waffles, mac and cheese and corn bread. Being 5:00 on a Thursday night it was pretty quiet and service was spot on. Because everything is made to order it does not all come out of the kitchen at the same time but that's okay. Prices are extremely reasonable."
4/23/2022,20220423,4,4.12,"This place was PHENOMENAL. Came in randomly on a Saturday around 6:30pm. Surprisingly, it was no wait and not a lot of customers at all which was a plus. Got seated and ordered fried chicken, greens, biscuits, and grits. Everything was so damn good!!! The biscuits were the star. Made from scratch, soft and buttery, and the jam paired exquisitely with it. Everything tasted like a home cooked meal and I seriously loved it. The only criticism I have is that they don't have many sides and the place is kind of small. I highly recommend this spot. Especially if you're craving a home cooked meal or soul/comfort food. It seriously made my soul dance!"
4/24/2022,20220424,4,4.12,Hands down one of the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had! It had a little bit of a twist on it and I didn't think I would like I but it was great. Light biscuit and a very filling meal. I had left overs because I couldn't finish it but it was good. This is a mobile / instant pay business. Signs says no cash. The servers both were polite and attentive. If they added alcohol I'd become a definite regular.
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.12,"This was some good eating!!!!! I know they've been around for a while but this was my first visit. The service was great. I loved the contactless ordering. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. If I had known the biscuits and gravy had fried chicken AND andouille sausage, I would have passed on the bacon. It was great and very filling. AND IT WAS $15 Y'ALL!!!! I tasted the other dishes. The cream cheese strawberry French toast was SO GOOD!!!! It was on another level good with a carmelized slight crunch in each bite. The salmon croquette dish was delicious with some of the best fingerling potatoes. The shrimp and grits were rich and very tasty. Selfish on the shrimp though. Would definitely return."
5/1/2022,20220501,5,4.13,Oh Luella's. Why are you SO delicious?! Your shrimp and grits is multi-layered with savory deliciousness and creamy perfection. Your gumbo is so perfectly spiced and rich. The collards are flavored so well with smoky pork and perfectly cooked. And your big biscuits are almost unnecessary after all that but who can resist? I should try some more things. Maybe I will. But these favorites keep me coming back.
5/11/2022,20220511,1,4.12,"The food is good, but we will not be returning/ordering from here again. We have had several issues with takeout and delivery in the past and we have let it slide knowing that all restaurants have struggled during COVID. We recently placed an order on Grubhub for Mother's Day dinner. After waiting 2+ hours for our food, Grubhub called to tell us Luella's canceled our order and would not fulfil it. We even called Luella's directly to give them a chance to make it right and no one returned out call. Bottom line, if you are not going to accept Grubhub orders, do not take them."
5/15/2022,20220515,5,4.12,"AMAZING! So glad there's a real tasty black owned business up north. We ordered the chicken and waffles, salmon croquettes w/potatoes and buttermilk biscuits & Mac n cheese! It all came out to around $70. We brung our own bottle and the experience was amazing. The service was also top tier! The saloon croquettes were honestly amazing and very filling. Love Luella's!"
5/22/2022,20220522,5,4.12,Everything was good. Saw the French toast online and it was definitely worth it. There was no salt and pepper shaker on the table but to my surprise the collard greens didn't need any additional season.
5/25/2022,20220525,5,4.12,"Since moving to Chicago during the pandemic I had been waiting to try this place, and I was not disappointed. The chicken was delicious, a huge serving of 3 large pieces. I like their greens, but they needed a bit more seasoning. As a southerner, their grits are on point and I cannot wait to have them again. The only thing they get wrong is the Nashville chicken -- there should have been a coating layer of cayenne seasoning, and only a drizzle of sauce -- (it was all sauce), it needed the traditional white bread and pickles to balance out the heat -- so Nashville chicken it was just OK. Ask for extra sauce for dipping. I love that it is BYOB.People come from all over for this place, and it's worth it."
