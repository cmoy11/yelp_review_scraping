5/25/2012,20120525,4,4.0,"Thanks Thrillist.com...saw their review about Berries & Batter's opening day today. Stopped by to see about some French Toast. Tried their French Toast Sampler -Delicious! also got a side order of their very tasty patty sausage, which I will recommend as well. See photos."
5/26/2012,20120526,3,3.5,"JL and I decided to try this place for brunch and overall, it's a nice addition to the neighborhood. The menu is not quite as extensive as many of the other popular places to brunch, and that may be why the options available try to seem a cut above the standard fare. You won't find a regular omelet on this menu, as all of the omelets are ""deconstructed"". What is a deconstructed omelet, one may ask, and I was set on finding out. JL, SL and I each ordered a deconstructed omelet - one spinach and swiss, one broccoli and cheddar, and one chicken and peppers. When the food arrived, I have to say, I was a little disappointed because it looked just like a plain old omelet. The only difference might be that the cheese and some of the other ingredients were on the top, but they were on top of (drum roll please) a plain old omelet! By not having the cheese inside, I actually felt that the omelet itself was a bit dry. SP had the Cluck and Gravy - a dish that was described as ""chicken and corn muffins...topped with chicken sausage gravy"". All his favorite things! During the wait for our food, he mentioned several times that he could not wait to eat. I guess he was hungry. When his dish came out, we were all expecting a decadent plate of chicken, muffins and gravy, but nothing could be farther from the truth. His dish consisted of mostly hash browns, with a little square sauce dish that contained 3 half dollar-sized biscuits, topped with a couple tablespoons of gravy. Alas, there were no corn muffins, nor was there any chicken. The size of his main dish could literally fit in my cupped palm. Now, was it yummy? It certainly wasn't bad. It just wasn't what a hungry man would expect. The ""corn muffins"" were unique in that they were neither muffin nor biscuit, but something in between. Soft, moist little tiny morsels studded with corn. The gravy was also flavorful without being overly rich, and the amount of gravy was not so much that it would ruin the texture of the muffin/biscuits. In a nutshell, this was biscuits and gravy without the guilt (or the heart attack). Lucky for SP, we ordered the french toast flight to share, so most of my omelette made its way into his plate while I happily dedicated my attention to the carbs.Now onto the french toast. I don't eat french toast all that often, because most of the times it is drowned in butter and syrup. Some will say that that's just how french toast should be, but I disagree. French toast should consist of bread that has soaked in the goodness of the egg and other flavorings, without being overwhelmed by it. It should be custardy, not soggy, and each bit should satisfy the taste buds without sending your blood sugar to alarming levels. This french toast was just that. The lemon was absolutely divine, topped with what looked like candied lemon zest that made it taste like lemon frosting. The caramel was topped with candied walnuts and caramel sauce and again, was so delicious without being overly heavy or cloying. This was french toast that you could eat everyday. Overall, I think what stood out to me the most was that all of the dishes seemed to be fairly healthy. There are sweet potato hash browns in addition to regular hash browns and neither had the typical tell-tale signs of having been doused in butter and oil. All of the dishes enabled you to taste the ingredients first and foremost, without masking it in the (delicious) taste of butter. Brunch without the guilt? Why not?"
5/26/2012,20120526,5,4.0,My sister and I heard about this place on thrillest and decided to check it out. I have to say the food was so good that we came back for breakfast and lunch. I had the chicken deconstructed omelet and OMG was it good!!! The vegetables and chicken that were on top were not only really well seasoned and tasty but were very fresh. My sister tried the cluck-n-gaufre. I Had a few bites and I have to say it was very interesting. It had the most amazing sweet and savory taste. The flavors married really well together. It was a sweet potato waffle with chicken stuffed inside with a maple butter. Unbelievable! For lunch I ate breakfast again and tried the banana nut waffle which was so good I didn't use any syrup. It had caramelized bananas on top of a waffle that reminded me of banana pudding. YUM!!! My sister had the salmon sliders. I noticed that this dish was very tasty yet light. On top of the good food the service was great as well along with their decor. I would definitely recommend this place. Great addition to Lincoln Park!!!!!
5/27/2012,20120527,3,3.75,"If you want good pancakes, visit this spot. I had the Buckwheat pancakes - not a high level of buckwheat in the batter (I like that), but I could clearly taste the flavor. Nice fruit accompaniments, a maple butter and maple syrup, which makes a difference to me.There was a mix of families with kids and adults. The staff was very nice, service was pretty quick and I enjoyed Sunday brunch. Next time I'll check out the omelets."
5/28/2012,20120528,5,4.0,"The French Toast was the best I've ever had. Didn't even need syrup!! I tried the flight of french toast which was a sample of four different flavors. I thought that the lemon flavor was the best. If you're a fan of french toast, you won't be disappointed."
5/29/2012,20120529,4,4.0,"They had me at chicken and waffles! In my opinion, there is truly a desperate need for chicken and waffles on the North Side. Thanks to Batter & Berries, I no longer have to venture far from my very own hood to get a taste of the goods. The description led me to believe it was a sweet potatoe waffle stuffed with chicken. I'm not sure if the waffle batter was sweet potatoe or if just the butter was somehow sweet potatoe flavored. Doesn't matter - all you need to know, it was scrumptious! The waffle actually had been stuffed with chicken!!!! My sister had a deconstructed spinach and mushroom omelet and it was excellent! My fiance had the steak and eggs and he was disappointed with the fact that his steak was overcooked, but you have to keep in mind that this restaurant opened up two days prior so there were some kinks yet to be worked out. For one, the kitchen is very open. Some people might like that, I personally don't. I prefer to live in ignorant bliss; where I do not necessarily need to see where my food comes from or how it got there - just so long as it tastes good, I don't need to be bothered with the details. So I suggest closing that off. They did not yet have any diet beverages, unfortunately. Our server was a bit odd. Not unfriendly or unhelpful, maybe a little blunt and rough in his delivery. Apparently orders are taken on ipad touches; but at first we thought he was just texting rather than taking our order. He also told us our son was cute - ahem, my daughter was wearing a dress and when I corrected him he said he doesn't pay attention to those things. Okay....didn't effect our experience, just an example of his rough exterior.They were able to accomodate 5 adults and 2 high chairs in a matter of minutes without a hassle - perfect! A nice touch having the owner and chef come around to the tables. Bravo, Batter and Berries! We'll see you again before too long!"
5/31/2012,20120531,4,4.0,"We came in for the chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffles topped w/ hot sauce & more fried chicken or muffins with chicken-sausage gravy raved about it the the Thrillist review, but they were out when we ordered. The chef told us that they were remaking the muffins, but we had already ordered by this point. I'm glad we did! The open-faced steak omelet with caramelized onions, mozzarella, and a beefy broth was delicious! The side cranberry muffin was so moist it made me want to try the ones that go with the friend chicken. The hash-browns were the best I've had - not burnt or dry like at Nookies. Chef Chris nails the sweet and savory taste that makes soul food so distinct. I will be dreaming about this breakfast."
6/4/2012,20120604,4,4.0,"5 of us including 1 child went for Sunday brunch. Hostess was very polite and accomodating. Space is cute and distance between tables is appropriate. Ample street parking on Sunday morning when we arrived.Between the 5 of us we ordered chicken sausage, hash browns, french toast flights, steak & egg omelet, fresh fruit, coffee and juice......and since we each love tasting food we tried it all!My opinion, the french toast flights are lovely....good flavor, good variety, perfect serving size. The steak & egg omelet was well flavored but mine was supposed to have swiss but ended up with colby cheese....didn't stop me from eating it one iota and it was still delish. The fruit was fresh and presented nicely and the beverages were fine. My one odd moment was the chicken sausage and hash browns. The sausage has some of the best seasoning I've had in a long while but because it's not encased in skin and I miss the snap you get from biting into sausage. Just a personal preference and not a negative especially if you like patty sausage.However, my hash browns were flavorless and required large amounts of salt and pepper to taste like anything......hopefully it'll be better next round.I didn't have a chance to taste the pancakes, but I'll be back and will go for it soon....real soon."
6/4/2012,20120604,3,3.89,"Just opening up but the place is decent. They still need to work on a couple of kinks.Serve breakfast and lunch all day. *Lemon French Toast: Yes! If you like lemon, get it. The french toast looks like normal french toast but the inside is super moist with almost a creamy lemony center. Lemon zest on top, served with walnuts (tasted like candied walnuts) and lemon maple butter. My only gripe was that it wasn't warm by the time we got it. I think they timed it wrong since it came out at the same time as our other dish (which was warm) but this would have tasted better if they had found a way to keep warm until they brought it out to serve.*Tempura battered Fish and Chips:Light and crisp outside, very flavorful, big hunks of fish cooked well. The fries had a little too much seasoning for my taste but I enjoyed whatever they used to season them Not my #1 brunch place but I would definitely go back...especially for that lemon french toast."
6/9/2012,20120609,5,4.0,"We live in the area and were excited that there is a new cute brunch spot in the neighborhood! We went for breakfast today and the food was incredible. I got the lemon french toast which was fantastic! Very moist and great flavor! My husband got the spinach/mushroom decontructed omlette, which was also incredible! It was very fresh and had a unique mushroom/spinach puree which brought out more flavor! Even the hash browns and bacon were great!It's a very bright and cheerful environment with a lot of beautiful paintings/pictures on the walls. Also I love the island that they have in the center of the place for big groups! The waitress was very friendly and great for giving out her recommendations and the chef came over to introduce himself and make sure everything was good. So overall a great spot with far better food than a lot of brunch spots that I've been to, with none of the waiting (at least yet). Definitely check this place out!"
6/9/2012,20120609,5,4.09,"I too attended the grand opening. I ate the Rylon Salad which was quite delightful with shrimp and mushrooms. My dining partner ate The Arthur, a chicken breast sandwich which she greatly enjoyed (I enjoyed nibbling from it as well, lol)! The decor is bright, pretty, and inviting; I will be back!"
6/10/2012,20120610,5,4.17,"There aren't a lot of restaurants in life that you really want to tell your friends about, well, this us one of them. I was so impressed with the taste! OMG, the chicken and waffles were wonderful and the variety of French Toast, remarkable! I now understand why they said you don't need syrup.A great place for a date, business meeting, a meal with friends or in my case, family friendly. This place is a hit and I encourage you to try."
6/10/2012,20120610,4,4.15,"A new breakfast spot around the corner from our house, glad to see it especially since Salt & Pepper diner still (never? who knows) isn't open. We arrived at 8am (we have a early-rising toddler) and were warmly greeted. It has a cheery atmosphere with good light towards the front. My husband ordered the flight of french toast and he LOVED it. So good. I ordered the bacon/cheese/egg sandwich and I also really enjoyed it. I was most impressed by the side of fruit I ordered for my daughter - it was so nicely displayed I almost didn't want her to eat it! The mint garnish was a nice addition and it was a really lovely fresh fruit variety. Not just a bunch of cantaloupe and melon that usually comes with a fruit side at other breakfast spots. I think the waiter ordering on the ipod was a bit weird; I knew he was taking our order but it instinctively made me feel like he was texting or not paying attention (though I knew he was). I think I'd rather than remember the order or write it down old school. That's just me. Not a complaint just thought it was kind of odd. They had nice quality table toys/games to hand out to the many families that continued to walk in after us. Nice addition to the neighborhood. We'll go back."
6/14/2012,20120614,3,4.07,"I've been here three times since it opened a few weeks ago which is probably a bit embarrassing. It's been hit or miss each time. Food: I would give the omelet 's 1 star (I've ordered them twice) - the ""deconstructed"" broccoli cheese omelet was cold, and the cheddar on top had already solidified by the time it got to me - gross. I understand the Chef wants to showcase the ""freshness"" by putting the broccoli outside the omelet - but even the most amazing broccoli couldn't save a cold solid omelet . My friend's spinach omelet was really soggy and unappealing. They only give you condiments on request, which is a tad pretentious and also shameful for the customer to have to ask for salt. The french toast has been great every time - it isn't stuffed like some of the nearby restaurants (Toast, Kanela's..), but there's a lot of flavor and the maple butter adds something different. If you're willing to take on the calories - I would definitely recommend them - the orange has been my favorite, the caramel pecan is up there as well. Lunch has been a little better for me - the veggie wrap has good (not soggy) veggies. My boyfriend really enjoyed the burger. The fries are awesome - I think they are the main reason I keep going back. Service: The waiters seem really distracted and confused by the process of ordering with their phones and not having a station to enter in items. As a customer it is hard to know the waiter was taking my order or texting a friend - perhaps using tablets or iPads would be easier. I really like the owner and Chef and wish them well - just maybe wait a few weeks until it becomes a fully functional restaurant."
6/17/2012,20120617,5,4.13,"I just went to Batter and Berries for the first time today after service at the Bodhi Center. Best french toast you have ever had in your life!! My friend actually got the french toast sampler and I had some of the lemon french toast, so good. I actually had the kale salad and it was also delicious. This place is run by really good people and has a great vibe. The chef sat down and asked us how things were after our meal - so sweet. I would love to see some smoothies or fresh veggie/fruit combo juices added to the menu. Fantastic overall. My only complaint - the atmosphere so jovial that it got a bit loud, but still more than worth it."

We loved that the chef came out to greet us and chat.The food is superb. I recommend ""The Goof"" (an updated spin on chicken 'n waffles), the french toast options (lots of fruit flavors) or ""The Executive"" (steak and eggs).This is will be my family's new breakfast spot for sure."

Today I had an amazing fresh and yummy egg white omelet with mushrooms and spinach -would have it again tomorrow! I also had the ceased chicken wrap last week and that was terrific too!Show up and support this great new neighborhood gem!
6/24/2012,20120624,2,4.2,"Food here was okay, but the service was terrible.I brunch with with my girlfriends about once a month, and since a few of us live in the neighborhood we thought we'd give this new local spot a try. Sadly, the service was so poor we will not go back. The server was slow to come introduce himself, slow to take our order, we had to flag him to get coffee refills after all three of our mugs were completely empty, and waited about 40 minutes after we ordered our food to have it on the table. His apology was that ""the kitchen is really small,"" which is a) not true because you can see right inside the kitchen from most of the tables, and b) a poor excuse, since we saw several other tables who were seated after us get their food significantly sooner than we did.The french toast was pretty good (I had the ""flight"" and liked the lemon best) but was not so amazing to risk wasting so much time waiting for it to come. Sorry Batter & Berries - I liked the idea and was hopeful this would be the new neighborhood gem, but I will not be back."

Shrimp was big and chunky, fries were the perfect side. My daughter had the blueberry Belgian waffle, and devoured it without syrup which speaks volumes for the flavor!"

7/1/2012,20120701,5,4.12,"I went here for brunch last Sunday with a group of six. I feel that several of their service kinks have been worked out. Service was phenomenal. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. Our table ordered lemon and blueberry frenchtoast, a French toast flight, chicken and waffles, a classic and a breakfast sandwhich. About twenty minutes later the food came out together and hot. I was impressed with the wait time as they seemed to be quite busy. The waiter was also very attentive in filling up our water and coffee throughout the entire time. The chef/owner came out to chat with us and the rest of the tables which was a nice touch. It is true that they do not serve standard breakfast condiments because the chef believes in creating flavorful dishes that don't require extras. I can respect that. And if you ask for salt, syrup, or whatever, they are happy to give it to you. We were all very pleased and impressed with our experience at Batter and Berries and plan to become regulars for their French toast."

7/2/2012,20120702,5,4.18,"I don't write a lot of yelp reviews though I do go out to eat quite a bit.

We love this sunny breakfast spot. The staff is warm and attentive with the chef making rounds to the table. The coffee is good and regularly refreshed. The food is really exceptional. The scrambled eggs are fluffy and flavorful. the hashbowns have a nice crispness to them and are a little finer than the usual grade. They make their own sausage -both chicken and pork- and both had a real freshness and herbiness to them. We have also tried the caramel french toast served with a flavored butter. It really is out of this world. It doesn't need syrup for my tastes, but if you like yours a bit sweeter they'll bring you complimentary real maple syrup. I really don't think I'm exaggerating on of these points. We look forward to returning soon!"

7/9/2012,20120709,5,4.29,"Okay, this place is amazing. I just types Brunch into the Yelp search bar and had Lincoln Park set as the neighborhood. I hadn't even heard of this place before, and I like to consider myself in the know about new restaurants, especially brunch places. The service was great. They told us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for a group of 4, but we only waited about five. They serve Mighty Lead tea which won me over at the beginning. I'm not much for french toast so I ordered the Cluck-N-Gaeurf which is a sweet potato waffle infused with chicken with maple butter. They places a grilled chicken breast soaked in hot sauce on tops of this scrumptious waffle. It was absolutely outstanding. A little steep at $13 but it was worth it. My friends all ordered french toast and agreed it was the best they had ever had. The offer a french toast flight which allows you to try all the options. They also have a special type of french toast that they offer once a week. I loved everything about this place, this is the real deal my friends."
7/14/2012,20120714,5,4.31,"Delicious food and very friendly service! Had breakfast here for the first time on 7/13/12 with 4 friends. We each ordered something different and we all loved our food. The French Toast is absolutely incredible. The omelets are superb, with the ingredients layered on top of the eggs so you can really taste every flavor. Everything is FRESH and they use all natural ingredients, nothing artificial. (There's not even Sweet & Low in the sugar container) Chef/owner Derek Rylon made a point to come over and speak with us before we ordered to explain his cooking methods and later to ask if we were enjoying everything. Our waiter was lots of fun, asking us silly riddles, which had us all laughing and added to the experience. We can't wait to go back and work our way through the various items on the menu ( I have my eye on their version of a Reuben sandwich). I can highly recommend this restaurant."

7/15/2012,20120715,2,4.29,"After seeing this place with such a cute name pop up recently, my boyfriend and I decided to go check it out for brunch. The Chef came by to greet us and the other two couples who were waiting, and I thought it was nice of him to be so welcoming. We were seated within 5 minutes and that's when everything went downhill.It took about 45 minutes for us to receive our orders of French toast, which can be overlooked since this is a relatively new place. However, I was very offended by the waiter when he finally gave us our food and said, ""Sorry for the wait guys, but it's worth it, you'll see,"" before he rudely ran away without asking if we wanted anything else. I had to flag down another waiter to ask for syrup for the French toast, which should have been standard at every table.We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink, or checked on to see if we wanted refills of our drinks the entire time we were there. Although we received our food at the same time, the table of four next to ours received their dishes 15 minutes apart. Another complaint is that there were no fans and the thermostat right by our table read 79F. It would be nice if they could make it a little bit more comfortable in there. There was a couple with a small child also sitting next to us, who waited for their food about the same amount of time as us. They ended up taking their food to-go after the Chef came out and explained why everything takes so long to make. I don't think that amount of wait for food is acceptable, and all the chef/owner needed to do was apologize instead of trying to justify himself/make excuses.Overall, the food was really good, the service needs some serious improvements. There's hope for this restaurant though. I'd recommend waiting until they have things in order before stopping by this place."
7/15/2012,20120715,5,4.31,"B&B is a relatively new breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in what was previously a somewhat desolate stretch of Lincoln Ave. It is a welcome addition. On a recent weekend morning, we were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was packed. The crowd was a nice mix: families, young couples, and folks from what appeared to be a variety of walks of life. The dining room itself is great: bright, open, and filled with a nice vibe from all the excitement. I like the abundance of natural light, which makes for perfect newspaper reading.We were greeted by a very nice, efficient waitress within a few minutes. I had several questions about the menu, and she answered each knowledgeably and without seeming hurried (even though she was slammed). We ordered and the chef/owner, Rylon, soon made his way to our table. He is quite personable and very obviously passionate about food and his restaurant.  His presence in the dining room is a nice touch.We ordered a salad and the spinach omelette. Both were excellent: fresh, flavorful, and not the typically sink-in-your-stomach brunch fare.  I'm eager to go back and sample additional things on the menu."
7/16/2012,20120716,5,4.33,"This restaurant is a wonderful addition to the neighboorhood. I found that all of the servers were extremely kind. The interior is cool without trying too hard. Well-lit, stylish, and relaxing atmosphere.The chef randomly came over and made conversation with us, which was great. He was funny and friendly.We had the best french toast we've ever had in our lives.Ever. The chef's salad was flavorful and unique. I'm really looking forward to trying more of the dishes here.This is a world-class breakfast. Definitely coming back here again. I hope this restaurant makes a ton of money. It was a great experience."
7/16/2012,20120716,4,4.32,"This is a great place for breakfast/lunch on the weekdays ($9 lunch trio with salad, soup, and a half-sandwich) and for brunch on the weekends.The ingredients are fresh and the food is delicious. The wait staff is very friendly and competent.I have only two suggestions: (1) Chef Rylon explained that his deconstructed omelets are designed to showcase the quality of the ingredients. Ok, I believe him, but I prefer my omelet ingredients mixed in. Consider adding a ""constructed omelet"" option. (2) The kitchen can be a tad slow. On the weekdays, especially, people want to be able to get their meals, eat, and go. Pick up the pace! Bottom line: Support this Black-owned Northside local business!"
7/16/2012,20120716,3,4.29,"Thanks again to Thrillist for introducing another fabulous, new Chicago establishment to mi estomac!B: etter plan to order some french toast bc this is what they're (Chef Rylon came by and told us himself) known for!A: te the flight of french, which included blueberry, strawberry, lemon, and caramel, and I surprisingly liked the lemon the best. T: he batter's infused with the flavors, so it's not just the topping delivering the boom!T: oast aside, P and I shared the traditional breakfast, 2 eggs, hash browns, and house made pork sausage.E: asy enough street parking on Lincoln.R: eally energetic and loud in here, so make sure to bring your boisterous voice for conversation."
7/18/2012,20120718,5,4.3,"Wow, what a find! The chef/owner introduced himself & gave us his mission statement. The waiter was such fun & asked us riddles. But the best thing was the food. The 'deconstructed' omelettes (everything fresh & separate - not chucked into the mix) were great & huge. The emphasis is on fresh, natural & expertly cooked food. The French toast is to die for - by far the best we'd ever tasted. And the home made pastries were awesome. We went on a quiet day, so it would be interesting to see it on a weekend. The owner asks for suggestions & complaints. He wants to get it right!"

7/23/2012,20120723,4,4.31,"This place is a solid 4 star brunch. It's bright, welcoming, friendly, and the opposite of every pretentious new brunch place that seems to open once a fortnight. Sure, the menu seems like it was printed out at the place, and put in to clear plastic envelopes, but that's almost endearing, as if they care more about the food they're putting out, than the aesthetics of the presentation of the food list. I'm a savory ""brah:"" eggs, sausage, ham, omelets, bacon, skillets, the usual. This time I went for sweet, as so much of their menu was just that, pancakes, french toast, and another thing, with a name I can't remember. French toast flight arrived in a timely fashion with strawberry (good, but not really too distinct,) blueberry (tasty,) caramel something something (decadent and delicious,) lemon something (my least favorite, but not by any definition ""bad"",) and a key-lime special. Again, it was all quite good, but keep in mind I'm not a sweets guy, and if I am, french toast is like the bronze medal behind waffles and pancakes. Like a distant bronze. Waffles and pancakes are all head to head, but then waffles pull forward like Mark Cavendish, leaving enough time between the two, like maybe 12 seconds, to be noticeable, but not really change up the field too much, as they're going in to the mountains the next day.Girlfriend went traditional with a sweet potato hash. I like my sweet taters savory, and this was a little more traditional brown sugar sweet. That being said, they were really enjoyable, but hot damn, the ham steak that came with her meal? That was REALLY well done. Not well done in the way that it was overcooked, but in the way that it was prepared excellently. The eggs also looked good, but I was too busy chowing on FT to pay attention. Some folks on here have complained about the lack of salt, pepper, and syrup on the table, and to you fine people I say ""try it first."" Seriously, just try it before you start saying that you NEED syrup for french toast. I bet half of you pour that aunt jamima ""pancake syrup"" on your stuff, not even real maple. Fine, each to their own, but this french toast didn't need more sweet stuff on it, it was fine just the way the outrageously-social-chef-who-came-around-to-every-table-twice intended it to be. Also, look on the menu, it even says something to the degree of ""try it first"".Sweet: Clean, quick seating, friendly service. Really friendly service, it felt family run.

Good thing the food didn't match the decor...The staff was super friendly and the food was quite tatsy. Everything was fresh, and there were some interesting takes on the food. I'd pobably rate the food a solid 3.5. I really enjoyed their fresh house made sausages. I ordered their biscuits and gravy. The gravy was damn tasty, but the portion was on the small side. Everyone else's orders were much larger, so i wouldn't knock them for it, but I also wouln't order it again.If I lived in the area i'd come by on a regular basis, but given that I don't live in that neighbohood, I doubt you will ever see me there again.

7/31/2012,20120731,5,4.29,"This place is awesome- what I especially love is everything is made in house. They roast the poultry, link the sausage, bake their own pastries, even go so far as to make their own chipotle ketchup (surprisingly awesome) and spicy pickles. The service there was extremely friendly and the Chef had the best Bulls chef hat I've ever seen, maybe the only one I've ever seen. My boyfriend and I both ordered deconstructed omelettes even though we had no idea what it meant- I got the mushroom and spinach, he got the chicken fajita. When the plates came out, we saw why they are deconstructed- everything but the cheese is presented on top of the omelette rather than inside. The owner/chef of the place came by our table to chat and explained that a deconstructed omelette showcases the fresh ingredients they use in house (I can attest to that, everything was without a doubt insanely fresh). Most breakfast spots throw in their old veggies when making an omelette, chop it up nice and small so we would never notice. Never thought about that, but the freshness of the omelettes will definitely bring me back to Batter and Berries.Next time, gotta try the french toast. The workers were swearing by it and they even have a money back guarentee if you are not satisfied with it- not that I want the money, I just want an awesome French Toast"

Ambiance on a Sunday is boisterous and alive- not for those looking for a peaceful brunch. Thanks for a great start to the day!

8/12/2012,20120812,4,4.34,"The flight of the french toast was indeed as good as described by everyone else. There was no wait for a late sunday brunch and the chef personally came out to ask how everything was going. Service started a little slow but she got a lot more attentive as others left and she had fewer tables to take care of (she seemed to be assigned all tables as she appeared to be the only server). My friend has the deconstructed omelet and liked it, but I certainly think their french toast is the real winner."

Friend said ""Let's leave early and go to some place cool for breakfast in the city"". ""No problem"", I said. And I turned to YOU! I hate to repeat but I ditto much of the reviews. Cute place (a little noisy with a crying baby), great french toast (and I didn't need syrup!). I would pass on the sweet potato hashbrowns. Great staff, helpful and funny (riddles and all) and totally enjoyed Chef Rylon visiting everyone. I even saw him with a broom and dust pan sweeping in the kitchen. What a hands on owner! I will be back!!!"
8/13/2012,20120813,5,4.36,"I used to think Toast had the best french toast in the country. Batter and Berries proved me wrong.I got the french toast flight, which is enormous. Each one was delicious, and although each piece has toppings, the flavors are also baked into the batter. I don't even like lemon sweets, but the lemon french toast was truly exceptional. This is my new favorite Chicago breakfast spot. The food was very fresh, and the service was friendly and quick. The prices were extremely reasonable. The waitstaff was very attentive, and the chef came out to introduce himself at each table, a charming touch."
8/19/2012,20120819,4,4.35,"We went here for brunch this morning and it was delicious! I was craving a breakfast sandwich so that's what I ordered and it was really good. I got a side order of hash browns and they were okay. They would have been better with salt but there was none on the table and our waiter never came back to check on how we were doing. My boyfriend got the french toast sampler platter thing and it was delicious. I've never had flavored french toast before, but I tried each of his pieces. He liked the strawberry the best but I think the lemon was good, but actually they were all great! When we go back it's definitely what I'll be ordering! The decor of the restaurant is super adorable but the layout could pose problems. There's a raised bar like table in the center of the room and due to the fact that it is raised and the tables surrounding it are at the regular level, well let's just hope if any girls are wearing skirts, they're crossing their legs! Our waiter was very nice and friendly but, like I said, he never came back to see how we were doing after dropping off our food, aside from quickly filling my water once after I was done eating, so I never got the salt for my hash browns. Also, they take their orders on ipod touches which, while it's pretty cool, kind of seemed awkward, like he was texting someone while taking our order; I guess it's just new technology to get used to. Chef Rylon was out walking around and talking to everyone. He was very nice and friendly and it was really cool to meet him. Overall the restaurant was great. We will definitely be back but have to knock it down one for service."
8/25/2012,20120825,4,4.35,"Pretty good. I love french toast and never thought a place could base their menu around it, but Batter & Berries have succeeded. First of all the southern-like hospitality is just unheard of. The chef and owner came out to discuss the menu items, tell stories and welcome us to the restaurant. Then he came back to see what we thought- seriously! I had the strawberry french toast, with strawberries in the batter and on top- something about them caramelized and it was addicting. Even the has browns were cooked to perfection. I'll definitely be back to try the chicken and biscuits. Suggestions: The hostess claimed it would be a 20 min. wait so we sat at the bar (not real bar- but high table) yet there were empty tables the entire time we were there. Up the service, but keep the food as is!"
8/27/2012,20120827,4,4.34,"Great breakfast place! The food is very fresh, and not dripping in oil like diner-type breakfast food. The enthusiastic owner/chef came and checked on us multiple times, which was nice. I was glad to be able to go on a week day when there was no wait. I'd definitely go back, and even wait in the weekend line!"
9/1/2012,20120901,5,4.35,"Drove from the south side based on the rave reviews of friends.  The food and service was excellent. We were promptly greeted upon entrance, actually the owner came outside to say hello while I stood outside reading the menu! I had the super flight of French Toast and each flavor was delicious!  Don't ruin them by putting syrup on them because it isn't needed.  I also had the chicken sausage which I honestly did not like unfortunately. My husband had the ribs which were baby backs and delicious as well as the grilled veggies and hash browns.  This place is a true hit and we will be back!"
9/1/2012,20120901,4,4.35,"Really 3.5 stars but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now because it's new.Solid new breakfast place in Lakeview. The menu is mainly french toast and belgian waffles, with some deconstructed omelettes and sides. I got the deconstructed spinach omelette, my husband got the fried chicken and waffles, and we split a flight of french toast (1 of each of the 4 flavors). The french toast really is amazing and definitely worth going back for. It's made with homemade batter so each kind really tastes fresh and different rather than just a piece of regular french toast with flavored sauce on it.My husband really like the fried chicken and chicken-stuffed waffles but said the chicken in the waffles was kind of weird. The deconstructed omelette is just okay- I really think they need to step it up a bit in their egg department and offer their omelettes also as scrambles, and also have a build your own omelette option. Either way, I know that putting the toppings on top of the omelette makes it easier to make the omelette, but it is a lot more difficult to eat- everything just fell out.Overall though, good food, service was efficient and friendly, reasonable prices, and best of all, no wait. Go for the french toast though, it's awesome."
9/2/2012,20120902,5,4.36,Fantastic! Great tasting food! Excellent menu selections I couldn't figure out what to order I nearly wanted about seven things on the menu. Guess that means I'll be coming back. Service was a bit slow but for a small restaurant cooking everything from scratch and fresh I was prepared. The chef is So friendly and personable. We will definitely be coming back!
9/3/2012,20120903,4,4.35,"I've eaten here twice very recently. First with Blake M who is a breakfast aficionado and then with Alex M, gourmand extraordinaire. First round: me: Strawberry French toast--lively strawberry taste and cooked to perfection (on the sweet side, so I worked a 1/2 slice trade with Blake M for a 1/4 blueberry waffle). Again, the fruit is monster good. Of the two, I'd go with the blueberry waffle--not as sweet, a tasty, near crisp waffle-very good!Second round: me: Caramelize banana with waffle--again sweet (1/4 trade with Alex M for fruit pancakes taste). The pancakes have lemon in them, at least for this dish. Interesting, but that piece of information should be on the menu.This is another one of the city breakfast dining delight storefronts. Go and enjoy!Oh, and each time I went, the hostess was friendly and outgoing (not as complained about in an earlier review by another. Maybe a bad day or they read the review).p.s. to me: you're ordering too sweet! Stop it!"
9/11/2012,20120911,5,4.36,"Had breakfast here for the first time this morning as part of a business group I belong to. The pancakes were fantastic - they were crisp on the outside (in a good way) and soft and yummy on the inside, with a slight lemon flavor. Best buttermilk pancakes I've ever had. The chef came out to chat with us and the staff was really friendly. I'm already planning a trip back to try the french toast!"
9/17/2012,20120917,2,4.33,"I visited this restaurant for brunch a few weeks after it opened so thing may be better, I wanted to like it more as it is a two minute walk from home for me... The food was good, I had the flight of French toast...Maybe this is just a personal preference but i hate how everything is served on glass plate, you can see right through you plate to the table...it didn't help that our table was sticky/ dirty when we arrived; i waited for one of the employees who were standing around chatting to check in with us after we were seated... After about 5 minutes I got up and asked them for a napkin to wipe down the table, instead of coming over to help they handed me a napkin as if it was my problem... I was annoyed that the service was so poor... The chef came out to ask us how everything was, that was nice. I split the bill and the staff didn't know how to do it, I guess it was a new system and they didn't know how. Overall poor service but pretty good food"
9/26/2012,20120926,2,4.3,"sunday. our weekly family brunch. this was a new spot for us. me no likey all that much, unfortunately.me and the bro ordered the chicken and waffles. this is chicken-stuffed waffles with chicken on the side, in a spicy syrup. i gotta say, the waffle batter is more on the cakey/doughy/drier side. the chicken was white meat and dry. the spicy syrup was not too bad. it was tasty and a ton of flavor, but it was dry. disappointed.my nieces weren't havin' the pancakes and syrup. the reg syrup tasted weird to both of them, so they didn't eat much. oh and the batter had a ton of nutmeg. dude, easy on that.the server was nice. decor is strange. one thing they do have down - the hashbrowns. they were the shit."
9/28/2012,20120928,3,4.28,"Hubby and I stopped in here after our dentist appointments on a Saturday morning and had a pleasant breakfast. I had the blueberry french toast and hubby had a deconstructed omelette. The french toast was very good and I appreciated that I didn't have to slather it in syrup (in fact this is frowned upon). They infuse the french toast with fruit and it is cooked to be a little crispy on the outside and soft in the center. Hubby enjoyed his omelette. I have two reasons for not giving this place 5 stars. The first is the decor/ambiance. The walls are a very jarring yellow and the artwork reminds me a of a daycare. This is one of those places that needs to decide what it wants to be. Are you a classy restaurant where the chef has a visible presence and syrup and substitutions are frowned upon? Or are you a decent breakfast place with yellow walls and art from an old lady's garage sale? Cuz you can't be both.My other issue, if you can call it that, was with the service. Our server was friendly and our food was served promptly. The service lacked confidence. This is probably because the place is new, but there is no other way to describe it. She did not seem comfortable doing what she was doing.If we are back in the area, this is probably a place we would go but we wouldn't make a special trip up to Lincoln Park for it."
9/29/2012,20120929,5,4.29,"We were down from Madison visiting my brother and his wife in Lakeview East. We've been unimpressed with some of their area breakfast joints in the past, as have they, so we Yelped around for a bit. This was one they hadn't heard of, so we headed down.Right off the bat the server was great and offered up a few riddles while we browsed the menu. The chef came out and said hello, and told us how blown away we would be by the food.And yes, the food... We ordered a ""French Toast SuperFlight"" for the table, which is all of the french toast offerings on the menu + the special, which that day was a banana brulée... We could have probably stopped there; when they arrived we devoured it like a pack of wild dingos. Everyone had their favorite, but a big hit was the pecan toast, which was an imitation and then improvement over the concept of a pecan bun. My wife was a bit bored by the biscuits & gravy (so was I) but if we hadn't had had the french toast first, I doubt we would have felt the same. It was a good solid version. I'm always willing to judge a place by it's chicken and waffles (Hearty Boys wasn't so great) and have had some great incarnations of this in the past, and this was definitely one of the best and most interesting. As other reviewers have noted, there is chicken IN the waffle and it's served alongside a wonderfully breaded chicken with a spicy syrup/sauce. It was amazing. Just go... This place needs to be in business by the time we get back to Chicago!"
10/1/2012,20121001,5,4.3,Great brunch with no wait for now. Super friendly staff and the best French toast in town. Get the sampler. The chicken and waffle is fantastic as well
10/5/2012,20121005,5,4.31,Arguably the best breakfast in Chicago. The French toast super flight is a must try.
10/5/2012,20121005,5,4.32,"I had the Chicken and Waffles and my wife had the flight of french toast., along with the chicken sausage and hash browns everything was good. I was concerned at first about the hot nutmeg sauce for breakfast but to my surprise it was tasty! This is our new best breakfast spot!...Decor? who the hell cares about decor? Is the food good? Yes, was it served quickly? Yes...Was it served hot? Yes.....Was the Staff helpful and friendly? Yes! Then nothing else matters.....When traveling the truck stops always had the best food, there is no decor in a truck stop....If you want decor go eat downtown! If you want good food, check this place out."
10/9/2012,20121009,4,4.31,"The super flight french toast is AMAZING! This place is a good start for a new place. Our waiter was very funny with riddles. The service is a bit slow, but I went during Sunday primetime brunch hours. The chef came out and greeted every table. It is a simple and nice atmosphere."
10/9/2012,20121009,4,4.31,"I have a good feeling about this place. I am thinking if all future visits go as well as our first, we'll be stopping in quite a bit. It's nice to have a convenient brunch spot that's not too hard to get into. Honestly, that worried me a little bit, but I needn't have been concerned. Their thing, as the name says, is batter (french toast primarily) and berries adorning the dishes. The husband got the special french toast, blackberry cheesecake...yum. Somehow they infused butter with cream cheese. It was magnificent. I got the waffle with caramelized bananas. Mmmm. I could have used a few more banana slices, but it was very nice. I do agree with what some of the others have said about the decor. I don't get it. Some of it is for sale, e.g., temporary, I hope, but it's kind of bright and jarring. I'm being really picky, but as an editor, I hate the font they're using in the menu and signage. It's like...almost jester. And no one likes jester. I think we also saw the chef/owner walking around. That's nice to see, and to know the chef is invested in your experience. Ooh also I want to try the lunch. I think I saw pretzel buns..."
10/11/2012,20121011,5,4.32,We live in the neighborhood and loving walking over for Sunday brunch...the food is amazing and the staff is so friendly.
10/13/2012,20121013,5,4.33,"The best French toast I've ever had. Doesn't need syrup. Quite frankly I think u would ruin it if u did. I got the super flight that included lemon, blueberry, hazelnut, strawberry. This is a black owned business and chef Rylon came out to talk to us before and after breakfast they have chicken sausage here we want to try next time. Kid portions available. My son got the chocolate chip pancakes."
10/14/2012,20121014,5,4.33,"This place is gourmet breakfast at a very reasonable cost! The French toast flight is original and delightful! Flavors like lemon, strawberry, blueberry hazelnut! Chicken sausage is homemade.. Hell everything is homemade, and the atmosphere is vibrant and soulful.. This of one place you have to visit.."
10/17/2012,20121017,5,4.34,"I am half tempted to write a negative review, just to deter people from coming here. But that would be selfish of me. Everyone needs to enjoy this place, because it is worth a trip.GET THE FRENCH TOAST FLIGHT! For all that is good in this world, get the french toast flight. It is french toast like I've never had before. When I went, the special of the day was butterscotch french toast. Add it for a dollar or two extra. Worth every penny. Also, the butter is amazing. Homemade and delicious!My girlfriend ordered the omelet and enjoyed it, though not as much as I enjoyed my french toast. She actually ended up eating more of my breakfast than she did of hers. The chef is awesome. He knows that he makes a great food and is clearly proud of it. He is friendly and goes to every single table to say hi.GO THERE! Why are you reading this review? Get off your chair and go to Batter & Berries."
10/17/2012,20121017,5,4.35,"Okay, I am a skeptical breakfast eater and a connoisseur of the Hollandaise at any restaurant with Old Bay, or just the standard. At any rate, the Poof(?) was, if I remember this right, a chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle with a fried chicken breast on half and nutmeg hot sauce. It was life altering.I think I read another review of this dish that wasn't as glowing as mine and that's a shame they didn't have the same glorious platter of waffles and chicken that proves that God(insert your personal god) indeed loves us.I am a huge fan.BTW, the Rib Eye my dining companion ordered was cooked a perfect MR and the eggs well made as well."
10/18/2012,20121018,5,4.36,"So, I've been to this place a few times, and it seems to just get better every time I go. I've come for breakfast, brunch, family get togethers, business meetings, all that jazz. That's why I finally had to post about it...Decor: Puts me in the mind set of being in a beautiful natural setting for a relaxing walk. I can almost hear the tranquility of the water coming out of the wall art. Really serene.Service: I seem to always get this nice guy that gives us a few riddles while taking care of our order. A real nice addition to the brunch experience. The chef always comes out to greet us, and that's nice. Price: Very reasonable for the type of food you get. This is breakfast to another level, and thank God its reasonable enough for me to enjoy it!FOOD!!: This is the icing on the cake! The food is outstanding! I must say the flight of french toast is outstanding! I am not a french toast eater, but this place takes it up a few notches! Whatever your ""10"" is for french toast, then this must be a ""13"" because it takes your mind past what you would expect french toast to be. Truly mind blowing. I've also had the waffle, wraps, burger, salmon sliders, steak sandwich, and salad, and they all have been exceptional. This is brunch to the next level... Hope this helps, and if you're in the area, make sure you go! And if you're not in the area, get in your car and drive there! ITS THAT GOOD!!!"
10/19/2012,20121019,3,4.34,The food was pretty good; IF YOU LIKE THE GREASTEST FRENCH TOAST THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC! Unfortunately I had scream in ALL CAPS when eating there because the music is SOOOOOO loud. If they would turn it down a bit I'd be here more often.
10/22/2012,20121022,5,4.35,"I felt compelled to write my own thoughts after I saw a few unfavorable reviews that just don't do this place justice whatsoever. Hands down, THE best breakfast joint I've ever been to. This has been echoed by a few of my family members and my girlfriend as well. The french toast flight is absolutely incredible. No syrup needed with Chef Rylon's maple butter, which is also amazingly good. For anyone who likes french toast or waffles, order them here and I promise you will not be disappointed. I've eaten here 5 times now and I have left very happy every time.Chef Rylon also makes it a point to say hello to each table and thank them for stopping in. I found that unique nowadays, and a bonus for a place serving such amazing food."
10/22/2012,20121022,5,4.36,"Such great service!  The chef came and spoke to us twice, the hostess did the same, and our waiter was hilarious- very upbeat and friendly. The recommendations were really helpful! Four of us shared the french toast flight as an appetizer- all five were completely infused with flavor. All four of our meals were delicious and would recommend this place to anyone for brunch"
10/22/2012,20121022,4,4.35,"quick service, food was great & we met the chef which made me want to come back and support a great business... I'll give it 5 stars once my husband gives his stamp of approval"
10/25/2012,20121025,5,4.36,"The food here is amazing. The best breakfast I have ever had. You have to try the Flight of French Toast - even if you are not a french toast fan - I guarantee you will be. No sryup needed. I still can't decide if the lemon or the carmel french toast is my favorite. Love the freshness of all the ingredients. So refreshing to have a chef that really cares that his customers are happy. We drive from Matteson, IL every week. I have told everyone I can about this place - and they all agree - it's delicious. So worth the drive - no matter where you are."
10/27/2012,20121027,5,4.37,"Great place! Scallops, Asperagus and mushrooms on my omelette, please! Service was good. Based on previous reviews, they must have worked on this.. Food was timely and amazing flavor. A bit pricy, but I did order sea scallops on my omelette. (and they did NOT skimp on the scallops, on size or quality) After the meal, the chef held the door for us, thanked us for coming and talked with us about his ever changing menu. Thanks chef Raylon! We will be back!"
10/30/2012,20121030,3,4.35,"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and am glad I did! On a Sunday at 12:00 there was a twenty minute wait for two. Once seated, our waiter was quite the character. He was instantly making us laugh and giving us recommendations from the menu. Halley W. and I split the Cluck-N-Gaufe, a side of chicken sausage, and the special french toast, which was roasted almond.The Cluck-N-Gaufe took us both a few bites to decide if we liked it or not, but eventually we decided it was delicious, just very unique. This sweet potato waffle with chicken inside, plus chicken on top, plus yummy hot sauce was one of the oddest dishes I've ever had, but it worked! Definitely recommend. The chicken sausage is made in-house and was really tasty, this was a great savory side to add. Lastly, the star of our meal was the roasted almond french toast. I feel like they should make this a part of their full-time menu (it was the weekend special). There were clearly almonds in the batter as you tasted the flavor throughout every bite. When at Batter and Berries, I would definitely recommend sharing sweet and savory dishes. One of the sweet dishes in its entirety would be too much, but it's absolutely worth having.All in all, I'm glad I went to Batter and Berries, but I'm not sure I'll return anytime soon. Breakfast was weirdly expensive, $13 for a not overwhelmingly large waffle with a smallish piece of chicken? Suspicious. $3 for a cup of coffee? Not Intelligensia or anything like that, just regular coffee. Hmm. No thanks."
11/4/2012,20121104,1,4.32,"This should actually be a 1 1/2 star and its based on the food being good, but our overall experience was not good at all. I was really excited to go hear because it was highly recommended. As I also do I check out the menu and base my decision to go on what is served on the menu. What follows is our experience based on overall experience, aesthetics and food. Aesthetics: Nice colors vibrant, unfortunately the restaurant is small and the floor plan is not conducive to the volume of people. First you enter and you leave your name with the hostess which the area interferes because of the high volume of people in the area. You are told to either wait outside or they have a waiting area. We decided to wait in the waiting area (this is where it gets interesting) the waiting area is in the middle of the restaurant in front of the bathrooms. First that is the worst area for waiting, the volume of people going to the bathroom and the serves going the kitchen is too much for such a small waiting area. Personally the waiting area should be in the front where they have two areas with tables. Second there should be less two people tables, this made it difficult to seat parties over two. Third there is a cabinet at the back where they keep their supplies they have to tell the person sitting in front of that area to move so they can get things. The supplies should not be in the eating area. We finally were seated after an hour unfortunately the hostess is not very organized and other people were being seated before us that came after. The are we were seated at was the hostess area and again there were so many people in the area that our view were peoples butts by our table not a pleasant way to eat your food. Food: I had the Flight of French toast, it was good but I expected a little more, they all tasted like they were made from the same batter and then different sauces on them, I expected the different taste be infused in the french toast. I also had the sweet potato hash, which I did not like, it was bland and my food was a bit cool, I like my breakfast hot off the pan. My daughter had the caramelized banana waffles (belique) it was good overall, she felt it had a slight burnt marshmallow taste which she didn't mind it just seemed a bit off. My boyfriend had the Chicken and Waffles. It was good but a few things were a bit different. The waffles were served with no maple syrup, they also had pieces of chicken inside the waffle which made some of the pieces a bit harder and dry, the chicken breast was good but a hot sauce was poured over it and it infused in the waffle. Bacon was good, coffee was ok and the tea was good.Overall because of the one hour wait and the experience that we had with the hostess, the waiting area and the unorganized layout of the dining and waiting area it was not a pleasant experience. We payed almost 60 dollars and the experience and food was not worth the 60 dollars, we had a much better experience at Bakin' and Eggs down the street and the food is much better and the service is great as well as Yolk. Both place less expensive. I will not be recommending this place nor will I be going back to Batter & Berries."
11/5/2012,20121105,5,4.32,"Best French Toast EVER.We have eaten here a few times now, and I just can't help but order the French toast flight. How can you go wrong with four different types of French toast, perfectly prepared, all on one plate?? The chef also makes a 5th type every day so you can opt for a piece of that as well with the flight for like $2 more. My boyfriend ordered the Cluck-N-Gaufe. So good. It's like chicken and waffles, only better. The chicken was perfectly fried and the waffle was out of control! The service has been impeccable when we have been here.I see mutiple more brunches here in my future."
11/6/2012,20121106,4,4.32,New and exciting menu! Chef is very creative and does great job marrying flavors! Nice place. Good service! I will return.
11/10/2012,20121110,4,4.32,"Had a great experience here last week. Excellent food and even better service. The staff and owner were very friendly and welcomed my table for coming in and since it was our first time they gave us the low down on the weekly french toast flavor. That's right Batter & Berries has a special weekly french toast flavor, what an awesome way to keep you coming back in. This last week was peanut butter and it was awesome! If you aren't into french toast then you have to try the Cluck-N-Gaufe, aka chicken and waffles. The chicken is great and the waffle has sweet potatoes cooked right into it.I can see this becoming a go to brunch spot in the future."
11/20/2012,20121120,5,4.32,"Despite some of the poor reviews, it's been pure bliss both times I've been to Batter & Berries. Obviously they must be trying to work out the kinks. Service was always pleasant and both times my party and I were seated promptly (perhaps it's because we came later). The interesting menu and the fact that the food is slammin' is what brought me back! Supa dupa props go to...-the sweet potato waffle & chicken breast w/the special sauce-the french vanilla infused french toast-cheese hashbrowns (literally the best i've tasted--EVER)-lobster egg white omelet is on fya!They could get a little more creative with the drinks, but that can come later. Again, my experience has been stellar and it was well worth the 20 minute drive."
11/21/2012,20121121,4,4.32,"My friend and I came here and ordered/split a super flight french toast.And then ordered another. 26 bucks. I'm not a french toast expert, but this stuff was better than anything i've ever tried to make/have ordered, nice. Chef was a cool guy. As a 19 y/o I never had anyone come up to me other than my server, nice. I dk why people complain about the layout. There were chairs that we sat on, and tables that we ate on. It was clean. Nice. -1 because our server was okay, whatever..lol."
11/23/2012,20121123,3,4.31,"Upon hearing that french toast is a specialty of theirs, I went, and was very satisfied with the quality of food served. The french toast was well prepared, and certainly is a highlight in their food items. And then, there's the service, which needs to be drastically improved. The server we had was a cool guy; told riddles in-between orders and was very personable. Where is the problem, you say? He was too personable, and could be interpreted as invasive with constant back-patting and high-fives. Kind of felt like a bar server working in a restaurant, and if professionalism is the motive, servers should maintain a reasonable space for their costumers. I ordered a cranberry juice, and didn't get a straw until halfway through my meal. I asked my initial server, then asked the server who actually brought the food out. Both of them were too busy to remember to bring me and my guest a straw. I desperately waited for a bus-boy or waiter to walk by. No syrup, salt, or pepper was placed on the table prior to the meal. The hostess who sat us down eventually saw us looking for the nearest soul, and got us what we needed, but it subtracted from our experience of enjoying the food. At the end of the day, no matter how good your food is, the service has to be better. If they can find ways to improve on these things, they could earn a righteous status in the breakfast food realm of Chicago."
11/23/2012,20121123,5,4.31,"Great new brunch and lunch spot. Chef Rylon is super skilled and very involved. Very surprised at some of the 1 star reviews, i would recommend anyone who wrote one to try the place again, maybe not on a busy weekend day because i think places like this can get so busy on weekends that stuff can fall through the cracks customer servicewise. Had the deconstructed chicken omelet, kobe sliders, wifey had the short rib omelet - which seemed like a weird flavor combo(as most of the dishes do) but was executed so well. Have been to lots of breakfast and brunch places around town and these guys have it down for sure. also an excellent tea selection and good coffee."
11/26/2012,20121126,5,4.32,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Seriously, best french toast I've ever had (we ordered the caramel). And the veggies in my omelet were so fresh and delicious. I was seated right away, despite it being a busy morning. Sundays usually have a long wait, so I suggest going during the week or on Saturday. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and there was always someone coming to fill my coffee or water. They could improve the decorations, but that doesn't matter to me. If anything it made the quality service seem as a very pleasant surprise."
11/27/2012,20121127,4,4.32,"If you're looking for french toast, this is THE place. Awesome service- everyone is super friendly including the chef who walks around and converses with the customers (part of me wonders what goes on in the kitchen while he's roaming around the floor, but stopped caring once I sank my teeth into their lemon french toast). The atmosphere is cute and quaint. Their pumpkin spice hot chocolate is fabulous and their french toast sampler was way more than filling (their gingerbread french toast is second to the caramel-both unique and tasty). Their sweet potato hash browns were a little surprising, they weren't crispy as I was kind of expecting/hoping, but sweet potatoes are great no matter how they're cooked.Overall, lovely service and great food at affordable prices. Definitely plan to come back."
11/27/2012,20121127,5,4.32,"So after my aunt and uncle ranted and raved about Batter & Berries in Lincoln Park, I had to go check it out for myself. First and foremost, I'm big about mimosas at brunch, so the fact they have BYOB option was great for me. It seems as though everyone in the place frequents the 7 Eleven down the street for champagne :-) Ok, now back to the actual restaurant. We got there on a Sunday afternoon and it was a 35 minute wait for a table, but they have a community table that's similar to a bar at breakfast diner where you can sit down immediately and order. I like the community table concept better because you can sit and actually face whoever you're dining with instead of just sitting next to them. Plus, you can socialize with other patrons at the table if you chose to and it's not akward. I ordered the Chicken Stuffed Waffles with Chicken on top. It was good, but it was waaay too much chicken for me. I had to remove the chicken breast on top. My friend ordered the French Toast Flight that included blueberry, strawberry, caramel and vanilla creme french toast. I should've ordered what she got because I was in LOVE! In the end, we ended up swapping plates. She LOVED the chicken.The customer serivce was awesome. At the end of our meal the chef even came around and introduced himself and asked how the meal was. The only problem I had with Batter & Berries is that they don't have a website, FB or Twitter to spread the word. Thank God for Yelp, huh?"
12/2/2012,20121202,4,4.32,"The Gist: No Website, BYOB, Breakfast and Lunch only.The Why: Located in a city that I consider to have the best breakfast/brunch scene in the United States Batter & Berries I knew walking into this new Lincoln Park location that I was taking a risk - passing up another chance to dine at Bongo Room, Southport, m.henry, or 2 Sparrows in favor of the 'new kid on the block' - but focused on all-natural ingredients, honest-to-goodness local sourcing, and innovative breakfast/brunch/lunch dishes with a lot of tongue-in-cheek nods to the south Batter & Berries seemed like my sort of place.The Reservation/Setting/Service: As one might expect from such a place, reservations are not necessary (nor taken,) though arriving around 8:45am on a Friday the traffic was still good, approximately ten tables turned during my 45 minute meal and with the space brightly lit, the music cheerful, and Chef Rylon checking in on tables frequently. With a coffee/pastry bar set at the center of the room and kitchen in back as only one server worked the room I'll note that coffee went empty more than once, but aside from that Sam was pleasant, efficient, and full of knowledge and recommendations related to a rather extensive menu.The food and drink: Coffee ($3) and Water, two entrees - $13 each.La Colombe Coffee: Brewing Nizza with its characteristic deep caramel notes Batter & Berries had me at 'hello' with the coffee selection, though I will note that consistent with the all-natural theme only Stevia and Sugar in the raw are offered as sweeteners making me glad I'd pilfered a plethora of Equal from the Skyharbor Airport the day before.Super Flight: Suggested by Sam as a way to make the most of the menu this plate featured half a slice of each daily French Toast option, on that day inclusive of blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel, and French vanilla. Generally a fan of maple syrup with my breakfast sweets but with none offered on this plate what I received would actually prove to be some of the best French Toast I've ever tasted as each piece of buttery brioche was infused with custard of a different flavor and subsequently topped with complimentary compote, spread, or cream. Crisp on the exterior and custard soft within it would be hard to choose a favorite and although I must say $13 seemed a bit excessive for the portion this was definitely a situation where you got what you paid for, each bite as good as the last.Cluck N Gaufre: Reportedly a dish slowly becoming their ""signature"" this one really came out of left field; I mean sure I expected chicken and waffles but I didn't expect tender bits of cooked chicken INSIDE the sweet potato waffle in addition to the tender and juicy breast drizzled with nutmeg spiked hot sauce on top. Tender and crispy - sort of like a potato pancake but rife with savory notes - and finished off with maple butter this dish touched on all parts of the palate with both sweet and savory coming through with aplomb as sweet and heat competed for attention on the tongue.The Verdict: Another standout in a breakfast and brunch scene that outshines even those of New York and San Francisco a breakfast meal at Batter & Berries does not come cheap, yet with items far more interesting than your average diner and a chef/owner that clearly cares about his product and his customers I'd place Chef Rylon's little eatery on Lincoln in the same league with 2 Sparrows and Bongo Room for innovative brunch fare and while the service needs a little work (or the restaurant needs more servers) I'd not hesitate to return or recommend it to anyone looking for a great breakfast."
12/2/2012,20121202,5,4.33,"Excellent. Service was great, nice people better food. Their interpretation of chicken and waffles, is next level good. Tons of food. Not especially cheap, but worth it."
12/3/2012,20121203,5,4.33,"Came to Batter & Berries over the weekend and will be back next weekend. It was probably the best breakfast I've had in the city. Everything was a 10 out of 10. Service, attentiveness, quality of the food, quickness, etc. Also, the head chef and owner was an awesome guy. He came by our table twice to introduce himself and check on us after our meal. The place isn't huge, but it's not small by any means..so the fact that he walks around introducing himself and talks to his patrons was really cool. The food: The menu is huge and has some really great, unique options. My girlfriend had the fried chicken and sweet potato waffle, which has chunks of fried chicken inside. I've never had a dish like this. The first bite was good, then it just got better and better. I ended up eating quite a bit of her meal. However, my dish was quite frankly the best french toast I've ever had. I went with the french toast flight (caramel, strawberry, blueberry, and a chocolate rum slice). Holy shit. I didn't have a favorite as they were all awesome. If you're a fan of french toast, get this.Batter & Berries has only been open for 5 months, but they didn't act like a new restaurant. The service was prompt and we only waited 20-30 min for a table. We didn't take advantage of this feature, but its BYO. How many breakfast places in the city are BYO!?I'm looking forward to returning for another breakfast and trying something off the lunch menu in the near future as well."
12/4/2012,20121204,4,4.33,"Oh yeah. This is breakfast. De-licious!!! Can't complain about a place that specializes in french toast. And it just so happen to be PEANUT BUTTER special that day. Have I told you peanut butter is my favorite food???? This was so excellent. You did not even need syrup. So I had some tri-fecta of ecstacy... Peanut butter, lemon and some berry. Portions were on the smaller size, but that's ok. I don't need 1800 calories for breakfast. Coffee was decent. Server was friendly. The accoustics were awful and when breakfast was in full swing it was difficult to talk. But, this place was absolutely tasty and worth a return trip!"
12/6/2012,20121206,5,4.34,"Just happened to pass by and was hungry to decided to stop in. I might have missed it otherwise - the sign IS big, but the yellow interior and sign would not have caught my attention. BUT I'm glad I did stop in! The staff is super friendly, and they have a kids menu as well as breakfast and lunch items. My daughter ate ALL of her chocolate pancakes - she's a picky eater. I opted for the Batter Burger - which was absolutely delicious. Large onion rings perfectly friend and crispy perfectly seasoned fries, not to mention the perfectly cooked juicy burger. Yummy!"
12/19/2012,20121219,5,4.34,"The Lemon french toast was Amazing! No syrup needed...Perfect! Go get you some :) Also the staff were fun and friendly. We even met the Chef. I love this place, but they need a southside location (HydePark please...)."
12/29/2012,20121229,1,4.31,Meh. Not very impressed. Brunch is my thing!!! And I was a bit disappointed. We were seated immediately. Not very busy. I was dreading the thought of being seated in the front. The draft came swooping in freezing everyone and their food in the first half of the restaurant. There was a poor girl sitting in the front who had pulled her sleeves down over her hands. We were seated in the back. Right in front of the kitchen. That needs to be closed off. I don't wanna hear all the racket of a kitchen and the banter that goes on between the staff. The decor. Blah. There were these weird stone garden benches in the middle of the restaurant in front of the restrooms. Yucko. And from other reviews it was a waiting area. The decor was horrible. Mish mash tiled vases on the windows. Tacky fluorescent lighting in the back. Weird paintings. The food was ok. Crispy cheesy hash browns. Coffee sucked. The hubs got the biscuits and gravy. He did enjoy the gravy. But who doesn't like thick gravy with sausage chunks? I had the crab omelet w cheese and squash. Not bad. Little bland.When I see good reviews for restaurants that were blah. Then I do some research on the reviewers. If they gave a place 4+ stars that clearly is not then I look at how many reviews they've done. Usually not very many. Then I suspect that they're friends of the owner and had opened up and account just to write a good review. Booooty
1/1/2013,20130101,5,4.32,I must say this place far exceeded my expectations. The food just had so many layers of flavor. I had the Cluck-N-Goof and everything about it was just amazing. The waffle was cooked to perfection and had so much flavor to it. I could have eaten it dry without syrup. That's how flavorful it was. The maple butter is also a very nice touch. The chicken breast was very moist and had good flavor to it also. The nutmeg hot sauce just added to the symphony of flavors at play in this dish. The smooth R&B being played in the background made me feel right at home. I'm eager to return and try some of their other dishes.
1/3/2013,20130103,5,4.32,I never review anything unless I really like it. These folks are truly making their food with love. I am obsessed. get the pork chop special while you can. By far the best chicken and waffles I have had in Chicago
1/5/2013,20130105,4,4.32,"Charming place with friendly service and fantastic french toast! I tried the Flight of the French Toast, which is a sampling of 4 different french toasts: blueberry, strawberry, lemon, and hazelnut. All of them were sweet and delicious. You must order the chicken sausage (2 patties in an order) because it was some of the best I've ever had. There are hints of rosemary (i think) and small chunks of apple cooked in to give it an unexpectedly ""crunch"". The coffee is decent, as are the pancakes. I'm definitely going back to try the fabled chicken and waffle."
1/11/2013,20130111,5,4.33,I LOVE THIS PLACE! The french toast is OFF the chain! I am actually scared of what the wait will be when people discover how amazing it is!
1/12/2013,20130112,4,4.32,"Okay, yum, I say- YUM, I say! We ordered the ""flight"" of french toast, which included strawberry, lemon, blueberry, maple, and the special for the week- cranberry rum. My friend and I both agreed the cranberry rum was the best one. It was special #37. The restaurant has been open for 37 weeks and each week, there is a new featured french toast. We also shared the special omelet. Egg whites and crab meat with some sort of squash in the mix. Just delicious. It came with a very generous portion of hash browns, which were done just perfectly. Crispy brown on the outside, just how I love them. I like that the Belgian waffles here are called ""belguiques"". Although we didn't try them, they looked amazing, as well.Service was great. My coffee cup runneth over. Very attentive server.  I also saw the chef walking around the restaurant, stopping to talk to his customers. It added a very personal and warm touch. As I find myself spending a lot more time in Chicago these days, I plan to return here again."
1/12/2013,20130112,2,4.3,"2 slices of french toast for $11? Terrible service. It took 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we wanted coffee and we had to flag 2 people down to place an order. When the food came we were waiting for napkins, ketchup, sugar, cream, syrup... they just dropped the food on the table and we felt like we were bothering them asking them for stuff. I could have just made eggs at home if I wanted that experience.Too bad. The food was good, but all things considered there are just too many places for me to bother going back."
1/13/2013,20130113,5,4.31,"What an amazing brunch at this place! Had the sweet potato chicken and waffles, crab omelet and biscuits & gravy. Everything was exceptional, especially the owner who made everyone feel welcome! Will be back."
1/18/2013,20130118,2,4.29,"Terrible service, delicious, inventive food. We got there at 9:00 and got served at 10:00. One of the people I went with had to be somewhere by 10:15, so she had to ask to have her food to go, but they didn't offer to comp it or even apologize for the horrific wait. Even drinks took a long time.We were there on a Friday, and the place was EMPTY, so there was absolutely no reason to for us to wait so long for our meals.Christie was our server, and while she was pleasant and answered our (copious) questions about items on the menu, she would disappear for long stretches of time and didn't apologize once.They also automatically added gratuity for a party of five. I have never heard of this for less than a party of six.The food was good - we got the french toast super flight and it was amazing, particularly the lemon. I thought the chicken and waffle was okay, but not incredible and needed a little something - maybe some more hot sauce? My friend's crab omelet was yummy and another friend who got the breakfast wrap was happy with it.Prices are expensive (the crab omelet was $16), but I don't mind paying for a good meal with good service.It's too bad about the service because even though the food was so good, I will never go again."
1/20/2013,20130120,4,4.29,"I ate the best french toast of my entire life there. The food is simply knock out amazing. You can't do any better if you are looking for brunch that's for sure. I had the flight of french toast, which is a slice of each type (they have a wide variety). Each type was mind blowing (strawberry, blueberry, lemon, pear etc). My partner got a cluck-n-gaul (i don't think i have the spelling right). His dish was a sweet potato waffle with fried chicken mixed in---savory awesomeness. We also got sausage and sweet potato hash browns that were simply knock out great. Sausage was clearly seasoned and prepared from scratch, with fresh herbs and a nice little spicey kick. Hashbrowns were cooked perfectly -- crisp but not burnt. Its one of those places where with each bite you just savor the sweet or the savory. It really hits the spot. The service and ambience are also really nice. The chef and owner actually comes out and talks to you personally to make sure that everything is to your satisfaction. He clearly cares about his customers and assuring that they have a good experience. Well he's succeeded. There were two downsides which prevented me from giving 5 stars. They are clearly a new establishment and they are still getting the kinks worked out. There was a mix up with our order and we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes after placing our order before being served. However, the head chef personally apologized to us and gave a free homemade red velvet cupcake (which was to die for) and homemade biscotti (which was divine). These things happen and the head chef handled it so well and the food was so good that I am not even annoyed about it. But still, it was a bit of a downer when you are hungry.The restaurant is a bit on the small side and there's no second door. We were placed right by the front entrance, which is heavily trafficked. Every time someone walked in or or out we were chilled to the bone. Consequently, we had to wear our coats the entire time. I imagine this would be a non-issue during the summer or if we were seated further in.That said the food was awesome and the service with one exception was superb. I'll definitely be coming back. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1/24/2013,20130124,4,4.29,"The food is outstanding. The menu has some really unique, creative things on it. The chicken stuffed sweet potato waffle was really good. THE FRENCH TOAST is the best I have ever had. When I go with friends we order a flight as a appetizer then each order our own meal. The guy that owns the place is so nice and comes out and talks to people. I would like to see the service get better. When I go to a restaurant, I really appreciate when there is at least some sense of urgency to help the customer, and I didn't get that either time I have been here. 4 stars because the food is that good."
1/25/2013,20130125,5,4.29,"It's been 4 days, 17 hours and 52 minutes since my last visit to Batter & Berries...and I'm daydreaming about what I'm going to order and how much I'm going to eat on my next visit. Which, hopefully, will be tomorrow morning.It's that good.You've never tasted french toast so moist and flavorful that you DON'T need syrup for it at all. French toast is their specialty, and special it is. Do the french toast flight. And for heaven's sake, get whatever is the french toast special of the day. Because whatever it is will be not just good, but outstanding. The blueberry and caramel french toast were my favorites, but I hear the sweet potato is super good too (might try that tomorrow!)I was also talked into getting the eggs any style/salmon/hash browns special being offered on my last visit. The server whipped out her phone and showed me a pic of the enormous salmon--the owner had just caught it himself 24 hours prior. SOLD! The salmon was (obviously) fresh and flavorful, if a little overcooked. The eggs were fluffy but not runny, which is what I prefer, and the hash browns tasted like my granny's. I can't say enough great about this place--great service, lovely decor and surroundings, and, of course, outstanding food. I wish I lived a little closer -- it's not particularly easy to get to by public transportation, especially on a cold day (there's no bus running down those long blocks on Lincoln Avenue...) but the trip is well worth it. I'm a-coming back, Chef Raylon -- have my french toast flight ready for me!"
1/26/2013,20130126,2,4.27,"I am completely dumbfounded as to how this place gets such good ratings. 1) It is crowded and there is no where for people to wait, so there are people just standing around learing at you for your table2) they dont have an entry way, so everytime the door opens, you get a blast of cold air3) the decor was nothing special4) the service was poor, our waitress either had too many tables or not enough support. We were short one place setting, so I asked for a fork, which was delivered when we were half finished, so one of us had to eat with a spoon. Asked for some ketchup for someone's fries, it showed up when we were done. Not to mention no one ever checked to see if we needed another drink etc5) the chef is walking around in pajamas pants with a tshirt that says ""chef"", is that supposed to make me want to pay these prices?6) the food is OK, and over priced. The french toast flight, which is so well named I went to this place just to get it. $11 for 2 pieces of bread, part with some blueberries on it, part with some strawberries, part with some nuts, and part with some maple butter. Absolutely nothing special about this, and for $11 it is exactly 2 pieces of bread. I can only imagine that all of these people raving about this french toast, have never personally made french toast, hence have no idea that it cost about 25 cents to make and is really simple. Everything else we ordered was also OK and overpriced."
1/26/2013,20130126,3,4.26,"I'm slowly branching out and trying new brunch places. After reading enough reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to give Batter & Berries a shot. I appreciated the seating area away from the door, and was fine with a 20 minute wait. The smells were intoxicating, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on the menu. 30 minutes later, we were seated near the front door, and immediately wished they had a second door to block some of the chill. Our waiter was funny, but I wished he had spent less time telling me riddles and more time getting our order in. I can understand the wait, if everyone else is experiencing it, but tables everywhere were getting in and out and here we sat with no food. It was another 35 minutes before we were served, and the food was incredible. I ordered the Crab Omelette, and my boyfriend had the Blueberry Belgique. Absolutely delicious, but nothing gets my goat more than having to wait 20 minutes to get the check. I wish I could say I'll be back, but there are far more places to try and get better service than here."
1/31/2013,20130131,4,4.26,"Because the food was so good, I went again with another friend. This time the service was spot-on AND the food was still yummy. I told my server that the last time I had come I had had bad service, so she had one of the manager come talk to me. The manager (the owner's sister-in-law) was so nice and personable. I really liked her and was happy that she was so concerned that I had had bad service. I will go again. I shared the crab omelette and a plate of lemon and the special french toast. Delicious."
2/3/2013,20130203,4,4.26,"after two visits to this great new neighborhood addition i can attest to a jekyll/hyde reaction. love, love, love the french toast! but the belgiques & deconstructed omelets are not orders i'll be placing again.on our first visit, my hub, the french toast gourmand, ordered the flight, which consisted of a sample of strawberry, lemon, caramel & blueberry, all excellent, although we agreed the caramel was a bit sweet for our tastes, good in a sample portion, but too cloying for a full order. however, the winning feature of the toast, aside from the tasty flavors, is the consistency, with a pleasantly crunchy outside crust and moist, but not soggy center. soooo well done!i always go for egg white offerings, and i was enthused by the thought of a deconstructed omelet, with the fillings serving as a topping for the eggs rather than being blended in. i enjoyed the actual product much less than the concept. though the broccoli was cooked as i like it, neither too raw nor soggy, the stalks were very large, and the cheese didn't incorporate itself into the dish at all; there seemed to be a disconnect. i ate all the broccoli, but was left with a mound of egg whites, which on their own were not interesting enough to finish. i guess i like a scramble better after all, so i won't go there again, although the lobster does sound tasty, and may be more to my liking since it advertises a sauce. the hash browns were nicely prepared and seasoned, with a crunchy crust which resembled a potato pancake, and my hub liked the homemade chicken patty sausage, though i found it too herbal for my taste. also, though very cordial, our server was fairly unconscious to our needs; coffee wasn't refilled, and it took FOREVER for our check to be delivered. maybe he misinterpreted my mound of eggs to mean i hadn't finished? our meter ran out as we waited for the check, which made for an anxious and hasty exit.on our second visit, my husband ordered the blueberry french toast and i opted for the belgique, which is their way of presenting a belgian waffle. his was as tasty as we remembered, but i found the waffle to be dense and doughy, so different from the light texture of the toast. there was an artificiality to the flavor that i didn't enjoy either. my hub, who didn't object to its density or sweetness, came to the rescue and traded 3/4 of my order with two of his slices, so i was a happy camper. also, on this visit, there seemed to be more back-up help; the coffee flowed well, which imho, is expected when it's $3 a cup, and the check came before the meter expired.all in all, i would heartily recommend b & b for its french toast, and perhaps after our next visit, the biscuits will garner a positive thumbs up as well, because that's going to be my next order."
2/3/2013,20130203,3,4.25,"A very average breakfast. Tried the french toast special, but there are much tastier options in Chicago. Omelette was sub-par. The best of the bunch might have been the chicken and waffle, but who does not love a fried, spicy, piece of chicken?Overall, if you are near, hungry for an OK breakfast, and don't want to travel to any of the better Chicago breakfast spots, then this is your place."
2/5/2013,20130205,5,4.25,This is such a friendly restaurant! They treated us like family. The food was AMAZING! You must get the french toast flight. My faves were the caramel and lemon. Our waiter told us funny little riddles and was just so warm. I highly recommend this place. I hope I can get back again soon!
2/9/2013,20130209,5,4.26,"My fiancee and I have been here about ten times since randomly popping in on a Saturday morning. I can't get enough. Honestly. And the fact that there is a different french toast each week, keeps us coming back. I just keep wondering, how WILL he top the last one?! I've had the Cluck N' Gravy many a time, and I can't recommend it enough. The super flight is my other's favorite choice. I've also had the deconstructed omelets (Crab and Chicken Fajita) as well as the Banana Nut Belguique. All wonderful.Our service is always great. Food always the freshest ingredients. Always a pleasant weekend treat!"
2/10/2013,20130210,5,4.27,"Let me explain why I gave this place 5 stars:Service: We had Sam - he was tentative, prompt, knew the specials, nice, and quick. He weren't overly nice (like fake-nice), we didn't have to wait too long to take our order or receive any refills, food, or extras. Your server is not the only one who will be paying attention to your table - the hostess cleared our table as she was walking by. The owner was walking around pouring coffee (we had already gotten coffee, but he still stopped by our table).I give extra props to the owner for walking around to almost every table and asking how their food is, how they are doing, if they have any questions, etc. You can tell he is proud of his product and restaurant, as he should be. Even the chefs were walking around, serving food and asking about their product. It was a great sight.Wait/seating: We did go for brunch on a Sunday at 12:45. We were told our wait (for 2 people) would be around 30-45 minutes. We were seated promptly before 1 - so about 15 minutes, not bad at all. They have the option to either sit at a normal table or a community-style table (when seats become available). We were sat at a normal two-top. There isn't a lot of waiting space, but service goes quickly so as long as you don't come in with a big party, I feel like you'll easily get a table within the wait time (if not quicker). Seating is a little cramped, but not as bad as some brunch places I've been to.Food: I was very impressed by the options on the menu - they had both a breakfast and a lunch side, which is good for brunch-goers who may not necessarily want breakfast-style food at the time. Most of the options on the breakfast side were traditional breakfast items with a twist, which I liked. At our table we had the buttermilk pancakes with fresh berries and homemade maple butter, cheese-crusted hash browns, homemade pork sausage, and chicken with sweet potato waffles. The menu explicitly states that things like salt, pepper, and syrup are available upon request, but they recommend trying it how the chef prepares it - which we did.My pancakes were soft, fluffy, and a little crispy around the edges - just how I like them. There was a little lemon-zest in the batter, which added a great depth to the flavor - not your original, plain buttermilk pancake. The maple butter really complimented the pancakes and the combination of butter, powdered sugar, and berries made the need for syrup nonexistent. The pork sausage was good - not the best I've had - but the flavor was really fresh and not overpowering and really complimented both of our meals well. The hash browns were perfect - I aways feel the need to add salt/pepper to my hash browns when I go out, but not this time! My boyfriend's sweet potato waffles were delicious - and I am very picky about waffles (they were really soft, almost like a pancake, that's why I liked them). They had maple butter as well and the chicken - breast, lightly breaded, with homemade hot sauce on top - really went well with the waffles. A perfect combination.Long story short, I highly recommend this place. I will go back, but never with a party larger than 4 people if I go on a weekend. I'm happy to have a small, unique place with a tentative staff, owner, and chefs in our neighborhood. So far my favorite brunch place in Chicago."
2/14/2013,20130214,1,4.24,"Again I have tried to really like this place , giving it a chance time and time again ... but if you are a solo diner you do not get the service as another customer..and this place if you are a solo male diner it is even better ..Day off... went in for a quick breakfast as I have done several other occasions... i asked to be seated at a larger table and was told we cannot do that with the lunch rush...uhm 10 in the morning lunch rush ...and then to have another solo customer seated alone at a larger table just after me ...ok.... service was slow to none... no server approached for 10 minutes....and when they did ... ""did you order yet??? ""  no specials were recited to me  really this place needs better communication and better front of the house..or maybe they just don't want a one person table ... i have given this place it's last chance in my book...I would not urge you to go ... i will not go back , there are MUCH better places for the money they charge..."
2/16/2013,20130216,4,4.24,Steak omelet has a big piece of tendered steak on top. They so not cheat by putting a few prices inside the omelet. omelet comes with gravy and harsh. Very good.Flight french toast is the combination of all their french toast. The strawberry is the best.Very crowded and loud so be prepared.
2/17/2013,20130217,5,4.24,This breakfast was phenomenal and chef rylon was so nice. Definitely go to this place and try the French toast. It changes weekly with fresh fruit and ingredients!
2/19/2013,20130219,5,4.25,"Absolutely love Batter & Berries. No, the decor and ambiance aren't like other brunch places in the city but you come (and return) to Batter & Berries for the food and service. I actually do not ever order french toast but after seeing photos and reviews, had to try it. DELICIOUS. Perfectly crunchy and what a burst of flavors. I had some sort of crab omelette as well, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The ingredients were so fresh and though seafood can smell fishy, this omelette did not. They also cut their hash browns fresh, and you can tell that they owners/chef really put time and energy into the place. If you're a tea person, you must try one of their teas. They're all loose-leaf and so very fresh and fragrant. I'm telling you, this place does not get enough credit in Chicago. If you're looking for fresh, excellent food with generous portions AND fantastic service where the chef/owner takes the time to greet you, Batter & Berries is a must."
2/19/2013,20130219,4,4.25,"I was greeted by a friendly hostess and Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely"" over the loudspeaker when I entered B&B. It was my first visit and, despite it being a holiday, my girlfriend and I were seated immediately. She had the chicken and waffles while I had the French Toast flight. Both were delicious. As the menu suggested, you really don't need syrup to eat with either meal. Each was sweet on its own. We added a side of cheese-encrusted hash browns and enjoyed those as well.  While the food was good, the service was exceptional. At least three people (not including our server) came over to inquire on our meals...including the chef (who was proudly wearing a t-shirt that said ""Chef)."
2/20/2013,20130220,5,4.25,The french toast is outstanding and the staff is very good.
2/21/2013,20130221,4,4.25,"Great new place on Lincoln. Wonderful fresh ingredients, house made sausage and pastry. Friendly owner and staff. Definitely worth a try."
2/26/2013,20130226,4,4.25,"This was my first visit and I definitely will make it a habit. A friend has been trying to get me to the restaurant for a while & today I gave in all I can say is that I'm mad I've been missing out on this!! The only reason I didn't 5 star it is because there are still some things that I've yet to try but what I did have was fantastic. As most of the reviews stated the french toast were to die for. Also, when you get good service, a warm welcome and a we'll see you later you know that is a place you want to frequent."
3/3/2013,20130303,4,4.25,"Pretty great food, friendly and effective staff, bustling atmosphere.I went on a Sunday around midday with clear weather and there was about a 40 minute wait, once we were seated the waiter was timely and attentive in spite of the absolutely packed house. I would say that the food arrived only just warm, but it was all cooked to perfection, remarkably sweet french toast if that's your fancy, and the deconstructed omelette and sweet potato fries were spot-on as well. Come with some time to spare and the meal should be worth it."
3/7/2013,20130307,1,4.22,"I previously wrote a review about this restaurant, and praised them on the quality of french toast/food. Unfortunately, the service was the focal point of my disdain before, and this time it was even worst. There cannot be a more fundamental mistake than to have an underwhelming staff at the peak of high noon on a Monday; during the time when many are passing through on their lunch break, and want a quality sit-down dining experience. I came in a tad close to 12:30p, which was not a problem as far as people traffic. There was no host/hostess at the front during the time I entered, then a busboy told me to sit in the waiting area until a table became available. For the record, the waiting area is in the middle of the dining room, so while you're waiting, you're surrounded by people eating, which makes them and the waiting party very uneasy. I waited for about 10 minutes before deciding to abort the mission. During lunchtime, this kind of service is unacceptable. I certainly praised the food selection in my previous review, and believe that they do have some very good items, particularly the french toast. When it's all said and done, service is the barometer for any restaurant, and if it's not solid, the food is no longer the feature, due to the sluggish and frantic nature of not having enough staff, or adequate staff to coordinate the guest coming in and out. If you want to know what I thought before, my other review is a good reference. This time, no sign of improvement; it's actually worst. I ended up going to Meli on Wells St, and the service was impeccable. Perhaps a cue to take from another restaurant that has great food and solid state service. If their service improves, Batter & Berries will be a strong option, but I'll go for the reliable choice for lunch in the meantime."
3/7/2013,20130307,5,4.23,"My girlfriends were visiting and were wanting pancakes. Um, little to much wine the night before. But, once we caught sight of the omelet selection, sold. This is what i had: Deconstructed Spinach Omelet topped with mushrooms, Swiss cheese & a spinach-mushroom sauce. Need I say more? Most delicious. I had to go back. On the second visit, I tried one of the lunch items I'd seen another table order during our first visit, called the Rylon Salad: a fried spinach tortilla shell filled with romaine lettuce, sautéed shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, basil & tossed in a white wine scampi sauce. The sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon and the shrimp in the salad were cooked perfectly and large too!"
3/8/2013,20130308,4,4.23,We went the first week they were open and we enjoyed it. We brought our 18month old son and they were very good about having him there. They even had some fun stacking toys for him to play with - not just the normal crayons for him to eat. The home made biscotti was the best I've ever had and by itself made this review 4 stars.The food was good but very rich. Everything was very flavorful and the sweet was super sweet and the savory was so strongly flavored that it got hard to eat after a while. Luckily my husband and I got one savory and one sweet between us so we swapped back and forth. We ended up enjoying it but probably won't go back.
3/15/2013,20130315,5,4.23,"My sister introduced me & a friend to this place last weekend when we met up with a friend who is expecting twins! Meter parking on a Sunday was decent. This place is a pretty good size. The atmosphere is casual & vibrant with a great selection of music playing throughout. Onto the food! I had the french toast flight special which gave a strawberry, a blueberry, a lemon, caramel & their special of the weekend- a coconut French toast!! YUM!!! I also ordered their house made chicken sausage, which was very tasty. Our server - don't remember his name :/ but I'll call him the ""riddle man"" was very nice & friendly & would come by with some funny riddles.  The chef makes himself present & visits each table to see how the food is which was nice. Every weekend the chef said they will have a new flavor of French toast so I definitely want to go back & try them! Overall I think it's a great new place that is definitely worth checking out!"
3/17/2013,20130317,5,4.24,Went to this place for brunch with friends for the first time on St. Patrick's Day....the food was great and awesome service!!!
3/17/2013,20130317,5,4.24,"Just returned home from Batter & Berries. I ordered the french toast flight, chicken sausage and scrambled eggs. Every bite was so good I found I couldn't eat fast enough. If you're looking for food made of quality ingredients, expertly seasoned, generously portioned and reasonably priced then you can have it at B&B. I was part of a group of five so I thought I get a chance to taste some of the other orders but instead dedicated myself to strictly, happily addressing the food in front of me. Tried my darndest but still couldn't eat it all. Have yet to decide which of the four french toast flavors was my favorite--it's like trying to decide which of your children you like better. Will definitely return--soon! Can hardly wait to introduce this wonderful place to friends and family members. One caution: try to visit during the week unless you're prepared to endure the hourlong (but worthwhile) wait on the weekend. Orchids to the owners, chefs, and servers."
3/18/2013,20130318,4,4.24,"Me and my friends went after church for a Sunday brunch.  Automatically knowing that it is Sunday afternoon, we anticipated a wait. We were told that we had to wait 45-60 minutes. Again, knowing that this is Sunday, we knew that the wait anywhere would be around that time, so we put our name on the list and waited outside in the car.After about 45 minutes, we went back into the restaurant where we waited an additional 25 minutes to get our seats. While we were waiting inside for our table, the waiting area (in the middle of the restaurant) was completely filled so we had to wait by the door where we had to constantly move for patrons to come through. It had gotten so crowded that at one point, we were almost standing on top of the patrons that were sitting down eating. The interior the restaurant was filled with tropical purple, green, and gold colors. 40x60 paintings that filled the walls, and background of entertaining music. Once we were sat down, we waited about 5 minutes before we got serviced. The silverware and cups were clean. There were condiments on the table. The server did a wonderful job in telling us the specials.  I ordered the shrimp omelet special, my two friends ordered the chicken and waffles, and we all split the french toast flight. The french toast flight was supposed to be an appetizer, but it was accidentally given to a table that sat down after us so we got the flight with our meal. One of my friends originally wanted a meal that had biscuits, but unfortunately they were out.  The meals were excellent. We were literally dancing in our seats while we were eating. I cleaned my plate of shrimp omelet and my two friends said that their chicken breast was moist, but no longer wanted to eat the waffles after the chicken was gone. The french toast flight had a character of its own. Each one was as delicious at the first. The owner came by each table to greet the patrons and make sure that our service was up to par. My friend asked the owner why was it that they ran out of biscuits, he said that he only makes 80 in the morning and he wants them all to sell out so he can make new ones in the morning. He also agreed to take a picture with us so remember our visit. Overall, I give it a four because at the end of the day, we all agreed that despite the uncomfortable wait, we would return. But a few suggestions would be to possibly make the waiting area a little more comfortable."
3/19/2013,20130319,5,4.25,"Helpful and friendly service and a well executed brunch. The server (Christie) was helpful in finding both food options and hot tea. Wife had an avocado club sandwich with fries that were well seasoned but not overpowering. I had an amazing concoction of sweet-potato waffles with chicken inside the waffles, topped with gently fried chicken and hot sauce. They brought syrup but it never needed it (and I'm a waffles and syrup kinda guy for brunch)."
3/23/2013,20130323,2,4.23,"Expensive. The buttermilk pancakes sweet times ten! Only butter is maple flavored which is also over sweet. Waiter advised chicken sausage sweet. Eggs are like egg beaters.....definitely not fresh. If you like it loud and sweet this is your joint. The plate had some pretty berries that I enjoyed. Coffee good. Waiter very loud, friendly but in attentive to necessary details....my friend didn't have water and my eggs were delivered after I had almost finished my pancakes."
3/26/2013,20130326,5,4.24,"I love this place! From the friendly and welcoming staff, to the amazing homemade treats, this place is great. The chef came out to check on us as well as one of the owners. Our server was a lot of fun keeping us on our toes with riddles. I highly recommend the Cluck-n-gaufre(chicken and waffles) and the French Toast flight. Everything is pretty much made in house from chicken sausage to an amazing maple butter. The French toast of the week, Snickers was amazing. I will be back!"
3/27/2013,20130327,3,4.23,"A decent brunch at a nice little eatery. That would be my description of my visit to Batter & Berries.  Once again, I sacrificed my arteries in search of the perfect biscuits and gravy. B&B's version of this Southern specialty didn't disappoint me. The sausage gravy was delicious. There were a few glitches with along the way that warrants me giving B & B only three stars. Our food came in stages. There was a good 15 minute lapse from the time I got my food to the time my Wife got hers. The servers seemed confused by our order. Being the gentleman that I am, I waited until everyone had their grub before digging in. By that time, my brunch was cold. Its kind of sad. The untimely service ruined what could have been a spectacular brunch.  Here's the bottom line: If you're looking for a neat little brunch spot to cure even the meanest hangover, give Batter and Berries a shot. What I tasted of the food was good enough for me to give them another try."
3/30/2013,20130330,4,4.23,"I'm a south sider, the trip to the north side for breakfast was my idea of an adventure. It was worth the drive! It was truly a delight and delicious! The fare was original and plentiful. I am certain to return. Now let me keep it real, we went on Good Friday afternoon and the service was a nightmare! It was obvious that something was Way OFF service wise. It was a half hour wait for a table, when there were clearly empty tables. Only one guy was cleaning tables, so that may have been part of the trouble. It would have been quite alright if it had not taken fourty-five minutes for my food. I overheard the owner say he was displeased with the days going on, that commentary and the flavor of his food will force me back."
3/30/2013,20130330,5,4.23,Excellent crab Benedict and La Colombe coffee is smooth and strong. Don the manager and staff are very gracious. All together a great place.
4/2/2013,20130402,2,4.22,"I came here early one morning with a friend after reading a bunch of rave reviews on yelp and some random blogs. We were so excited for the food, only to experience a catastrophic let-down.1. Cluck N Gaufre. Everyone says this is the best thing ever. Chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle with a lightly battered fried chicken breast, nutmeg hot sauce, and maple butter. It sounds pretty awesome, and the flavors are all there. However, the waffle was dry and the chicken over cooked. Subpar execution. Booo.2. Sweet potato hash. I had read this was amazing. It was soggy and barely lukewarm. No golden crisp. Some of the shreds of sweet potato were undercooked.3. Deconstructed spinach and mushroom omelet with swiss cheese and a spinach-mushroom sauce. The sauce was essential non-existent--a tiny little drop on the side of the omelet. The cheese consisted of cheap, unpalatble slices of swiss. It came with a side of ""crispy cheese potato hash."" Neither crispy nor cheesy. Flop.4. #48 Snickers French Toast, one of the specials. The one redeeming factor. This was delicious and crispy. It could have come out hot, though, but was instead barely warm. The order that shined. Go with the French toast.Our waitress was not well versed in the menu and unable to answer our questions (i.e., what's a snickers french toast?). She was nice, but would linger awkwardly throughout the duration of our brunch.Ultimate disappointment. This place has a lot of potential but failed to deliver. We wanted so much to love this place!"
4/4/2013,20130404,5,4.22,"I went to B&B on a recent business trip to Chicago and I was so impressed that I made a point to eat there twice in five days! The wait staff was warm, lovely, and knowledgeable. You really cannot expect better service. On my second visit, our initial server remembered us and came to chat while our current server treated us to some riddles. Fabulous!The food is creative, flavorful and FRESH! Everything is homemade, it seems. The French Toast flight is a MUST. I also adored the Cluck and Gravy. Whatever the special is - GET IT! You're in for a treat. My hat is off to the chef and staff of this charming establishment. I look forward to visiting again on my next time in the 310."
4/5/2013,20130405,2,4.21,"Seriously? $75 for a family of 4 (with two small kids) to eat a so-so breakfast? The waiter pushed the extra kiwi french toast on us on St Patrick's Day-- bleah..!Coffee was bleah... And the service was sloooooow. Nothing stellar or stand-out, and once the place gets going, the small space is not for the claustrophobic. The lemon french toast was good, though..."
4/5/2013,20130405,5,4.21,"Girlfriends and I went for breakfast, well it ended up being later than breakfast time by the time we all got there, around noon. There was about an hour and half wait.....but I would wait ALL OVER AGAIN!!! The french toast flight was worth the wait and then some. You know its an awesome restaurant when everyone there waits for an hour or longer and doesn't complain or leave. The Chef came out and greeted us and made our experience one to remember!! We cannot wait to go back!! :-)"
4/7/2013,20130407,5,4.22,"Black Owned Business that does an amazing job at everything.Food - 5I had the biscuits and gravy with coleslaw. I wish I had a vat of this to just eat at my liesure. The Coleslaw was not as great because of the cut of the cabbage I received and it needed more dressing, but the biscuits and gravy were so good I can overlook it.Ambiance - 4.5Super cute with lovely tables and a chalkboard that has the specials.Price - 5Not over priced and I was so happy with my selection I still would have paid more for itService - 4.5The girl was very nice, but she was a new server. I can be forgiving about it though since it was her first day. She took a bit too long to get to us for the bill and when we asked if it could be separate checks for two people she came back with the bill split. And took a Looooong time to come back with the correction. But the chef came out and checked on every person about the food and gave his card. Yep... I became a fan!Overall - 5Run, dont walk to this place. I will be back whenever I can."
4/7/2013,20130407,5,4.22,Pancakes don't need syrup... 'Nuff said!
4/7/2013,20130407,4,4.22,"Very tasty food although my omelet was cold. The Super French Toast flight was tremendous. Our server was friendly but didn't give us a lot of attention. I don't blame him though because he wasn't getting a lot of help. The place was packed and people were waiting outside, yet we tried to leave our table for 10 minutes before we got a bill. Then that took time. There is a waiting area in back but I'm thinking it would probably serve them well to add a table or two. And more servers. I hope they figure it out though because the food really was awesome. They use fresh ingredients and have a really creative menu, all housemade. That's how it got to four stars. I'll go back for sure but if my food is cold we'll have to have a chat."
4/11/2013,20130411,5,4.23,"Service is great & fast. French toast flight is amazing, at a good price ($11). Yes, it's essentially two pieces of bread, but it's rich and delicious and very filling, imho. It gets suuuuper busy after 10, so get there early!!"
4/13/2013,20130413,4,4.23,"I have been to Batter & Berries 4 times now. The first 3 times my breakfast was AMAZING. I went there again this morning, and found my waffle undercooked. While I love how fast my order came out, I would have prefered it to be fully cooked. I still gave 4 stars because the other 3 times I have been have been completely delicious."
4/14/2013,20130414,2,4.21,Wait was supposed to be 15 minutes... 80 minutes later sat down for our meal! Food was not great; 2 of my friends spent the majority of the afternoon in the bathroom. Will not be returning.
4/14/2013,20130414,5,4.22,"Had the Deconstructed Spinach Omelet topped w/mushrooms, Swiss cheese & a spinach-mushroom sauce (added grilled onions) w/the B&B Cheesy Omlette & Chicken Sausage. My meal was DEE*LISH! Be sure to try a flight of French toast (including strawberry, blueberry, lemon & caramel) as an appetizer if you go w/a large group. It included the standard Challah bread drenched in each flavorFILLED tasty mixtures, then griddled to perfection & served w/delightful garnishes. LOVE the option to BYOB to construct Mimosas on weekend. Chef Rylon came by our table to check on how we enjoyed our meal and our host and waitress were very attentive as well! It was an AWESOME foodie experience! We will definitely be visiting again!"
4/14/2013,20130414,5,4.22,Soo good!!! Met the chef. Had the caramel French Toast and it was soo good.
4/15/2013,20130415,4,4.22,"Came here as a party of 4 plus an infant on Sunday and loved it. The restaurant was crowded and the waiting area (really, in a hallway in the back) was awkward and not very functional, especially with a small child in tow. There is NO room for strollers (and no place to lock outside). That being said, once we were seated, the service was great and the food DELICIOUS. The chicken & waffle dish is outstanding, and my husband devoured the french toast flight. I can't wait to come back and try more!"
4/16/2013,20130416,5,4.23,"best french toast. ever. i got the super flight - definitely preferred the blueberry and strawberry over the other three (the special was sweet and savory, the flavor was a little funky to me) as the lemon and caramel french toast were just a little too sweet for my taste - especially the caramel! nonetheless, some of the best french toast. it is a little bit crispy - hard to explain, but the flavor and texture were absolutely fabulous. the cheesy hash browns were spot-on as well.our waiter kept telling us jokes and was very attentive. the rest of the staff we encountered were very sweet as well. good coffee. cute place.can't wait to come back and fill my belly with a full order of blueberry french toast.. ohhhh yeah."
4/19/2013,20130419,4,4.22,"French toast is out of bounds! I'm a HUGE french toast lover & this is by far the best I've ever had. I had the blueberry & others had the carmel. Both were great but that carmel was excellent, not too sweet like I expected.I love chicken sausage but this was quite bland. If I were in a blind taste test I would never had guessed that it was supposed to be sausage. It's missing the much needed thyme, fennel, sage & red pepper flakes. Tasted like a plain chicken burger so it definitely needs some work. This is a rather tight space so I'd suggest parties of 4 or smaller & if you're going for breakfast..GO EARLY or you will be waiting. The chef came out to see how service was, that was very welcoming. And yes I told him about the sausage! :)"
4/21/2013,20130421,3,4.22,"We have been there twice now and the food does not disappoint! However, the service needs to improve to make this a 5-star place. While we got seated right away, it took over 5 minutes both times to have a server acknowledge us and get us coffee. We even asked. The same thing happen at two other tables. It does not appear that there is structure to the table assignments and the staff seems to gather to chat without noticing a new table has been seated. We will give it another chance, but I hope the service improves."
4/21/2013,20130421,4,4.22,"I came with my friend and her toddler son. They were very helpful with getting her son settled, from helping pack up and move his stroller, to bringing him toys to keep him busy while we ate. The food was very, very good, and the chef came out to say hello. The wait time was exactly what they said it would be, and the prices were very reasonable. The only thing that could be improved on was the service was a little slower than preferred. We actually lost track of our waitress for a while. Luckily the bus boy was there to help us out.All in all, B&B is a great place for brunch. It's worth the wait for the amazing breakfast menu. Go and check it out."
4/22/2013,20130422,5,4.22,"PHENOMENAL! *drops mic and walks off stage, Randy Watson style. Lol There is not much else to say about the food. The service is also impeccable. It is so nice to see owners be visible and take so much pride in the experience they provide for their customers! I haven't seen it done better in awhile. Bravo!!"

Wait: 35 minutes on a Sunday around 10:30 in nice weatherAmbiance? So cute! Small (seats maybe 50ish people at a time). I love the local artwork on the walls and the tables are made out of tiles. It is a tight fit though but I expected as much. Nice plus? They had changing tables in both of the bathrooms, which I wouldn't expect from a small joint. The only downfall? It is REALLY loud. My husband and I could barely hear each other.Staff? Busy, but welcoming and attentive. Our server did not have time to hover but he did check in 2x and my husband's coffee was always filled. The chef/owner did come out and say hello which was a nice touch. And most important...Food? AMAZING! They are known for their french toast and there is a good reason why. My husband had the flight, and each one was better than the next. The flight had strawberry, blueberry, lemon, caramel and for $2 we were able to try the birthday one too. Each one was light and just the right about of fluff and a hint of the flavors as to not overwhelm. I had the lemon french toast and I about cried when I finished it. It was just tart enough. I also ordered the sweet potato hash browns, so crispy and perfect!Even though it took us an hour to get there from Arlington Heights, we will be back. I am already craving more french toast."
4/29/2013,20130429,5,4.25,"The wait on the weekends is brutal, but no worse than other brunch hot spots in the city. It's worth it for the delicious caramel french toast. My husband loves the chicken and waffles dish and they play awesome music to boot. The owner and manager are both very friendly and are always walking around greeting the customers. I'm not sure if the lunch menu items are any good, but if you stick with the french toast, you can't go wrong."
4/29/2013,20130429,4,4.25,Great service! Delicious food! Loved the French toast flight :-)
4/29/2013,20130429,4,4.25,"This is southern cooking; I didn't see that mentioned in any of the previous reviews. The chef knows his thang and is slingin' some fine southern fare. If it wasn't apparent enough, the sweet potato and chicken waffle with fried chicken is a twist on the traditional chicken and waffles with the sweet potato, nutmeg and hot sauce. A nice balance of Savory, sweet and spicy. There are even bits of chicken in the waffle. A tad overkill I must say as it didn't really need/add to it. Biscuits and gravy were a nice contender; no twist on this though, just an additional eggs any way and cole slaw, which was rather bland. The rich chicken sausage gravy and tender biscuits held their own however, and it didn't need any more pizazz. We over did it with the super-flight of french toast, and while it was a good sampling, not all were amazing but well done. It included blueberry, strawberry (tasted like strawberry gel in pies), lemon, caramel pecan and birthday cake (special of the day). Well done B&B."

4/30/2013,20130430,1,4.23,"My husband and I went to eat breakfast at this location because we bought a restaurant.com gift certificate. We sat down and I ordered the french toast flight and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles. We thought our food was quite good and would be willing to come back. However when we received our bill we were told by our server that the establishment was no longer taking the gift certificates and that we had to present the certificate before we sat down. We looked on the paper and no where does it say that we had to mention it before we ordered. We asked to speak with the manager, which he later came to the table to discuss the issue. He told us they no longer accepted the gift certificates any longer and did not do a thing to make the situation better.  This place has poor customer service and even after speaking with the manager found that they do not know how to treat their customers. Needless to say, we will not be going back and they will say anything to make a few extra bucks.On our way out, we asked to speak with the manager again about the situation. The manager explained that no one in their business signed up for restaurant.com and that restaurant.com put the gift certificates online without permission from the establishment. When we spoke with him a few minutes earlier about the issue he never mentioned that and simply said that they were no longer accepting the gift certificates. It seems like they are changing their story so they do not have to give the discount and are will to lose customers over a few extra dollars."
5/2/2013,20130502,5,4.24,"Drove in from the South Suburbs with my hubby after getting recommendation from a friend. Arrived at opening on Sunday, so no wait. Staff was attentive and knowledgable concerning the menu. I had the strawberry french toast. It was delicious, light and fluffy with just the right amount of strawberry flavoring. Coffee was excellent, which is one of my requirements for a good breakfast establishment. My husband had the chicken and waffle and cleaned his plate. The manager was very friendly and greeted all customers.The local artwork on the walls added to the ambiance.We would definitely make the trip again and bring friends or family."
5/5/2013,20130505,4,4.24,Pretty good food. Just beat the morning brunch rush at 10:15. The portions are perfectly sized.
5/7/2013,20130507,3,4.23,This a great breakfast place especially if you love French toast. Its not perfect service like any other brunch spot but it is worth a visit. I will be going back for sure.

5/9/2013,20130509,5,4.24,"Dear other breakfast places, pack your bags cause the champ is here!! As a ""breakfast person"" I have found my little slice of heaven. I have been here twice and floored twice. The food is so delicous. The wait staff is very friendly. The manager checks on you and chats candily about the place and they have a very soulful music background. Think Marvin Gaye, MJ, Stevie Wonder, Jill Scott all while you enjoy your meal. Thursday is house music day. House music and french toast? Umm yes please. Speaking of which I had the french toast flight. Four different ones each in a different flavor. Strawberry, lemon, pecan, carmel. All incredible. I dont even like strawberries but I LOVED this french toast. I also had the best chicken sausage I ever tasted in my life! Most chicken sausage taste like cardboard. This was decadent! Run don't walk to this spot. Weekends are packed and for good reason. They may have to knock down a wall soon for space. Get in early. They close at 3. I can't wait to try the something new on the menu next time!!"
5/11/2013,20130511,5,4.24,BEST BRUNCH SPOT EVER!! Food is always fresh and great! Love the staff and the Owners always speak to the patrons. I have been back every weekend since my FIRST time..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! :)
5/11/2013,20130511,3,4.24,"I came here for the sweet potato waffle and fried chicken... and I left still starving. Why you ask? I'm not sure what happened. I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars if I could but I've rounded down for this one because I left still hungry...Came here with a group of 5.. 3 of us including me ordered the sweet potato waffle and fried chicken. My friends waffle came out superb, light fluffy and sweet with the chicken pieces inside. Mine... dense, slightly browned, and not so good. In fact I only ate the chicken and left my waffle because it just didn't taste right to me. In the end they didn't charge me for my dish but I think I would have preferred them to have gotten it right instead of me leaving just as hungry as I went in. I also tried the sweet potato hash, I guess I was expecting something on the salty side but instead I got something overly sweet so I wasn't a fan. There was definitely a big crowd for this neighborhood establishment, we waited for about 30 minutes but they were very good with service. Someone told me their french toast flights were also very good, maybe it was just a fluke with my waffle but its enuogh to deter me away for a while."
5/13/2013,20130513,5,4.24,"My sisters, nieces and I ate here for Mother's Day. Yes, the wait was long but we expected it. While we waited the owner came out and offered everyone coffee and stayed a while to talk with his customers. But once we were seated, OMG the food was well worth the wait. I had the super flight which is french toast in different flavors. It was so good I wanted to order another plate and was tempted to get a serving to go. I also had the chicken sausage which was good. My sister and niece had the crab cake benedict. It was heavenly. I will definitely order that the next time. My other sister had the sweet potato waffles with chicken and it was good too. My son recommended this place and we all truly enjoyed it and will be back again SOON. It's a true hidden gem."
5/14/2013,20130514,5,4.24,"AMAZING brunch! And BYOB to boot! A must-try!!I have been several times and could not have better things to say about this place :) The wait is usually 15-20 min (*standard or less than other Chicago brunch establishments) ans it IS worth it. Along with the DELICIOUS food, they have an extremely friendly staff and the chef comes out to check on how everyone is enjoying their meal.French toast flight = my favorite french toast in Chicago, absolutely delicious! I love getting to try each of the different types.Daily Omelette Specials = I've had both the shrimp alfredo (with egg whites, spinach) & scallop (with egg whites, goat cheese, asparagus) I would definitely recommend both! And they come with cheesy hashbrowns -- so yummy!Bonus - Byob! Bring your own champagne for mimosas/bellinis (& just order juice) or whatever brunch drink you would like."
5/14/2013,20130514,4,4.24,"gotta try their french toast flights. it is to die for. excellent neighbourhood breakfast joint, not too pricey and excellent service. Chef even comes out and greets you some times. recommend going early on weekends as I have seen long line ups."
5/16/2013,20130516,3,4.24,"Let's start by saying the food was very good. The French Toast flight was excellent. But I was kinda done after waiting over an hour for a four top. When the server came to take our order the computer crashed. Oh, then it crashed again when we were trying to get our bill! If that kind of thing is happening even once a month seems to me they should invest in a backup system or go back to the old credit card swipe machines that take an image of your card!"
5/17/2013,20130517,5,4.24,"B and B has ruined just about every other breakfast place in Chicago for me. I literally don't want to go anywhere else. EVER.And to think, if I had gotten the address right of another Lincoln Avenue breakfast joint, I might never have stumbled upon this amazing place. I've been four or five times now and I love it more every time.The staff is really, really friendly, especially a particular waiter who loves to tell riddles and is absolutely hilarious and so personable that you want to invite him to join you for breakfast. Chef Ryland (I think) regularly makes the rounds of the restaurant and personally asks everyone how they are enjoying their meal. It's obvious that he has a great deal of pride in his little business, as well he should!The decor is pretty and inviting.But all of this would amount to nothing if it didn't have quality food, it is a restaurant after all! Let me just say:The food is simply incredible.Almost everything is homemade, organic, local, FRESH, etc. They even grind their own sausage.I highly, highly recommend the flight of French toast - I think I've had it every time I've gone. It's so good I can never decide which flavor to save for last. I usually end up regretting saving anything for last because I am so full!The sausage is full of flavor, both the pork and chicken are good. The cheesy potatoes are one mouthful after another of cheesy goodness.I've never ordered their specialty, the Cluck and Gaufre, which is fried chicken in a sweet potato waffle with fried chicken on top, but a friend has had it and said it was good.On top of all of this, a righteous cup of coffee.You can't go wrong with B and B."
5/21/2013,20130521,5,4.24,"This is a case of the 'Most Improved Customer Service"" review. In my 2 previous assessments of this restaurant, the customer service was the torn Achilles heel of such quality food, and made for a squeamish experience. Upon returning a succession of times, and hoping for the best, I finally was witness to the service that such a restaurant should have with quality food. My reservation prior was with a few of the wait staff, who were either too concerned with customer interactions and not food service efficiency, or a host/hostess that wasn't present to seat me and my party in a timely manor (with light-moderate table activity). These areas have been improved drastically, perhaps due to the absence of the employees at fault for such analysis. Ever since returning, there is a new rotation of servers/wait staff that are far more efficient to the customer needs (all around), and the environment has a smoother aesthetic with these updated employees. My preferred time to dine in is Monday after 1p, where the observation of the improved service has been noted for about a solid month now, which means that the changes were not by chance. If you care to experience the great food, and the newly improved service efficiency, perhaps the weekday afternoon post-lunchtime would be great. I raise my glass to Batter and Berries for making the adjustments, and reward improvement by engaging my colleagues in that direction, so please keep it going. w.k-"

5/29/2013,20130529,5,4.25,Great place! Was there the first time today and I got the Rylon salad and strawberry French toast. Both really good and decent price. Except the coffee was $3 which I thought was a bit pricey. But overall it was great!
5/29/2013,20130529,5,4.25,"This was my 3rd visit, and I must say. . . it's better every time! The Lobster Omlet special #56 was AWESOME! Also the Crab Cakes Benedict. I waited over an hour (Memorial Day) but worth every minute! Must go !!!"
5/31/2013,20130531,5,4.26,"Best French Toast I've had! Definitely going back. (Had the Flight, they were all good)."
6/2/2013,20130602,5,4.26,"Good food, great service, pleasurable environment. Will definitely come back!!!"
6/4/2013,20130604,5,4.27,"Went for lunch today and was AMAZED. The waitress insisted we made no changes or add-ons to our food at the demand of the chef and I was not expecting to be proven so right. We ordered the french toast flight which comes with lemon, blueberry, strawberry, and plain french toast as an ""appetizer"" and it was so delicious with the maple butter and I'm so glad I didn't add syrup. I also had the BBQ chicken sandwhich, which was good as well, but the herb fries were to die for (esp bc I love super seasoned food). Def going back!"
6/7/2013,20130607,5,4.27,"Worth the wait.... Come b4 u get hungry because u will have to wait... Good things r served 2 those that wait @ B&B.Friendly attentive staff, best breakfast I've had in Chicago ...... In a word, GO!"
6/7/2013,20130607,4,4.27,"Everything was really good. I came here for a birthday brunch with a few friends and we all shared each other's food. The french toast was FABulous! I really like the fact that the french toast was designed to not need extra condiments. It was a very French-like thing to do like it is considered rude to ask for A1 sauce for your steak. A friend ordered filet mignon and it sounds odd to say this but it was definitely one of the better filet mignon I've had and this is a brunch place!! The artwork hanging on the walls were intriguing too, not the usual artwork with paint splattered all over the canvas and selling for $400-500."
6/9/2013,20130609,5,4.27,"Seriously the best breakfast food in Chicago. Amazing staff. We came here for a meeting and decided to order a few plates of everything. We ordered the french toast with different toppings like lemon and pecans, amazing. Chedder eggs, belgian waffle, bacon, it was all perfect. I will be back for sure!!!!"
6/11/2013,20130611,3,4.27,"Coming here I had two expectations: delicious batter and berries galore. Unfortunately, Batter & Berries only came through on having tasty batter, but failed to deliver on my ""berry"" expectations.According to the menu, the pancakes I ordered were said to come with seasonal berries. I was disappointed when they arrived with one strawberry and literally ten blueberries. Not nine, not eleven - ten. Never mind the fact that the word berries is in the name of this establishment, compared to how similar dishes are served at other brunch places in the area - M Henrietta, Tweet, and Sola, to name a few - this just felt cheap. The batter of the pancakes was tasty - as was that of my girlfriend's waffle (she ordered the ""goof"") - but at the same time, her fried chicken was dry.My other complaint was the service. The host was not unfriendly, while at the same time being everything but friendly and welcoming. Add to that, we had to wait a few minutes for a table - not a big deal - but when we were seated we were surprised to find that we were sat at a communal table. That's not a big deal either, but it would have been nice to have been told this / given an option ahead of time. Our waitress was friendlier, but when our food took a long time (~20-25 mins) to come out (and indeed, several other two tops around us who ordered after us were served before us), I had to get her attention to find out what was going on, instead of her being proactive about it.We may come back to try some of the other dishes, but with so many good brunch options around Chicago, it would be far from being our first choice."
6/12/2013,20130612,5,4.27,You haven't eaten brunch until you've been here! #noleftovers
6/12/2013,20130612,2,4.26,not a fan. greasy and impossible to avoid oily cheese. hash browns way under cooked even after sending them back. I do not get the hype about this place. we had to keep asking for coffee refills as well. I do admire that the owner has busted his tail to open his own restaurant. Takes courage and shear determination.If you want the best brunch in the city check out Mhenry or MHenrietta.
6/13/2013,20130613,4,4.26,"Was looking for a brunch place by my lonely self, and decided on this place because the menu just looked so different than your standard brunch place. Since I was by myself, I sat at the communal table right in the center, which was completely fine by me. Got me in and out quick! I was a bit embarrassed when they yelled out ""ED PARTY OF ONE!!!"" Awkward lol.Ordered the Cluck-N-Gaufre. Being a fan of sweet potato, waffles, and chicken, I just had to try this out. The waffle certainly did not disappoint. Had a strong sweet potato flavor, the flavor of the syrup was there, but I still had to drizzle some extra on the top because I like my waffles wet. The chicken inside was a nice touch, but I don't know if it added a whole lot. The fried chicken I got wasn't super hot when it came out, but I still ate it anyway."
6/13/2013,20130613,5,4.26,Convenient location and great service and accommodation. I ordered the french toast flight with bacon and hash browns and everything was delicious! The chef came out and chatted with us for a while to make sure everything was to our liking and told us to come back again soon. I'll have to bring champagne along next time to take advantage of the BYOB offering.
6/16/2013,20130616,4,4.26,"I've been hearing about this place for some time and I finally wandered in for brunch this weekend.NOTE: B&B is a BYOB, so be sure to stop by your local party store for champagne, etc.B&B's brunch menu is made of up of SEVERAL varieties of French toast, pancakes, standard stuff (eggs, hash browns), and the chicken and waffles dish.My order: standard breakfast with chicken sausage ($1 upcharge). Amazing.The sausage is patty-style, and it tasted very fresh - definitely not processed/packaged/frozen.The servers and staff are very welcome and friendly - I'll be back to try some other dishes."
6/18/2013,20130618,4,4.26,"I never write reviews for restaurants even the terrible ones, however I would be an injustice not to write a review for Batter & Berries. I went here for breakfast on Father's Day and it was a great way to start the day. I had the crab cakes benedict and the peach cobbler french toast. OMG, what an outstanding meal and who could not love the Purple & Gold decor. This is the place to eat and I will definitely be back over and over again."
6/19/2013,20130619,3,4.25,"I'll admit that Batter & Berries has great french toast. Where else can you find watermelon french toast?! My only complaint is the fact that they use regular white bread so the toast gets limp and soggy. The result is great flavor, not so great texture. The chicken & sweet potato waffle was tasty as well. Even the hot sauce they use is good and I don't even like spicy food. I like that the chicken is boneless so you don't have to eat it with your hands."
6/21/2013,20130621,5,4.26,"Seriously what is not to love about this place?!?!???!First off you walk in and instantly feel warm inside. The decor is super cute and let me tell you, customer service is on point. Every one here has a great attitude and you can tell they love what they do. The manager stopped by and made conversation with us which I thought was nice. Our waiter was hilarious (can't remember his name) and kept coming by at various points with riddles. Cracked me up. I noticed he didn't do this with every one so he probably has a sense of who's up for it and who's not.On to the food. Maaaaaaaannnnnn that Chicken & Waffle. Forget about it. Not a drop left on my plate. The amazing waffle was stuffed with fried chicken and was accompanied with a nice piece on the side with hot sauce on it. Maple butter on top. This dish didn't even need syrup. The combination of flavors were great.My dad had the biscuits and gravy with cole slaw and eggs. I had some and the flavors when perfect together. I am so picky with cole slaw... that stuff was good.We both had a cup of coffee which was fresh and always filled quickly. I found this place randomly and am glad I did. Can't wait to go back and try their other unique dishes. It not cheap but not too pricy for the quality either.Stop in and try it out. I doubt you'll be disappointed."
6/22/2013,20130622,4,4.25,"What's not to love about Saturday or Sunday brunch. My friends and I a group of 3 arrived around 11 am and were seated by 11:30 am. Batter & Berries is cosy and has cute decor. Getting seated at our table was a little confusing because the hostess was trying to seat 2 groups of people at once. Once we were seated we were given our menus and visited by our waiter. He recommended the french toast with is there speciality. A few minutes later the waiter returned with coffee and a iPad for entering our orders. Before long our orders arrived. One friend chose the flight, I had the lemon french toast and another friend got the chicken and waffles. All three things were good. The service was good as well."
6/22/2013,20130622,5,4.26,"This is one of those restaurants that you walk away just feeling impressed that food can be this good! Do yourself a favor and eat breakfast here if you're in Lincoln Park. I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on favorable reviews and it was worth it. I had the french toast flight and got to try a little bit of everything--strawberry, blueberry, caramel, and lemon I believe. There are only two major drawbacks with this place and they have nothing to do with the food! First, there are large crowds depending on the time of day you go...this attests to the fact that the food is great. Second, parking can be a bit of a hassle here, but that is true of most places in Lincoln Park. Overall, a great french toast experience and a must try."
6/26/2013,20130626,5,4.26,Yes you will have to wait in a Soul Train line unless you get there early but it it worth it. My faves are the lemon french toast and almond tea. Friends are coming in a few weeks and we will be back to enjoy the great food and welcoming staff.
6/27/2013,20130627,4,4.26,"Some of the best Chx and waffle you can find. Get therr early, it gets packed."
7/4/2013,20130704,4,4.26,Went to Batter & Berries while visiting Chicago. Took the L from our hotel and then a short walk. Food was amazing (we went for the chicken&waffles and french toast flight). We loved both but were both floored by the chicken and waffles. The manager (or owner - not sure) stopped by the table to greet us and then gave directions to some nearby sites. Overall a great choice for brunch!
7/5/2013,20130705,5,4.26,"Like most of the other reviews, the food is incredible. I am a huge fan of the french toast and the maple butter is out of this world. It's one of the few brunch places that can not only provide a diverse menu, but make all the dishes top notch. There is nothing on the menu that I've seen myself or others not enjoy.Perhaps what I like best about the place is how passionate they are about the food. The chef genuinely seems to care that you enjoy your meal and the servers go out of their way to make sure you are happy. It seems each time I'm there something new has popped up on the menu that is worth trying.The only problem is that it can be difficult to get a table at times. It's not their fault though that they've become so popular. Obviously word has gotten out. If you do hit them up on the weekends, go early or be prepared to wait. Prices are a bit high, but you honestly get your money's worth with food this good.With food this good, I""d love to see them offer a carry-out option in the future."
7/10/2013,20130710,5,4.27,"Come armed with a joke and tell it to your server! BTW, the Cluck-N-Gaufre is the best thing ever! Actually...I've gotten that the past few times I've been there. I'm confident if I branched out to something else on their menu I would probably fall in love. We shall see!"
7/14/2013,20130714,2,4.26,My second time at this place... I gave it a second chance even though our 1st experience started with a rude hostess that did not want to honor our request for a four top... Understandable considering we were a party of 2. She told us we couldn't sit there unless we had 3-4 people in our party which was fine until we looked around and saw multiple 4tops filled with 2 people. Whatever the food was good. So now a month later we go again and yet again was met with a little rudeness from the same hostess. When she was asked if we wait outside for our name to be called how will we know our table is ready..... Like to me that is a simple question but I guess she was asked that too many times and got frustrated by it. This time our food tasted like they rushed to prepare it... Not overly satisfied.
7/17/2013,20130717,4,4.25,"before making this place our mommy/daughter breakfast selection this month, I did my research - read some reviews, checked pics of the food etc.I noticed, many of the bad reviews all centered around bad customer service and/or the wait so I was already prepared but turns out Those bad reviews had to have been before their newbie kinks were worked out... because customer service was certainly NOT a problem today. mind you we arrived @ 8:36am on a Saturday though and they open @ 8:00am - perfect timing on our part I might add.. because we were greeted, seated, served and walking out in about an hour! by then here was a line waiting outside to get in. whew!. Elvira was there in a flash but then gave us our space to peruse the menu as it was our 1st time. my daughter decided on the Banana-Nut Belgigue... it was yummy even the next morning! I had the super flight of french toast- the diff btwn a flight and the super flight is the super adds an extra triangle of whatever the flavor of the week is: so I had a taste of blueberry, my least fav, strawberry, caramel nut, lemon yum!, and the spcl flavor was pineapple upside down cake also yum! even thought the place only seats apprx 68 ppl, it was bigger than I had envisioned and quite pleasant. other than the odd waiting area smack dab in the middle of restaurant- who thought that was a creative idea?!. my daughter enjoyed the waiter-his name escapes me as I type- who had her solving riddles for her doggie bag LOLour orders came out timely, correct, and hot. I saw many complaints of this as well... it must be the time and/or day you wandered in... I'd give it another shot if I were you.I must point out to reviewer Katrina C who complained the lemon french toast tasted like lemon, heaven forbid, and I quote: Not like bread or cinnamon or anything french toast-like .why in the world would I want my 'lemon' french toast tasting like cinnamon ewww. ijs. everyone's plate going by looked more delish than the last - can't wait to get back to try more 'n' more items...next up if available...for sure is that lobster omelet! my daughter was disappointed she didn't get to meet the chef but enjoyed her food and our quality time immensely nonetheless. Thank you B&B for a perfect setting. Moms: there's a nail spa right across the street !Sincerely,a satisfied customer"
7/17/2013,20130717,1,4.24,"And now the reply from the Manager to the email I wrote to him!! Now, maybe it's just me, and i'm speaking from over 40 years of hospitality work, is that any guest who sends a personalized email to the boss outlining the great food, some good/bad news, and a negative observance about staff behavior would want to respond asap and NOT blame the guest for his outreach. Contrary to my last line in my first email I will not return to Batter & Berries.""Chris,I apologize for not returning your email in what YOU considered a timely fashion, but I was not the server, and the matter has been dealt with.Thank you for your concern and Yelp review.Don JonesGeneral ManagerBatter & Berries""A copy of an email I wrote to the manager, which did not merit a response from him.Afternoon Don,I just left your restaurant after it being recommended by my co-worker. She suggested the french toast as it was the best she'd ever had. Of course I disputed that because I think the restaurant I work at has the best. She said to get it without any syrup and I was very skeptical; I'm a huge syrup guy. But I did and have to admit it was pretty phenomenal. I had the flight and the flavors were great. It was cooked to perfection. On to the good and bad. The good news is you were busy; the bad news is you were busy. It was pretty loud. :-)Now, something that disturbed me. There was a table of two quite pretty ladies next to my table. They were very nice as well as one of them struck up a conversation with me while she waited for her friend. Anyway, there was an African American male waiter working and though the table wasn't in his station he made a point of going up to the table several times. I know that wouldn't be uncommon for a server to go up to a regular customer and greet them. It's how we get regulars. But every time he went up there were sexual innuendos from the very start. He hugged one of the them and kept putting his hands on both of them. Now, I do that too when I am serving but I do it to every table I come in contact with; it's just who I am. He only did it to that one table, not any in his real station at all. He went over the line when he walked up to the table and while grabbing his shirt asked, ""Do either of you have a needle and thread?"" Before they could answer he pulled up his shirt sleeve and flexed his muscles saying, ""Cuz I'm ripped!!!"" His acquaintance chuckled and the one he didn't know didn't ever smile. She did not think it was funny at all, in fact I would say by her expression that she was pretty offended. I'm not writing to get the server in trouble but I wanted you to know. I'll be back, I know that."
7/18/2013,20130718,5,4.24,"I have now been here multiple times, always with teacher friends. All I have to say is that the teachers of CPS love the fried chicken sweet potato waffles out of this place! Where else can you order a freaking FRENCH TOAST FLIGHT? I'll tell you. ZERO PLACES. I've also tried a bunch of other stuff on their menu and all of it has put me into a temporary sense of euphoria. As if that isn't enough to make you show up, everyone there is kind, and happy, and jovial. As a customer you really get the sense that I love to give people when I cook which is just making people really happy with great food because you like them.If you're smart, I'll see you there. If not, then you obviously hate brunch."
7/25/2013,20130725,2,4.23,"I came here for breakfast with two of my friends a week ago, and the place / food was just ok. The menu is pretty small, which would be fine if they allowed substitutions to be made, but they do not! My friend wanted strawberry waffles, but all they had were blueberry, and weren't willing to give her strawberry.... in fact, they said they couldn't even give her plain!!!--because the batter was premixed. We both ordered the blueberry waffles and it was ok... nothing special; I've def had better. Our other friend ordered an egg sandwich, and it seriously looked like I made it myself in my kitchen.Our server was nice, but I could hardly hear anything he said and I was literally like a foot away from him!The whole experience was kind of a let down."
7/29/2013,20130729,4,4.23,"I recommend this place even though the food may be a tad pricey for the amount of food that is given but its a really good place to eat if you prefer quality over quantity. The French toast was amazing (even though I never ordered it....eating off plates is highly looked upon) and I had the Executive which is steak covered in wine sauce reduction with mushrooms and onions along with cheesy hash browns and eggs, all of which were really good. The food arrived quick and the customer service was great."
8/2/2013,20130802,1,4.22,"How do you turn customers away before they sit down? Take Batter & Berries' ""Business Policy"" and don't even sit them down!We were so excited to check this place out today as it was highly recommended. It was adequately busy for a Friday mid-morning brunch. My boyfriend and I waited patiently for a hostess (or anyone) to greet us and seat us. After a few minutes of figuring out if we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait, an older lady came up to the podium who appeared to be a hostess as she crossed off numbers on a pad. I cleared my throat and loudly greeted HER hello! (sheesh) Then glancing the room a few seconds, she directed us that it would be a 10-15 minute wait. We were dumbfounded as there was a clean 4-top table directly in plain sight of us (not to mention another in the back).""Oh no"", she replied, ""That's a 4-top, That's for four people. There's only two of you."" ""Um...but there's no one else waiting for that table ma'am. There's no one waiting at all"". ""No, but it's Business Policy"". ""So you mean to tell me that you're going to hold a perfectly good table for four imaginary, maybe customers while there are two willing customers who are available right now?""""It's Business Policy here""""Oh, ok. Well then, goodbye.""We'll go someplace who's happy to serve us and won't discriminate by the number of people in our party. This kind of ""business policy"" reeks of poor customer service and heavy focus on their own superiority. Perhaps they should add some humble pie to their menu if they want to stay in business. *Note: Due to this instance, we were unable to try their food so this review has no reflection on their food because well, they wouldn't serve us."
8/2/2013,20130802,1,4.2,"I came here with a good friend of mine. I was expecting the food to be very good because of the reviews I have read on yelp, which rarely fails me. HOWEVER, I was extremely disappointed. First of all, my waitress was terrible. She took 20 minutes to come and check on us and see whether we were ready to order drinks, and then another 15 to take our food order. She also completely neglected to ask whether I wanted any more coffee or water the entire time I was there. (Though the coffee was terrible anyway)Then there was the food. I ordered the broccoli and cheese omelette, with hashbrowns. What I received was a flat omelette, covered in cheese with three hunks of raw broccoli on top. I could have made a better omelette for 1/4 of the price in my own home. The hashbrowns were fine, though they were burnt on top and should have it described on the menu that they were made with cheese and sour cream (in the case a customer was a vegan). The worst part about this place however, was that my friend as well as myself have felt completely nauseated all day. I haven't been able to eat anything at the risk of throwing up--which is definitely attributed to this food. Do not eat here, there are dozens of better spots within two blocks of this place."
8/4/2013,20130804,5,4.21,"Great breakfast. Amazing food. Best buckwheat pancakes ever. My entire family was delighted. The service was great...but a little slow at first...the manager came around to check on us and we got great advice from the waiter. We were thrilled, and it was fun."
8/5/2013,20130805,5,4.21,"Great customer service and wonderful food!!! I had the chicken and waffle and my SIL had the biscuits and gravy...both were delicious!! My 2.5 yo daughter was with us and they were very accommodating, bringing her fruit while we waited for our table and small toys once we were seated. We will definitely be back really soon!!"
8/6/2013,20130806,3,4.21,"Ok the French Toast might be the best I've ever had! Get the French toast flight...u won't be disappointed. I would have given it 4 stars, but the service was slow, she messed up an order, my hash browns were over cooked, & no biscuits on Monday. I have to go back again though to give it a second try."
8/9/2013,20130809,5,4.21,I know what a good breakfast is...with so many options in Chicago it is hard to choose! This is a place you MUST try and not only try but become a regular! Believe me!
8/13/2013,20130813,3,4.2,"I stopped by this past Sunday with a friend who lives right around the corner. Neither of us had been, but the reviews looked great and the people gathering outside signaled good vibes. I went in to check with the hostess on wait times and it just so happened that since we had 2 people they would be able to seat us right away. On a Sunday morning, that's a total bonus! The place is small, and they have a few communal tables which I'm never too thrilled about (especially at brunch). It was a busy little Sunday morning in there, and all of the plates of food going by smelled delicious. The one complaint I must make is the hostess. She was pretty rude, and you can't have someone like that greeting people when they walk in the door. She asked us if a communal table was ok, my friend said she would rather have the two-top in the corner that was being cleared. The girl rolled her eyes and shoved menus at her co-worker standing behind her. That's nice...Things certainly improved when our cheery waiter came over to the table. Service was great. We just did simple eggs, hash browns and bacon but everything was good. Next time I will come back to try the chicken and waffles but hopefully ms. crabby pants will be in a better mood next time!"
8/14/2013,20130814,4,4.2,"Holy goodness, this place is amazing. I ordered their French toast flight with the ""special"" flavor of the week (worth the extra $2) and it could quite possibly be the best French toast I've had in my life. I stole some bites from friends' plates and the waffles and hash browns are also good. French toast was the winner hands down though. Decently priced for Chicago and for the amount of food you get. The hostesses weren't the most friendly but that didn't affect our experience too much. Our food came out late, however they generously discounted our meal and came out and personally apologized for it.Overall I would definitely recommend it!One last tip- you might have to wait a little depending on the day. Less wait time if you're flexible with seating."
8/15/2013,20130815,5,4.21,"I live in Houston, TX, and was brought to this place by a couple of fellow ""foodie's"". I am planning a trip back to Chicago, FOR THIS BREAKFAST SPOT.Best breakfast I have ever had, and we tried 5 different dishes at our table. Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict was AMAZING. Their French Toast flight was probably the best French toast I have ever had. The Chicken and Waffles, with chicken IN THE WAFFLE, rivaled my favorite chicken and waffles spot here in Houston, and DESTROYED their version. I got lucky and had one of our tablemates get there early to wait in line for a table, other than that, the service was superb. Excellent and funny waiter, would leave us with a riddle, and come back with the answer. We were never thirsty or wanting for too long, and deserved the great tip we left. Goods: Everything, especially the FOOD, followed closely by the excellent service.Bads: The wait, and it not being in Houston."
8/15/2013,20130815,3,4.2,"I was recently introduce and had to go for breakfast 3 days later. I enjoyed the cheese hash browns, pork sauage & sea scallops. Unfortunately, I did NOT enjoy the egg white omelet & french toast flight . Our server was pleasant. Yes, I will go again not sure when."
8/16/2013,20130816,3,4.2,"3.5 starsThe food was good, but expensive for the amount given. $11 for the Flight of French toast which came with 4 triangles of assorted French toast and NO sides, is a bit ridiculous. Each side you get is an additional $3 each, so if you want French toast with bacon and potatoes, be prepared to pay $17 for your food alone, never mind if you have guests with you. I got the cheese crusted hash browns. The hash browns were good, but I've had better. The French toast was so damn good though man let me tell you. You can also get the super flight which is 1 more triangle for $2 of their flavor of the week or whatever. Mine was cherry pie so I didn't end up getting it. Then, there's this maple butter on top, which is to die for. You don't even need syrup for this dish. Our bill for 3 people was around $60The customer service was great and our server was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable about the menu front to back, as well as the specials that were going on. The food came rather quickly.I liked this place, but the prices are enough to hinder me from returning."
8/18/2013,20130818,5,4.2,"The food is awesome. ..everything made fresh and from scratch! Service was good...staff was friendly...food was AMAZING. Only wish they had a mobile website, would have made it easier to find/call! I will definitely go back!"
8/23/2013,20130823,4,4.2,Food was really good. The french toast was yummy and so were the hashbrowns. Service was friendly. Our waitor was super funny because he was sharing riddles with us.
8/23/2013,20130823,4,4.2,"Nom, nom...and nom! As you know anything that gets a buzz in Chicago gets crowded quick, but when I came to visit my hometown Chicago last weekend I had to visit this place. I heard the words ""chicken stuffed sweet potato waffle"" and was sold. First of all, the chicken that came with this waffle was the absolute juiciest, well seasoned, fresh piece of meat ever...no, really. Fried to perfection. I wish they fried chicken and sold it. In fact, I hope this place ends up on one of those Food Network shows for the best chicken and waffles. The waffle was pretty good too. I was expecting a more sweeter taste, something with a little more cinnamon/nutmeg/vanilla--almost like pie, but it was actually a great combination with the chicken. I requested syrup because I have a severe sweet tooth and almost gave the chef a heart attack. He was very cool and came to the table to ask if I had tasted it sans syrup and I assured him it was perfect as is, but I'm a messy foodie who needs it extra fat. I wish I had've tried more things, everything honestly looked great. The service was enh...just okay, but they had ""cute"" little iPads to give you a glimpse of the food before you ordered. Even with the not so great service the food was delicious and the place has a real home feel to it. Nothing over the top, no fancy napkins, just great food, great music and a friendly atmosphere."
8/24/2013,20130824,4,4.2,Fast and VERY friendly service. The French toast and bacon seems like it was made earlier in the morning and warmed to serve. Go for the service and variety.
8/24/2013,20130824,2,4.19,Service was slow but nice and fun attitude made up for it. Food was the problem. Hash browns were not fresh. Clumps of hard cheese mixed with dry potatoes! Lobster cakes had a weird consistency. Broccoli omelette was over cooked. Maybe the sweet stuff is good?
8/25/2013,20130825,5,4.19,"Superb service! The owner/chef is personable and the staff is welcoming. The food is extremely fresh, hot, and mouth watering delicious. It was well worth the drive! So pleased with this experience! Ill definitely be back!!!"
8/27/2013,20130827,5,4.2,"French toast here is amazing. I also had the chicken stuffed sweet potato waffles that were pretty damn good. Restaurant is nice, great service, great location. Portions are large. Would definitely recommend this for breakfast/brunch. I'll be back for sure."
8/28/2013,20130828,5,4.2,"Batter & Berries & Brunch & Breakfast...Oh MY! This place is twerking me...just like Miley.#amazingserviceOur girl went over everything. Was attentive and showed us lots of yummy pics on her handy mini ipad. I was drooling within 5 mins of walking in and wanted everything on the menu.#amazingbreakfastYummy crab omelette with egg whites, smoked gouda cheese, HUGE chunks of crab (#sorrysebastianfromlittlemermaid.Iateyou), delicious cheesy, creamy, crunchy hashbrowns. Amazing super french toast flight...yup, didnt need extra syrup. I loved the crunch that was in every bite. Strawberry, blueberry, caramel, lemon, oatmeal raisin...they all were #delicious#greatpriceBrunch that doesnt blow the bank...yup, its here. BYOB if you are interested. Fantastic coffee#iwillbeback#goduringtheweek!"
8/31/2013,20130831,1,4.19,"I was looking forward to eating at B&B this morning until I arrived. I was still interested in dining there despite the bad reviews regarding their bad service. When we walked into the restaurant we were escorted past several empty tables to the back of the restaurant near the kitchen. When we asked why, we were given a lame excuse about the servers needing to wait tables in that area. When we insisted on eating at a table we just passed by we were greeted with a quizzical look. At the end of our meal I asked to speak to the manager. We expressed our disappointment with our arrival and he became defensive and unapologetic. I understand why the service is poor because management sets the tone. Needless to say, we will never dine there again. P.S. the pancakes were very tough and I only ate half of the order."
9/1/2013,20130901,4,4.18,"Waited over an hour on saturday around 1pm...but it was worth it for the french toast, best french toast I ever had in my life! i forget the name..I think they put graham crackers on it . I will definitely be back :)"
9/2/2013,20130902,5,4.19,"My new favourite breakfast place. The flight of flavourful French Toast is a must to perk up the morning pallet. I wanted something different and the crab omelette hit the spot. It was light and fluffy with the right amount of zucchini, cheese and onions. This was my 3rd time and the wait for a seat is well worth it. The chef always greets the crowd and the waiting customers. I am very pleased again!"
9/2/2013,20130902,5,4.19,I think this is what I've been looking for in a breakfast joint!! Quality. Quantity. Wonderful service. Nice patrons. What more can you ask for? And the menu has something for everyone. Regular classics. And creative gourmet. I hope this place stays open for a long time. I plan on becoming a regular.
9/2/2013,20130902,4,4.19,"Very, very good, and consistent. I just wish they would offer a healthy breakfast choice or two. When they had an egg white special, it was loaded with a creamy sauce that negated the egg whites. (Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but I am looking for healthy choices on the menu every week!! My husband doesn't care as much, but I do!) Offer a fruit bowl, egg white frittatta or something that I know I can enjoy guilt free."
9/2/2013,20130902,4,4.19,"We got there at 10:30am and the wait was about 50 minutes. The service once we got inside was also a little slow. These are the only reasons I'm taking away 1 star, because otherwise the food was AMAZING. We got the french toast flight that had one piece of every type of french toast and each flavor was delicious! Also got the traditional with the chicken sausage substitution which I highly recommend. Lastly, got the Goof which was OK compared to the other two orders. I would love to go again, but next time, would probably bring a book for the long wait."
9/3/2013,20130903,5,4.19,"Love this place. Great atmosphere, Owner is amazing guy, & the food... Well there is none like it. Food is the best. Thanks for being available."
9/4/2013,20130904,5,4.2,"The only thing I hate about this place is the fact that its in the north side. I wish people starting businesses would do so in our hood versus in the north side. Especially when they are from the south side. Anyway, that's personal shit. This place is awesome!!! We tried 4 different dishes. We had the French toast flight which was so very good. My favorite one was the pecan or cinnamon or praline. It was that kind of flavor. Second dish was the crab cake dish. It was good. Not my favorite, but real good. Flavors were full and rich. Third dish was the chicken and waffles. I don't have to go on about how amazing they were because of all the other reviews. But one this is... They cook the chicken into the batter. Holy crap!! Last dish was- Hmmmm..... I don't quite remember what it was but I know that it was damn good. They took away all our dishes empty!!"
9/5/2013,20130905,4,4.2,"French Toast flight is heavenly. Not as good for large parties as I'd thought, but very kid friendly and the owner is incredibly hands on and nice. I'd go back!"
9/6/2013,20130906,5,4.2,"Excellent service and excellent breakfast! Warmly greeted by Don when we entered. It was our first time here, and Don went over the specials which was well worth it. He made sure we understood how to eat the food to maximize the flavors and it was absolutely amazing!"
9/6/2013,20130906,5,4.2,"Southern hospitality is hard to find north of the Mason Dixon but Batter and Berries is that little taste of home. We've been twice now and are blown away by the service and taste! I love the iPads they use to highlight the specials, the table touch by the chef, and the all around genuine care of their patrons. The French toast is to die for - lemon, graham cracker, strawberry were AWESOME! The crab egg white omelette with the Gouda hits the spot and the lobster Benedict left my foodie friend speechless!!"
9/7/2013,20130907,5,4.2,"Let me say, I NEVER write reviews on anything..But this place?..I just had to. The Food was EXCELLENT!!!! I had the crab omelet, and the French toast flight. My daughter had the kids chicken fingers. Even the chicken fingers were good! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the flavors went together very well.The service was fine for me..I had no issues at all.We did wait about 20-30 minutes but I am a patient person and it was well worth the wait.I'll be back!!!My bill was $49.80 for 3 people (myself, 7 year old and 3 year old)They are a bit pricey but they're worth every penny."
9/7/2013,20130907,3,4.2,"Food was above par. Very delicious. Unfortunately, the service is very poor which should bring down the rating to one star as I personally highly value good service. If I only wanted great food I can cook quite well myself and for much less. The server was dismissive and rolling her eyes. Bad reflection on the business."
9/7/2013,20130907,4,4.2,"Few restaurants master breakfast AND lunch like Batter and Berries can! From the French toast flight for breakfast to the BBQ chicken sandwich for lunch, this restaurant knows how to make every bite scrumptious!  The down fall is the wait - but it is well worth it! An additional nice touch is the owner/head chef comes out to great everyone at the tables quite often. The spot is a must-eat!"
9/8/2013,20130908,4,4.2,"So this is my first review and I must say I had an amazing experience. I saw this place on a friends IG page and thought I would give it a try. It was my sons 19th bday yesterday so we did brunch here. Upon arriving, the first thing I noticed was the 20 people outside waiting for a seat. REALLY?!?! I went ahead and put my name on the list anyway. Standing outside, the establishment had juice outside for everyone to drink. It was delicious and free. ( yall know I love free). As your name came up on the list, the little cute server came outside and called your name with the biggest voice Ive ever heard on a little lady. You could be a block away and hear her. Finally, the cook came out twice while I was waiting to ensure that everyone was doing fine and had no complaints or concerns. Very nice touch. Now on to the food..AMAZINGGG.....I had the french toast flight and it was like heaven in your mouth. They served it with this homemade butter ( I forget the flavor) that I could have eaten by itself. The french toast had unique flavors that required no syrup. I was ready to vomit from being so full. My son tried the chicken and waffles and could not stop eating.Now for the highlight of my meal....( drum roll please.....pause for effect....) my server. I think his name was Tunami. He was the most personable, knowledgable, helpful, considerate, and funniest hostesses I have run into. He was always there to tell you a funny joke and had the place lively. You would think it would be a distraction but it was quite the opposite. I will definately return. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the hour long wait, but it was worth it! Kudos....."
9/8/2013,20130908,5,4.2,"Went here for the first time today and both hubs and I loved it. Considering it was prime Sunday brunch time (11 a.m.), we expected a long wait when we saw a huge crowd outside. We were quoted 35-40 mins, but somehow were seated after only 13 mins. During our wait outside, chef Rylon came outside & told everyone about the specials that day - which I thought was super cute because you could tell how excited he was and that he truly loves what he does. Our server was super friendly & our food came fairly quickly. I had the french toast flight (lemon, caramel, strawberry & blueberry) along with the cheesy hashbrowns. Hubs ordered the banana nut belgigue (waffle) and homemade chicken sausage. Everything was delicious - this definitely makes our list of top brunch spots in the city."
9/10/2013,20130910,5,4.2,"Is there a way I can give more than 5 stars? Because I seriously need to give B&B more than 5 stars. Seriously.My debonair breakfast buddy B.V. has been raving to me about this place for a while now, but for one reason or another I could never make it up there whenever I visited him in Chicago. This time, I struck it lucky! We were just there this past weekend & AHA! We got moving in time enough to get to B&B for brunch!We knew there would be a wait for our party of 3, but what I didn't know was that the chef provides a YUMTASTIC berry drink for folks who have to wait outside for a table. It was freshly made, & had real blueberry pieces in it. I wanted to hug the cooler it was in, it was so good. One of the managers came out & chatted us up as we waited for our table; he was hilarious! Just one of the many ways B&B shows their appreciation for their customers. The other way they show it is with their STELLAR food!So finally the wait was over (it was actually pretty short, considering how many folks were already dining or waiting) & we were seated. Our server T. was so awesome & hilarious, I want him to be my new bff. He was so amazing & funny, I ~have~ to tack on an extra star over & above the 5 stars just for him. He welcomed us first timers to the place warmly, & seemed to be having as great of a time as we were! We each got the french toast super-flight, & they were DREAMY. I almost couldn't deal with all of that deliciousness on one plate. The hashbrowns come with cheese in them by default? OH YES. My other friend had the veggie egg-white omelet, & it was all I could do to keep myself from putting my fork into her plate. Not only is the food excellent, but it is plated beautifully. Each plate is a work of art that you can eat. And you should eat them. Lots of them! I'm already plotting my return. It's almost a good thing B&B is so far away from me, because I'd be there every.single.weekend. I'm not even kidding."
9/10/2013,20130910,5,4.21,"Visited Chicago for the weekend and this place was near by. The table couldn't decide what to get so we had 5 different breakfast items. Everything we had was delish. I have told everyone about this place and if I ever make it back to Chicago I am definitely making it back.Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffle - Highly RecommendFrench Toast Flight - A must even if you get one to split. Hopefully they have the white chocolate peanut butter optionDeconstructed Steak Omelet - Amazing and the cheesy hash browns are so good.Brunch is the time to go. Service when we went was great. Friendly, quick, and very knowledgeable.Thanks for the great food!"
9/10/2013,20130910,2,4.2,I honestly have to rate this place as just average. Everything is just a little too sweet for breakfast. I had the french toast flight along with a chefs special chocolate peanut-butter french toast and Chicken Sausage. My wife had the crab meat omelet and my daughter had the Chicken Sweet Potato Waffles. This place would be great for desert but not for breakfast. Did I mention that the cost for 3 people to eat breakfast came to $73.00 or the fact that the wait was over 1 hour. Never again!!!Overrated!!! There are better places to eat a real breakfast. The meal should come with an insulin shot.
9/14/2013,20130914,2,4.19,"Terrible service!! Very disappointed after reading the reviews about the French toast flight, average at best!! Chicken sausage was too sweet. Won't be back!"
9/15/2013,20130915,5,4.19,"First time in, played it safe with a signature dish of blueberry waffles. First bite in, i knew i would be back! I typically think breakfast places think that one wants nothing more on a Sunday morning than to eat their weight in pancakes and maple syrup only to feel over served and under productive the rest of the day. Not so here. Perfect portion size to Keep Calm and Carry On with your day! Next time in, tried their breakfast wrap... I didn't think I could have trumped the blueberry waffles love, yet the addition of their homemade hot sauce easily became my first choice for the following week's order. Oh and they have a ""Waffle of the Week"" that changes every Sunday-big fan of going Sunday (as do others but the wait is barely 15 minutes max for party of 2)"
9/15/2013,20130915,4,4.19,Foods unreal. Price is kind of high but still worth going. You get a lot for your money.
9/16/2013,20130916,5,4.2,Excellent waffle flight and crab omelet. Would recommend - outstanding breakfast find!
9/22/2013,20130922,5,4.2,"Great brunch place!! The food is delicious. I had the French toast flight with a side of bacon. It was amazing! You get to sample every type of French toast that they have. But thankfully each flavor only comes in a half slice, so you don't get completely stuffed. The French toast flight comes in the regular flight or the deluxe flight. The deluxe includes a sample of their French toast flavor of the day. My favorite flavors were the lemon and the caramel. The lemon had a delicious zing to it and was just sweet enough. I wasn't a huge fan of the butter cookie french toast, which was the special of the day. It was way too sweet and the cookies weren't well incorporated into the French toast. But overall, I really enjoyed the flight and I completely understand why this place is known for the French toast. My dining companion got ""the executive"" - steak and eggs. The steak was amazing and cooked to perfection. It was smothered in a delicious gravy - and this is coming from a girl who really isn't a big gravy fan in general. And best of all, it came with the restaurant's signature, delicious cheesy hash browns. Yum!!The service here is also amazing! The owner and the staff are all amazingly friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have a good meal. They also do this cool thing where they place your order from an iPad. Very cool and I think it helps the food to come out quicker. The only downside about this place is that the decor leaves something to be desired. It definitely looks like someone with little to no restaurant experience designed the place. Overall, great brunch place. Definitely check it out. PS - for my fellow tea lovers, they have a great selection of loose leaf teas!"
9/22/2013,20130922,1,4.19,"It's beyond me why this place gets such fantastic reviews. I decided to come back and give it a second try and was seriously underwhelmed. It was a packed Sunday morning and we waited about 45 minutes for a table which is about standard. The hostesses were pretty rude once again. Everything from the initial greet to the way they shouted the names of people on the list when their tables were ready. They didn't seem to give a damn about making anyone's dining experience cheerful. We sit down at the table and the bussboy brings us water and asks us if we wanted coffee. Then we sat there for about 15 minutes before anyone even approached the table. Regulars seem to get treated real well around here and everyone else seems to get seriously overlooked. The chef walked around laughing with all his buddies but I never once saw him table touching with anyone else. The icing on the cake was the chef hacking and coughing while standing at the table next to us. All that was going directly on our food. Have some class buddy. The waiter was unattentive and forgetful. We ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and the biscuits and gravy. Neither were anything special. We asked for a side of ranch and ketchup once the food arrived and never got it. My friend ended up getting up and asking someone else. Not once did our waiter come back to make sure we needed anything. I will also point out that both of the times I've been here, the eggs have been runny. It was pretty gross. I will not be back. What a shame because it's right in the hood."
9/22/2013,20130922,5,4.19,"Waking up ""early"" on a Sunday wondering where to get some grub. We're visiting friends who just moved into Lakeview, so Lincoln Park was en route and a colleague said how great Batter and Berries was. For a table of 2, we waited less than 5 min - note: before 10am. I got the cluck n gaufre( chicken and sweet potato waffle) - AMAZING! My husband got the deconstructed spinach omelet and it was great, too. Friendly wait service and awesome food, parking is free on Sundays, too.... we'll be here again!!"
9/23/2013,20130923,3,4.19,"French toast flight was delicious. All of the flavors were so good, I could not choose a favorite. Crab omelet was decent, however I would highly recommend adding some Old Bay Seasoning to add some flavor to it. Disappointed that the omelet was $16, especially since there was not enough crabmeat to justify $16. Hashbrowns were delicious!Wished I had known it was BYOB..."
9/24/2013,20130924,5,4.19,"Dined Date: Wednesday Sept 4 2013BA-by, Batter & Berries got it going on! It's so refreshing to see a BOB thriving and doing the damn thang.For starters: My Sugar in the Raw vs White Sugar Struggle---------------~Coffee [bottomless] was good (not too weak/not too strong, just the way I likes it)BUT [rewind], after receiving my coffee, WHAT? Where's the white sugar packets? I quickly noticed that there were only Sugar in the Raw and Splenda packets in the sugar dishes, on the tables surrounding me O_Oh hellz NO! Understandably-Supposedly, the Sugar in the Raw [unbleached] is better for you?, but, I have tried it, and I DON'T likes the way it makes meh coffee taste! I was ready to beg! I was thinking to self, there is no way in the world, you 'bout to tell me yawl ain't got no white sugar up in here. My waitress and I laughed 'bout it and she kindly brought me some white sugar-from the kitchen, poured in a little cup. WHEW, thank goodness. Sans the white sugar, I would have had to have her take that coffee off meh bill.~Blueberry French toast, eggs were delicious! I ate 1/2 of everything and got the rest to go. The pattie pork sausage was meh.~Being greedy, I also ordered the sweet potato waffle w/chicken to go; the waffle was meh and the chicken was OK.~Owners of B&B, I love the funky ware that was chosen to rep your concoctions.~Restroom gets an A, as it didn't give me the heebie-jeebies..~I will for sure return to B&B, more than likely, when I have a day off during the week, to avoid the wait that other yelpers yelped about. FYI-B&B is BYOB, but I'll just BMOS {bringMyOwnSugar}."
9/29/2013,20130929,3,4.18,"Dine here Sunday 9/29 for breakfast and the food was great. This food might get me to come back but the hostess is terrible. She greeted us with no smile like she was angry at the world. After asking how many we had she went back to tell the staff to get the tables set and then returned said nothing for a couple minutes while we stood there awkwardly. She then huffed and waved us along to our table. This first impression was terrible and will likely keep me from really recommending it. With all that said the food was great, just don't expect to feel welcomed when you step through the doors."
10/2/2013,20131002,5,4.19,"Got a tip from a new friend that this was the place to take your honey for brunch.  So right. Management, service, food and price were great.  My new friend has moved up to friend for life."
10/2/2013,20131002,5,4.19,"My [genderorientation]friend suggested this place to me, this is a big deal given if she recommends a bad establishment she'll end up as ""battered"" as the berries in the eponymous name. I had the lobster benedict, which laid on top of some kind of potato shards and then coated in a hollandaise sauce that has since been coagulating in my fridge ever since along with all that cheerleader blood. Overall, I'd recommend this place, but the lobster benedict was the most expensive brunch item and id recommend the stuffed chicken waffle instead."
10/2/2013,20131002,4,4.19,"This is my favorite breakfast go-to in my neighborhood. Be prepared for waits on the weekend - but keep in mind, there's a reason why there's always a wait. The food is PHENOMENAL.I've had the lemon french toast and blueberry french toast and loved them both. I really like that you don't even need syrup with the french toast because of the delicious maple butter that comes with the dish. The sides (sausage, hash browns) are a bit on the smaller side, especially if you decide to share, but along with the french toast, you'll leave feeling satisfied.I really like that the chef/owner comes out to meet with his customers and hear how they're enjoying the food. Great customer service.I would recommend Batter and Berries to anyone that loves breakfast - especially french toast!"
10/3/2013,20131003,5,4.19,"Probably one of my favorites Breakfast places in Chicago. Its almost a must-go if you live here or just visiting. I've been here 3 times in the past year and every single time its been better than the time before (which is hard to do). Food - Excellent. Their French Toast may be the best I've ever had. I've tried the French Toast flight and just the regular Caramel French Toast and both were excellent. It was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of sweetness. I've also had Crab Benedict (which I think is a seasonal entree) as well as deconstructed Chicken Fajita skillet. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. And just for a little unknown fact that most people don't know about...THE PLACE IS BYOB. So you can definitely bring champagne, vodka or whatever you like to go along with some orange juice to start your breakfast off right!!!! Service - Excellent. Food came out in a timely manner. Wait staff was very nice, pleasant and professional. No complaints whatsoever. Price - Extremely reasonable especially considering the quality of food they present.The only thing I would suggest is to expect a wait especially on weekends. But the food is definitely well worth the wait. So thats not enough to bring it down from the 5 stars. And I repeat BYOB, BYOB, BYOB, BYOB!!!!!!!"
10/5/2013,20131005,5,4.2,My second visit and it was just awesome as my first! The customer service was off the chain. The manager even came outside and explain the menu and coffee to all while we waited. Our waiter Tim was great!
10/7/2013,20131007,3,4.19,"I will start by saying that my friend and I waited and hour and a half to be seated. The wait staff, managers and chef was very friendly to the people they apparently knew who might I add were seated before us. Another thing is the music. Who plays loud club banging music on a Sunday morning? Batter & Berries does, that's who. I found that very strange. Once seated, we had to wait about 15 minutes for our order to be taken. There doesn't seem to be much structure. The place is very small but surprisingly not that cramped. I thoroughly enjoyed my Carmel french toast. It had a slight crispiness around the edges but fluffy in the center. Not too sweet and full of flavor. The waitress seemed a bit annoyed when I asked for syrup stating that it didn't need it but she can't tell me how to eat my food. She was correct in saying that I didn't need it for the french toast but the chicken sausage was a different story. It tasted like chunky water. I've definitely had better. I thought that the dish was over overpriced. Four triangles of french toast (which don't come with any sides) and 2 chicken sausage patties for $14. In my opinion, the food is the saving grace. If you don't mind the wait and being pushed aside for more familiar guests, this is the place to be."
10/10/2013,20131010,5,4.19,The Flight of French Toast!!! There's nothing else to say. It can get extremely cozy on the inside at times and before you know it the bill can add up but its worth every bite!
10/12/2013,20131012,4,4.19,The service was very attentive. My partner and I shared the deconstructed chicken fajita omelet and French toast. The chicken sausage is homage patties and was very flavorful. The meal was very enjoyable. We went on a weekday so a weekend brunch may be a little slower. We will be back.
10/13/2013,20131013,5,4.2,"Holy moly is this place good, we waiting an hour and a half BUT at least they told us up front. You have to go early or on a weekday, hash browns are awesome. The owner/chef was in the room and I asked him for a big hug because I loved his food so much. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE, but don't freak out about the wait, plan ahead."
10/13/2013,20131013,4,4.2,"I went here two weeks ago on my b-day. It was about 10am and the line was out the door, so imagine my surprise when we were seated immediately. See, it's a reason that I don't travel in packs ;-)  The atmosphere was bright and loud. When I say loud, we could not hear each other or the waitress telling us about the specials. The din of the voices and the house music and the high ceilings makes for an acoustic nightmare. We ordered the sweet potato chicken and waffle to split, she got a chicken sandwich and I, the traditional breakfast. The manager stopped by to chat and said he would stop by to see how we liked it before we left, that didn't happen.The sweet potato pancake was awesome, and I am not a waffle fan. I asked for extra napkins and butter and never got them. I asked for them at separate times. The chicken was tasty, my daughter loved her fries, said they were the best she'd ever had. The traditional breakfast was meh. The temperature was luke-warm as if it had been sitting. The hash browns were like a mush, the bacon was decent. I had asked for my eggs, over hard, I cannot stand runny yolk. What did I get? Medium. When I showed her, she asked me did I want them cooked more? She said it in a way that I should say no. Now it is my policy not to send back food..all those well-done steaks I get, when I ask for medium, I eat. But I cannot abide runny yolks and it was my birthday and I was going to have what I asked for. I'm thinking, I would like some new eggs, but I sat as she got a little plate and scraped the egg off my plate, leaving the gross yolk. They did bring new eggs with dried parsley flakes splashed across the top, which I could not get off, so that ruined it for me.The coffee was good with real cream. I love when you get real cream in a little creamer. I would not return unless I was in the neighborhood and it was before the morning rush."
10/16/2013,20131016,5,4.2,"We frequently eat brunch at FLO, Yolk and Tweet - but we wanted to try something new so ran across Batter on Yelp. There looked like an intimating line upon arrival but it ended up only being a 15 min wait for two (this was on a Saturday at 11ish). But while standing outside, a man approached us, introduced himself as Derek (owner and chef) then asked if we wanted our bottle of champagne chilled in their refrigerator while we wait for our table. We were in such disbelief. What was his agenda? Was he the owner or was he just going to book it down the street after we handed him the bottle? No, he really was the owner and chef and he really did put it in the fridge. Unbelievable customer service. After being seated, our waiter Tim was EXTREMELY helpful. He took his time explaining the menu and answered any of our questions. I tend to over-tip, but this time it was warranted. Our waiter did a great job checking up on us throughout the entire meal and made sure we were comfortable. It was loud but not because of the music (I didn't even hear any music) but because it was packed.Derek ended up coming by our table THREE times to check up on us too, giving us recommendations, background about the food and his culinary journey. I read on a review he only talks to regulars - this was our first time so no. He claimed he had no canned foods in the kitchen and that everything was fresh so I inquired on the location of the lobster in the lobster eggs benedict, which he told me he just received from Maine. We ended up going with the lobster benedict and he was truthful - it was definitely fresh lobster and the poached eggs were perfect to boot. I ordered the Cluck & Gravy (Biscuits and chicken sausage gravy) - excellent biscuits and the gravy was addicting. Portions were large, food came out fast. We kept hearing about how good their french toast was so we ordered the ""SUPER Flight"" and split it. You don't need maple syrup on this because the flavor itself takes care of your palette.That and some mimosas made it a very enjoyable brunch. We'll definitely come back soon - I'd recommend to anyone."
10/27/2013,20131027,4,4.2,"Here on a Sunday for brunch. An hour wait so went to Starbucks for coffee. Had the chicken and waffles, they were awesome! The eggs benedict was ok. The French toast with berries was great! Well worth the wait."
10/29/2013,20131029,4,4.2,M suggestion is to get there before 9 AM because there isn't a wait before that but once it's 9 AM expect to wait at least an hour. The owner is so nice and will come outside if your waiting and he is also very hands on while you are inside. The food is also amazing and different then what you can get anywhere else. I always get pancakes or french toast and my boyfriend gets the steak and eggs which he loves
10/29/2013,20131029,3,4.19,Had the french toast flights. Flavor was wonderful but french toast itself was just lukewarm and tasted like it was made a long time before being served. Butter didn't even melt on it. I was underwelmed after all the reviews.
11/3/2013,20131103,5,4.2,"My friends have been raving about this place for about a year and every time I am invited I either have plans or I am too drunk to get up and get here.I came on a chilly Sat morning and was welcomed to a 35 minute wait which is around my threshold of time for being seated in a restaurant. While I was waiting outside, I noticed a sign that said byob (next time I know!) so I knew a mimosa wasn't going to happen...lol. Also while waiting I was able to see everyone's plate and it made me hungrier as everything looked delicious. My wait ended up being more like 20 minutes.We were shown to our table which was like a communal high top across from a couple that had some loud ass friends that recognized them as they were leaving so there was a temporary discomfort with the seating arrangement, but it was the only space for two that was available at the time so we had to take it. Server came by and gave us a breakdown of specials that weren't on the menu and everything sounded scrumptious. I took a gander @ the menu, but decided on the surf & turf omelet that came along with some awesome cheesy hash browns. The surf & turf omelet included shrimp, steak, cheese and lobster....well worth the $17. One of the best omelets I ever had, no doubt. Bring your appetite here as the portions are a nice size. I noticed a lot of people getting the french toast flights which allows you to taste multiple french toast offerings. Came back again and had the Lobster Benedict and it was also delicious.Awesome food and awesome service! I would definitely recommend getting here before noon as the wait can get pretty lengthy at that point. I also recommend bringing a bottle of champagne if you want mimosas as I said earlier it is BYOB."
11/3/2013,20131103,5,4.2,"A good friend took me the Saturday before my birthday. She warned me the wait would be long. It was totally worth it. Everything I ate was simply beautiful. I am a lover of breakfast. We had the super flight which was a taste of about 5 different french toasts. Each one was amazing. And also, during that time, they featured a crab omelet, it left me speechless.The following week we returned and ordered the crap omelet once more considering it was the last day for it. We have all intentions on returning soon and frequently."
11/5/2013,20131105,4,4.2,"The food here was absolutely delicious. We tried the flight of French toast, which is great if you're a French toast junkie like me and want to try all the different kinds. We also tried the hash browns, i don't know if ill ever be able to eat them without cheese again. Overall good service, but a little slow. I will definitely be back!"
11/7/2013,20131107,4,4.2,"I'm not always willing to wait 40 minutes for breakfast on Saturday, so I'm glad that I actually did. It was amazing. It's a small restaurant with quite a menu of options. We sat at the big community table with about 8 other people. My brother went sweet with the waffle flight; I went savory with steak omelet. We had a side of chicken-apple sausage. My plate was more than enough for two breakfasts (and reheated well the next morning). Coffee was decent. I really enjoyed this place and would enjoy coming back to try more items off their menu!"
11/8/2013,20131108,5,4.2,"Omg this was my first time there today.... This was the best breakfast I've had in a looooooooong time. The service was great I'm definitely going back!!!! I had the sweet potato waffle n fried chicken with ham and sweet potato hash, it was excellent!!!!"
11/9/2013,20131109,5,4.2,Went with three guest and was amazed. People wait for the great experience of food and the atmosphere. It was an amazing experience and the owner comes and welcomes guest to his extended home. THE service is truly on point. We had to share plates just to enjoyable the delectable presentations and taste this amazing experience. Thank you can not wait to return.
11/12/2013,20131112,5,4.21,My husband and I came across this place through yelp reviews the first week we moved to Chicago and it put us off to such a great start! We went for Sunday brunch and were told the wait would be close to 2 hours - and it was well worth it! We ended up getting asked an hour into the wait if we didn't mind sharing a 4 person table with another couple and we said yes (which I normally wouldn't but we were super hungry). It was such a great decision because we met two really great women who always come here for brunch and knew the menu inside and out!. The best part of the experience was that the server would give each table a riddle to try and solve and the chef came out wearing his PJ pants to each table to ask how the food was. Super friendly place that makes you feel like you are eating at your friends restaurant. Fantastic chicken & waffles and chicken sandwhich!We will definately go back again
11/16/2013,20131116,5,4.21,Best Brunch ever. Delicious food and wonderful staff! Chef Ryan came to our table himself and asked what could he do to make it better! They are BYOB so if you want Mimosa being your own champ an and they make it for you. It is worth the wait and believe me you'll go again and again.
11/16/2013,20131116,5,4.21,I have never finished every bite of a plate before and I just did that here today. Ya'll have to try the sweet potato waffles and cheesy hash browns with the homemade hot sauce! Best brunch I ever had!
11/16/2013,20131116,4,4.21,The Fried Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffle blessed by baby Jesus himself & the restaurant is BYOB ! The only bread on I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because if the three hour wait time .
11/20/2013,20131120,1,4.2,"This was our 3rd visit. Came on a Sunday as they opened their doors at 8AM. Friendly staff, bus boy was great making sure the coffee cups were filled. The waitress was great, The food- was a major let down this visit. On our previous visit we had their broccoli cheddar omelette that was was uninspired. Our simple order of Buttermilk Pancakes and the French Toast sampler were just average at best. Had to ask the waitress for syrup. Isn't that something that should just be served with pancakes and French Toast?  The pancakes were one turn away from being burned, the french toast sampler was ok,,,just ok.  The thing that really upset me, was the order was a couple of degrees above room temperature. The place was not that busy, and the server couldn't get that food to our table piping hot off the grill? Come on. That's lame.It was a poor value for what we were served, but that's eating in Lincoln Park I suppose."
11/22/2013,20131122,4,4.2,"Did not disappoint what so ever. Couldn't make up mind so I went with the chicken gaufre, eggs and the hash browns. Came out very quickly and the service was excellent. The hash-browns were definitely worth getting too. Perfect mix of burnt and soft hash. The sweet potato waffle was unique. I don't know if I was totally in love but they were a nice change from the the spiciness of the chicken"
11/23/2013,20131123,5,4.2,"This is the best place to go for an awesome, delectable, and flavorful dining experience with what would seem to be very basic breakfast items. The French Toast is unlike any I've had before with such an incredible variety of flavors - blueberry, lemon, strawberry, spiced Apple, Carmel and walnuts. Though I've never had eggs benedict, the lobster benedict was the best ever! It had huge chunks of lobster fried to a crispy perfection with perfectly cooked eggs on top. This meal was so full of flavor, it so delicately titillated my taste buds that no seasoning (salt, pepper, syrup, etc. ) was ever needed. Not only was the food excellent, but so was the service from the hostess to the table bussers. Even the manager was speaking with all of the customers, helping out where needed and creating an environment of joy and happiness! I will be back!"
11/24/2013,20131124,5,4.2,"Absolutely amazing and delicious!! I think this may be one of my top 3 favorite brunch places...ever! The chicken and waffles is good. The owner was very insistent that I eat it without putting any syrup on it for my first bite. I followed his advice and I was glad I did! Definitely didn't need any syrup. There is a certain sweetness and tanginess that make a great flavor that comes from the hot sauce, the chicken, and the sweetness of the waffle. Absolutely delicious!! The other unique thing about this place is their french toast, which is in several different fruit flavors. The special thing about their French toast is that, it's not just regular French toast topped with fruit, each piece of French toast tastes like the fruit it has on it. It is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it!! As I mentioned earlier, the owner is so nice. Came to our table to ask us how we liked it, was very polite, joked around, was very down to earth. I am going back there every time I go to Chicago!"
11/24/2013,20131124,2,4.2,"MUST GET A SECOND DOOR FOR WINTER!Food is always very good, service is good, but restaurant is FREEZING. We were seated close to the door, and every time the door opened, 20 degree wind blew into the restaurant. Because it is busy, the door was constantly opened. We were too cold to enjoy our meal. We ate quickly and left as soon as possible. Most small restaurants understand that to keep guests comfortable, they need to protect them from the outdoor weather. When we asked the server about the table location, we told us it was the only table available and told us that ""it is the city's fault; they won't let us have an awning!"". huh? how does that address the cold?"
11/26/2013,20131126,3,4.19,"I love, love, love brunch! It's my favorite meal and time of day. I've been to quite a few brunch spots in Chicago and love trying out new ones, especially those that come recommended. And this place is BYO champagne and wine which is nice.It's expected that the wait time at brunch spots will be outrageous for a variety of reasons including a) just as many people love brunch like I do, b) the place is small or c) the place is wait-worthy.I'm going to give Batter & Berries a) and b) for now. My friend had been here before so she raved about it and knew that the wait would be crazy after 11am. So we went at 9am! That's not even brunch mind you... it's breakfast. LOL. Anyway, she was late. Yup, I'm calling her out... late. So at 9am on a Sunday the place was already jumping. The wait was only about 10 minutes, but wow, I'm still surprised there was a wait that early to begin with. You can't get seated until your entire party has arrived so my wait time turned into 45 minutes. Whomp whomp! And it was cold outside. That's another downside of a small location. There's nowhere to house your waiting guests except for outdoors! After a solid 30 minutes of waiting, the manager (I suppose) came out to greet the waiting guests. He gave this whole speech like an auctioneer rattling off specials and must haves, must dos, etc. etc. It was entertaining. At the end of it all, he offered everyone free coffee while we waited. I would have much appreciated that 30 minutes sooner because my fingers were frozen at that point and we got seated shortly after so I didn't get the free coffee after all.We got seated by the window so it was still a little chilly inside, but we were seated so I was happy. They are known for their French toast. They have 4 flavors (I believe) and offer a flight that gives you one of each flavor to try. And according to the manager, their chicken and waffles are the best. I wanted to try something I wouldn't normally make on my own, so I ordered the pork chop that came with eggs and potatoes. The pork chop was made well and it was flavorful. The potatoes, however, weren't cooked long enough. They are made with cheese which sounded exciting, but they weren't fully cooked... they weren't crispy, the cheese wasn't melted, so overall it was a letdown. My friend who had been here a few times before agreed that it was noticeably different from her other visits and wasn't as good. Just my luck. Nevertheless, the pork chop and eggs were satisfying and I had plenty of food. I tasted my friend's French toast and it was really good too. But I don't know. I didn't leave thinking I would be willing to wait however long to try something different on the menu. It's a decent spot and was highly frequented. But it wasn't to die for or to wait 45+ minutes for. I don't think I can give it c) just yet. It's not really wait-worthy but it's ""A-OK""."
11/28/2013,20131128,5,4.2,"I had brunch here a few days ago. I was very pleased with the service and food. The waiter greeted us within moments of sitting down. He gave us all the specials of the day. I choose the French toast flight which was delectable it included lemon, caramel, strawberry and blueberry. I also ordered the cheesy potato and housemade chicken sausage. My friend ordered rhe deconstructed steak omelette and cheesy potatoes. She also enjoyed her food. The owner came around to our table to make sure everything was ok. Its a small quant place and willl def dine here again. We didn't have a wait at all but we dined on a Monday."
11/29/2013,20131129,5,4.2,There was a wait but it was well worth it. The service is spectacular at this place and the food is even better! Best birthday brunch ever!
12/2/2013,20131202,3,4.19,Grossly overrated...no shade just truth! Service and food subpar had similar experience to other reviews. U bring pancakes and have to ask for syrup (great pancakes tho). I'm an egg lover so for me I just need placed of this caliber to use fresh eggs however they did so at my request after that scrambled yellow mess they brought me! Ha! Lastly don't make excuses about how fast bread cools when tell u my French toast could've been warmer (the sampler really does taste delightful). It's worth checking out for something like the lobster eggs Benedict it looked creative and tasty! It's worth a try but not worth a wait...oan: THE MAPLE BUTTER!!!! Ask them to melt it!
12/2/2013,20131202,3,4.19,"I confess that I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I do I come here to assuage it. The french toast is good and their specials are always inventive, although when we ate there today the specials were on an ipad which felt a little contrived. I guess it was nice that we could see pictures of the presentation but it also meant that it took a long time to get through them as they were being shown to our table in the manner of a woman reading a picture book to small children.The waitstaff are always very friendly and attentive and our coffees are always topped off. Possibly because I avoid this place on the weekends(?) but my food has always come out in a timely manner. However, they need to get a second door for winter! It was a warmish day today (40's?) and every time the door opened frigid fingers of chilly air were sent crawling up my back; this is a relatively small venue so there's no escaping that cold."
12/3/2013,20131203,5,4.19,The best!
12/6/2013,20131206,4,4.19,"Batter and Berries is definitely a great place for Brunch!I'll list my complaints first before going into the good stuff.1) SINAGE is terrible! They need really need someone to re-vamp their sign and logo. It blends into the building and makes it difficult for folks who pass by to see/notice. Just from a marketing perspective, their product is already great, now it's time to make it visible and noticeable. You guys should really hire someone with a good knowledge of graphics to really spruce up your menu! Your great product deserves great advertisement to accompany it! 2) The restaurant isn't really designed for large parties, and spacing is quite small and packed. But enough complaining, now onto the great stuff!1) I absolutely loved their menu. The food was delectable! The portions were quite generous and prices were reasonable. The food was incredibly flavorful and the different combinations explored different pallets for taste. We ordered a few different things, chicken and waffles, french toast platter, special lobster dish that day (can't remember the exact name). I enjoyed the different variety of offerings. Overall the food was incredibly scrumptious! The fact that we had to wait 45 minutes for seating a full house is truly a testament of how delicious the food there was! I will definitely be re-visiting on my next escapade to Chicago.2) My other favorite part about this restaurant was the service! I loved their staff! You can really tell that they care about their customers, and really knowledgable and proud of their establishment. The staff really took care of our party when we were there, explaining the menu to us and really patient with all of our inquiries (first timers) . Also this place is incredibly family friendly and stresses community involvement and customer appreciation. The chef came out and randomly made an announcement about how much he appreciated two regulars who have been supporting him from the beginning. Genuine appreciation like that is hard to find now-a-days, but will keep customers coming back from day and day out. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES!"
12/9/2013,20131209,5,4.19,"My co-worker and I took my boss there when she came in from NY. Service was excellent (I love that they show pics of the menu items), and the GM came over to our table and was super friendly. Food was amazing! I had the Bailey's French Toast and my Co-workers had the French Toast flight and the Caramel French Toast. (They strawberry french toast was a little too sweet, but other than that they were all great). We also ordered chicken sausage and eggs. Will definitely be back :)"
12/10/2013,20131210,2,4.19,"Overall, the food is OK for a brunch place; nothing spectacular. The lemon French toast is good, but everything else is just average. Nothing on the menu is a standout and all the food taste pretty blah. The omelets are particularly bad: they're like an overcooked Denny's omelet - belch! (And those are really gross!) On my 2nd visit, I didn't bother to start or finish the omelet - I had it removed. I gave the place 3 visits. There are other, better places to eat.Service, however, is an absolute nightmare - by the maitre d, the wait-staff, and by Donald, the manager. In my final visit, I came as a single person and watched as my name was obviously and intentionally overlooked as the maitre d repeatedly seated individuals who signed in after me. Her feedback: ""We can seat 2 at a table for 4, but not 1 at a table for 2 when it's busy."" That made NO sense considering it was late on a Sunday and it wasn't busy. I purposely arrived later in the day to avoid the long wait. I brought this to the attention of Donald and he just looked at me as though I were speaking French. The guy is totally useless. The maitre d: If you're not careful, she'll seat you at the worst possible table: right near the bathrooms. On my 2 initial visits with a friend, she wanted to place us near the bathroom when other two-person tables were available. Go figure.The wait-staff: For all 3 visits, I had to ask for things: more water, silverware, syrup for the French toast, napkins. On the 1st and 2nd visits (when the omelet didn't work out), I asked for soft scrambled eggs. Each time they came back hard as a rock. I asked the wait-person if that looked like a soft scramble and each time it was ""They look OK to me."" When I asked if they knew the difference between a hard scramble or a soft scramble, the first wait-person said no and the second one shrugged her shoulders. I accept that it's the kitchen's fault, but I recall each wait-person had a hard time with ""runny, half-cooked eggs."" Both times I brought this to the attention of Donald. He says a lot without saying anything: ""I understand. We try to give customers the best service,"" etc., etc., ad nauseum. It was like hearing a recording. He even admits the kitchen staff are challenged on how to execute a soft scramble. Really?! And getting the check on all 3 visits was an effort in futility. Once they serve the food, they're gone! Not a big place, but it's challenging to track down the primary wait-person.If you want me to wait for an hour or longer for average brunch food, it definitely will NOT be Batter & Berries. I'm done. After 3 visits, I won't be back. But, good luck to them. They seem to be popular and I'm sure they'll survive without my contributions."
12/13/2013,20131213,5,4.19,"This place made me love the idea of brunch. Their caramel French toast is to die for, and the employees are all very friendly. Be prepared to wait for a seat, especially on the weekends... but trust me, it's worth it."
12/14/2013,20131214,2,4.18,"I was not impressed at all. I came with a party of 5 and we were seated right away in the middle table, except the service stood in the way of me sitting down for 2 minutes while everyone else was allowed to. This was after my 5K so I was pretty tired by this point. Our waiter seemed annoyed by the moment we sat down. He explained the specials and the flight and such. He took a while to get our order which shouldn't be a long drawn out thing with 20 things on the menu. They also don't allow substitutions so you can't sub in the French toast flavor of the day in the flight unless you add it. At $11 for 4 half pieces of French toast, I wasn't impressed. I could have made it at home and poured the toppings on top myself. They didn't do anything special to make this plate their own. The lemon was different but didn't taste very good. The strawberry flavor and caramel flavor were good but the actual French toast was thin and dry.Our waiter brought our check as one, and refused to split the check. This was really inconvenient and wasn't appreciated. He barely visited us and seemed really annoyed with our table the whole time. We asked about splitting the check with another waiter and he said it's up to the waiters discretion. So basically out waiter was so annoyed he didn't feel like it. Service was rude, they took away our plates and silverware before we were done with our coffee and seemed to want us to rush out. Awful experience, bad service, and subpar food."
12/14/2013,20131214,5,4.19,"Prepare to wait, but it's more then worth the wait. The food here is amazing. The chicken sausage is the best I've ever had. The maple syrup is unlike anything I've ever had. You must try the French toast flight it is amazing. I can't wait to go back."
12/21/2013,20131221,5,4.19,"Stopped by for some hangover food. Any place I can find chicken and waffles is already up there in my books, especially if they are as well made as these."
12/22/2013,20131222,4,4.19,"We really like this place a lot. Our waiter was wonderfully warm and charming. We arrived shortly before 9:30 on Sunday and were seated right away. Our food arrived super fast, so fast you would think they anticipated our order and got a head start!Despite a long list of fab sounding specials, on our virgin visit, we couldn't pass up the Cluck n Gaufre (chicken and waffles) and French toast flight. The chicken and waffles were amazing! Sweet potato waffle with chicken in the batter, with delicious fried boneless chicken breast topped with a wonderful spicy sauce. A perfect blend of sweet and spicy. The French toast flight consists of four of their flavors that they select, no substitution. You can get a ""super flight"" that also includes their French toast daily special. We did the super flight and included the spiked eggnog flavor. The regular flight includes blueberry, strawberry, caramel and lemon. The caramel was my favorite, followed closely by the lemon. The spiked eggnog was also very good but crazy sweet! We love finding new brunch spots, and this one's a keeper!"
12/23/2013,20131223,5,4.19,"So..... Normally I would have wrote a terrible review because of the long wait, but seriously I think the almost 2 hour wait was well worth it!! The service was great, and the food even better. To top it off Batter & Berries was a BYOB without a corkage fee. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try a new brunch restaurant in Chicago. Recommend: Chicken & Waffles (Chicken Waffles & Fried Chicken with hot sauce sauce)."
12/23/2013,20131223,1,4.18,"First your Facebook page and now here..And now on to my yelp review...I wish I could give you guys 0 stars. My experience was THAT bad. Your hostess was the rudest and most unprofessional person I think I've ever encountered in a long time. After making several seating errors and not even owning up to the mistakes, I provided you feedback and still wanted to give you guys a shot. I waited until my birthday to drive a ways to support a black business I assumed was up and coming that came with decent recommendations, but alas I'll never know if the food experience would have helped me overcome how awful the incoming service experience was. Once your 'hostess' (what a joke host) told my party that we could 'sit over there', I'd had it. Why exchange good consumer dollars with a restaurant that doesn't even understand rule #1 of the restaurant industry, without service you have nothing. No one will ever get to sample the supposed (as I didn't get to try it) great food you have to offer when they can't even get past the nightmare service awaiting them as soon as they arrive. Ok...now on to other sites so I can tap to warn other patrons to skip the hassle and choose another venue who takes their service seriously."
12/26/2013,20131226,5,4.18,"A fabulous breakfast spot for you and whomever you would like to split that french toast flight with. Busy as can be and for good reason, this establishment is clearly chef driven and has certain brunch flare that appeals to the masses. Taking pride in their ever so famous french toast flights, Batter and Berries also has delectable savory menu items that will have you wanting more. Items that caught my eye where the chicken and waffles and the fajita omelette, but the crab Benedict special stole my heart. After indulging in a carefully crafted Crab Benedict, I had nothing but smiles and compliments to share. The quality and abundance of the crab in the Benedict was superb and well worth the price. Besides great food and a vast tea selection, the service was on point. Our server was attentive, personable, charismatic, and a hard worker. Many of those skills are already instilled in a successful individual, but to have a customer become fully aware of this shows a marking of a great establishment that not only makes good food, but treat their people well. People, just go. Have the french toast flight and be amazed because it'll happen."
12/26/2013,20131226,5,4.19,"It was about a 15 min wait this past Saturday for 2, not bad. We ordered the cheese crusted hash browns and the well-known chicken and waffles. Yup. I knew it. It was amazing. The chicken was pretty moist, with a delicious hot sauce, crispy salt-iness, alongside the not-too-sweet sweet potato waffle with creamy maple butter... I mean, what a genius concoction. And our server was so attentive and friendly. And even in the midst of the chaos of people waiting and walking all around, she kept so calm and composed, never ever rushing us. I will definitely come back.. and with a bottle of champagne next time!Thanks for the tip Chicago's Best TV!"
12/26/2013,20131226,5,4.19,"What a great find here in Lincoln Park. We heard about this place from someone at a retail store and were driving around the neighborhood looking for a lunch/brunch spot for a post xmas meal.It may not matter to most, but to find a place in the heart of Lincoln Park where the customers are mostly brown (all types of brown, not just african americans) is just awesome. Makes me proud to call Lincoln Park home. Now don't get the wrong idea, there were plenty of non-brown folk here as well.The food was delicious. I pretty much ate some of my daughters kids menu food, my wife's meal and I inhaled my Sweet Potato Pancakes with Hot-Sauced Chicken Breast. It took a while to get service because they are so busy but the waitress came around with an Ipad and pictures of the dishes we wanted to order. This place gets busy and probably needs to expand because I can see someone dinging them for wait time. Once ordered our food came up in no time.This is a great find in Lincoln Park and the food is absolutely amazing."
12/26/2013,20131226,5,4.19,All I can say is this is probably the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant in a long time. I absolutely loved everything I had and the sweet potato waffles were amazing. Will be back for sure.
12/27/2013,20131227,4,4.19,"Homemade is right on. Fresh. You better like butter. Great french toast for sure, service staff was awesome and entertaining. Chicken sausage was also as noted in previous comments: fantastic. Definitely worth a stop for an off the beaten path breakfast stop."
12/28/2013,20131228,5,4.19,"ALWAYS on the hunt for GREAT breakfast places, as breakfast is our favorite meal. Wandered into French Toast heaven this morning. The place was packed at 9:20, but we were given a nice place to sit and wait for the 20-25 minutes they said would be the delay. They were right about the wait. And it was worth it.The marquis items for breakfast are their French toast selection. After much deliberating over their delicious sounding menu, we opted for the Lemon French Toast (my wife's selection) and the Blueberry French Toast (mine). The waitress tempted us with a glorious looking Pork Chop and egg selection and Lobster Benedict; made even more tempting by her showing us pictures from her tablet (nice touch). At FIRST BITE we were hooked! Wow!. We also ordered the side of chicken sausage and the cheese hash browns. Oh, my!My only regret in writing this review is that it may attract even more people to this gem.p.s. This is a BYOB restaurant, as if things couldn't get any better."
12/29/2013,20131229,4,4.19,"LOVELY little place for a solo brunch that I grabbed while in Chicago for a few days. The place was energetic when I popped in around 11:30 or so on a Friday morning, and I was seated at a large center communal table. Despite being surrounded by other parties at the big table, it was large enough that I felt like I had my own space to relax. The restaurant is simple and decorated in bright colors, with a very casual feel. I ordered my coffee, which came out quickly as I scoured the menu. ""French Toast Flight"" caught my eye...what the &*%*#(. Well of course I was ordering that. Scouring the web now, I see that this place is a bit of a French toast heaven with new flavors and ventures rising regularly. The lineup during my visit was blueberry, strawberry, caramel, and lemon. I also ordered a side order of chicken sausage to satisfy my savory tooth.Food was all delicious...I loved the flight for 1) its modest size, unlike most French toast experiences I've had in my life, and 2) the variety of awesomeness. I think the caramel was my fave, followed closely by blueberry. Of course, they were all great, and I gave myself up to a world of sugar and happiness. Chicken sausage was a tad oily but otherwise also yummy and sufficient to provide the sweet-and-savory fix I needed.I think the whole thing with tip came out to about $20...not bad for a quick, yummy meal. An added bonus was taking home half of each slice of French toast to donate to my generous friend and host for the weekend. I would totally come back here for brunch! Loved it."
12/29/2013,20131229,4,4.19,"I enjoyed Batter and Berries, although I'm not sure I would choose to go back there when there are many other places in the city to try. I went here on a Sunday with three girlfriends, and the wait was about thirty minutes, which was nice as I was expecting longer. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. I ended up ordering the chicken and sweet potato waffles after I had seen so many good reviews of them on Yelp. I was not disappointed and especially enjoyed the hot sauce that was put on the chicken and on the side.I am giving this a four instead of a five as while it was good, I do not think there is enough on the menu to keep me coming back or any unique menu items that set it apart from many of the other brunch places in Chicago. Perhaps if I had had the french toast, which I have heard plenty of good things about, I would feel differently."
12/29/2013,20131229,2,4.18,"This is my 2nd time here, The food is delicious. .I came back to bring my family (which included two 70+ years old). The 1st time was pretty crowded, however the Manager on duty recognized the inconvenience and gave us coffee and profusely apologized. However, I guess there wasn't a manager on duty; OUR wait was 2 hours AND 20 minutes. Since we had an odd party of 5 it took much longer to seat us. Casey one of the Hostesses was HOSTLESS!!!CRAZY.......PROCEED WITH CAUTION"
12/29/2013,20131229,1,4.18,"4 friends and I waited 1 hr 45 mn outside to be seated. The foolishness behind this wait time was 5 people in our goup, so we had to wait until a group of five left. So in the mean time groups of 4, 3 and were seated before us. To add insult to injury the table size was the same!!! Also we couldn't change any of the ingredients of our meal, but food was ok."
12/30/2013,20131230,5,4.18,This food was stupid good. The wait was a bit on the ridiculous side because I had a party of 10 and the place is small (or quaint) but it was well worth the wait. I had the chicken and waffles (it's not called that though) and it was the BEST CHICKEN AND WAFFLE COMBO EVER! They season the chicken and place it into the waffle batter AND...they give you a superbly seasoned chicken breast on the side. I went to Hop House A Go Go last week and got their Chicken and Waffle and was so disappointed that it didn't/couldn't measure up to the one I had here! This is the BEST breakfast spot in Chicago. Oh...and the food is cheap:)
12/31/2013,20131231,4,4.18,"We tried coming here last month but it was too packed. So what better way to say farewell to 2013, than a nice hearty brunch with the girls?! We got in quickly. Our server was AMAZING (I believe his name was Tusemi). We ordered a flight of the French toast to split. The special was the mimosa French toast- it was great. So were the blueberry, caramel, strawberry and lemon. I ordered another special- the surf & turf omelet - marinated steak and jumbo shrimp with bell peppers over an omelet stuffed with mozzarella. It was DEEELISH! My friend ordered the lobster Benedict. It was also really good- only complaint there was the eggs were over-poached. Otherwise, Great service, great food, what more could you ask for? I would suggest everyone check this place out, but make sure to get here early- wait times can be up to 2hrs. Happy New Year!"
12/31/2013,20131231,3,4.17,"After a long wait to be seated (1.5hr), the food was good but it wasn't hot, more like luke warm. If you're going to wait over an hour for an awesome plate, I would expect it to be hot. We also noticed where food was being wasted, as we, and other patrons, were brought food we didn't order. I wonder how much money is being lost. If the food was hotter, I would give them 4 stars, and if they did a better job of managing their orders and not wasting food 5 stars. I would definitely go back - the French Toast Flight, and Peach Punch tea was AWESOME!"
1/2/2014,20140102,5,4.18,"Absolutely Delicious...We were on the hunt for a great brunch spot in Chicago. So, after much research and ""kissing a few frogs"" we decided that Batter & Berries was a must try spot on our last day.I had the Blueberry French Toast, which was full of flavor and seemed to melt in my mouth...a side of bacon and eggs. All in all, this was too much food for me. The bacon was smoky and crispy. Eggs were ok...I really wanted to save room for the French toast, so the eggs were cast aside. My hubby had the sweet potato waffle and fried chicken, which he stated was like none other. Overall great experience...nice, quaint place with attentive servers."

1/2/2014,20140102,1,4.17,"UNSANITARY!!!!!!!! I WILL NOT BE RETURNING AND HAVE REPORTED THEM TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!!!This place is only busy because of location. The food and quality of service are not even up to par. The owner needs to clean house on the staff. Only two people on that staff are good waiters. Don't get me started on the rude hostess. She must be a product of nepotism. The rest of them.... God help them. So rude! My last visit was today! The manager/and chef were on the floor vacuuming during a busy shift right next to our table. It was disgusting! The smell of the vacuum and the air coming from it was hitting our table. It was the rudest and most ridiculous thing I've seen in a restaurant. I don't care to see the chef carrying mats with dripping melting snow on them across the dining area. Nor do I care to see him parading about the dining area in his dirty apron that I'm sure he's using in the kitchen. Gross!!We waited twenty minutes to be greeted by the rude waitress Elvira. She took the order of two other tables that sat down AFTER us. Then gave me attitude when I simply said I'm ready to order. She told me to "" Wait"". I guess she was flustered but rudeness isn't helpful to someone who sees you taking the order of two tables that were seated after you.I own two restaurants and I tell you....When we get busy...I usually am busy helping my staff. - Not sitting at a table on my laptop tweeting.Volume and Quantity do not equal quality----Message to the owners!!!"
1/3/2014,20140103,1,4.16,"What a disappointing outing. Excited that my cousin was treating me to the often talked about Batter & Berries - stunned by the vibe of the restaurant, the owner and the subpar food.The swap meet ambiance left much to be desired. I've visited small breakfast spots but the decor is so hideous I was distracted by its ugliness. Once the specials were explained I was disappointed to find that the surf & turf omelet could not be substituted with shrimp as opposed to the turf- the beef. Ok, fine no problem.I got the spinach & mushroom omelet with sweet potatoes hash browns. I sent the hash brown back because the shredded potatoes on top were undercooked. I replaced with the cheesy hashbrowns and they were over cooked! I couldn't get a break.As the owner walked around asking people 'how is everything' I guessed he found my disappointment & criticism a shock. He was rude & dismissive to my concerns over the surf & turf omelet. He told me I couldn't replace the turf with surf because of the 'count' of the food. Really? Is this a elementary cafeteria or a restaurant? No accommodating paying customers? Umm, yeah I'm good with this dump. I didn't finish my food & I definitely won't be darkening the door of lumpy batter & sour berries again.PS all was not lost- my server was gracious and fabulous!"
1/3/2014,20140103,5,4.16,Wish they were in LA cause I really miss this place right now. Everytime I am in Chicago I make sure to visit this place.
1/3/2014,20140103,5,4.16,"Woohoo! As good as it gets! We went on a Sunday at 11:15 and waited 1.5 hours and as I saw the food coming out to other customers I thought, it's not very fancy looking with ruffles and sparkles so how in the world is this place so packed with people WILLING to wait 1.5 to 2 hours. Well, when we sat down I knew exactly why! Our waitress was very patient and helpful. She explained the specials using an iPad. Genius! You were able to see exactly what your food will look like when it comes. No guess work. No disappointment. No, uhh waitress can you take this back, this isn't what I thought it was gonna look like. There were five of us. I ordered the super flight. The extra French toast was mimosa French toast. YUMMERS!! Our table ordered the sweet potato hash browns, regular French toast flight, ham, egg and cheese sandwich, caramel French toast, apple cinnamon waffle, eggs, cheese crusted hash browns and coffee. Every single thing I tried was a winner!! No frills, no thrills, no ruffles and no sprinkles -- just good food. The owner walks around quiet and proud of his accomplishment which I admired. We would happily go back."
1/6/2014,20140106,4,4.16,"First time I've ever had lobster benedict. And now I'm irked more brunch spots don't attempt to make it. Although I would probably just be disappointed because there is no way it would be as good as the lobster benedict at B&B. Good service, lively atmosphere, and looking forward to going back.Minus one star for mediocre coffee. If you're gonna have an amazing brunch menu, at least make sure the coffee is in the same class."

1/7/2014,20140107,5,4.17,"My server was Nadine & Nadine was so passionate and was very knowledgeable of the culture of the business, I was very impressed, I'm not the kind that gives credit but when I do, it absolutely needs to be acknowledged. I ordered the Banana-Nut Belgigue waffle with a vanilla sauce and a side of a well-seasoned boneless chicken breast. My meal was PERFECT, The ambiance was GOOD, The Staff was Polite & GREAT!!! What else can you ask for? Thank you!DvD"
1/7/2014,20140107,2,4.16,"The problem when people rave about a place is that you have higher expectations than you should. I was underwhelmed by my experience at Batter and Berries. My friend and I were catching up over the holidays and decided to do brunch. First, it was cold outside and there was a 45 min. wait. We decided to stick it out, but did wait outside. The hostess never told us there was a waiting area inside. #Fail. We finally were seated, but by the door that constantly opened and closed causing use to freeze. They need to fix this issue with the another door or awning door as other businesses do.  It took forever for our server to come over, and she was anything but pleasant. Our waitress needed a lesson in customer service. The food was not good. It was mediocre at best..The coffee was borderline nasty. The french toast flight was disappointing. My friend and I were expecting the french toast to be dipped in the batters with strawberries, blueberries, lemon and carmel as promised. The french toast was plan thin bread topped with the toppings, but nothing more. The lemon one, may have had lemon extract. The chicken in the chicken and waffle meal was good, but the waffle left a lot to be desired. The cheese hasbrowns were overcooked. Simple things like eggs and bacon were fine. However, for what we paid for our food, everything should have been great. Needless to say, I probably will not be making any more trips to this restaurant. If you do choose to go, try a random weekday. I believe many of the problems we encountered were rushed cooking, service and the staff being overwhelmed."
1/7/2014,20140107,5,4.16,This a great place for breakfast just make sure that you get there early to avoid the long lines
1/8/2014,20140108,5,4.16,"Because of the close proximity to my boyfriend's apartment, I've been here more then I would like to admit. But it's okay, because the food is that amazing! Neither of us have ever been disappointed. The staff is so friendly and attentive, service is timely and the food is always hot and flavorful. Go for the super flight- it is a must even if you are not a French toast fan. The cheesy hash browns are also delicious. I just wish they would bring the crab omelet back- that is my only complaint. If you're going on weekends try to go before 10- that seems to be when it really gets busy."
1/8/2014,20140108,5,4.17,"I rarely take the time to review, but I wanted to give this restaurant the credit it deserves. I live just a short walk away but never came in to the restaurant because it always seemed so busy. I drove or walked by and people were always gathered outside the doorway. This past week, I decided to visit the restaurant because of all the wonderful reviews. I was not disappointed!! First of all, the wait was not long at all. You are brought to a waiting area towards the back. Secondly, you should expect to be just a short distance away from the next table. This is the city, after all. I expected to wait to have to take my order, but a server took my order right away and recommended a delicious french toast flight that I am still dreaming about!! I couldn't make up my mind about the eggs with steak and shrimp, so I had that too!! It was delicious! My son had pancakes and bacon and he loved it. I also expected to wait for the food, because it was so busy, but it came right away. The food was high-quality and presented very well. I plan to make this a favorite restaurant and cannot wait for my next visit. All the patrons seemed to be in a good mood and the manager (I believe) even walked by to ask us how we enjoyed our meal. I have lived in the neighborhood for 15 years and I can honestly say that I have not experienced a restaurant with such a positive vibe and delicious food!!"
1/10/2014,20140110,5,4.17,"I have been to batter and berries several times and never left disappointed. Yes it is small. Yes the wait can be long but u have long waits at any decent brunch place on a Saturday or Sunday in Chicago. If u don't have to wait then that means the food isn't good. I will say they need a new hostess or training. They aren't rude but not the nicest. Food is spectacular. I am not picky when it comes to waiters. Just be polite, take my order and ask if I want more water or coffee. Some people just like being difficult customer and having butt kissed. Food is always hot. Best brunch place for the money in Chicago. I always leave satisfied. I will take them over a place like yolk any day. People need to get over the size and the fact u can't substitute items. Stop being so damn picky and difficult. Just go and order cause it's damn good."
1/11/2014,20140111,4,4.17,"I am SO a fan of B&B! My experience was about 2 weeks ago around the Christmas holiday, my aunt and I wanted a good breakfast. I had heard many good things about this place and decided to take her here. The wait: About 20-25 minutes. There is a waiting area in the back if you do not want to stand outside. We didn't mind waiting, we had a chance to look at the menu and decide what we wanted. We came on a Saturday, btw.The service: Our waitress, Elvira.. was ""ok"". She seemed to be very busy, and a couple times we had to ask the manager for assistance in refilling coffee, etc. No big deal. The FOOD: O.M.G. it's so good. we ordered the french toast flight (EXCELLENT), eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. The portions were so large we able to share everything. We loved every single bite. definitely will be back!"
1/17/2014,20140117,5,4.17,"Great service, LOVED the lemon french toast. Will go again to try the crab eggs benedict and cheesy hash browns!"
1/18/2014,20140118,2,4.17,"Very nice staff who made sure to get me seated within a reasonable amount of time. Once seated, I found my waiter to be unhelpful and rushed. He almost seemed annoyed by my wanting extra time with the menu. I should've left when I realized the waiter sucked. Instead, I brushed him off with hopes of great food to come. I decided to order the chicken with sweet potato waffle. I'm no chicken and waffle connoisseur, but my meal left much to be desired. The meal overall wasn't hot. And the waffle can be best described as bland, doughy, and overstuffed with pieces of room temperature chicken. The fried chicken was decent, but nothing special. Overall, I'm not sure what the big deal is. The food wasn't even mediocre. And I'm pretty sure they leave food sitting out that's already prepared until someone orders it. That's the only logical explanation for fried chicken that's room temperature. I won't be coming back. I guess the next time I want chicken and waffles, I'll catch a flight to LA and visit Roscoe's on Pico."
1/18/2014,20140118,4,4.16,Finally went to Batter and Berries for breakfast. The French toast flight was very good especially the Grand Maurier sample. I had lobster omelette was good nice amount of lobster. The homemade pork sausage was good a little spicy. The negative hash browns a little cold. There was 30 minute wait hostess was great about keeping us up on how long we had. Overall highly recommend ..
1/19/2014,20140119,5,4.17,"Freaking fantastic. My new go-to place for brunch. The wait is long but so worth it. Weekends are busy. We arrived around 12:45 and the wait was 45 to 60 mins. Anticipation built as the servers delivered deliciousness as we stood waiting to be seated. My dining partner opted for the Super French Toast, a total of five flyers that included one mystery flavor which we figured was chocolate. Best. French. Toast. Ever! I picked up The Executive - steak and eggs with hash browns. It was good, but I preferred the French Toast. There servers are prompt and friendly. The coffee is bottomless and the the music is lively. Hit this place up, you will not regret it... but go early!"
1/19/2014,20140119,1,4.16,"Have been here 3 times and am convinced that Batter & Berries is the Jekyll and Hyde of Chicago brunch spots. When its good, it's great. When its bad, you're left feeling like you'll never get that 3 hours of your life back. The good: Really thoroughly good food. Great French toast flights!! They pair all four delicious and varied flavors into a flight so you don't have to pick. The chicken and waffles is delish (chicken actually inside the waffle) and the omelet and hash browns are good too. The first couple times we came our server made us feel right at home with jokes and a smile. Amazing. Started recommending Batter and Berries to folks immediately. The bad: The service. The last time we came here and waited over 2 and a half hours for a table. What started as a quote for ""30 minutes"" (expected for Chicago on a Sunday) slowly turned to one hour then two. During that time, two groups our size who were friends with the hostess came so we got bumped. It was clear from their conversations that they didn't have reservations and came on a whim. Got seated right in when we had already been waiting for an hour. This happened twice. In the same morning. No apologies for the wait or the inequitable treatment. Our waitress actually gave us attitude when we asked what might be ordered quickly or taken to go because one of our friends needed to catch a flight. Yes, I know brunch is for indulging with friends, not speedy service but we had spent 3 hours there without getting any food yet! The food is great but that experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Two in our group ended up scrambling because of the unfair long wait (needed to get to a flight and a soccer game). There's too many good brunch places in Chicago to risk a bad experience like this one. Don't waste your morning like we did!!"
1/25/2014,20140125,5,4.16,I heard some many great things about this place. Today my mother decided to treat me to brunch at Batter and Berries. I walked in and it was packed but not a long wait. We sat down and I couldn't help but look at everyone's food around me that I almost forgot we brought a bottle for BYOB. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. We started with the Flight of French Toast which was ah-maze-zing!!! My mother had the lobster omelette and I had the Deconstructed Steak Omelet. I love the music they played while we eat. It was almost like grooving and eating at the same time lol. I really love this place and can't wait to come again with friends and family.
1/26/2014,20140126,5,4.16,"Neat breakfast joint. I ordered the waffle with infused chicken, it was very good. When I got it I couldn't help but want syrup for my waffles, but that wouldn't be good with chicken. It took me the majority of the meal to get over the fact that I was just eating a regular chicken lunch in the shape of a waffle. It was a fun experience."
1/26/2014,20140126,5,4.17,"I went to B&B on a Sunday around 12:45 and it was PACKED! I went alone so i got seated almost immediately. You could tell the hostess was new but she was pleasant and not to over whelmed given how busy it was. I was seated at the large table in the middle of the room. This was a little awkward since it seats 10 and there was about four other small parties at the table so i wasn't able to do any general people watching since all i had to look at was a stranger eating across the table from me. My server was very attentive, gave me the specials with good descriptions. I orded the french toast flight given all the reviews and my server's recommendation. I also got hashbrowns, which you could tell were homemade, with two over-easy eggs. All my food was AMAZING. I even liked the blueberry french toast and I'm generally not a fan of blueberries. My server didn't rush me to leave like they often do when i go out to eat alone. Over all great food and service, I will definitely be going back!FYI this place is also byob if you want mimosa you need to bring the chamagne!"
1/27/2014,20140127,5,4.17,What people don't realize is that the place seconds as a great coffee shop. There's a big communal hi top table in the middle of the restaurant. I'm bringing my laptop next time. Could use some wifi tho...Get the chicken and waffles. Also ask for extra hot sauce.
1/28/2014,20140128,4,4.17,"I've been here a couple of times now and the food is always excellent! I've had the super flight (platter of french toast) as well as a few other dishes. As a fair warning, you will more than likely have to wait at least 25 minutes for a seat especially if you go during peak hours. It is a small place so there isn't much standing/waiting room and the noise level can get loud quickly. After the wait, you're good to go! The staff members are very friendly and attentive and it doesn't take long at all to prepare the food!"
2/1/2014,20140201,5,4.17,"This place is the ISH!!! I wish we would have given them a try sooner, but we finally did and this might be our new go-to breakfast spot! We were worried about parking at first, but it wasn't a problem at all.So, as far as the service......EXCELLENT! Our server was very courteous and knowledgable. After we placed our order, our food was delivered to our table SUPER fast......CRAZY fast, and I'm not complaining about that. Breakfast is the first meal of the day.....when I order, I want to eat ASAP and Batter and Berries fulfilled my wishes. Also, they cleared our plates swiftly after we completed our meals and they kept our waters and coffee full. Personally, that's all you have to do to keep me happy and everything else is just icing on the cake.Now, the food........HEAVENLY! I had the Pork Chop Executive and my ""boy toy"" had the Chicken and Goof aka Chicken and Waffle. Both of our dishes were amazing. My pork chop was grilled and seasoned very well. It came with eggs and cheese crusted hashbrowns, which were something new to me and very tasty. The Chicken and Goof was the star of our meal. So, you get a sweet potato waffle with this ""super good sweet butter stuff"" all over it and pieces of fried chicken cooked inside of it.......WTF!!!??? My mouth is watering as I'm typing. Then, the fried boneless chicken breast has this special hot sauce drizzled all over it. Initially, this dish worried me because I was thinking ""Why would they drizzle hot sauce all over it? What if I don't want hot sauce?"" BUT after tasting the waffle, with the butter, with the chicken, with the hot sauce.........PARTY IN MY MOUTH. I can't even describe it, it just tastes so good; like nothing I've ever had before. Also, you DO NOT need syrup on the waffle! Just try it first and you'll see what I mean."
2/2/2014,20140202,4,4.17,Their specialty is fancy French Toast and it's indeed delicious. Great service.
2/6/2014,20140206,4,4.17,"Very good breakfast spot. I have only been twice (don't live nearby), but I have been happy with the service and food both times. I also have several friends who have been and have great things to say about the place.There have been a few complaints on Yelp and FB regarding a long wait - but people need to be realistic. If you go to a popular breakfast/brunch spot that has limited seating after 10:00 am on a Saturday/Sunday, you should expect a wait. Seriously.Check it out for yourself. This place has a great variety of food options and is an overall yummy spot."
2/7/2014,20140207,5,4.17,"We came here for breakfast a few weeks ago and had a great experience. I had forgotten to write a review of this place until I found the photo I took of my chicken & waffle.The restaurant was very packed on a Saturday morning.I was not too crazy about the chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffles I had, but the french toast flight that my girlfriend got was excellent. Their bacon is also very good. Very interested to try the rest of their menu -- we will be back!"
2/9/2014,20140209,4,4.17,"Note to self: this is BYOB. My friend and I knew it was BYOB but at the time, we were too hungover to even think about alcohol at brunch. Like a lot of brunch places, there is a good wait time, even on extremely cold days. It's such a cute place with some pretty cool artwork. The owner himself is cool. He would come outside every so often to chat with those of us waiting and go around the tables making sure everyone was well fed. I had plans to get the French toast flight. But once we heard the specials, I had a tough decision to make. French toast flight or crab cake benedict. I'll just pat myself on the back for going the crab cake benedict route. It was quite heavenly. I tried to take my time and savor this but couldn't. I stuffed myself and still had a small amount left to take home. And the cheese hash browns were too good. I almost asked about substituting those for something else, but our server said keep them. They are his favorite and that I wouldn't regret it. He was right."
2/9/2014,20140209,4,4.17,"The food is amazing here and definitely worth the long wait. Make sure to order the French toast flight as an ""appetizer"" and try other items on the menu, too. I had the chicken & waffles and it was awesome. You have to be a sweet potato fan, which I am. The food was so good that we all cleared our plate. We will definitely be back, but will try to get there a little earlier than 11am to beat the crowd."
2/9/2014,20140209,5,4.17,"Get here before 10am!!!Amazing food and service. Got here at 10:05. Had a 90 minute wait, which turned in to 60 minutes. Left our phone number and walked to Starbucks. They called us when our table was ready and we were back within 5 minutes. Server (Tusiime) was fantastic. Took the time to explain everything thoroughly. Food was at our table within 12 minutes. Left there full and satisfied at 11:45. With an hour wait this was remarkable. When we left there were 21 tables in the wait line. Try the French toast flight and the buffalo chicken sandwich. Chicken and waffles is solid as well."
2/9/2014,20140209,2,4.17,"We waited two hours to be seated on a Sunday at 12:30. The chicken and waffles and omelette were good, but not amazing. The waiters were nice but the hostess was rude and incompetent. There were open tables that weren't being sat and an unorganized list for people waiting. She also told us it would be 10 more minutes after waiting an hour and then we waited another 45 minutes."
2/11/2014,20140211,4,4.17,"I came with a friend to Batter & Berries a little past 2PM on Saturday and the place was PACKED! Which spoke to how popular this place is. Luckily, since it was later in the afternoon, we only had to wait about 10-15 min for a table. Our server was very friendly and attentive; he ran through the very detailed specials and checked up on us very often for a place that was still bustling with customers. Also our food came out in a matter of 5 minutes.We got the executive and the raved about chicken and waffles. Both dishes had very nice presentation (must take picture worthy heh.) and tasted very good, although I guess I expected the chicken and waffles to be ""blow my mind"" good, but they didn't quite reach that level for me. The chicken and the waffle both tasted great separately, but I wasn't sure if they really tasted great together. I expected to taste the chicken inside the waffle, but the bread was too sweet and dense to make out the chicken. It was definitely a good experience though--had to come just to try the waffle with chicken in it. Though it did not go as expected, now I can be at ease. Possibly overhyped it for myself by reading through many yelp reviews and getting overexcited.But it was delicious anyway.TL;DR Good food, great service. Worth it for the experience."
2/13/2014,20140213,4,4.17,"French Toast unlike I've ever had, quite good!  The coffee is kind of weak, but that's a forgivable sin.  Super nice owner and the staff is very attentive. I went at 8:00am on a Sunday, one of the first patrons that day; 20 minutes later the place was packed.  Try this place, it's a winner."
2/13/2014,20140213,1,4.16,"So I just got back from Batter and Berries and I wish I could give this place 0 stars.....where do I begin? How about the disgusting looks we received once we walked into the door as if we didn't belong in the Lincoln Park area. The hostess acted as if she was hesitant to sit us as if we would run out on the check or something. We were seated and we waited about 20 minutes for our waitress Nadine to come. We continuously were looking at our waitress and she finally looked at us and said she would be with us. But of course before she came to our table she stopped at the couple's table that was there way after us to take their order. I was pissed and I wanted to leave but my friends and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Their order came out and guess what....my order didn't. I sat for about 20 minutes without food. I was upset, an it got the point where I didn't even want my food. Nadine the waitress insisted on me trying my food and bought it out anyway 15 minutes later. I got it and it was nothing to brag about. At the end of our meal I asked for the manager, he took his time to come over but when Don came by I was glad to share my dining experience with him. While I was telling what happened and how his bust boys were using our table as if it was cleaning station he just looked at me as I was wasting his time. Homeboy had the audacity to offer my friends and I a $5 gift certificate for ""our troubles"" for our $70.00 bill. Sorry Don you will not insult me so you can keep your measly $5 gift certificate. I have never in life been treated by someone of my own race the way I was. Whenever I spend money with other cultures I am treated with way more respect and they are more accomandatining. I will never visit Batter and Berries ever again in life. I used to think it was truly sad when I would hear African Americans say they don't support black businesses but after my experience at Batter and Berries with the hostess, Nadine, and the manager Don I now understand their reasoning....never again will I visit this establishment"
2/15/2014,20140215,5,4.16,"We went during the week and we went early. The wait was almost non-existent! Many of the reviews talk about how long the wait is, and frankly this is why I rarely go to brunch anywhere anymore, it's the thing to do, and good brunch places, well they have long waits for a reason, they are where everyone wants to eat.The food and service was just excellent! Lamb chop special, I almost reordered it, it was that darn good! (had we not already ordered three dishes to split between the two of us I would have!)The Executive - perfectly cooked rib eye bathing in saucy onion mushroom red wine goodness! Yes sir may I have another!Super flight of French toast - she notes with a smile as she drops the plate that we will not be needing syrup and be sure to utilize that maple butter, I could have rubbed my self up and down with that maple delight and just smiled on top the hill all day long, it was delish, and every variety of French toast was just tasty and moist and wonderful! We loved every moment!"
2/15/2014,20140215,5,4.16,"Came here for Saturday brunch. For the amount of business they get the place is super small and cramped- while waiting for a table you're bound to be in someone's way. That was really the only downside of the place. They do give out free coffee while you wait- but be warned that if you continue to get coffee once seated they will charge you.The waitress was super friendly and helpful. They present their specials on an iPad slideshow so you get to see the food and they do an excellent job explaining what it all comes with. Love being able to see the food before it comes! My table ordered the french toast flight, lobster omelette, and crabcake benedict to all share. EVERYTHING was tasty and amazing. The omelette and benedict were pretty large portions, while the french toast flight, not so much, but probably my favorite of all the things I tried. It comes with 4/5(?) half slices- so like, 2 whole pieces of bread slices in total. I would recommend the extra hungry to actually order two flights. Service was quick and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try it out again!"
2/17/2014,20140217,5,4.16,"This place is The BOMB .com. I want to eat here everyday! No complaints except our waitress took awhile to get to us, the place was full though. I had the Deconstructed Chicken Fajita Omelet. We had a half order of the French toast special, Strawberry Champagne, it was scrumptious. Side of pancakes with maple butter.. SO delicious. Wasn't sure I'd like them because of the lemon zest but it was a yummy touch! I tried my friends egg white veggie omelet (special) and Pork chop & eggs, both great!! I can't wait to go back here and get the French toast flight or chicken & waffle!"
2/17/2014,20140217,5,4.17,"I discovered this place a couple of months ago and i have been obsessed ever since! the first time i came here i ordered the french toast flight which was really good, the french toast didn't need syrup because they were that good! i also ordered fries and let me tell you they are one of the best! the chives make them taste amazing. I also ordered the chicken sausage, but i was not overly impressed with these. they have a syrup taste, and although at first i didn't mind it, after a while i couldn't eat it anymore. The second time i was there i ordered the cluck and gaufere ( sweet potato waffle with chicken on the inside, and chicken on the side) this was really great! the manager even came up to our table to make sure i was enjoying it. Lastly, the third time i was there i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and that was also amazing. the pulled pork was nice and juicy, and there was a generous amount of pulled pork on the sandwich. i also ordered a side of a biscuit (which is $2/biscuit, kind of expensive) and that also didn't not disappoint.my one complaint would be that sometimes if your sitting too close to the door you are constantly feeling that cold air coming in and out of the restaurant.Overall, amazing place to eat at."
2/19/2014,20140219,2,4.16,"Sacrificed sleeping in on a Saturday morning to come and try this place. We got here right after they opened and it was already running over with breakfast goers.. Anywho.. we were seated promptly and were presented with what seemed to be pretty interesting options. I being a risk taker opted for the french toast flight just for fun. After the 3 of us ordered our generous sized meals we were expecting a wait of at least 20 mins before we were served our food, considering the amount of people that were there before us. Nope, we waited anywhere between 8 - 10 mins! Awesome when you're in a fast food joint... The short wait was evident in the quality of the food. It was lukewarm at best, and had obviously been precooked. The taste wasn't bad, probably would have been much better if it were above room temperature and uhm fresh. I guess its a way of getting people out faster so that more people can dine... let me not forget to mention that we had to ASK for syrup..LOL as if the fruit on top of the french toast was supposed to serve as a coating.. oh well I personally don't get the hype.. At least our waiter was entertaining..too bad I can't remember his name.. *shrugs*"
2/19/2014,20140219,5,4.16,"After reading the amazing reviews on Batter & Berries, my boyfriend and I knew we had to see what all the hype was about. Saturday brunch wait times are typically at least a half hour, but the food and service definitely make up for the long wait times. The Flight of the French Toast (blueberry, caramel, lemon and strawberry with maple butter) is my favorite. No syrup necessary. The chicken and waffles are delicious (sweet potato waffle with pieces of chicken cooked in and a piece of fried chicken on the side covered in hot sauce) were on a list in Travel & Leisure for top places for chicken and waffles. The omelets are also delicious. No matter how busy it is, the service is always great. Southern hospitality meets midwestern charm."
2/20/2014,20140220,5,4.16,My colleagues and I visited B & B today! We waited fifteen minutes but it was fine.Our waiter was very entertaining. The owner came over to greet us and gave us a complimentary French toast flight! Impeccable customer service! And BYOB. Let's just say us nursing students was able to unwind mid semester!
2/21/2014,20140221,5,4.17,"My coworker has been trying to get me to go to breakfast for a very long time. I personally try to keep work and personal separate- like Church and State- the one and only thing tempting me from this? Butterfinger French Toast. This exists, it is delicious, this is not a test. Amazing. She lured me with a picture of this chocolate champagne French toast special served previous and the Butterfinger is phenomenally-mind-blowing. Worth re-prioritizing work relationships for. Worth a two hour wait- you heard me. Worth it, do it, get here now."
2/22/2014,20140222,4,4.17,"When I saw the line for the restaurant sprawling outside the doors, I had to try it out for myself and the food didn't disappoint. Sampled a few items, but my favorite by far was the French Toast Flight, definitely a must have! Also don't forget this is a BYOB, something I didn't realize until after I sat down and saw everyone with mimosa in hand"
2/22/2014,20140222,4,4.17,"Come here for the French toast flight. Best French toast I have ever had in my life. The other breakfast items we ordered were not bad, but nothing to rave about either. The Place is loud but nothing matters when that French toast arrives. It's insane how delicious they are, they will not disappoint."
2/23/2014,20140223,4,4.17,I've have been here a few times and the food never disappoints. The weekends can be very crowded so don't be in a rush and try the French toast flight so you can sample all the popular flavors at one sitting. Enjoy!
2/25/2014,20140225,5,4.17,"Really excellent breakfast place. Unusual menu items and specials, all executed flawlessly. Warm, efficient service. And they let me come in out of the rain even though I showed up before they were open. Highly recommended."
2/26/2014,20140226,2,4.16,"Our second visit to Batter & Berries left my emotions seriously bruised. Our first visit was fantastic, but a much larger crowd was added to our second visit and the ""ish hit the fan""!!! Hence, I have to knock some stars off the five star rating I gave initially........it was that bad. The staff at Batter & Berries have no concept of crowd control & traffic flow.So, when we arrived, the restaurant was full, but no one was waiting to be seated. The hostess, then led us to the ""waiting area"", which is in the middle of the restaurant, off of the main walkway and across from the restrooms. This place is not large, so this is awful for traffic flow. Anyway, we were told our wait would be 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, approx. 4 additional parties of 2 were seated in the ""waiting area"" and a separate line formed at the door. The waiting area didn't have enough seating for everyone. So there were some people standing against the wall where the restroom doors are at AND blocking the main walkway the servers use......just messy.So, we were finally seated at the ""common table"" about 25 minutes later. After we sat there unattended for about 5 minutes, a server came by and said ""Do you want coffee?"" We both replied yes and he ran off. We didn't get a hello or anything.....I don't even know if he was our server or just being helpful. So, he brings us black coffee with no sugar or cream and runs off.......like, warp speed fast. I was really bent out of shape by this time because I was super hungry and I wanted to drink some coffee to ""fix"" my mood, but I do not drink black coffee. We saw the guy that gave us coffee, but he would not make eye contact with us nor would any of the other servers. So, we waited another 7-10 minutes and no one came by to get our drink order, food order, or to greet us........NOTHING. So, we politely got up and left. The food is really good, but it will be awhile before we give Batter & Berries a try again."
2/27/2014,20140227,5,4.16,"Very cute and quaint breakfast spot. I waited about 10-15 mins for a table on a Thursday morning so i can only imagine what the wait is like on the weekend. I chose the chef's special which wasn't on the menu but it was delicious!!! I was very happy with the service and with my meal. I will be returning to try their French Toast flight which looked amazing!The only improvement that could be made is the awkwardness of the waiting area. Its towards the back of restaurant and placed in the midst of tables where others are eating. You'd never know it was there w/out the hostess informing you. Strange position for waiting area in my opinion. Otherwise, worth the wait!"
2/28/2014,20140228,5,4.17,"Long wait, but worth it! The service was perfect, atmosphere was great, and the food is something I crave and dream about. A small restaurant, but comfortable when you're seated. It's BYOB, so bring a bottle of champagne for mimosas. Get the super fresh crab cakes and shrimp Alfredo omelet and thank me later! The owner came out and thanked us for coming while servers celebrated birthdays through original song! Love this place and will be back!"
2/28/2014,20140228,2,4.16,"So I decided to leave the Southside for a Saturday lunch with a good friend. I think I should have stayed at home. As most reviews have mentioned! the wait can be very taxing. I was given 3 wait times in one brief conversation with the hostess( I guess that was her job). I watched people come and go for about a hour. She and the young girl in the restaurant, called for people at a snail's pace. Both repeatedly talked about a wait area in the back. Limited seating in the wait area created more congestion and confusion. Four groups of two complained about the wait and being passed over by the hostess. She accommodated the angry guests, extending my wait for a table. When we finally able to be seated, we briefly saw our waiter, then received water that ended up being our drink. I also got a coffee that was never refilled and I was never approached for a refill. My friend always orders water sans ice. When she received a refill, it was from the pitcher with ice, so she didn't drink it. I tried the flight French toast. It was tasty, but seemed like a small portion of food. Cheese crusted hash browns were interesting but rather tasteless. We saw our waiter three times including when he took our orders. For some reason, the young girl came up behind my friend and covered her eyes with her hands. My friend was pretty shocked and annoyed by it. The girl seemed oblivious to the inappropriate nature of the interaction. I don't plan in returning. Amazing food can make up poor other areas, but adequate food really doesn't."
3/3/2014,20140303,5,4.16,"If you are looking for an awesome place to have breakfast or brunch look no further! The French toast sample had cookies and cream, lemon, caramel, blueberry and pecan French toast. All were delicious! I got the sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken with a piece of fried chicken on the side! So super good. The owner also makes his own maple butter! This place has a very warm feel and the staff is so friendly. Every time our waiter came to the table he always had something funny to say or he told a riddle. We even met the owner who thanked us for coming! The food is amazing and I will definitely go back!!"
3/3/2014,20140303,4,4.16,"Damn, the wait is long here. It's a cute little restaurant, but we waited a good hour for Sunday brunch. Everything on the menu sounded soo good, but I ordered the famous Fried Chicken and Waffle. It was delicious and totally lived up to the hype.I definitely want to come back and try some of the other sweet and savory items. Everything looked great!"
3/6/2014,20140306,2,4.16,"After all the hype, I made it my business to try this place out today. I was warmly greeted & seated right away by the hostess & my server immediately came over w/a smile & bubbly personality & told my friend & I about the specials for day. Our food was served SUPER fast & the presentation was nice BUT the food was nothing to brag about, in me & my friends opinion. She ordered pancackes, said they were heavy not light & fluffy. Eggs & Bacon a la cart. I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict w/cheesy hash browns. The cakes were OKAY & I didnt care for the hash browns, tasteless. All in all, I wont be going out my way to return. If Im ON the block & hungry, then maybe but otherwise I can get a better breakfast some place else. Maybe my expectations were too high or just maybe, its just a new spot w/mediocre food. Don't believe the Hype bcuz its just that: HYPE!!"
3/8/2014,20140308,5,4.16,"This was my first time going. After reading some of the previous reviews that were not so favorable I almost decided not to go. I decided to give it a try and glad I did! We got there when they first opened on a Friday morning, no line no wait. The service was great, the owner brought our food out to us and gave us tips on how to best enjoy our food. The sweet potatoe waffles and chicken are delicious! I would definitely go back again for them, I did get the sauce on the side, glad I did the sauce was hot and sweet but good. The restaurant is a little cramped it's not a kid friendly spot for little ones, this is definitely a place for adults. I want to to try the brunch, but from the reviews it's sounds like if you don't get there early you will have a long chaotic wait."
3/9/2014,20140309,5,4.16,"Had the flight of French toast and the chicken sausage, both were incredibly good! The flight of French toast was all different flavors which was fun to try and the chicken sausage had little bits of what I believe were apples which was also amazing. The hot chocolate was weak and it would not recommend it. All together this restaurant has really rich decadent and unique foods that I would definitely recommend to try!"
3/9/2014,20140309,2,4.16,"After an episode of ""Check,please!"" I was excited to try out the restaurant. We expected a wait but thought it was worth it since we had read so many positive reviews. When we checked in with the hostess we were told it would be about an hour wait for a party of three and there only 6 parties ahead of us. Time passed and we began to notice people that arrived after us and when we were waiting were seated before us and it was more than 6 parties! Obviously we were annoyed, especially when we would see large parties or guests that arrived after us were being seated. We went to ask the hostess how much longer we had to wait because at this point it was 2 hours! At this point we saw a party of three that arrived 20 minutes after us get seated. The hostess told is that parties of 3 and 4 were tough to seat and they don't seat by time of arrival BUT the number of guests in a party! We obviously would have left and gone elsewhere if we knew of this seating arrangement. We finally were seated and stayed since we have already waited so long. The food was ok, maybe because we were so irritated and annoyed, and a but overpriced. I don't think we will return after this experience."
3/10/2014,20140310,5,4.16,"Hubby and I went this past Saturday. We arrived at 10:30am and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. From the reviews I was expecting longer. We were seated within 15-20 minutes. We ordered our food and received it in literally 12 minutes. The place was very busy, so we were shocked. Everything was delicious and our server was great. I think larger parties have to wait longer for bigger tables."
3/12/2014,20140312,5,4.16,"Long wait on a Saturday morning but overall, the food was amazing. Best French toast I've ever had. Nice vibe and service with decent prices."
3/14/2014,20140314,4,4.16,"I've been a patron here since they opened and the food is GREAT!!!!! Typically on the weekends, I order food for carry out. Today I find out that they do not offer that service anymore so I am stuck at work craving Caramel French Toast, chicken sausage and eggs with extra cheese and now IM HEART BROKEN AND DISAPPOINTED BEYOND REPAIR. PLEASE change this policy ASAP! Im literally in tears because of this. I can't help it, once I find a great place I love to eat at, I support it daily.Signed,Disappointed Patron who wish you had carryout again!"
3/15/2014,20140315,5,4.16,"Great place!!! We went on a Sat in the mist of the St. Patrick's Day rush and it was extremely busy, but they moved the crowd and turned the tables without feeling rushed. The electronic ordering system made all the difference in allowing the servers to socialize while food being made. The food did not disappoint and arrived extremely fast and deliciously made. We ordered the Executive Country Chicken and Shrimp Alfredo Omelet. By only using egg whites the omelet was not too heavy are rich couple with Alfredo sauce which seemed to be made from scratch in house. The owner and Chef could be seen greeting customers and checking on satisfaction throughout our visit. The noise level was a little on the loud side for me, but it could have been a result of hyped parade goers who had already a few drinks under there belts."
3/16/2014,20140316,4,4.16,My wife and I attended on a Sunday around 11. We had a 45min-1hr wait but excited because we heard a lot about this place. I enjoyed the food but the atmosphere was very loud and busy. I tend to like a bit more of a calm and relaxing environment but this place was packed to the bone and the noise was like a night club. It was a great food experience and I am glad i tried it. I would look for a different place next time for a more chill environment.
3/17/2014,20140317,3,4.16,"The food was good, but not as tasty as I had imagined. The broccoli omelette was literally egg, broccoli, and cheese, no seasoning or spices. The cheesy hash browns were very good. The flight of French toast was good, but I've tasted better flavored French toast at places like Kanela and Yolk. If I could rank these three places I would rank Kanela first, Yolk second, then Batter & Berries. It was good food and I have no complaints, but it wasn't exciting at all to my taste buds."
3/19/2014,20140319,5,4.16,This is such a great place for brunch! I had the fried chicken and french toast and it was soo good. Def do not come here hungry because the wait is VERY long and can take hours! Def worth the wait though :)
3/19/2014,20140319,5,4.16,"Great food, great service!!!! Please come to the southside!!!!"
3/21/2014,20140321,4,4.16,"I liked the food a lot! The hostess was a bit short in a way which but she set the proper expectation for the wait time which was long but the food made up for it. I had the sweet potato waffle with chicken... Waffle was sweet and the chicken had a complimentary hot sauce that just worked very well with the sweetness of the waffle. The chef/owner stopped at my table and said hello which was nice because i was able tell him how much I liked the food but I wasn't sure if it was normal or he just did it because I had my food warmed up just after getting it because it wasn't hot like it just came off the stove, but warm like it had been waiting for the crab eggs Benedict that my friend had (he liked his meal also) It is one of the better breakfast/brunch places I have been and I will definitely will be going back to try the French toast which I heard is also very good.Keep it up Batter & Berries"
3/21/2014,20140321,5,4.16,"The food here is YUMMY. I had the mixed French Toast, the BEST french toast I have ever tasted in my life."
3/22/2014,20140322,4,4.16,This was my first time here and the food was well worth the wait! I had the peach punch tea and it was so good. For dinner I ha the chicken and goof (chicken and sweet potato waffle). It looked and tasted amazing!!The service was really good. Our server was on point and very personable. I can't wait to come back again and bring my husband. It was the best chicken am waffles I've had ever. Plus it's BYOB so next time I will be bringing my own champagne for some mimosas.
3/22/2014,20140322,2,4.16,"This is one of those spots that should stick to their specialty. We went last Sunday and most of us wound us disappointed. The highlight: the caramel french toast, which was just as amazing as our charming waiter promised. Their tea selection was impressive and the other breakfast beverages (coffee and hot chocolate) were fine.The downside: the side of chicken sausage was barely warm and had a disgusting uncooked flavor so bad two of us spit it out. The two sandwiches (BBQ and Buffalo Chicken) we tried were both lackluster, and the fries had a strange fishy aftertaste. Overall, it wound up being an hour wait and a $50 bill for one good dish. I'm not saying don't go, but don't try to push this place outside its French toast comfort zone."
3/22/2014,20140322,5,4.16,"Thank you, Yelp, for the wonderful reviews that sparked my curiosity to give this place a try. If I go here on a Wednesday morning and return Saturday of the same week, you know this place is good. If I order the French toast flight on both visits, you know that I've been having French toast dreams because Batter and Berries' are just so amazingly delicious!! The waitress was right...absolutely no maple syrup is needed in your blissful consumption of the French toast. My experience on a Wednesday morning compared to a Saturday early afternoon was like night and day. Just a few tables were being waited on on Wednesday whereas on Saturday, each table was occupied and there were hoards of people standing in the back area and in between tables with the wait-time ranging from 45-60 minutes. I didn't mind waiting because I already knew what was in store...the French toast is worth the wait, people! I've also tried the steak and eggs from my dining companions and that was pretty good too! Despite the craziness, service was friendly and prompt. I was pretty surprised at how the staff handled their tables as well as the waiting crowds. I didn't sense any frustration or irritability as the waiters worked among the chaos...I just saw smiles. The chef even made his way to greet each table. Mmmmm...I'll definitely be back. Many, many times."
3/25/2014,20140325,5,4.16,"I went here today for the first time with a friend. We came in and were seated right away because it was a tuesday morning at 8:30am (on weekends expect an hour+ wait). The waitress explained the specials board and even showed us a picture of what each dish looked like on an ipad mini...very helpful. I ordered the super french toast flight (blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel and vanilla bean rum), deconstructed broccoli cheddar omelette (that came with cheesy hash browns) and chicken sausage. I am now a huge fan of the french toast flight and chicken sausage....they were my favorites. I like that they have different specials every week so it keeps it interesting. The food was flavorful abd AMAZING, staff and general manager were friendly and the atmosphere was good. Oh, and my friend loved her french toast flight, ham and bacon as well. After one visit, this is my new favorite breakfast spot. Can't wait to try other dishes."
3/28/2014,20140328,5,4.16,"The vanilla bean rum french toast special was incredible, the homemade pork sausage was incredible, and the service was exceptional. (Next time, I will be showing up with a bottle of champagne to add mimosas to the mix.) Now I know why there's always a huge freakin' wait here...we came on a Wednesday at 10:45 AM and there was still a 15-minute wait, and that was after we tried coming last Sunday soon after Batter & Berries opened. If anyone has some advice on when this place is NOT totally jammed, it would be appreciated!"
3/29/2014,20140329,2,4.16,"My food was not hot, the host staff were rude, the table structures are all wrong, the bus boys are clumsy. Chicken sausage were really good.... Not to mention we were rushed from out table once we got the bill...!Im sticking to the bongo room."
4/1/2014,20140401,5,4.16,"Finally made it to Batter and Berries and it exceeded my expectations. Arrived at about 9:45 on a Tuesday morning and the timing was perfect. Entered an empty restaurant and by the time my coffee was served, the place somehow became full to capacity. Ordered the cluck and goof, which is a sweet potato waffle with chicken. It was amazing!!! Was slightly concerned about any type of hot sauce being on my chicken with a waffle, but it worked. Also ordered the cheesy hash browns. They were tasty but had to add salt to pepper to season to my liking. We also ordered the French Toast Flight, which was also amazing. The pictures made me think this was simply a dessert disguised as breakfast, but it was delightful and not too sweet. The service was remarkable and the owner was humble and made me feel as though he truly appreciated us dining there. Overall awesome experience and I can't wait to return."
4/7/2014,20140407,5,4.16,Me and my girlfriend went it was amazing she got the sweet potatoe n chicken waffle and I got the cinnamon apple waffle it was sooo good definitely going back the owner came out and greeted us and was very friendly the service was excellent they even had an iPod with their specials definitely now one of my favorite breakfast spots
4/7/2014,20140407,5,4.17,"I know this joint does not need another outstanding review. But jeez. Its like slap ya mamma good! They have quite the cult following so be prepared to wait. I went on a Monday at 10am and we still waited about 30 minutes to get seated. Went once before on Sunday at 1pm and wait was almost 2 hours! I am not a french toast gal, but we ordered the french toast flight with also a sample of the daily french toast special. Sooooo good! It was nice to be able to try them all. My favorite was the caramel. Went in large group so we all got to sample quite a bit. There home made butter and hot sauce are scrumptious! My only disappoint was the biscuit--it was horrible. But this place is so worth the hype. An added bonus was to talk and make friends with others waiting. People shared their favorites and stories of previous visits. It is like a little community of friendly regulars just waiting to talk to you about this place-- which is pretty cool."
4/8/2014,20140408,4,4.17,"I decided to come because on the weekend the waiting line is tremendous and was curious. The food is amazing, I had the crab cake Benedict. I went during the week.  The service was surprisingly fast. I will return"
4/12/2014,20140412,5,4.17,OMG!!!! The food is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!! Do not go on Saturday the wait is horrible !!! But that lemon french toast and crab cakes Benedict makes it worth the wait!!! Sooooooo good !!!!
4/14/2014,20140414,5,4.17,"I have friends who have been raving about Batter and Berries for quite some time and I finally got the chance to experience it for myself. I am now a believer. Believe the hype. Batter and Berries is solid. The French toast flight is remarkable and highly recommended. Bring a bottle of champagne and buy a carafe of OJ and they will pour you up some mimosas!. The service was attentive and professional. Be warned though, this place gets pretty crowded. Prepare for a nice wait, upwards of 1 hour, particularly if you go on the weekend. If you have a large group(more than 4) I recommend a weekday visit."
4/14/2014,20140414,2,4.16,"I'm sorry but - Don't believe the hype! First off, I went with my two daughters on a Monday morning thinking it wouldn't be too busy. It was. Getting in the door was a hassle because there's no room to come in. Then you get shouted at to come all the way in so the doors can close. But there's no where to go. The place is too small. We gave our name and was lead to the ""waiting area"". What a joke. It's in the middle of the restaurant and is only big enough for 6 people. There were already 6 people there so we, as well as about 10 others, were standing in the path of the servers, trying not to bump into them and vice versa. We finally got seated by the door (remember this is where the mob of people pretty much have to stand because the waiting area is full) and my daughter makes the comment that she loves looking at butts while eating...and there was a sea of them. Anyway, we all got the flights of French toast. We were not impressed. It tasted like regular toast with a drizzle of flavor. It was dry. The scrambled eggs were browned, the bacon wasn't cooked enough and I never got a refill on my coffee.  Maybe we're not sophisticated enough but I wished I could have regurgitated the whole meal and gone to the Original House of Pancakes and had a satisfying breakfast for under $50 instead of the $72 I spent. Oh, yeah...The young lady who led us to the waiting area, acted like she just totally did not want to be there."
4/15/2014,20140415,5,4.17,"This place is always amazing! My wife & I recently visited on a Saturday afternoon at about 12:30 and even though we had to wait over 90 minutes for our table, our meal almost made us forget about the super long wait. I ordered the Scallop Omelette special which was delicious and the cheese hash browns were a great compliment. We also had the super flight of French toast which is something that I would recommend to everyone. The regular 4 that they have are phenomenal and it's always nice to try the special.I will be back again soon for sure! A tip, I think if you come with a party greater than 2 you will probably be seated sooner than if you only have a party of 2 since their usually is so many of those."
4/18/2014,20140418,1,4.16,"An annoying waste of time, money, and calories...The much heralded French toast flight, WASN'T. French toast is made by soaking bread in beaten eggs and then lightly frying it. I was served a small portion (two slices) of bread that was completely dry -- I couldn't see, or taste, that it had been anywhere near an egg. Not at all. This after I waited twenty minutes to be seated and was finally shown to a chair at the communal table that had been AVAILABLE THE ENTIRE TIME. Others who came in after me were seated at tables. I was both passed over AND made to wait for no reason at all. No excuse.And the general atmosphere was unpleasant. I looked around and saw that almost every table held one or more bottles of champagne (the group nearest me had 3 bottles for 5 people). Everyone lingered after their meal to finish their wine -- no wonder there was a wait. And they were all screaming at each other to be heard over the music. There are times when I enjoy hanging out with a bunch of happy drinkers, listening to loud house music tracks, but after 2 pm on a weekday is not one of them. I don't like needlessly noisy meals.The one star was for the side (extra cost) of ham. The ham was fine. I will NOT be back -- bad food and rude service aren't worth the hassle."
4/18/2014,20140418,5,4.16,I visited Batter and Berries for the first time today and it was amazing. It was really crowded the wait was 1hr 15 minutes and the inside is really small. However the food was amazing! I had the Caramel French toast and I loved it.
4/18/2014,20140418,5,4.16,"This place was awesome! Long wait, but worth it. I had the scallop omelette with mushrooms. Delicious! Had a mini flight of the cinnamon brown sugar French toast. So decadent and delicious. Just the right amount of flavor. No syrup needed. Even the butter was good! My girl had the crab cake omelette which was almost as good as the scallops. The sides of hash browns were good too. Great gravy! Definitely coming back!"
4/19/2014,20140419,3,4.16,"My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday afternoon and came in with the expectation to wait a bit for a table. The long wait time that other reviewers mention is definitely true on a weekend. We ended up waiting a little over an hour when we had originally been quoted the wait time to be ""45 minutes or less"". It might also be true that those with bigger parties get seated first and if I ever plan to come again, I'm going to find a third or fourth person to string along or maybe even try and join forces with another party of 2. :P Anyway, the food was pretty good and came out extremely quick. I love cheese, so I was I happy to see so much gooey cheese in the midst of my deconstructed omelet and in my hash browns. No complaints there. My boyfriend's dish came with fries and those were delicious as well.There was however, one slight issue with the service. My boyfriend had asked for a soda when we first placed our order but when our meals came, his drink didn't arrive along with it. Our server came by once, to hurriedly drop off some ketchup and hot sauce and didn't come back until we had finished our meal. When she came with the check at the end of the meal, she said something to the effect of ""I never brought you your drink so of course I didn't add it on your check"", chuckled, and left. Seriously? She honestly shouldn't have even mentioned it because at that point, we had just about given her the benefit of the doubt that she might have forgotten about it. An apology or offering a free drink next visit or somethingggg would have been a nice attempt at saving the situation (even if she had brought the drink out midway through the meal would have worked) instead of just pointing out the mistake and not providing any sort of remedy for it."
4/21/2014,20140421,4,4.16,"Service - The waitress knew the menu by heart and gave us excellent recommendations.Food - Oh man you HAVE to try the Flight of French Toast. You'll get a piece of the strawberry, blueberry, lemon & carmel. All were super yummy (yes I just wrote super yummy don't hate), but my favorite was the lemon piece of French Toast. It was just a mouth full of goodness.- Scallop Omelet made with egg whites and goat cheese was AMAZING. You get 3 jumbo scallops to go along with your fluffy egg whites. I believe this was a special for the week so it's not on the normal menu.- Pineapple Juice is served here! I don't know why this made me so happy, it's not like a drink pineapple juice in my everyday life.The only negative about Batter & Berries is that we got there at 9:50a.m (during the week) and still had a 30 minute wait. However, after eating there I can see why that place is always busy."
4/21/2014,20140421,3,4.16,"Sometimes one just needs some booze at 10:30am on a weekday morning. Don't ask questions. No corking fee at B&B AND I can drink as much cheap champagne and prosecco I can carry? No convincing me I'll be there!   My friend Jessica N had big reason to celebrate and I was honored to be her fete buddy for the morning. Both of us are big suckers for french toast so neither of us could pass that up. We feasted on the french toast sampler. Incredibly sweet. Right up my alley.   Food A+. Now why the three stars. I found the wait staff extremely pushy. I had my plate snatched away within two seconds of putting my fork down. The staff was soo eager to clean our table that my bottle of presecco with at least a third left in it was thrown out before I could pipe up and say something. Also, if you byob you are required to order a glass of juice.  I read prior reviews pointing out how cold it is inside the restaurant. And those are accurate statements. I purposely picked a table toward the back and I still had my winter jacket on the entire meal.  Sweet tooths will love the French toast. Give it a try"
4/23/2014,20140423,3,4.15,"The wait, as we expected, was long: one hour on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Our dishes came out very quickly, which was appreciated after the long wait. The restaurant is also rather noisy. BYOB with no corkage fee is good.The food was pretty good, but not great. Crab Cake Benedict was fresh, but rather bland. I think I enjoyed the cheesy hash browns that came with it more. We also had the Super French Toast Flight. It was good and the maple butter added some nice flavor. Other than the lemon and the strawberry, though, the other French Toast flavors just didn't stand out from each other very much. The orange juice was not fresh-squeezed. I think this place is pricey for what you get. Crab Cake Benedict was $17. Super French Toast Flight was $13 for the equivalent of 2 slices of toast. Frozen orange juice was $4. Our total bill for two came to over $50 not including tip. While I might return if in the neighborhood, I'd have to say that there are other places that are a better value with better food elsewhere."
4/23/2014,20140423,4,4.15,"Food is pretty good - wait is not! Had to come during the week because waiting for 2 hours on the weekend was just not happening. Love the fact that everything really is fresh. Also, loved the waitresses and their ipads showcasing the specials - What a great idea! Wasn't too crazy about the sweet potato waffle with the chicken on the inside but the chicken on the top was delicious. We got several sides of the special hot sauce it came with. We even got extra to take home! We did try a small piece of the lemon french toast and i actually liked it even though i was hesitant at first. Service was on top of it as well."
4/26/2014,20140426,4,4.15,"The cuisine is truly versatile from French toast to unique omelettes to sandwiches and salads. My friend lives nearby so we decided to go here during the week when most people are working. We met at 8:15 am and were seated immediately. Sweet! We ordered the flight of French toast which covered several flavors and was truly ubiquitous. The French toast was light, fluffy and flavorful and really did not require any additional syrup. It was sweet enough without syrup. Seriously. It was served with real fruit which was greatly appreciated. The strawberries and blueberries were perfectly ripe. The sweet and salty flavors on the caramel French toast made the perfect amalgamation! My rating: 4 Stars. My friend ordered the chicken fajita omelet which was dressed up with red onions, red peppers and green peppers. She rated it with five stars. The coffee was robust while the Service was outstanding (hospitable, entertaining, but not overly attentive). The Chef and Owner are very personable. Their passion, for what they do, truly comes through in the cuisine. Next time, we plan to return for lunch, and try their sandwich wraps and salads. The quality of ingredients are outstanding. Most everything is made from scratch which incorporates fresh, quality ingredients from local produce and meat vendors. We appreciate this very much. (Street parking is ""pay to park"" but it was easy for us since we went during the week). I would never go on a weekend, because the wait is super long and parking is a pain in the ass. (Note to the Chef or Owner: My only recommendation is to add some granola to the french toast batter (dip it into the granola batter which gives the French toast an incredible taste and crunch). Also, give the customer a choice of pecans versus walnuts for the caramel French toast. WARNING: If you go on a weekend, go when they open the doors. Otherwise, if you go later in the day, expect a long-ass wait."
4/27/2014,20140427,5,4.15,"Imagine a kid making every imaginable flavor of french toast, accompanied with some creative sides. This is Batter & Berries. Let's get down to it.The place is cozy, meaning if you go at peak time, it can be up to a two hour wait. When it's good, this is the effect of the cause. Live with it. Be patient or use this tip (go during the week or before 10 on the weekend). The menu is creative yet focused. The chef and the servers work in unison making sure the quality is consistent and the flavors are good.The thing you must try (in my opinion) is the flight french toast and the cluck n goufe. The flight is a sample plate of all the flavors. For a little extra you can add the special flavor of the week. The cluck n goufe is the start to me. Why? Because it' a chicken and chicken waffle with a banging hot sauce as the syrup. Of course they have other things on the menu. I can say I haven't had anything outside of breakfast food, so I can't comment on the lunch side of the menu.All in all, make the time, bring a bottle (BYOB) and experience it and see what flavor you like the best. (SIDE NOTE: Dreamsicle and the Peanut Butter french toast were the best!!!)."
4/28/2014,20140428,5,4.16,"third time's a charm...yes it took 3 times to finally get a table (ahem on a monday) at this hot spot! and it was worth it!i generally do not like breakfast food but my sweet tooth does enjoy picking at a shared apple pancake or fruit waffle with my eggs. at b&b, my sweet tooth discovered the french toast flight; i do not like french toast at all but had to try their signature dish - we ordered one to share and it made me a convert...wow! the french toast was crunchy and so very flavorful - not just soggy bread with heaps of blueberry/strawberry/what have you syrup and equally syrupy fruit on top. the actual batter gave the french toast its flavor: blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel and the flavor of the day: peanut butter! we could not decide which we liked best!i ordered the vegi omelette served ""deconstructed"": veggies on top of the egg whites. i loved that the choice of veggies were green beans and colorful peppers (not your typical spinach or broccoli). i didn't love how buttery the eggs were...i little bit too greasy for my taste. the selection of berries (and melon) served on the side were also such a refreshing alternative to potatoes or mini cup of overripe cantaloupe and sour grapes. my husband loved his lobster omelette (i had a bite sans lobster to try the absolutely delectable smoked gouda!). he had a very difficult time deciding what to order as there were many other specials that sounded equally delicious (pork chop, pork sausage breakfast wrap, crab benedict) along with the regular menu items.we need to go back!oh need to add: the servers were very informative and are armed with ipads not only to take your order but to give you visuals of their specials! with all the wonderful choices, this actually made it a tiny bit easier to decide. what a great idea!"
5/1/2014,20140501,5,4.16,"How amazing is Batter & Berries? It is extraordinary. It is totally worth missing an extra hour of sleep to get there early to ensure you get a table without waiting a long time to be seated. The french toast flight is not to be missed, but always upgrade to the Super Flight! The food is exceptional. I took my husband and teenagers and they loved it. I went back a few weeks later with my girlfriends and their daughters for a mom and daughter outing and it was fun and the experience was still just as great. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. Tussimee is not to be missed. He is the best waiter we have ever, ever had the pleasure of dining with. Take everyone you know, they will love you for it. This restaurant is not be missed."
5/4/2014,20140504,5,4.16,"Batter & Berries was a memorable experience. Everything about it was vivid: the noise, the crowd, large artwork, lively service, and the food - oh! the loveliness of the food! - was like being at a festival or parade. My senses were heightened to the buoyancy of a beach ball bouncing above a crowd. This sort of environment walks a fine line between being fun or obnoxious but Batter & Berries did a good job of staying on the right side.We went at 9:00 AM this morning and although it was already busy we scored a table for three soon after walking in. The waiting area is near the back of the restaurant with concrete garden benches.It's a pretty small space but the tables aren't crammed TOO close together. For example, our server was able to review the menu with our table and our neighboring table simultaneously; however, we weren't close enough to touch and we couldn't overhear each others' conversations.Speaking of our server, he was a CHARACTER. He called me boo and repeatedly touched my shoulder in a congenial manner. He asked us about three riddles throughout the course of the meal and generously doused our hot chocolates and waffles with whipped cream. I don't think that my friend Howard was a fan, but M and I were both amused. Near the end he was still jovial but seemed keen to flip our table. It isn't the sort of place to linger anyway because so many people are standing around waiting both indoors and out and it just gets awkward.This is what we got:Banana-Nut Belgigue Waffle (doused with whipped cream) and with a side of hashbrowns. The waffle was too rich, but still a positive dietary experience. The hashbrowns were perfect. They were were fried, shredded potatoes - not greasy and not salty.Crab Cakes with poached eggs and hashbrowns. The crab cakes were made with REAL crab and were declared by M to be the best she's had in a long time.Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) was amazing. It is a sweet potato waffle with large shreds of chicken INSIDE the waffle. The waffle is dusted with powdered sugar and a scoop of maple butter in the middle. It is served with a fried chicken breast on top and a small puddle of hot sauce with nutmeg. Every component resulted in moments. The kind where you just pause and the cacophony around you evanescences and it's just you and the food and the flavors and textures and the ebb and flow of chewing and experiencing... Gosh. I'm jittery and sweaty just writing about it.So, the bill came to $60 for the three of us. I thought it was worth it and reasonable enough for me to foot the bill myself. M liked all of her food but commented that she prefers breakfast restaurants that emphasize meat more than bread. We recommend going as early as possible."
5/5/2014,20140505,5,4.16,"Fire!!! The food was so good, i had the french toast, cheese eggs & ham! they use this maple infused butter that was so damn good i asked for some to go! haha! im going back! Cons: The wait time. The place was pretty loud, for some reason they have folks waiting in the place who have not got a table. the restaurant is not that big to start with so why not use that space for more tables?? i felt like people were looking at me eat the whole time, its not a deal breaker but it could be done better."
5/10/2014,20140510,5,4.16,My favorite place to get breakfast in the city. Can't go wrong with the french toast flight or steak omelette.
5/13/2014,20140513,5,4.17,I've been trying to go to this place a couple of times but the wait was always long and I can certainly see why the wait is so long... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!! My bestie and i went on a Thursday to avoid the long wait. We couldn't decide on what we wanted so we ordered 3 breakfast dishes to share. 1) french toast flight2) chicken infused sweet potato waffle and3) deconstructed fajita chicken omelet When I say everything was delicious you have to believe me.. the Owner/chef came out and introduced himself to my friend and I; he even checked to make sure the food was delicious being that we're from the home of the chicken and waffle (wooop woop Los Angeles).... i highly recommend..
5/14/2014,20140514,5,4.17,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? Amazing!I have been hearing about Batter & Berries for a long time now. All of my friends were raving about the food, but I never was able to find a free morning to go. Mother's Day was coming up and my sister and I really wanted to take our mom, so we thought it'd be the perfect occasion. From the reviews and from my friends, I knew there could be killer wait times. It can be annoying, but to me that is also a sign that there is something special going on and I still really wanted to go on Mother's Day, even though I knew it would probably be crazy busy! We decided to arrive at 7:30am (they open at 8am) and we made the right call. There were people lined up in their cars waiting as the same time as us. We started forming a line outside to door about 15 minutes before they opened and ended up being the 2nd group in there. Perfect timing.We were immediately greeted by our awesome and extremely enthusiastic waiter. I wish I had gotten his name, because he was great. He was clearly knowledgeable and very enthusiastic about the menu and the restaurant experience, and he explained everything to us very well. There were three of us and my 7-month old baby (they have high chairs and the place is baby-friendly), so we decided to split some things on the menu.My mom ordered the crab cakes benedict, and we all shared the peach cobbler French Toast, as well as a super flight of French Toast (a sampler of all the flavors. DELICIOUS). I also had the homemade chicken sausage, which was great. They are also BYOB, so we brought a bottle of champagne and had mimosas as well. Overall, it was such a great experience! My mom was so happy on Mother's Day, and that makes me happy! I will definitely be back to try more things off the menu. A note: as we were leaving, the outside of the restaurant was PACKED full of people waiting. It was a madhouse. I know it was Mother's Day, but I get the feeling this place is packed on any day. My suggestion is to do like we did: get there before opening. It's early, but totally worth it!"
5/14/2014,20140514,5,4.17,"Just left this place. Went to brunch with the hubby for his birthday. Had the sweet potato waffle with the chicken and he had the steak omelette. We both lived the food and friendly service. As a fellow food- business owner, i say kudos to you guys! We will definitely be back!"
5/17/2014,20140517,5,4.17,"Second time visit today to Batter n Berries and it was just as good as the first visit. I've had the chicken n waffles and the French Toast Flight, both signature dishes and they were amazing. Both visits my guests had different dishes and seemed just as pleased. The flavor, quality, and presentation of the food is impeccable. Breakfast food can be so so and routine but not Batter n Berries. This is place gets it right every time.The wait can be long on Saturday and Sunday so be prepared for a 45-an hour wait but it's worth it. Once you sit down the service is extremely quick and efficient. I also love that the business is black-owned and thriving. Sadly, I will be leaving Chicago and moving to another city but this will always be my brunch spot when I come visit the city."
5/17/2014,20140517,4,4.17,"One of my favourite things to do when visiting my hometown of Chicago is go out for a great brunch- and this spot didn't disappoint. I didn't mind the short wait (about half hour) as from what I'd heard I was expecting much longer!The three of us decided to split entrees to try a variety- we ordered the chicken and waffle, French toast flight and the shrimp omelet (daily special). Everything we had was absolutely delicious- great flavours and mix of textures, though for my liking the waffle was slightly dry without the addition of some maple syrup. Service was attentive without being overbearing, and despite the big crowd waiting for tables, we didn't feel rushed at all. Also appreciated the nice cup of bottomless coffee, something I desperately miss for brunch! Great value for the food and service too, as the total came to about $22 each including tip. A must try if you're in Chicago- but prepare to wait!!"
5/17/2014,20140517,5,4.17,"We're visiting from out of town and found this lovely spot with the help of Yelp. My little ones loved the pancakes, specially the butter. Hubby and I shared the Super Flight of French Toast (each piece was better than the last) and the Traditional Breakfast. The cheese hash browns we're the best I've ever had, maybe made with asiago? Down home atmosphere, fantastic food and very friendly server and manager."
5/17/2014,20140517,3,4.17,"I enjoy the food. I enjoy the severs. But the wait time and their seating management system is ridiculous. I cannot for the life of me fathom why I have to wait over an hour for my party of 2 when a party of 3 can pull up and be seated in 15 minutes. I believe it's completely disrespectful to the patron. Last I checked, 2 people could sit at a table with 4 seats unless they're being seated first b/c the management is more concerned with the amount money being spent vs customer satisfaction. As I write, I'm watching a family of 4 get seated as they just walked up maybe 15 minutes ago while I've been waiting in my car since 1:15. It's now 2:10."
5/19/2014,20140519,5,4.17,"Greatness in the form of FOOD with a superb atmosphere paired together & you get ""Batters n Berries"". I'm not a big 5 star type of person however I am fair, honest & not easily impressed. This place deserves all 5 of the STARS available to be given when reviewing from the interactive kitchen staff, more so the owner & chef who openly come out to mix and mingle with the patrons while asking about the dishes being dined on & taking in any suggestions with a smile.I've dined at Batters N Berries a total of 5 times now as I no longer live in Chicago & this restaurant opened as soon as I relocated. I do visit home (Chicago) often & every trip includes a gathering to Batters N Berries with a group of individuals either Family, Friends of Business Associates.

5/19/2014,20140519,5,4.17,"Highly recommend. Super friendly, funny staff. Great food presentation. Cozy, lively. Great specials. AMAZING Oreo French toast! I am not a fan of super sweet things, and these babies are PERFECT. Compliments to the Chef. Go, you'll love it."
5/21/2014,20140521,5,4.18,"About the only complaint I have about this place is that it's only open until 3pm. Thank God they're open every day, but plan on a wait no matter what day you visit.The hot tea selection is fantastic (try the toasted almond)!There's a communal feel to the place with the large family-style table in the center and how close the small tables are set together. It didn't feel awkward, however, since our server immediately turned our table and the one next t us into a ""team"" and started asking us brain teasers. Service was friendly, knowledgeable, and exceedingly fast - which is great because I was starving.I tried someone else's French Toast Flight - the Lemon French Toast lives up to the raving reviews - but I ordered the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. My God, if it's on the menu for the day, order that dish! These were the best crab cakes I've ever had! Just huge chunks of crab, the perfect amount of delicate seasoning, and toasted to a golden hue. I'll be back!"
5/22/2014,20140522,5,4.18,"Brought my mom here for mother's day and we waited over an hour to be seated! Thank God it was a nice day, because we had to wait outside. This places is SOOOOO small on the inside. Very limited seating for those who are waiting. No stars are lost for this, because the hostess took our names, even though it was 3:30pm, when we arrived and they were closing at 4pm. Everyone was allowed to stay and eat, as long as their names were given before 4pm. Sweet!My Crab Benedict was AH-MAZING! I haven't had eggs benedict in a long time, because I no longer eat pork. But a crab substitution? Yes! It was perfection! My mother loved her lobster omelette, I had a taste and it was better than my food!!! *speaks volumes* Now, these were mother's day specials...I'm not sure how frequently they return on the menu. However, my brother had a pulled pork sandwich and he loved it! :-)We did share the French Toast Flight (which is a french toast sampler; it comes with different varieties). I must say, I was not really impressed with their french toast. I've had way better. It was dry and the french toast that came with fruit (strawberry and blueberry) were not hitting on anything for me. Our waiter bragged that french toast was their specialty...but I liked their other food more. *shrug* Speaking of our waiter...he was fantastic! Exceptionally attentive, checked on us often, but not in a ""I'm rushing you to finish"" sort of a way. He was genuinely making sure we didn't need anything. He also started a Riddles Game with us (all of his tables) and we were competing with one another. We lost! *shakes fist* But, it's all good. Bottom-line: Cool people and over-all, good food. If you can, go during the week...Saturdays and Sundays are monstrous. Lol."
5/23/2014,20140523,3,4.18,"I came here for a business meeting on a Friday afternoon.  The decor is colorful, bright, and inviting. There was still a line that meant a 20 minute wait but I took that as a sign that I would be pleased with my first time experience. And, I have to admit that I was surprised and excited to see so many African American patrons at a spot on the north side not far from where I lived. Their brunch menu definitely has a lot of great options. Yet, due to other self-imposed restrictions at the time I can only wish I tried some of the sweeter options. My server also used an iPad to show us pictures of the specials which I found to be a nice touch. As far as what I ordered, the hash browns I loved; yet, the broccoli and cheese omelette was just okay. I'm not sure that I like the deconstructed concept to it. Overall, I had a good experience. My only downside comment would be that the hostess was not very informative or efficient. She failed to tell me that my whole party needed to be present in order to be seated and I was only waiting for one other person. Then, I stood in front of her hostess stand for over 15 minutes. And it wasn't until she seated a couple that came in after me that she decided ask me if she may escort me to the waiting area. I understand why restaurants have this policy of seating a whole party but there was no sign that clearly stated it. And, again the hostess did not mention it to me until i asked her why I was bumped in line. Considering I did have a heavy bag with business items with me, it would have been nice to be able to prepare a little bit for my meeting whether I was being seated at a table or in the waiting area. So that would be my only comment for room for improvement. I did let the hostess know directly that I thought she should have told me about the policy of all guests being present much sooner."
5/23/2014,20140523,1,4.17,"My first visit here was great Leslie was my server Friday 5/16/14 I visited the restaurant a second time 5/23/14 and all I can say is I will NEVER go back from management on down customer service training is a huge opportunity. When we were seated coffee was offered I asked the bus boy the price of a glass of orange juice his response was you have to ask your server, Ok not a problem I'll glance at the menu and figure it out myself. We ordered our breakfast I had a salmon executive my husband ordered pork chop executive and the French toast flight when our breakfast came out the strawberry and blueberry pieces of French toast were hard over cooked my husband asked the bus boy Pedro for our server and explained our concern he passed the message to another server who said I'm not their server my husband requested the manager who was seating another guest the manager Don doesn't seem to know how to work under stressful or busy circumstances he threw his hands in the air and said when I finish seating them I'll be with you with an attitude. Don came over we stated our concern he took the plate back and brought a fresh order maybe 7 minutes passed. The attitude of the staff from management on down was unacceptable I tried to explain to Don how I thought they could improve service in the future if I was the owner of this business none of my employees would ever be allowed to say that's not my job the customer does not care who's job it is, just communicate with the appropriate person and get the job taken care of Don the manager told me that bus boys don't have to talk to customers in fact they don't want to talk to customers they are there to fill glasses and clean up then in a dismissive tone said we fixed the problem and got you a fresh order no compassion he didn't care that now our food was getting cold as we waited for our food to be prepared properly. This business will NOT go far it reminded me of a breakfast chicken and waffles and that business is going under the sad part is the food was pretty good but for $55 for breakfast and poor service I'd rather go somewhere else. Maybe Leslie can be promoted and she could pass some of her skills to the staff Don has to be related to the owner I have no idea how he is still working here especially as management."
5/24/2014,20140524,5,4.17,"They say third time's a charm. Tried to come to Batter & Berries on 2 prior occasions. First time, the wait was 2 hours and the next time, it was temporarily closed. So, my 2 lovely daughters and I finally got there early enough on a Sunday morning to beat most of the after church crowd. Even so, the wait was almost an hour. (TIP: we put our name in and did a couple of errands)Batter & Berries was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the special lobster omlette- and wow! It was fabulous. One daughter ordered an egg sandwich with potatoes and a side of pancakes, the other ordered a delicious veggie omlette. We all split the super french toast flight which was out of this world!Food was excellent, service was fast & pleasant. Don't forget to BYOB so you can make mimosas with OJ!"
5/25/2014,20140525,5,4.17,"This review gets 5 stars in my book because the food was excellent. I may have given it 4 stars if we had really had to wait the hour and 45 minute wait we were quoted when my girl got there at 12:30 on Sunday afternoon. We ended up running into a friend of hers and joining their group at the communal table.Right off the bat the service was excellent! Our waiter Tim acknowledged our present and reassured us he'd be back to take our order soon and he was. Besides that the owner and another waiter checked in on us throughout the entire time. Our food took about 20 minutes and they apologized for the long wait and offered us complimentary juice (pineapple juice is yummy)Now.....onto the best brunch food I have ever had! I had my heart set on ordering the crab cake Benedict, but they stop serving it the day before, so I got the lobster Benedict. It was so good!! I'm not a fan of poached eggs, but this was just delicious. My friend ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffles, which were also tasty. We shared the super flight French toast, which included a champaign option. That is the best French toast I have ever had! My favorite was the lemon. I was absolutely stuffed when we left. What a great black own establishment. I will be back and hopefully I'll either run into someone or luck out with seating right away :)"
5/25/2014,20140525,5,4.17,Mmmmmm!!!! My fiancé found this place on yelp before we planned out our trip to Chicago. It is soooo good! I got the french toast flight. Best french toast in Chi-town. I've been to a few other places in Chicago that are supposedly known for their french toast but it did NOT compare to this place. Staff was very nice too. I suggest going early before the crowd gets there. We went on a week day and it was crowded. It made me wonder if anybody in Chicago works or if they all worked from home? Interesting...My fiancé got the crab benedict and he enjoyed that as well.
5/26/2014,20140526,5,4.18,"The food here is excellent. Their french toast is the best I've ever had and the maple butter they put on it is amazing. The only downside is how small the restaurant is so it gets extremely busy on the weekends. I usually go between 8 and 9 on the weekends to avoid the wait. Once you are seated, you get your food pretty fast even when they are really busy."
5/27/2014,20140527,5,4.18,"Bring on the French toast!!!Try to get to Batter early as the line grows longer and longer as people wake up and casually accumulate outside. Although, it didn't seem like your roll out of bed, come in your pj's type place either. The men and women are dressed to impressed. I enjoyed observing everyone. On to the food. It's BYOB. They have great tasting smooth coffee. VERY ATTENTIVE staff- I am allergic to certain nuts and never had a waiter ask me if I were allergic to anything before I asked, let alone show me the actual dish I ordered on an iPAD. Interesting. Mom and I ordered the very popular French toast flight (including a soon to be gone pina colada French toast) My fave was the caramel.We also shared crab cake benedict. Delicious and flavorful. Aha- the side of sautéed veggies we ordered last minute were great also, tender and perfectly seasoned. I can't wait to go back and try everything else Batter and Berries has to offer."
6/1/2014,20140601,5,4.18,"There is not much I enjoy more than eating... As such, I am constantly looking for great restaurants. The search is over!!! B&B is awesome!!! Everything I tried was delicious (deconstructed steak omelette, shrimp omelette, blueberry waffle, biscuits and gravy, and cheese crusted hashbrowns). It was all absolutely amazing. I will definitely be back anytime I'm in chi-town!"
6/1/2014,20140601,5,4.18,"Hands down the best brunch I've ever had!!! Shrimp omlette, steak omlette, blueberry waffle, cheese hasbrowns, biscuits and gravy. ..OMG!!! Waitstaff very personable, owner came by to see if everything was stellar, and the wait time was minimal on a Sunday afternoon."
6/2/2014,20140602,5,4.18,"This was my second visit. 1.get the French toast flight. 2. Get the tea (they're all great)! Both of my experiences here were GREAT. I guess that would explain why they're never empty. My servers were nice and friendly and very helpful. The fish and chips, shrimp egg white omelet, lobster benedict, and crab cakes benedict are all amazing. The cheese crusted hash browns alone are enough to come check the place out. Oh! I forgot... the buttah!!!! OMG!!! Is butter supposed taste like breakfast cake batter?"
6/4/2014,20140604,1,4.18,"When I go to a restaurant I expect service. I had a simple request while visiting for b&b for the first time, please add an over easy egg to the burger I ordered. The server was very nice, good at her job, and helpful when I made this request. Naydean (our server) was unsure if the kitchen would do that but went to the back to ask. When she returned she mention that the chef said I could order a side of eggs and put it on myself. I asked to speak to the manager, Don Jones, about my simple request. When he arrived, he did not seem interested in satisfying his customer. He repeated that the chef will not put an egg on my burger because he cares about presentation. After this he pretty much walked away without even an apology or a solution to making me happy. It was a simple request. What I got from our conversation was they care more about presentation than making their new customer happy. The food was good but the portions were small and over priced.I will never go back here. There are tons of breakfast places around. Service makes the customers come back. Thanks to Don Jones and the Chef I will not be returning... EVER!"
6/7/2014,20140607,4,4.18,The chicken and waffles were phenomenal. I loved that the sweet potato waffles had the chicken inside . Nice touch. Friendly staff too. The wait was pretty bad just because we got here at noon on a Saturday which I guess is expected.
6/9/2014,20140609,4,4.18,"Wonderful breakfast food. Extremely creative dishes prepared by the chef. The service is great, and using an iPad to take the customers orders as well as show the specials for the day (actual images of the dishes already prepared) is a fantastic idea. You don't just come to this particular restaurant just to eat, you come for the experience."
6/11/2014,20140611,5,4.18,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday at around noon. There was a hour - hour and a half wait. We walked around and then came back in a hour and our name was called just in time!It was super loud, and there was a lot of people. I could hardly hear the waitress. She did a good job explaining the specials and had pictures of the food on her mini iPad which is smart.We got the chicken and waffles and the flight French toast and all of it was amazing! I preferred the chicken and waffles over the French toast!I would definitely come back and wait a hour to eat and would recommend anyone to come and check it out! So delicious and the service was great!"
6/11/2014,20140611,5,4.18,"Heard a great deal of buzz about this place. From word of mouth to WTTW. We went on Memorial Day... A huge crowd had the same idea. The wait to get in was about 45 mins. A long time to wait. But time passed quickly as I walked up and down Lincoln. Admiring the historic architecture and taking photographs. Once we were seated. Our server came immediately and explained the dishes. Also was very interested to learn this was out first visit. We ordered the famous Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof). It was a sweet potato waffle topped with a hint of maple butter. Also with a piece of fried chicken with a tad bit of hot sauce. No need for syrup. Our food came out quickly. One bite and I it was on. Delicious is not even the word for it, The food was excellent. Each bite made you just savior the moment. I just have to go back there again. So I can really give a proper review.  The long wait was well worth it. Next time they say it's a long wait. No problem!I'm just Happy to be here!"
6/15/2014,20140615,3,4.18,I've been to Batter & Berries about 4 times now. The first was when it first opened and was the best visit. I went with some friends and had the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) which was delicious. My friend also mentioned the omelet she had was the best she ever had. The Chef came out and chatted with us which was a great touch. I've gone back recently and ordered the same and the quality of food has seemed to go downhill a bit. They do get busy but they are pretty good about trying to get you into the restaurant as fast as possible. It's worth going to but I don't feel its as good as it used to be.
6/27/2014,20140627,5,4.18,"Man oh man. This place literally lives up to the hype. I arrived to a very busy restaurant on a late Tuesday morning. It's a very loud restaurant because people are having the time of their lives. The server in the back told several jokes to keep the crowd going, and also sang happy birthday to the birthday folks. The host showed me to the waiting area and informed me of the ""BYOB"" policy. As long as you buy a beverage (ie orange juice) or a champagne flute, you can drink whatever you want! I obviously opted for some champagne from the 711 down the street. For my meal, my friend and I split a french toast flight, with the butterscotch one (the special for the week) added. I also had a side of egg whites and cheesy hash browns. You HAVE to get the french toast flight. You HAVE to. I don't even like french toast and this was absolutely superb. Upon receiving the flight, the chef requests that you at least try one bite of each french toast slice with the respective toppings and the maple butter. The maple butter is to die for. I was literally in heaven. My favorite was the caramel turtle one, but the blueberry one was a close second.In summary, split the flight with a friend and order one of the specials, which can change at anytime."
6/28/2014,20140628,4,4.18,Fried chicken+ waffles+ spicy sauce +flavored butter= gastrorgasmic experience!!! Is worth every minute of the wait!
6/28/2014,20140628,5,4.18,First of all: the staff is amazing. Chef Rylon is the most personable chef I've met. I really hope he succeeds in his goals for this place. I got the strawberry french toast and it looked and smelled so good. Then I ate it and it was orgasmic. My eyes closed because I had to enjoy it all. -- guess this didn't post a couple years ago but better late than never.
6/30/2014,20140630,5,4.18,Fried chicken insane buckwheat pancakes insane coffee strong staff friendly place will change ur life
7/1/2014,20140701,5,4.18,"I have been to this place twice already this summer! Brunch with a co-worker and took husband for breakfast for Father's Day; the place was packed and food was great! I heard reviews from friends and reviews on TV so I had to go. When I walked into the place a man walked out and said ""what an experience"". I came out of the place saying the exact...same...thing! Infectious uplifting atmosphere, great decor, lots of activity, staff and customers are friendly to each other. Sweet potato Waffle is my favorite. The owners are in THE PERFECT location. The business recently celebrated 2 year anniversary and manager was visiting tables to ask about their food - everyone looked happy in the place. Take your out-of town friends to this place; all will have a great time - and a great experience!"
7/3/2014,20140703,5,4.19,"Great food and service. They were slightly busy even on a Thursday afternoon. Regardless they seated us promptly and provided a high chair without us asking for my niece. Everyone was very polite, from the hostess to our waitress. Our food came out quickly and was AMAZING! We of course had the French toast flight, I had the traditional breakfast and mom had the chicken quesadilla Omelette. We'll definitely be back."
7/3/2014,20140703,5,4.19,"Addicted to Lemon French toast (real lemon zest and pecans and something I can't quite put my finger on), though have the flight if you haven't before."
7/4/2014,20140704,5,4.19,"All I can say is I love this place!! It's worth the wait and just try anything, you won't be disappointed. Oh, don't add anything before you taste it."
7/4/2014,20140704,5,4.19,Service awesome. Food awesome. Will be back. Large portions and reasonably priced. Feels himey

7/6/2014,20140706,5,4.2,"Saturday breakfast ... Arrived around 8:30 and it was crowded already! But we luckily got a our seat within minutes. Your entire party has to be there in order to be seated. We ordered flight of French toast( which comes with a sampling of all 5 of their speciality toasts... Carmel was the favorite, followed by strawberry, then lemon, apple pie and blueberry) and banana-but Belgium waffle. Both were delicious. Didn't need the syrup for waffle."
7/6/2014,20140706,4,4.19,"Came here with friends after the 4th of July for brunch. We got there around 830 and there was a tiny wait starting to form, but we were seated shortly after. We got the French Toast Flight to share before our meal which was amazing! I had the B&B Breakfast sandwich, that was delicious. I took half home and was able to heat it up the next day for breakfast.My bf got the sweet potato chicken and waffles. The waffle was very yummy, as was the chicken. The service was great and very fast! Also, I love that this place is BYOB. I will definitely be back!"

7/7/2014,20140707,4,4.2,Monday morning and it's crowded. Got the French toast flight. FANTASTIC. I asked for syrup (a big no-no). The waitress smiled and said it's very sweet so you really don't need syrup. She brought it any way and she was right. The best French toast ever. The bacon was good and crisp. The cheese hash browns were just ok. Needed more seasoning.  Service was ok. Place is small. Love it. Can't wait to come back.
7/7/2014,20140707,4,4.2,"This was my first time dining at Batter & Berries and the food was really good. I ordered the executive medium well with eggs w/Gouda cheese scrambled hard. The eggs weren't scrambled as hard as I'd have liked them to be, but they were good nonetheless. The French toast sampler was AMAZING! The kids had strawberry French toast and I was turned off when I asked our server for syrup and he suggested we try it as is as the butter was maple syrup infused. We took his advice and OMG, it was perfect! The owner made his rounds which was nice and our server was friendly. The only negatives was it is a small place which was extremely loud and extremely hot--almost as if they did not have the air on. In spite of those things, this is a really good place for brunch and I'd DEFINITELY recommend the French toast. You will not be disappointed!"

7/14/2014,20140714,5,4.2,"So I was looking for a new brunch spot yesterday, one that served bottomless mimosas. I went on Yelp and found that Batter and Berries was rated high; they didn't have the mimosa special I was looking for, but it's BYOB, so I thought that's the next best thing. Well when I arrived, it was a sea of black folk waiting outside. I put my party's name on the list and was told it would be a 45 minute wait. I thought, the food HAD to be good if all these people were waiting this long. *NOTE: Since the wait is long, don't come famished like I did. Have a snack before you come!*Anyway, the host graciously seated my party and our waitress was attentive. I ordered the French toast flight, chicken sausage and eggs scrambled hard with cheese and onions. Members of my party ordered the Executive. We found the food to be delicious from the first bite til the last. They recommend not adding syrup until after you taste the french toast, and I am glad that I waited because I didn't need to add a thing! I rarely eat eggs and never finish them, but I ate all of mine yesterday. Delicious!! This place surpasses my Chicago breakfast favorites like Yolk and Bongo Room. And to top it all off - its BLACK OWNED!!! I had such a lovely experience, I shook hands with the owner and congratulated him on owning such a great place with tasty food!I cannot say enough good things about Batter & Berries. I will certainly be back again, and bring family and friends who visit the Chi. Thank you Yelp as always for not letting me down. Just remember you will likely wait a while so have a snack or something before you come!"

7/14/2014,20140714,5,4.2,"I went to Batter & Berries for the first time yesterday afternoon. It was crazy crowded, inside and outside. The hostess told us that the wait would be about an hour, but she promised it was worth the wait. I trusted her, and I'm so happy that I did! Our wait ended up being only about 15 minutes because we were a party of 2, versus the other large groups. After hearing so much about the French toast flight, I decided to order that before even looking at the menu. I also ordered a veggie omelet special. Everything was superb!!! I was blown away by the French toast flight, particularly the lemon. My second favorite was the caramel French toast. The other two were strawberry and blueberry, which was pretty much just regular French toast with the fruit on top, but still delicious. The French toast is so good that they don't even serve it with syrup. The omelet was the fluffiest I've ever had, fluffier than I ever could have imagined was possible. It was topped with broccoli, green beans, peppers, and some kind of delicious sauce. My only complaint is that the place is LOUD!!! Not only is it packed with people talking and laughing, but they play house music on full blast, so everyone is talking over the music, which makes it louder. Our server had to put her ear 2 inches from my mouth in order to hear my order. It's all good though, I'll be back!"
7/14/2014,20140714,5,4.2,"This place is NOTHING short of AMAZING! My sorority sisters and I visited Chicago for a reunion trip and to enjoy great food. We heard this was the place to go, so we took a train and walked almost a mile from our downtown hotel. We had a large group and the place was packed (as expected) so we waited about an hour. The chef came out and greeted everyone waiting which was really nice. We had already looked over the menu so we asked about the sweet potato chicken and waffle. We are from California and have Roscoe's chicken and waffles which is great! He told is that his chicken and waffle was rated the best in the nation so we had a friendly conversation about that. He also suggested the super flight of french toast and stated if we didn't like it then he would buy it. Needless to say he sent 2 super flights to the table and we devoured them in 2 minutes. The flavors and special butter are second to none. We had 9 in our party so we ordered e everything from crab omelets, to pork chops, chicken and waffles to salmon and it was ALL amazing! The restaurant is also BYOB so we got our own mimosas, that was definitely a first. I encourage anyone ever close to Chicago to come treat yourself and eat here!"
7/14/2014,20140714,5,4.2,"I went to Batter & Berries for the first time yesterday afternoon. It was crazy crowded, inside and outside. The hostess told us that the wait would be about an hour, but she promised it was worth the wait. I trusted her, and I'm so happy that I did! Our wait ended up being only about 15 minutes because we were a party of 2, versus the other large groups. After hearing so much about the French toast flight, I decided to order that before even looking at the menu. I also ordered a veggie omelet special. Everything was superb!!! I was blown away by the French toast flight, particularly the lemon. My second favorite was the caramel French toast. The other two were strawberry and blueberry, which was pretty much just regular French toast with the fruit on top, but still delicious. The French toast is so good that they don't even serve it with syrup. The omelet was the fluffiest I've ever had, fluffier than I ever could have imagined was possible.

7/14/2014,20140714,5,4.2,"3 words, well actually one, a-maz-ing! From the interior of the restaurant, to the exterior. A + for sure. The owner even came out and made sure we had everything we needed and everything met our standards. He does it everytime I go! Very good, very professional, great music, clean, tech savvy, and a safe environment. I just wish there was MORE room. I feel so packed. Anyway, this is the place to be everything melts in your mouth so deliciously!"
7/15/2014,20140715,4,4.2,"I am so happy I finally got to try this place! The wait on a Sunday around 11:30 was about an hour, and there's not really anywhere good to wait, so we walked up and down Lincoln to kill time. We ended up being seated at a community table, which was totally fine since there was plenty of space for everyone. Looking at all the delicious plates around us made the decision on what to order way harder! Although I really wanted the french toast flight, I went with the crab omelet special. It was served with a little bit of cheese (I think smoked gouda?), a very light tasty sauce, and topped with squash and red onion. The best part: they didn't skimp on the crab one bit! Lots of huge, delicious chunks of white crab meat. The flavors all blended together perfectly. And it came with the cheese crusted hashbrowns. No joke, I would wait a full hour again JUST for those taters! The service was also awesome. The owners were walking around and chatting with the guests and the food came out very fast. The only real downside of this place (other than the inevitable wait time) is the lack of AC. After waiting outside in the hot for a long time, I was hoping to cool down once I went inside, but the air was very minimal. They also played some pretty weird dance party music...but it wasn't too loud or anything, just a little weird for brunch. Next time: I'd consider waiting an extra hour or so and hitting up Atlas Brewing Company right across the street during the hour wait. They open at noon on Sundays. I'd also bring a bottle of bubbly because it's a BYOB place. That's right: BYOB brunch!"
7/15/2014,20140715,4,4.2,This place is a great breakfast spot but get there early or you WILL have a nice wait .. I loved it so much my co workers and I ( who work 3rd shift) would get off and go here every 2 weeks! last time I went I was told no more plain waffles which was a bummer but overall as many times as I have been I have been satisfied. the french toast is always good and the weekly flavor is very creative. the staff is generally friendly and attentive nice breakfast place I think i have o.d ive been so many times lol anything is a reason to go great for showing out of towners a good nice meal
7/18/2014,20140718,4,4.2,The food was great and I will definitely come back again! We went on a Sunday morning and the wait to be seated was an hour but it was well worth it. The place is not that big so I can see why the wait time can be very long. I had the french toast float and chicken sausage. I'll go back just for those two items! And it's BYOB too!
7/20/2014,20140720,5,4.2,"Best breakfast in town! I really don't have the words to describe how delicious it is! Of course I had the 'Flight of French Toast' which I devoured (best french toast I've ever eaten) & I also had the crab cake Benedict which was just as good. This place is very tight & small & the wait is typically long. So if you're in a rush or just an impatience person you probably want to go somewhere else. But it's totally worth the wait & then more waiting. The service was very welcoming & personable. Oh & they were playing some nice music, too! Try it! You won't be disappointed!"
7/20/2014,20140720,4,4.2,"I really love the food here it is unique and exceptionally awesome. I visited 2 times. My first visit I thought I would swing by and grab a quick breakfast. The wait was crazy. I had to leave and call my order in for pick up.    The second visit my girlfriend visiting Chicago and our kids went. We had a party of 7. The wait was extra long. Once agin the food was awesome.    My recommendation if you are on a time schedule don't stop here. If you have a party over four, they do not have seating for large groups so you have to wait for multiple tables to empty.   If you have all the time in the world, and you want to experience an flavorful breakfast check out this spot.   I the chicken and waffles. The lemon frech toast is amazing.This place should really expand. .."
7/20/2014,20140720,5,4.2,This place is by far the best brunch spot i have been to. It has some very creative dishes but everything is great.
7/21/2014,20140721,5,4.21,I've never gone wrong! The French toast is the classic. What they're known for. Have to try it! My other fav is the goof n cluck delicious sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken. Food is uniquely delicious. Service is great. Just expect a wait of at least 30 mins.
7/23/2014,20140723,5,4.21,"Took my boy friend to Batter and Berries for his Birthdate on a Monday morning, it was a pleasant experience. The service was great and the food was excellent. The atmosphere was really cool and laid back they are well known for chicken and waffles, French toast and egg Benedict. So when visiting you should try one of the few and on the second and third visit try others(just a suggestion). There were so many different flavored French toast to choose from I didn't know what to get; however, they do have a French toast flight which is like a sampler you will have four different flavors of French toast on one order. I really enjoyed this place because you get to see what you order because they have the pictures of most of the food on a iPad. I ordered the Carmel French toast and my boy friend order the chicken and waffles. It was divine! The Carmel French toasts came out with maple butter on it you didn't even need and syrup! The chicken was crispy and moist and the waffle was fluffy and it was actually a sweet potato waffle. I will be a returning customer I don't have any complaints."
7/26/2014,20140726,5,4.21,"This place was awesome! We had the super french toast, biscuits and gravy and eggs with bacon and hashbrowns. Our waitress was very nice and the food came out spaced out enough to fit on the table. I thought the biscuits and gravy was the best meal that we ate and my friend thought the French toast."
7/26/2014,20140726,4,4.21,Im probably late but this place is the business! Try the French toast flight....and the chicken sausage. Yum!
7/26/2014,20140726,3,4.21,"The food is amazing. Period.The wait is extremely long on the weekends. The place is BYOB. After waiting a hour 15 minutes don't expect to stay long since they rush you out very quickly. Living in NYC brunch is very different from Chicago. If B&B doesn't want ppl to stay long times than they should have some sort of policy in place instead of being passive aggressive. The food gets 4 stars, the service a 2."
7/26/2014,20140726,5,4.21,"Loved everything about this place! French toast ""flights""! What can be better than that? Coffee excellent, service excellent! Wish we lived in Chicago so we could go more often! Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place!"
7/26/2014,20140726,2,4.2,The food was amazing but the customer service was poor. The cc machine stopped working so we had to get cash to pay our bill THEN a waiter (not our waiter) approached us very rudely wanting us to leave because we'd been there for nearly 2hrs. Mind you the two hours included waiting on our food and walking to the nearest store to get cash. Customer service goes a LONG way
7/27/2014,20140727,2,4.2,"Sunday brunch is something I really look forward to especially going to a restaurant that has such rave reviews. The food and server were great, I highly recommend their cheesy hash, pork sausages and hot sauce (all homemade) but why the low review? The hostesses ruined what would have been a great experience. It is a beautiful day out so we were expecting a long wait, however we were skipped over (after waiting 45 minutes) and then when I asked her how long the wait would be (after she seated another couple) she told me she could be seating people instead of talking to me.If it hadn't been for the friendly server and good food, this establishment would have gotten 1 star."
7/27/2014,20140727,4,4.2,"I'm a little conflicted. I'm motivated by food, so overall, it's a four.The good: the French Toast flight was amazing, so were their omelets. On special, they had a salmon omelet and a scallop omelet. Simply delicious. The price point is great as well. I was at Girl and the Goat last weekend, and two scallops cost me $17. Their omelet included three, and it was I believe $14. Finally, when you order, the food comes out very quickly.The bad: The wait was painful. It took two hours, though I guess it wasn't their fault they are so popular. Also, I think the hostess has a tough job, and can come off as a little abrasive. I can get over that though.I am not itching to go back, simply because of the wait, but the food is the real deal."
7/28/2014,20140728,5,4.2,"My first time and what, no wait???! Ok, so it was a Monday morning but I still got lucky! I had the super flight, a slice of each (4) of the freshly made French toast, plus a slice of the week's special--Oreo French toast. The chicken sausage is also AMAZING! I don't have a single complaint. No wait. Excellent food. Attentive service."
7/28/2014,20140728,5,4.2,I went there for the first time Friday. There was a 30 minute wait for 2 people but It was well worth the wait. We had the lobster omelet and the chicken and waffles. Both dishes were absolutely amazing! The service was great as well. I liked the fact that the waitress had pictures of the specials on an iPad so you could see the dish before ordering. Definitely worth going to again....and again lol
7/28/2014,20140728,3,4.2,"Not 4-stars as is reflected on yelp, but a decent brunch place.Service was decent. And although there was a wait, was seated right away somehow. The portions were a little small on the French toast flight, but they were very tasty. If you're not that hungry and want a lighter brunch option, this may be it!"
7/30/2014,20140730,5,4.2,"IT IS SO GOOD! !!! I LOVED IT. WORTH EVERY BITE. On a Monday morning, Of the four of us we had the French toast, pancakes, apple waffles, pork sausage, chicken sausage, hash browns ,and finally the broccoli and cheddar omelet. It was really a taste bud satisfaction. The food came out within 15 minutes; awesome. The fruit is infused into the French Toast, it's definitely not your average. Everything had amazing flavor. One con that could bother some is that they strongly insist that you order the food AS IS. NO CHANGES. Another thing that's different is the way their omelets are made. They put the ingredients ON TOP of the omelet instead of inside. I prefer the inside method, but it was still a good experience. They also have cheesecrusted hash browns that we tried. Pretty tasty Go try it, you won't regret it"
7/30/2014,20140730,3,4.2,"I'm not sure how to rate this place...The food is eclectic and the menu is very interesting. I had the Blueberry French Toast, which was excellent! The cheesy hashbrowns are delicious as well. The spinach omelet was just spinach on top of eggs...not very exciting nor good. The wait was to be expected, but I was very surprised by the lack of customer interaction and attentiveness by our waitress. After being seated, we waited 15 minutes for a waitress, and I finally had to ask the greeter to send a waitress over. Once she arrived, much later (she had passed our table several times before) she was unenthused and could not even muster up a smile. However, the ""bus boys"" were friendly, fast and efficient and very well deserving of the tip given. Their service was much appreciated, and made up for the waitress...who left us waiting.Overall, I would have to give the place another shot, because everyone I know, swears by this place. Besides the obvious...lines and waits - must be an indicator of something worth waiting for???"
8/4/2014,20140804,4,4.2,"I've been meaning to go to Batter & Berries for months...I finally got to go and I really like it. The food is really good. My party and I had the ""Chicken and Goof"", the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, and the French Toast Flight. With the exception of the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, everything was EXCELLENT! There was a certain taste on them that my taste buds did not like...that didn't keep my mother and daughter from cleaning the plate so someone enjoyed them. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the space and noise. It's a very noisy spot...I enjoy House Music as much as anyone but it was a bit much for a breakfast experience. In terms of space, I like cozy but for the traffic this place gets, it could be twice as big and still not be big enough. Great food!"
8/6/2014,20140806,5,4.2,"You will leave craving more!!! I'm speechless! Always in a party of 3-6, no one ever has a complaint! The staff are super awesome, they give presentations of the food and come with funny jokes! The wait is often pretty long, they really need to expand the size! BYOB! Parking on the street can get difficult!"
8/6/2014,20140806,5,4.2,"One word AMAZING... The French Toast are awesome! If you want an awesome breakfast or a breakfast/brunch date with a lucky person, I highly recommend this place, it has a great atmosphere, great staff who knows the menu and meals of the day by memory. Five stars overall for the extra friendly people and atmosphere"
8/7/2014,20140807,3,4.2,"Factoring in a couple of factors, Batter & Berries gets a solid 3. Our wait time on a Sunday was a good 1 hr 15 min before we even got seated. Then it was another 25 min before we got our food after ordering. I got the Super French Toast flight which comes with a slice each of blueberry, strawberry, caramel, lemon, and the special of the day - Golden Oreo. I must say that it was very classic french toast - just a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. However at $14, I just don't think two and a half slices of bread topped with a little bit of fruit and puree should be worth that much. Out of the five, the golden oreo was my favorite with the caramel coming in second (though too sweet), then the lemon. The blueberry and strawberry were both fairly standard. + that the interior is gorgeous. All the pictures on the walls are items I would love to have myself.+ that they have the Lakers purple and yellow going on- for the level of noise. It was so loud that I had to yell so that my dining buddy could hear me even though he sat less than two feet away. Bottom line: Batter & Berries is okay if you have nothing to do and don't mind waiting around (there's Starbucks nearby for those interested.) Otherwise, there are other brunch places to go to."
8/7/2014,20140807,5,4.2,"Seriously, I had a sweet potato waffle, topped with fried chicken, maple butter, nutmeg, and hot sauce. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten.And the hash browns and bacon... Do it.It's worth waiting for a table!"
8/7/2014,20140807,3,4.2,"The food was great! The hash browns were more of a mash potato, than the typical hashbrowns that Im use to. We went on a wednesday at about 1pm, we were seated immediately, however it took 10-15mins before we got water and our order was taken. Another thing I didn't like is that the owner or manager, spoke to everyone else and asked how other patrons around us, was enjoying their food, but we were neglected. The french toast flight was awesome, my boyfriend didn't care for his pancakes or the ""mash browns"" aka hash browns"
8/10/2014,20140810,5,4.2,"Amazing food and the head chef/owner was kind enough to stop by my table twice to introduce himself and see how everything was turning out! I only wish I could eat here every day! Be sure to arrive early because they stop taking name promptly at 3pm and there is a huge crowd because it is that good. I had the vegetarian omelette which are served deconstructed, and a side of the lemon french toast. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned, service was prompt and kind. Definitely try this place sooo good."
8/13/2014,20140813,5,4.2,"Fantastic low-key brunch joint. Service was impeccable and went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect.Food was absurdly delicious. We ordered the fried chicken and chicken stuffed waffle and the french toast flight. Both were not only unique, but deliciously perfect. All in all it made for the perfect morning and if I'm ever back in Chicago, I would definitely return here."
8/13/2014,20140813,4,4.2,"Great place for brunch! The food is great, the staff is beyond amazing and attentive, it's a black owned facility which is awesome! Will come again with my girlfriends."
8/13/2014,20140813,5,4.2,"Batter and Berries is so absolutely delicious. I would definitely rate it, one of the top 3 breakfast spots period. The menu is so fresh, and all the dishes are bursting with mouth watering flavors that keep you coming back for more. Although, this restaurant gets pretty crowded, the staff keeps everything running smoothly, and you'll be seated in no time. The food comes out so quickly, it's almost unbelievable. One of the servers who gave us a great experience was Tusime. He is always in great spirits, and always has a great riddle to get you through the day! While you're visiting might I suggest trying the cluck n gaufe, Carmel French toast, and crab Benedict....... Thank me later :-)"
8/14/2014,20140814,4,4.2,"The attitude of the hostess was HORRIBLE. It was very stuck-up and rude. There was a point in time that she gave my cousin and I a dirty look while calling us for our table. Other than the poor attitude of the hostess, I enjoyed the meal seeing that it was my first time there. I loved the Brown Sugar & Cinnamon french toast with cheese hash browns and scrambled eggs!"
8/14/2014,20140814,5,4.2,"After watching on Check Please and hearing about this place again recently my son and I decided to go on Sunday morning. We were fortunate to have no wait time. There were larger parties waiting so we got lucky. We had an excellent server who had a riddle every time he came to the table. The food lived up to the hype. We shared a super flight of French toast and an egg white omelet with salmon. It was light and delicious. Coincidently, the Check Please segment aired again right before we left home. Mario you're right I could have smoked a cigarette and I don't smoke. I will certainly be back. Also, I got a chance to take a picture with the owner who came to our table several times. I recommend being patient, well worth the wait. Next time I have my eye on the pork chop I saw on the plate of another guest, it was huge and looked wonderful."
8/15/2014,20140815,5,4.21,"I have visited this establishment on more then one occasion, and all I can say the experiences have been WONDERFUL, food DELICIOUS just all out FANTASTIC"
8/16/2014,20140816,5,4.21,"My friends and I from Columbus are here for the weekend and Chris the manager and Chef Rylan accommodated us to the best of their abilities! They greeted us explained the menu and let us know the status of our order the entire time. The food was amazing!!! We ordered the Pork Chop executive, scallop omlet, crab cakes Benedict, and the Cluck n Gaufre. We also got a couple flights of French toast which were all very very tasty! We're going to make it a tradition to come for breakfast every time we come here.Oh and Tusemee our server was quick and super funny. I hope you're quick witted because he's hilarious and has the best riddles"
8/17/2014,20140817,5,4.21,This was the best breakfast I have ever had hands down. The food was awesome with a great taste. The customer service was high quality. The manager was very cordial and gave instructions how to eat my chicken and waffle. They had chicken cooked in the waffle....who does that!!! If you haven't been then please go and give them your business. This was my first time on my birthday today and this was the best way to begin it! Thank you husband!!
8/17/2014,20140817,2,4.2,"My husband enjoyed his Deconstructed Chicken Fajita Omelet. However, our hash browns were received cold, chicken and waffles were just Ok and the chicken sausage a little too sweet. The wait was long and when I went in to find out why the wait was longer than initially stated (we were told an hour and ten minutes and time was creeping up on an hour and a half), we were in within 15 minutes. I've had friends rave about this place and it was a major disappointment to me. Thus, I will continue my journey in locating and possibly recommending other black owned businesses."
8/22/2014,20140822,5,4.21,First ones in the door this morning and it was delicious. We had a flight of French toast and the crab cake Benedict.
8/26/2014,20140826,5,4.21,"Wow! This place definitely gets my vote for the best French toast! If you're looking for something sweet, go here! Went on a Saturday with a 20 minute wait...not bad! Great coffee, super friendly staff, and great service!  A bit noisy inside, but the food is worth it!"
8/26/2014,20140826,4,4.21,"This place is GOOD! All of the fresh fruit that came on top of our entrees were sweet and fresh. The taste of everything is definitely of QUALITY. Service was Great. Any item you would normallly put syrup on, I would suggest tasting it first. Plus there is a house sweet butter which accompanies the plate that is delicious. For the first time in my life, I ate pancakes without syrup.I want to give them 5 stars but I'm deducting a star because of no (or the lack of ) Air Conditioning. My BFF did not finish her meal becuz it was so stuffy inside the establishment and she began sweating horribly. Other that....it is a MUST TRY!"

The second time I went, the server was just okay. Sadly, there is NO AIR OR VENTILATION, which makes it unbearable for me to eat. Also, the hostess at the front door is RUDE! She has an attitude problem and she gives dirty looks. I wish I knew her name to report her to management next time."
8/27/2014,20140827,3,4.2,"Went here today for breakfast with my dad and wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be after reading all the reviews. First of all, the restaurant is crazy loud...I know it's the city but seriously, it was hard to hold a conversation. I got the french toast flight and sadly, I felt that each of the four pieces were very dry. They are creative flavors, yes, so that was the upside, but I had to add syrup diluting a little bit of the specialty flavors just to soften the bread. My dad had a mushroom omelet that he enjoyed. The service was indeed great and the location is easily accessible as well. I would love to go back and maybe try something different on the menu but with so many other great brunch places in the area, I'm in no rush."

8/30/2014,20140830,5,4.2,"This review is for the French toast flight. And the side of cheesy potatoes. And the juice. And the service. I knew this place was a gold mine when we pulled up to a parking spot. But then I also knew there was gonna be a long wait when I saw a long a$$ line of people outside. We b!?€he'd and moaned how hungry we were, and how we were about to eat the leather off our purses. And then they called our name. The most beautiful word I heard all day, bc I knew I'd get fed. So they sat us at this long table with other people. Kinda like being back in grade school, when we had to sit next to people we didn't know/never would be caught sitting next to. Weird. But I was determined to get food. I got the omelette with goat cheese, asparagus, and scallops. I like all those ingredients, just not together. But it did come with a side of awesome. I mean, a side of cheesy potatoes. You'd have to try it to understand what you've been missing every morning. We also ordered the French toast flight. It was sooooooooooo freakin good. The blueberry was my favorite. The cream sauce they use is mind blowing. Will upload a photo just like every other patron in the restaurant has done. The others ordered the chicken and waffles, and the ham with eggs. They agreed that it was very good. But then again, eating with an elite yelper does have its rewards. Just ask them ;)"
8/30/2014,20140830,5,4.2,"This review is for the French toast flight. And the side of cheesy potatoes. And the juice. And the service. I knew this place was a gold mine when we pulled up to a parking spot. But then I also knew there was gonna be a long wait when I saw a long a$$ line of people outside. We b!?€he'd and moaned how hungry we were, and how we were about to eat the leather off our purses. And then they called our name. The most beautiful word I heard all day, bc I knew I'd get fed. So they sat us at this long table with other people. Kinda like being back in grade school, when we had to sit next to people we didn't know/never would be caught sitting next to. Weird. But I was determined to get food. I got the omelette with goat cheese, asparagus, and scallops. I like all those ingredients, just not together. But it did come with a side of awesome.

9/4/2014,20140904,1,4.2,We waited for the table on Saturday for 2+ hours and after that the food was not good. We ordered the famous fried chicken and waffles and I have definitely had better food at other brunch places. All the other food options was ok and kinda pricey for a brunch place. I would skip it and may be go to another brunch place with the wait time.

9/6/2014,20140906,3,4.2,"A very popular spot with some unique breakfast specials such as salmon omelet and a marinated bone-in pork chop and eggs.We got there Saturday at 8:30 and had a 45 minute wait which our hostess was spot on with estimating so no quibbles there. It seems the sweet spot would have been around 9:15 as others who got there about that time had only a 10-15 minute wait. They open at 8:00.Service was good, however, our server failed to volunteer the cost info for my off menu special - turkey omelet. The specials are all listed on a chalkboard but also don't have the prices listed there. I assumed the turkey omelet would be similar in price to the ones in the menu that come in around $10. It was actually $14 which is a little steep for eggs with stuff on them in my cheap ass world. Shame on me for not asking but shame on them for not publishing the $ info. Omelets come with a pile of their cheesy hash browns which are yummy but mine were barely lukewarm and slightly gluey in consistency The omelet itself was quite good and hot. It was filled with a cranberry cheese and then topped with a good amount of sliced turkey, portabella mushrooms and gravy. I could only eat about half of the huge omelet. Coffee was good."

9/7/2014,20140907,5,4.19,"The four of us went for breakfast. Our server was kinda loud but friendly , pleasant and knowledgeable . We ordered f french toast flight which was fabulous. Ordered 4 different kind of dish which also delish. Service was quick. I would go back there and will recommend the place to friends. Great for family and kids."
9/8/2014,20140908,1,4.19,"I have been a long time customer of Batter & Berries and I am really sorry I have to write a review of this kind, but something has to be done about the customer service I have experienced from them in the past couple of days. I had lunch there a few days ago and realized my credit card had been charged twice for the lunch I had. I called there as soon as I realized this happened and was told I could not speak with a manger about the situation because he was too busy at the time. I explained to the young lady that this was unacceptable and could not believe her manager did not see this an an emergency to come to the phone, but he refused and that I had to call after 3 pm. I made the call and of course no one answered because it was after hours. I then called back on Monday assuming this would be a better time and the young lady once again said her manager would not come to the phone. I explained to her that this once again was unacceptable and I wanted to speak with someone asap. The manager would not take the call. They may have great food but it is very unprofessional for an establishment not to see you being charged twice a priority to come to the phone. This situation has still not been resolved and they have officially lost a customer. I will never eat at a place that does not see their mistakes as an emergency to correct and I will defiantly tell everyone I know of my experience."
9/10/2014,20140910,3,4.19,"I had the French toast super flight which includes a half slice of five different preparations, two of which had fresh fruit on them. I liked the taste but the French toast came out barely lukewarm and the bread was relatively thin so the dish wasn't very filling. For $11, I would expect it to be hot and the slices to be thicker. I also tried some of my GF's cheesy potatoes and they also weren't hot. Service was very good and the food came out very quickly. The coffee was also excellent."
9/12/2014,20140912,4,4.19,"Tried B&B for the first time with family and I was pleased. The wait was at least an hour but the food was worth it. My fiancé and I split the French Toast Flight : Blueberry, Lemon, Caramel, Strawberry and the flavor of the day - Apple Pie. It was delicious! I also had egg whites, cheese hash browns, and turkey sausage. The hash browns could use a little seasoning and the turkey sausage was good. It had like a maple taste to it. Would recommend to try. Get there early because the wait can be long."
9/12/2014,20140912,3,4.18,"OH MY GOD the wait was the WORST. And don't get me wrong, This isn't my first rodeo. A friend and I waited over two hours when we should NOT have because the hostess was seating 3-4 ppl groups before us (even if they arrived later). This was because there weren't enough two ppl tables and they absolutely refused to seat two people at a four person table. It's worth going once especially if you're a sweets person - but GO WITH A GROUP"
9/16/2014,20140916,4,4.18,Sooo good! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was too noisy and I could barely hear my server! I ordered the Carmel French toast (amazing! No syrup needed) with the chicken patties that had pieces of apple in iy sigh scrambled eggs. My mother had the veggie omelette and hash browns; and what's really unique is they put the veggies on top of the omelette instead of adding it in with the eggs.The next time I come back (trust I will be back lol) I'm going to try the specialty French toast; a couple weeks ago they had pink moscato French toast...where else can you find that besides batter and berries??!!
9/18/2014,20140918,5,4.19,"YES! If you are short on time, just take my word for it, stop reading now and plan your next breakfast at this place. Just, yes!Been there once, can't wait to go back. I had the chicken and waffles (they have some funny name for it that I can't recall). It was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. They were pretty sheisty on the hot sauce on top, and I should dock them a star for that, but I'm in a giving mood tonight - so I hope they read this and put more hot sauce on the darn thing and not make me order extra for 50 cents. Otherwise, the fried chicken atop the sweet potato waffle was awe inspiring. My dining partners ordered the crab cake benedict and it was met with so/so reviews from that individual. He said it was a good dish, but because of personal taste, he wouldn't order it again, citing the lack of ""zip"" he was hoping for. My other partner had the French Toast Flight which apparently is their coup de grâce and most famous item on the menu. All we were getting from him were moans of pure ecstasy as he was eating with a promise to return and order the exact same dish. It is also what I'll be trying on my next trip. The wait staff kept my glass full (which is about 90% of my rating of any server), were attentive and I appreciate their use of technology in the iPads they use not only to place your order tableside, but also to show you pictures of the features of the day and popular dishes - very smart. The staff was extremely friendly - my only suggestion for such a small and intimate place where it is clear the Chef runs the joint is that it would be nice for him to come out himself and visit the tables. I feel like chefs who make the time to do that probably gain a lot of insight into their operation and the successes and failures of their dishes. The 5 stars were well earned - tres bien!"
9/20/2014,20140920,4,4.19,"Came here a few weekends ago at around 9:30 AM and I could easily spot the restaurant from a few blocks away due to all the people milling around waiting fora table. I put my name down and it was 45 minutes for a party of two, so if you somehow don't want to wait I suggest coming here probably at open hahaWhen my friend and I were seated we were shown the specials on a tablet which was really great. I normally never order a special, but actually considered it after seeing what the food actually looked like. Props to the servers here because there are about seven different specials, and ours went through each one of them.Having heard nothing but amazing things, my friend and I decided to share the super flight of french toast and the chicken and waffles. Hands down best french toast I have ever had. Each piece of french toast was the perfect balance of sweet and fruity, and the texture soft but slightly chewy. Though I appreciated the chicken and waffles, I didn't fancy the hot sauce that came with it very much. The chicken was nice and crispy though while the waffle had a nice touch of sweet potato flavor and came with hunks of chicken in it. When I came, it was still summertime and for some reason there was no AC working. My friend and I were feeling the humidity in the crowded restaurant, though that should not be a problem as the weather starts to cool down. Hopefully I'll be back to try some other dishes!"
9/20/2014,20140920,1,4.18,"The customer service at this place is horrific. We arrive and were told there was a 40-45 min wait. We stand outside in the rain waiting for 40 min where we check to see where we are on the list as several parties have gone into the restaurant that arrived after us. We go inside and the lady proceeds to tell us that we weren't on the list. Then the 2nd hostess says she remembers but she lost the list. They insisted that we wait another hour. They never apologized for the inconvenience, they later said the bus boy dropped the list so we must have gotten lost in the shuffle. Still no attempt to rectify the situation. In addition, no one advised us that we could have sat inside for the hour we were standing in the rain. We received a major attitude from all three hostesses who were unorganized, unprofessional and rude."
9/21/2014,20140921,4,4.18,"Believe the hype! Everything was amazing. We had the lobster omelette, shrimp and crab Benedict and a half order of strawberry French toast (yes, we ordered too much)! The only sad thing is we were so full we couldn't eat it all! Definitely worth checking out and waiting for a table if you have to."
9/21/2014,20140921,5,4.18,This was by far the best brunch place I've ever been to. The menu was great and the service was impeccable. The sweet food wasn't overly sweet and the savory food wasn't overly greasy or salty. Highly recommend this place
9/23/2014,20140923,5,4.18,"I'm a big fanatic of breakfast food and brunch. So I've tried a lot of restaurants around Chicago but this restaurant I feel should be in it's own category. First, I live French toast so I decided to try this place because of all the hype about the French toasty flight and yeah, it's everything it's hyped up to be. They make all the sauces and butters in house and exactly how each French toast is prepared is how you should eat it. Best breakfast I've had in a long time, maybe even years. (Sorry mom) it was so good I woke up early the next day to go back and try the cluck & gaufre."
9/24/2014,20140924,3,4.18,Was looking for a good french toast or pancake. This place was great for their french toast especially because of the 'float' with the four different flavors. I do wish there was a bit more variation...I feel that there wasn't enough to appeal to more people. If I wasn't craving french toast I'm not really sure what I would've ordered....
9/24/2014,20140924,5,4.18,By far my favorite place to eat breakfast. I've had several things on the menu and nothing has been less than excellent. The French toast flight is a must. They are always changing their menu items which keeps me coming back often.
9/25/2014,20140925,3,4.18,"My husband and I were quoted a 45 min-1 hour wait. We watched while MANY larger groups (3-6 people) were seated before us. Then the hostess would come out and ask who doesn't mind sitting together - and everyone rushed to get in (it had started to rain). She didn't follow the list at all. We ended up waiting an hour and 20 minutes. I watched the hostess (young pretty gall with her hair in a bun on the top of her head) get in two verbal arguments with irritated patrons. Not the most welcoming thing to witness.Our server was fantastic - fast and hilarious. He made the visit worth it. I ordered the French toast flight and my husband got the breakfast burrito. Both were good, but nothing special.It was a memorable experience, but a very frustrating start to the day. Only go if you are in a party greater than two. You will be seated much faster."
9/26/2014,20140926,5,4.18,"The first time I tried chicken n waffles, I was a young 23 year old, getting ready for a big day of prepartying for a Lil Wayne concert. Since we already had the Hypnotiq and Hennessy, we decided the best thing to pair up with that was Eggo's and Jewel Fried chicken. It was a life changing combination. Since then, my standards have risen for Chicken n Waffles, and Batter & Berries has provided me with the best I've had so far. They make the waffle with a sweet potato batter, with chicken chunks inside...genius. They topped that with a fried boneless chicken breast and some excellent hot sauce. Dirty South gourmet greatness. Aside from that, the place is BYOB, so we were able to pop bottles of Andre and get our mimosa on. The service was awesome, they quickly brought out a bucket of ice for our $5 bottles, and different employees stopped by our table multiple times to see how our meals were. As a rule, I don't take off stars for long wait times, because that means the place is doing something right, but be prepared to wait a lonnnnnng time to get a table on the weekends."
9/27/2014,20140927,5,4.18,"This place is a great place to go for Brunch. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good for a friendly atmosphere. ***BYOB ALERT**** this place is excellent for you to bring your own bottle of champaign and make mimosas!To start, if you go on the weekend, expect a wait. As our waiter pointed out, they open up early on the weekends but there can be people outside waiting up to a half hour before they open. Although the wait can be long, I would say hold out because the food is amazing! In addition to the menu they have, they change up the specials every week. Although I give them 5 stars, there is a few of things that I didn't personally like but it could just be my perception and my preference: 1) the hostess is not that friendly. When we went to ask about our wait time, after we had been sitting there for about 40 mins already, she gave us somewhat of an attitude and said ""we didn't call you yet"". Me and my fiancé politely said thank you and went back outside to wait. 2) the place is not that big so it can be kinda cozy with the neighboring tables 3) the noise level is high. Our waiter was awesome! He knew everything about the menu and made some great recommendations! If it is your first time going, I would suggest getting the super flight of the French toast. It's one piece of all the French toast they have including the special they have for that day. Overall, I would come back."
9/27/2014,20140927,4,4.18,"Been here four times. Waited to review because I did agree with the service issues. It's gotten better, but even if it's peaks out at mediocre, this is the reality: the chicken sausage is ridiculous. It just is. And yes, I do mean the chicken sausage, not the pork sausage. Both are made by Chef Rylon and good, however, the chicken sausage is a standout. I would come here once a week with okay service just to get it. Like the sausage, Chef Rylon makes most of what you eat. If you order a turkey club, you get real, freshly carved turkey - not cold cuts. The hash, batters for pancakes, waffles and French toast, maple butter, etc. are all made by Chef Rylon and very good. I have more of a taste for savory vs sweet, so The French toast and sweat potato waffle were a little on the sweeter side for my liking, but both were meals I would get again with a twist (regular waffle with the cluck and gaufre for instance). Chef Rylon appears to really care about the success of his place and your enjoyment of his cuisine. He is seen often throughout the place and always says to simply grab him from the kitchen if you have any issues with te food. I doubt that's ever been necessary. Good value too for what you get. Never look at the bill and think that it's out of whack. Quite the opposite. 4.5 star place to me. If service gets corrected, Batter & Berries will be one of the toughest weekend spots to get a table."
9/29/2014,20140929,3,4.18,"My friends and I arrived at this place around 1 PM to grab brunch/lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and boy was the line long for this place. We had a party of 3 and waited close to two hours for a table. My friends and I were starving by the time we got seated and during our wait, we went to a nearby Starbucks to grab a drink while we waited.Note: they have their regular menu and then they have a special menu that is written on the chalkboard and the waiter will highlight them to you before you order. I wish they would have the special items printed on a menu so I can read it and not have to be rushed in my decision. Also, the pricetag of each plate wasn't attached so I was hesitant in ordering from the special menu. The waiter place your order through an iPad, too so that's pretty cool until you have to face with technical difficulty...which happened to us.I got the chicken and waffles while my friends got the blueberry french toast and the crawfish omelette ($16/17?).Food came out pretty fast and we finally got to enjoy our first meal of the day. My friends and I were all pretty satisfied with our food. It wasn't the best chicken and waffles I have ever had though so if I do come back here, I would probably try something from their special menu or the executive plate (steak and eggs) I saw someone order. And I would definitely try to go during times where I wouldn't have to wait so long for a table."
9/30/2014,20140930,5,4.18,"Fantastic food, great service. One of the most delicious brunch spots in the city. The only reason I don't go there more often is because there is always a line. But that's because the food is so good. So if you've got some time on a Saturday or Sunday morning, pick up some champagne (it's Byob) and head on over."
10/1/2014,20141001,5,4.18,"Of the charts for brunch! Their lobster omelet and the french toast flight was yummy! The only downside is that wait is long but the food comes really fast. Overall, very impressed!"
10/1/2014,20141001,1,4.18,"I was excited to try this place since it was recommended by my brother. So today me and my mom went at around 10:45am . Anyway I got the the buttermilk pancakes and chicken sausage. My mom ordered the traditional which consists of scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and biscuits. I must say I was not impressed with the food. The only flavorful thing on the menu was orange-cranberry juice. We had to keep putting additional seasoning on our food. Don't think I will be coming back."
10/6/2014,20141006,3,4.17,"Pros: The food was different and pretty good. Of course I had the Flight with ham and sweet potato hash browns. The only thing I wasn't too pleased about was the hash brown dish. It was more like a lumpy mashed potatoes and it was too rich for my pleasing. Other than that, food was pretty good. Cons: The wait. Don't tell me 45 minutes when it's actually an hour and a half. So, I recommend only going to this place if you have time to kill. The management gave us the most shrug look when we told him we don't mind the wait just tell us so we could have left and went somewhere else (because we were on a tight schedule.)So am I running back? No but I definitely think everyone should experience at least once. Great business to support."
10/6/2014,20141006,1,4.17,My first review for this place was over a year ago and it was 5 stars. This time it is barely 1. I have been a staunch supporter since they opened. I always order the french toast flight but due to a strawberry allergy I cant eat the strawberry french toast. Chef Rylon is aware of this and always lets me substitute due to the allergy. I encountered one of the other owners Craig Richardson and not only did he absolutely REFUSE to make any exceptions but he was somewhat nasty in his response. I informed him I was one of the early supporters of his business but he didn't care nor was he interested in the fact that my request was due to a food allergy.  Customer service is key to any business and I think that owner or not he can brush up on his customer service skills. I travel from the near southside to eat here & I am very disappointed.
10/7/2014,20141007,2,4.17,"I wish I could give this place a higher rating because I really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, after waiting an hour my friend and I ordered deconstructed omlettes and shared a waffle flight. The food came out 5 seconds after we ordered it, meaning everything is pre-made in the back and that's why the omlettes are deconstructed, so that the cooks can just put some eggs on a plate and scoop the ingredients on top and churn food out quickly. The french toast flight was the same. All the french toast was the same, just with different toppings on the same standard french toast. I understand having to serve lots of people quickly, especially in a small space like this one, with a long line. However, if you're going to make things in bulk, and make me wait an hour to be seated I want it to be delicious. The food here was just ok. I do love that it's BYOB and I also think the service was good here, although not great. Overall, brunch is my favorite meal of the day and I doubt I'll want to come back here when there are other places with food that's just as good, service that's a little better, an environment where I can eat and drink more leisurely and don't have to wait for an hour. I'm glad I tried them once though."

10/10/2014,20141010,5,4.16,"Delicious, Decadent, Flavorful food- beautifully decorated: the food and the restaurant!! Come support black businesses"
10/11/2014,20141011,1,4.16,"Disappointed with the service of this famed Chicago brunch spot. During the end of our 1-hr meal, we were repeatedly asked (every few minutes or so) by different servers whether we were finished with the meal. When we asked to speak to the manager to express our frustration, we were told that this was a very busy restaurant and many customers were waiting and the table needed to turn. We couldn't have had a more rushed meal and certainly will not return. Restaurant management should consider re-training service industry etiquette to the staff."
10/12/2014,20141012,4,4.16,"I love this place, the wait is long but the food is great!! The cooks and staff is really nice and friendly, minus the hostess (the younger one). She never smiles at customers or even acknowledges people who walk in to put their names down. She's the first person we interact with when walking in so she leaves a bad taste in our mouths as far as customer satisfaction. She seems so miserable and it's contagious. We've gone several times and different times of the day and the story is always the same. It's a shame because this place is amazing but she leaves such a bad impression."
10/12/2014,20141012,2,4.15,"It is with great sadness that I write this review because I had high hopes and wanted to like this place. First, we waited for our table(no big deal), but the hostess sat everyone who came after us before us and then commenced to explain she called us but we weren't present. Not to sound egoistic, but we are very attractive people and are impossible to miss. And, we were in the waiting area the entire time and even gave our waiting bench to some elderly women who came after us and stood for 30 more minutes. Well, let's get passed the point that they just overlooked seating us. So now we are seated. Truly the saving grace of the restaurant was TOOSEEME(sp?) our waiter. If not for him, 1 star surely. We ordered the chicken+goefre and the crawfish omelet. My omelet came out 12 minutes before the chicken. I don't know about you, but do you ever go out to eat alone while someone is sitting at the table WITH you? When I finally got upset and asked why the chicken hadn't come out yet while my partner was starving (my food was now cold )and I practiced common etiquette by waiting to eat, I was told,""We bring it out while it's warm."" Is that a major feat in a restaurant?????? I mean isn't that a basic task???? Ok, let's get passed that. (WTF) Now we have our food. The waffle was tasty so 1 star for that. My crawfish omelet was tasteless. I was wondering where the bacon was as I was told it was an ingredient inside???? Please put some seasoning in those hash/mashed potatoes, please!!!! I asked for hot sauce 3 times before getting it. In all honesty, this place ruined a perfectly sunny Sunday morning. Plus, we came from downtown on Chicago Marathon day and drove the long route to get there. Thank God parking was free! I'm into supporting black owned businesses, but damn, this place made me feel bad for having high expectations...which I will uphold."
10/14/2014,20141014,4,4.15,"This place is amazing!! One of the best brunch places in chicago! If you are looking for something different and incorporating different protein sources, this is your places. They have seafood, lamb, steak,chicken, and the normal eggs. And everything was so good! The lobster omelette is a must, the lamb trio and the french toast flight. All so good. But all this good food comes with a cost, the wait time. If you don't get their before 9am, you are looking at a 1.5 hour wait! Another thing no mimosas which I think is a must at brunch.Also the food came out way too fast after we ordered. So some of it must be pre-made to order. But I will go because there are more things I want to try."
10/16/2014,20141016,5,4.15,"Three words. French Toast Flight! This was one of my favorite brunch visit's in the city with my spouse, and I can't wait to return. Yes, there is a long wait on weekends, but the food is worth it! I've never said this in a review before, but you can taste the LOVE in the food. It's all sorts of comfort food and tasty wonderfulness. I'm preggers right now, and am totally craving this place. Save calories to eat here or make sure you go for a long walk afterwards because the food is definitely an indulgence. My husband and I split the french toast flight, as well as a veggie omelet and both complemented each other really well. The maple butter is a great touch, and you don't even need syrup if you have the maple butter, just enjoy the flavors as is. Everything is seasoned and spiced perfectly. Our server was very welcoming and kind. He had an energy about him, that you couldn't help but tip him largely for! It was also nice to see the Chef walking around and greeting customers and regulars. This place draws a diverse clientele and it's nice to support local chefs. The only improvement I can think of is to improve their wait times, maybe reservations wouldn't be a bad idea or perhaps a system where you can call in and put your name on the list day the day of."
10/18/2014,20141018,5,4.15,I've heard so much about this place and after one failed attempt due to the ridiculous wait time I finally made it in! The food was really good just as I had heard. They food came out within minutes which was pretty shocking and also made me a bit skeptical. I had the french toast flight and the lobster omelet and both were delicious! Most dishes come with cheesy hash browns but I could tell they make them in bulk bc they were not hot or fresh which was disappointing. The service here was equally fantastic. Our server was extreme knowledgable of the menu and the current specials. The reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because I literally left wanting more!
10/18/2014,20141018,5,4.16,The specials were unique and delicious! Our server has a great schpiel for the specials and even gave us a riddle to ponder while we waited for the food! (Which wasn't long at all) Make sure you have the maple butter and get a side of their home made hot sauce!
10/19/2014,20141019,4,4.16,We went at prime time on a Sunday and waited over an hour. When we ordered the food came out immediately but it was cold. It probably would have been awesome. I will definitely give it another try on a weekday. Staff was great amidst the craziness thou!
10/20/2014,20141020,5,4.16,"The wait can be long but do yourself a favor and just walk down the street and grab a drink at a bar and head back to have some of the best food you've ever tasted.Hands down the chicken and waffles makes this place the reason I've already been twice in the past month and I don't even live in Chicago. The french toast flight is great as well. Once seated the time waiting for food was insanely fast, it is spoiling me now when I go to other places.I must also say the staff has been great as well.I wish I could go every week."
10/20/2014,20141020,5,4.16,"Yes the wait is long, but it is worth it. Their breakfast food is great - french toast flight, chicken and waffle, pancakes, homemade sausage, and deconstructed omelete. I just had a salad there for the first time, and it too was great - the berry salad, on spinanch with goat cheese. I'm happy they finally got a winter door system, as sitting up front in the cold weather was pretty breezy. I think they need to move to a text system for their waitlist or call people 5 mintues before their table is ready. The wait is by far the worst part...however when I missed my name (bc I wasn't out front when they called) and checked back in they sat us right away...I was worried we were gonna have to get back on the list and starve!"
10/22/2014,20141022,4,4.16,"Breakfast food with gourmet quality. I mean this place has crab omelets, shrimp and grits duck Benedict...need I say more? Where else can you get breakfast food like this?? For all of the delicious dishes the prices don't break the bank. I will say the wait to actually get a seat is a little long. But what place isn't on a Saturday or Sunday? Give this place a try. It will give your taste buds a nice shock."
10/22/2014,20141022,5,4.16,"I've only been here once, service was great when I went. Although it's kinda loud in there but then again it's a small place. I had the fish and chips and I love their fries! Def going back"
10/23/2014,20141023,5,4.16,Great menu especially if you like to explore new dishes. The service and food is awesome!
10/24/2014,20141024,3,4.16,"The Deal: I decided to search for a great brunch spot on the northside for my girlfriends and I. I heard through the grapevine that this place was great, yet that the wait was long. There is no RSVP. When we arrived (August 2014) we were quickly greeted by a long line. I went to speak with the hostess who let me know that the wait would be approximately 45 minutes, and indeed it was.Food: Now people rant and rave about the food on here. However, I was not impressed. I ordered the Deconstructed Steak Omelet topped with grilled onions, mushrooms, swiss cheese & red wine sauce, which came with fresh shredded B&B hash browns. The steak lacked flavor along with the hash browns and I had to ask the waittress if she could replace my order of hash browns because there was barely any cheese on it.Thank goodness my friend was there and she told me about their infamous hot sauce that they make. This definitely helped add flavour to the meal and made for a much more enjoyable experience. Now, they have BYOB, however, they request that you purchase the juice. We didn't know about this rule and had purchased orange juice from the 7-11 down the block. Our waitress was accommodating and allowed us to drink our own juice albeit we hide the bottles. lolFYI: My friends ordered french toast and seemed to like it.Atmosphere: Chill. Urban. Laid-back. The place is set-up nice, but it is small. There is minimal noise.Service: Great!Overall: It was a good experience. I would come again but it would not be my first choice."
10/24/2014,20141024,4,4.16,"love this Restaurant! also, love that it is black-owned in predominantly white Lakeview/Lincoln Park. Unique in the sense that they show you photographs of their specials on an iPad which I thought was smart and creative. I love seeing pictures of what to order beforehand.I had the Blueberry Waffle and the Spinach and mushroom Omelet. The Waffle was amazing! very sweet and only needed the maple butter that came along with it. It reminded me a lot of a blueberry muffin and was yummy when I reheated it later that evening. The spinach and mushroom omelet was also divine. The omelet is made with cheese inside and the spinach and mushroom sauté on top. Additionally this comes with a side of cheesy hashbrowns. They make their own hot sauce and it was so yummy I had to ask if they bottled/sold the sauce. Spicy with a hint of garlic. Only complaint is that the choices for omelets are limited. Having some traditional omelets like a meat and cheese (ham, chicken sausage, etc) wouldn't hurt!"
10/25/2014,20141025,4,4.16,"I loved the food! I have been there and have had the french toast flight which was amazing! The pork sausage also very good. It reminds me of Bob Evans sausage with a little spice to. The broccoli and cheese omelette was loaded with cheddar and had huge chunks of broccoli. The cheddar hashbrown were good but needed more seasoning. The deconstructed steak omelette was ok. Huge chunks of steam and lots of gravy. The times I went we were told the wait would be 45 or 50 minutes but the wait wasn't that long. The server was polite and attentive. Food came out very fast. I absolutely love this place and recommend it. The only issue I had was that there was a gentleman, who im guessing was the owner, was greeting people asking how they liked the food. I noticed this gentleman pay more attention to the tables where Caucasian people were sitting. One table happened to be next to us. For an establishment that has a large African American clientele, I feel that everyone should feel welcome no matter their race. Other then that this place is wonderful."
10/27/2014,20141027,5,4.16,"Delish!!! I had the French Toast Super Flight and the Chicken & Geuf (""Goof"" - it's a chicken sweet potato waffle with a side 'o chicken breast). Soooooo goooood! No syrup needed. That chicken was the best!! The breakfast selection was great and there were some tasty sounding daily specials; they looked good too ( I saw a few as they went by). No grits though. I didn't even pay attention to the lunch menu. The breakfast was singing to my tummy. Lol! The service was great and classic Chicago house music played low in the background. Nice touch. The owner(s) and manager walk around interacting with everyone which also made the experience enjoyable. But really it's all about that great food!! Kudos to this place. In Chicago for 4 days and I'm going back tomorrow!! Yuuummy!!"
10/29/2014,20141029,4,4.16,"We heard about the lines and we heard about the food and decided the food would be worth the wait.Good decision.Bonus:around 12:30 , midweek, there was no wait. It would have been worth it even if there were a wait.The food: I had the chicken and waffle, my friend had the eggs benedict over crab cakes with cheesy hash browns. Chicken breast was moist and tender and crispy crusty on the outside. There was a spicy sauce on the chicken. There was maple butter on the waffle. The waitress explained that Chef Rylon recommended that all 4 components (chicken waffle spicy sauce and sweet butter) be eaten in one bite.Chef Rylon rocks. Crispy, spicy sweet and waffle all together in my mouth. Mmmm ( that sound you hear is a sigh of bliss over a well seasoned tasty good textured and nice looking dish.) Like I said, Mmmm.I sampled my friends crab cake. You could actually taste the crab. It was a full tasting counter to the nicely poached egg which was runny enough to make an unctuous sauce when combined with the Hollandaise. The Hollandaise itself was more tangy but we never did figure out what the flavor was. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.I sampled the cheesy has browns. The cheese is melted over a generous portion of potatoes. I 'm not sure it was the best textural pairing with the crab cakes and eggs ( a bit of green salad on the plate might have been better), but certainly good with other dishes.Coffee was hot, not too bitter and plentiful.Wait service was prompt, friendly and they did not hover. We did not have to ask for coffee refills; the staff was there to offer first.Quibbles: the room is noisy even when the place is not full. The spicy sauce on the chicken was a bit too vinegar-y standing alone although it meshed well when eaten with the other components. The specials were on a chalkboard, but not the prices.Cost $24 per person for entree, coffee , tax and tip. Plus meter parking on well- patrolled Lincoln Ave (Thanks to the manager who announced the coming of the meter maid)We will be back"
10/31/2014,20141031,4,4.16,"This place looks a little small and unassuming in a cool area of Lincoln Park. We were told the standard wait time of 45 minutes, while there were multiple tables clearing out. My friend went back to ask about the wait time, and it so happened that the really nice restaurant manager was right behind the hostess and pointed to an empty table up front. I got the Buffalo Shrimp Wrap with sweet potato fries and was surprised by the hefty portion. A really great deal for not too much money. The wrap was stuffed with greens, which I loved, and huge chunks of blue cheese, and just enough buffalo sauce. The shrimp was ginormous. The perfect lunch for wandering around Chicago."
11/1/2014,20141101,4,4.16,"I had my first experience at Batter and Berries today! While, I'm not typically one for sweet breakfast foods, I had to try the super French toast flight based on all of the reviews! The French toast was wonderful. I love that the French toast was the star and not the toppings. I hate when I order something and the toppings overwhelm the plate. My French toast was cooked to perfection. Crispy edges and chewy in the middle. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita omelet, and while he thought it was too much work to eat,( I guess one does not enjoy working for their food) the taste was amazing. Our server was super friendly and attentive. My only complaint is how crowded the space is. We were sat right in the front by the door and crowds of people were coming in, holding the door open, making it a little challenging to stay warm. I definitely recommended trying this place for breakfast!"
11/2/2014,20141102,1,4.15,"So not impressed. We heard great things about this place and the reviews were amazing. However, and this only applies to small percentage of people, me being one. They don't have any dairy free options except salad and fruit. We got in line, waited 15 mins to put our name in, used the restroom and since we had a 45 min wait decided to look at the menu. Every breakfast item is severed with cheesy hash browns. No substitutions. All the omelets have milk and cheese in them. No substitutions. At this point I ask the hostess whom I had to track down and get her to stand still for a min to ask her if they had and items that I could eat without dairy. She said ""Nope, wait, yes fruit and salad. We don't change items."" Really!!!! Most places go out of their way to accommodate a food allergy. They just said nope. They had gluten free, but not dairy free. Way to lose an entire group of lactose intolerant, dairy allergy and vegan people."
11/2/2014,20141102,2,4.15,"The French Toast was great. But everything else had too many weird seasoning, especially the homemade sausage, and they were under-cooked, yuk. The pancakes were doughy. I left with a really bad after taste. I was hoping for the best with this place but I so won't be going back. Oh I forgot, there were so many non work staff in and out of that kitchen, at one point I thought that's where the bathroom was located. Please stop the guy from doing silly chants and riddles!!! Highly disappointed."
11/9/2014,20141109,4,4.15,"Id give this place 5 stars for its French toast flight- super tasteful French toast with different flavors. I loved bongo room for its French toast but this will be my go to place now! The crab and shrimp eggs Benedict I ordered had awesome shrimp and crab cake but the eggs were over cooked. Didn't have that oozing yolk when I cut through them, which makes me give this place 4 stars. So not the best for eggs Benedict.The staff is super friendly and they ask you if u're eating there for the first time and walk you through the regular menu and specials with pictures off an iPad. Awesome touch I must say! Helps making the decision when u look at pictures on the menu. Keep up the service guys! I'll be going back whenever I feel like having French toast :)"
11/9/2014,20141109,5,4.15,"The best brunch ever!!! The blueberry waffles, French Toast Flight and crab/shrimp Benedict were SO delicious! At least an hour wait but totally worth it...Chef Rylon came by our table and when he saw we hadn't ordered the flight special French Toast, a blackberry cheesecake French Toast, he sent one over to point out our error in skipping the special.... He was SO RIGHT !!!"
11/10/2014,20141110,5,4.15,Very good food. Atmosphere was great. Server was very personable and had knowledge of the menu. I got the executive. Steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Eggs with the hollandaise sauce was so good i can't describe it in words. Before the check came i said i don't care what the bill is...It's worth it. Wish they had one on the south side. Will definitely be back.
11/11/2014,20141111,1,4.15,Simply horrible customer service. The young lady working the reservation both is totally unproffesional and rude.She was rude to us and other patrons as well. She even told the staff to make us wait to take our oder. The bus boy gave horrible service. The owner came out to speak with us and offered to give us a free French toast never received it. AT LEAST IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT ..please have good service.I could not enjoy the food for the horrible service we received....
11/11/2014,20141111,2,4.14,"After seeing the endless line day after day I figured it would be awesome. As I waited 30 minutes for a table and food was going by, my mouth was watering. It ended when we got our order. Nobody had the pancakes or French toast so can't review them, but we had the chicken and waffles, executive omelette, and the shrimp and crab Benedict. The shrimp and crab was just ok, was missing something a little bland. The eggs were cold and also just ok. The chicken was the same and waffle was way to sweet. The cheese hash browns were horrible. We figured it out. Everything is mass produced then re heated the cheese had hardened the eggs and waffle were cold and the centers never got warm. Would I eat here again, no. There are to many other choices. Besides long wait extremely loud and not the friendliest of staff."
11/15/2014,20141115,5,4.15,"I like to call myself a connoisseur of good food and, as far as breakfast goes, this is top notch. An elegant assortment of breakfast favorites and classy alternative combinations create a bombastic menu of great tasting food. Each dish I've had here has been exquisite and consistent to say the least. The french toast is of course what people come for, but with interchanging menu options (my favorite being the lobster benedict) and B&B staples like the delicious potatoes, you begin to find yourself making up reasons to return to try everything else they have to offer. The service is exceptional as well, though quite often you may experience a wait and calling ahead is not accepted, it is a testament to the delectable dishes you experience once inside. You are greeted with friendly wait staff, constantly checked on, and you will see the general manager at least 4 times before leaving so he can accommodate you in any way you need to ensure a great experience. Highly recommend."
11/16/2014,20141116,5,4.15,"Yummy Delicious. Great atmosphere! Cozy! Sundays R off dee chain, beware the wait is ReaL BUT it was worth it."
11/16/2014,20141116,4,4.15,"The food was freaking AMAZING. It was hot, flavorful and orgasmic. Yes, it was THAT good. I've had the Crab Cake Benedict, Lobster omelet, French Toast sampler (during different visits). I've NEVER been disappointed with the food. Another plus is that you're allowed to bring your own drink. Whether it be fresh juice or libations. My only two complaints are the wait times and price. Each time I've gone, I've had to wait an hour and the bill was $70 for two people. A couple of friends told me that they'd gone during the weekday and there was no wait at all. I guess it just depends on when you chose to go. If you don't mind the wait, I strongly suggest this place."
11/18/2014,20141118,3,4.14,"Nice experience.had the vanilla bean french toast.really nice and tasty with great tasting homemade maple butter.eggs were nice,fluffy and fresh.bacon tasted like it was from corn king very low quality and was cold,although they replaced it with warm bacon it was still dry and low quality.coffee was not very good either.like the special menu items.will try this place again and hopefully the next meat i get will be tasty to."
11/23/2014,20141123,5,4.15,Amazing experience here its a long wait buts its well worth this is my second time here and its is great everytime
11/30/2014,20141130,4,4.15,"Hubby and I decided to visit B&B on Saturday morning. We called ahead and the hostess said there was about a 20 minute wait. We arrived and the wait grew to one hour. What an hour that was watching the delicious looking plates being delivered to the 30 or so tables in the tiny restaurant.Finally, our named was called and we were seated at a small table in the back in view of the energetic and busy busy kitchen. Our waiter, who I was convinced moonlites as a standup comedian, approached our table in all of his surround sound splendor. He announced all of the specials, and we waited. The restaurant bustles with chatter and laughter. Soft house music played in the background.Hubby ordered the crawfish omelette, and I ordered the lobster Benedict. Both were amazing. We also ordered theft envy toast flight which was the best I've ever had. Overall,this was a wonderful dining experience, and I'll definitely be back. The only ""meh"" of the meal were the cheesy hash browns. They were average at best which was surprising because of the awesomeness of everything else."
11/30/2014,20141130,1,4.14,"The rudest hostess team I have encountered. Neither one responded to my ""good morning"". One was on the phone while seating guests the other simply walked away to what I learned was to figure out if there was an open table.  If that is how the owner wants his establishment represented, I will go some where else.  Hello is a simple word to say."
12/1/2014,20141201,5,4.14,"One of the best breakfast experiences I have ever had! Their French toast flight is a must have if you are a first timer; the chicken waffle with the homemade sauce is superb as well. The staff was professional, knowledgable and extremely courteous during my visit. My only complaint would be the size (capacity) of the place. Get their early on weekends if not hold out for during the week."
12/4/2014,20141204,5,4.14,"Absolutely amazing. My friend and I went right at the opening on a Sunday morning so we were able to avoid any crowd. He was visiting Chicago, and I'm so glad we decided to go here before he left. The waiter was kind and timely on the order and we were seated immediately. I had an egg white omelette with spinach, it was huge but delicious. My friend tried the chicken and waffles and love them. We both shared the french toast which was both of our favorite - a little too sweet to eat all of them . I would definitely come again and recommend to friends!"

12/8/2014,20141208,5,4.15,"I absolutely LOVED the food. I went with two girlfriends, and of course we sampled each other's food, and everything was delicious. The wait was a bit long because of the customers that were there and didn't want to leave after they finished their meal... But the wait was so worth it. The French toast were amazing, chicken and waffles amazing and most of all the customer service....was amazing. The owner/chef was so friendly that we took a picture with him. That's how much we enjoyed this place. I'm going back with other friends :-)"
12/10/2014,20141210,5,4.15,"One of my favorite brunch spots in Chicago. If you haven't been, you are seriously missing out! I've been here 3 times, and each time is just as good as the last! The first time I went I had the French toast flight. Ummm - best thing ever. The flight features a slice of blueberry, lemon, caramel, and strawberry french toast served with their maple butter. I tried to order maple syrup with it, but was told to try it first. Honestly, it is so sweet and delicious you don't even need anything extra.My second time I had the chicken and waffles. Everything is made so deliberately here so that the flavors combine in the perfect way in your mouth. I was instructed to take a bite of the sweet potato waffle, maple butter, and chicken with the hot sauce - the chicken has nutmeg in the batter that works well with the waffle and it literally is just mind blowing! Some of the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. Wow!On my most recent visit I ordered the lobster benedict (split the super french toast flight with my boyfriend though - addition of gingerbread toast). The lobster cakes were buttery and delicious, the hash brown were cheesy, and overall I left full and satisfied. I would highly recommend trying this place out if you live in Chicago or are just visiting. They get VERY busy on the weekends, so shoot for a weekday if you can. If not, get there early or be prepared to wait."
12/11/2014,20141211,5,4.15,I'm a breakfast foodie and this is one of my favorites! I haven't been disappointed yet and I've worked my way around almost the entire menu. They have special items from time to time that aren't on the menu and those have been awesome! My go to is the Cluck and Goof aka Chicken and waffles. It's a chicken infused sweet potato waffle with a chicken breast on the side (makes me hungry just writing about it.) Yum!!Pros: Best brunch ever! BYOBCons: Wait time can get long sometimes so don't wait until you're starving to go.
12/11/2014,20141211,4,4.15,"Ok I've come enough times that I can now give an adequate review. I should start with the caveat that I am a vegan that occasionally eats seafood. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. So for me there isn't a lot on the menu I can try. Most people go for French Toast but i don't like sweets. There is a veggie omelet but i find that the specials are always beyond amazing!!! The specials are usually seafood so that's the way I go. My favorite thing was the lobster Omelet when they had it. My mom said her Pork was very tasty, cooked perfecrly, and juicy...she was smitten. My little brother said the service is great, the presentation is amazing, nice portions for the price, seasoned well, and the menu is diverse. The chef came out and talked to customers."
12/13/2014,20141213,5,4.15,The food is so good! We also had a very attentive waiter who also kept us entertained with random but witty riddles. Highly recommended!
12/14/2014,20141214,4,4.15,"This was our first attempt to dine at Batter and Berries. Friendly servers, Caramel French toast was amazing and the environment was fun (one server in particular did a hilarious birthday dance for another customer). I was expecting more from the chicken and waffles (the butter on the waffles saved it for me). Overall we had a great experience! We will be back."
12/15/2014,20141215,5,4.15,Everything about my dining experience was great! The hostess Neki was very friendly. She offered an accurate approximate wait time and went over the daily special with me while I waited to be sat. My server was Tusimi. Although I was pretty set on what I was planning on ordering he gave me a tour of the menu and I actually changed my order based on his suggestion! He was very helpful and offered up a few jokes while I was waiting for my food. The food was excellent! by far one of the best breakfast joints I've visited in the city. Between the friendly and fun service and the wonderful food I'll definitely be back for me.
12/22/2014,20141222,5,4.15,"I had a reconstructed lobster omelet that blew my mind. They did not skimp on the lobster, worth every penny! Their cheesy hash browns are equally delicious."
12/24/2014,20141224,5,4.15,"This by far has become my most favorite place to eat breakfast. Because it is THAT amazing, you have to prepare for the long line, and the long wait. The food is absolutely worth it though! My brother came to visit from Dallas, so I decided to take him to brunch. I was with a group of 4 people so it took about 30 minutes to be seated. We ordered our food, and in less than 10 minutes, the food came out hot, fresh, and amazing. I'm really big on drinking tea as well, and the tea at this restaurant is also great. I ordered a Banana-nut waffle, with the cheesy hash browns. It was perfection! It was so good that two days later, my brother and cousin went back for a second helping."
12/25/2014,20141225,5,4.16,"This place is one of a kind! Had the Fried chicken w sausage gravy on top, cheesy hash browns, eggs over medium w hot sauce & a side of Texas white toast w caramel butter... Unreal! Food came in less than ten minutes and that was with a packed house on Xmas!"
12/26/2014,20141226,5,4.16,Simply put: this is one of thee best places to eat in Chicago. The menu is so full of flavor and creative design but the best part is the prices. My recommendations: 1) French Toast Flight. 2) Buffalo Shrimp Wrap. 3) Pork Chop Executive.
12/28/2014,20141228,4,4.16,"4.5! Pretty much the best breakfast of life ! I had the chicken and waffles & it was out of this world. The down side about this place is the LONG WAIT! And it's so tiny . If you don't wana wait , be there when thy open ."
12/28/2014,20141228,1,4.15,"The service is the worst. Be prepared to wait for upwards of an hour and half, with the potential of your table being taken by another party. The waiters were rude and the hostess was disrespectful. This has happened to my party multiple times. The food was great but the hassle to get a table was a nightmare. Not only was my request to speak with management denied, but our waiter kept getting ruder and ruder. Your best bet is to take your business to Hash House A Go Go. The service and food is divine. PS: after every trip to B&B I take my business to Hash House because I refuse to support a business that doesn't not appreciate my business."
12/28/2014,20141228,1,4.15,They have by far the WORSE AND UNPROFESSIONAL customer service! You walk in to a hostess with a terrible attitude! We were told that we were about to be seated only to have our seats given away! When asked to talk to the manager she told us that she will get him when she gets ready! That surely sparked a fused! However when the manager finally came he said we were wrong and said he didn't care if we left! After driving and hour to get there and waiting a hour and a half to be seated! Wow!!! It is also so small in there and people are standing over you while you eat your food! The waiting room is a joke! The waiters bumping into you and each other! It is a fire hazard! Again... DO NOT GO!!! I'm only giving one star because I have to in order to write this review
12/30/2014,20141230,4,4.15,"Went on a Friday for brunch with a couple of out of town friends about 2 weeks ago. We were recommended to come here from 2 our friends, and it is this cute random little yellow awning place. We parked in the neighborhood nearby so we wouldn't have to pay for parking.The wait time they told us would be around 45 minutes, but we just walked around the block, and we were seated in about 20-25 minutes at the communal table in the middle with high top chairs. We loved the communal table, because you could see what others ordered, and we got to chatting with a nice man there who had been there multiple times, and had tried EVERYTHING on the menu except for the chicken and waffles (the sweet potato ones everyone talks about). So, he had some great advice to give on what to order.But, all the cheers goes to the waiter. He is one of the few waiters I've met that is honest. He told me he was in the 2% of people who didn't actually like the chicken and sweet potato waffle, and I was amazed because he totally convinced me not to get it, so I went for the spinach omelette which was AMAZING. Because we were sitting at the communal table, the nice man I mentioned earlier actually offered me some of his sweet potato waffle. Yup, just a stranger I just met. Seriously, the communal table was great. I agreed with the waiter in that he felt there was too many flavors competing. I did feel like there was a TON of nutmeg in the sweet potato waffle that kind of overpowered everything. So I think a lot of people like the chicken and waffles, but just ask yourself first if you like nutmeg. And, if you like sweet potatoes, obviously.Our waiter recommended the dish with biscuits and gravy, but something about how their oven stopped working and they couldn't make any more biscuits. :( sadness. Both my friends ordered the french toast flight and you can bet I tried theirs. AMAZING! Really amazing flavors and very delicious. And yup, no need for syrup. They both loved it. Really friendly atmosphere!"
12/30/2014,20141230,5,4.15,"Does this place need any more rave than it already does?? Always my go-to breakfast spot and they are always packed! Can you blame myself and everyone else in the Chicagoland area? Friendly staff, great service, BYOB and amazing food. It's definitely a must try."
1/2/2015,20150102,5,4.15,"Food was great! We ordered The Flight, The Executive, & Strawberry french toast.. Service was great! Be sure to arrive early because it gets VERY PACKED. I'll definitely be back. I'm sold on this place."
1/3/2015,20150103,5,4.15,Geez!!! Love!!! This place was the highlight of my recent trip back to Chicago. Yes-you will wait. Yes-probably for a long time BUT...it's definitely worth it!! By far one of the most amazing breakfast experiences I've ever had. We ordered everything pretty much and sampled each others plates. I had the lobster omelet which had to have had an entire lobster in it...no joke. The portions are quite generous (I say this as a Texas girl). Heaven!! I also ordered the Strawberry French toast (don't judge me). Both were uber-delicious and beautifully presented within 8-10 min. Other insanely good bites while there:Sweet potato waffle w/chicken Champagne French ToastShrimp Alfredo OmeletNot a place to sit down and chat...especially on the first visit...we were too busy oooh and ahhhing over our plates. Enjoy!
1/4/2015,20150104,4,4.15,"Went here yesterday for my birthday brunch. I've been wanting to go here for a long time because everyone raves about the food here. I just hate that it's in Lakeview. And in general I try to stay away from Lakeview unless I absolutely need to be there. But I made the trek anyway and it was worth it. Be warned it is byob so dont leave your bottle at home. If you do though the 7 eleven down the street sells booze. And you'll have time to get said bottle because your wait will be no less than 30 minutes. But I think that's the usual for most super popular brunch spots. Once we got seated everything went super smoothly. We ordered the crab cakes w/ poached eggs, the lobster spinach omelette and the french toast flight. Everything was amazing. Seriously this was the best brunch I've had in a really long time if ever. I'm only deducting a star because our food was a bit cold and the space was small and we were sat by the front door. However I would definitely make the trip back to Lakeview for their french toast. Just maybe once all the snow melts."
1/4/2015,20150104,5,4.15,This place is always busy so be sure to put your name on the seating list as soon as you arrive. The waiting area is in the middle of the resturant. The owner is always on site greeting customers. The specials are not on the menu yet on the chalk board near the ceiling. The waitress was very polite and showed pictures of every meal on her tablet before you order. Once you order you don't wait long for your food. The food looks just like the pictures. They food is very very good. The toast taste wonderful. I tried almost everything. This is a very nice place to eat. It's worth the wait in line.
1/4/2015,20150104,5,4.15,Two words to describe B&B? Yes. Lawd. The chicken & waffles and fish & chips are amazing. Go there - you will not be sorry!
1/4/2015,20150104,5,4.15,"Love, love, love this place! I always get the caramel french toast which is awesome! I'm one of those people who likes my food hot so I learned after a few times to tell them to bring my French Toast out the second it is done. Also i ask for syrup when I order. Some of the waiters try to guilt you into not using syrup but I know what I like. Anyway I ask in advance because otherwise my food gets cold while they run around looking for the syrup. This place is byob for champagne which a lot of people take advantage of. It's always packed and sometimes there is a long wait but it's totally worth the wait!"
1/5/2015,20150105,5,4.16,The sweet potato waffles and fried chicken are the best! Making a beeline to B and B on our next trip to Chicago. 5 star all the way!
1/6/2015,20150106,5,4.16,"The best brunch I've had in Chicago thus far! I had the shrimp alfredo omelet with bacon and cheese crusted hash browns and it was amazing! So tasty, the shrimps were huge and the homemade alfredo sauce was perfect! Our server was charming, we came on Christmas eve, so there was no wait and it's byob! I can't wait to go back! Loved it!"
1/7/2015,20150107,5,4.16,"Definitely one of the best places in Chicago. If you come later in the day be prepared to wait for a little but it's well worth it! The chef is very friendly and extremely innovative. People rave about the French toast flight and the chicken and waffles but it's all amazing! My only complaint is that it is too close to my apartment so I'm compelled to frequent. It also has a great south side atmosphere, which is refreshing since it is engulfed by a pretentious neighborhood. So if there is a bad review on here it is probably from a rich mom that went on a girls brunch date and wanted to feel like she was superior. GO TO BATTER & BERRIES!"
1/8/2015,20150108,4,4.16,"The wait was extreme...1 1/2 hour on a Saturday. However, the food was excellent! It was also served very quick!!! I would definitely come back again."
1/10/2015,20150110,5,4.16,"How is it acceptable and legal for food to taste good enough for it to become habitual! I've traveled the world for a living and have eaten at some of the most amazing restaurants for breakfast/brunch...NOTHING COMES CLOSE! Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING is delicious! I'm sure their non -breakfast food is equally amazing but I'm so stuck on the breakfast food , addictive! You have to get the super flight (regardless of the weekly french toast feature), the chicken sausage, cheesy hash,omelets...all of it should be criminal it's that good! TIME TO EXPAND"
1/10/2015,20150110,4,4.16,"We chose this place on a whim this morning. We started with the Super French Toast Flight (includes a piece of the daily special french toast as well as strawberry, blueberry, lemon, and caramel). Today it was Godiva liqueur, which was my least favorite of the 5. Very good overall, though I found it curious that it was served much more lukewarm than warm/hot. My husband got the chicken and waffles and I had simple scrambled eggs and a side of the cheese hash browns (which were served cold, though I got an immediate replacement when I asked). Friendly, quick service, more than decently good food overall. I'd stick with the specials and the things they hype up like the chicken and waffles to get the most bang for your buck (and tastebuds!!)ETA: Apparently I need to clarify that the well-deserved 4 stars are for the overall experience. I'd think that any rational, reasonable restaurant patron would be able to differentiate between a tiny mistake (ie cold hash browns) and a bad experience where I wouldn't highly recommend the restaurant. Fixed, small mistakes are overlooked in my book."
1/11/2015,20150111,4,4.16,Delicious restaurant!!! Be prepare to wait but its worth it. Had the breakfast wrap and was full to a coma lol. Owner is really sweet and personable. Came around to check up on us! Nice neighborhood breakfast/brunch spot!
1/12/2015,20150112,5,4.16,"We walked in around 10am on Sunday AM and was told it was about 30 min for an individual table. We chose to sit at the communal table since it was immediate seating. Come hungry! I ordered the sweet potato waffle (which is sprinkled with chicken chunks and light covered with confectioner's sugar, YUM). Note an additional fried chicken breast comes on top drizzled with hot sauce. My bestie ordered the Biscuits & Gravy, they cooked our eggs just as we'd asked- over easy. The menu is pretty heavy, but was absolutely delicious. The service is fantastic, we were greeted in a timely fashion by our waiter, we placed our order, dove into conversation, then our food showed up nice and hot. We barely spoke much as we were too busy stuffing our faces, and washing it down with pretty decent coffee if you like it strong. Took a minute to get the check, but an overall satisfying experience and I will certainly be back to try a ham dish as I saw the kitchen dishing out quite a few of those! IMPORTANT: Free street parking on Sundays!"
1/14/2015,20150114,4,4.16,"The food at Batter & Berries is awesome, especially the special Crab Cake Benedict that was a special the day I went - it was delicious, not full of other stuff that distracted from the crab. I also had the French Toast Flight - much above average french toast in 4 different flavors. The flavors are so good you don't even need the syrup, but can get some if you want. If you can make time for the long wait, it's worth it. I'd love to see them move to a bigger space, especially something with a better set up for parties waiting for tables."
1/14/2015,20150114,4,4.16,"I love this place. Any time that I have friends or colleagues visit from out of town, I usually take them here! (UNLESS, they are on a diet.) The food is absolutely delicious, and often times decadent.  Their savory dishes are rich and their sweet dishes are richly sweet! It may be a bit much if you're used to typical breakfast/brunch food. But that's what makes this place popular. It's not supposed to be typical. In a city like Chicago that is so segregated, it's nice to have this racially diverse spot in the heart of Lincoln Park!"
1/15/2015,20150115,4,4.16,"This place is delicious! Loved the mimosa idea. The food was scrumptious. i had the pancakes and my wife had the lobster omelet. We both ate it to the last drop. It's crowded, but the servers were friendly. It's a bit pricey."
1/15/2015,20150115,5,4.16,"Batters and Berries is simply delicious! Everything is homemade, and makes your mouth water just by looking at it. I had the crab cakes Benedict and honestly I can't stop dreaming about it! Plus the waiting staff is phenomenal, my particular sever could sell me on anything. Definitely recommend!!!"
1/18/2015,20150118,5,4.16,"I do NOT like to wait - and typically don't BUT it was my bestie's birthday so wait I did and ... this time it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT... AND I would wait again! The staff was friendly, the food came quick, hot and was out of this world delicious!"
1/18/2015,20150118,1,4.16,"I hadn't been in quite some time and was excited to return. I was very disheartening and I was truly disappointed that a very unfair seating policy had been instituted. I arrived at 1:30 and put my name on the list. The hostess quoted me 30 minutes for a wait time. I went back to my car and 15 minutes later I sent my son in to inquire about the wait from there. The hostess then told him to come back in another 30 minutes. I came in to double check and the hostess confirmed that is exactly what she told him. I asked why the wait time had increased and was told that people who were on the list from earlier in the day who left and decided to come back must be seated 1st. So you can put your name on the list, run several errands and return and bump others. I've always been a fan of awesome black-owned gems. But it's those black-owned gems that don't survive because of poor customer service practices and inconsistent policies. In the case a representative from the company would like to refute this, the 2 hostesses on duty January 18th, 2015 were Nicki (sp) and Tamia. Nicki is the hostess that explained the new policy to me."
1/19/2015,20150119,5,4.16,Great experience here today. Long wait but totally worth it. Original recipes and quality ingredients. Definitely coming back. Manager was professional and genuinely cared about our experience and the quality of the food.
1/23/2015,20150123,4,4.16,"I'm giving 4 stars based on the size of the restaurant and the hour wait to even get a table. Service was great and my caramel french toast was even better, I just wish they had a bigger restaurant or even a new location. I plan on returning!"
1/24/2015,20150124,2,4.15,"i got a special, which had lobster in it. it was pretty mediocre, but it also had a lobster shell piece in it. when i told the waitress, she was like ""oh"" and did nothing. i emailed management and they were like ""oh"" and also did nothing.wish i loved this place, since its POC owned and really cute, but i think they're overpriced, for sure."
1/25/2015,20150125,2,4.15,"We went here this morning for my birthday. My fiancé had heard good things and after looking it up on here we decided it was a good choice. First off, the design of the restaurant is terrible. The waiting space is in the middle of the dining area and the bathrooms are 4 feet from the tables. No one wants to sit next to a bathroom. We waited for about 50 mins, even after arriving at 2. Once seated we ordered quickly. She wanted to try the chicken and waffles and I got the crab cake Benedict. Everyone raves about the French toast but I would rather make it than pay 11 bucks for bread. The chicken and waffles was disappointing. The flavors were just weird, and because the waffle was more dry and cakey it was like eating sweet potato bread. The chicken was over cooked and dry. The Benedict was good but nothing to rave about. We were still eating after closing time, so the server who clearly wanted to push people out, dropped off the check as we were still eating and after one min came back to open the bill to see if we had payed yet. Restaurants tend to forget people base their expectations not only on food but service. We won't be back here. The food is mediocre and the service was sub par."
1/25/2015,20150125,5,4.15,"I went here for my birthday came around 9 and we waited to be seated about 30 min, once seated we were serviced promptly and food came quickly...I order the crab cake benedict DELICIOUS...My mom and sister ordered the french toast which they said was AMAZING!!! Wonderful atmosphere....worth the wait!!"
1/28/2015,20150128,1,4.15,I have been here twice. The first time we were with a large group and everything went great and I liked the food. Months later I went back the second time I went with my girlfriend and they had terrible customer service. No one would even look at me so I could ask them how long the wait was. After 20 mintues the host told me 1 hour and 30 minutes. I was shocked. No one was waiting for a table and there was open seats for 2. Needless to say I will never go back there and neither will any of my friends.
1/28/2015,20150128,4,4.15,"This place was pretty delicious! I'll start by saying be prepared to wait about 2 hours---no joke...and when you wait you NEED to wait inside or they'll call over your name--they will not text you or call you or come outside when they're busy. It is BYOB which is pretty epic. I went with 2 other friends and we killed 4 bottles of champagne while we were eating. The staff was very friendly, the food was great (I forgot what I ordered) but it was real good! I'll definitely come back sometime and probably come by earlier so I don't wait 2 hours."
1/28/2015,20150128,5,4.15,Going to be brief. The chef asks that you try your food without condiments first. The chef knows... ENJOY!
1/30/2015,20150130,3,4.15,"There was a lot of word of mouth buzz around this place, so I decided to give them a try. Almost hidden away in the eclectic Lincoln Park neighborhood, a bright yellow awning above the door marked the spot. Ample pay box street parking available. Upon entering, we were greeted by a less than enthusiastic hostess. She didn't speak, no smile and directed us to a table by saying "" right there"" with a head nod. This wasn't a good first impression, especially from a customer who just drove from the western suburbs to patronize. The space was cramped and the place was packed. The decor reminded me of something you might see in a coffee shop on a college campus. Bright and inviting. I really liked the first come first serve community table that was situated in the center of the restaurant. Specials were written on chalkboard placed high on the wall near the ceiling. Service was average. Although the waitstaff was being courteous by refilling coffee and or water, it was getting annoying because of the small space. We were seated on a wall near the door so there seemed to always be someone walking by.Now on to the food. I had the Apple Belgigue (waffle with caramelized apples) and the cheesey hashbrowns. The food was good pure and simple. My only critique about the Apple Belgigue is the sweetness. It was almost overly sweet, especially with syrup and the homemade butter. I also didn't enjoy the caramelized apples on the waffle, so I just removed them. The hashbrowns were excellent. All and all, the food made up for the negative first impression but I would like to go back and give them a try on another day when there is less of a crowd."
2/1/2015,20150201,5,4.15,"I was looking up this place to send to a friend and was so surprised to not find a 5-star rating! Let me be clear - Batter and Berries changed my life. I was a simple tourist visiting Chicago from Berkeley, and after B&B - I became a happier (and probably 2 lbs heavier) foodie. Yes, I've had a fair share of glorious SF brunch encounters, but I still think most fondly about my brunch at this place! So we came here at about 10 AM on a Sunday morning. It was PACKED, but my amazing friends conceded to my crazy suggestion of staying for the 2 hour wait to try out this place. So we wrote our name down, and walked around and explored town. Since we were tourists, just walking around the residential neighborhood was nice but this might not be as fun for locals. I suggest just going to the nearby Starbucks. Anyways, our party of 6 (also explains the 2 hours wait in this small restaurant) ordered lots of food! My ALL-TIME-FAVORITE dish ever in the history of brunches was the sweet potato waffle topped with good ol' Southern style fried chicken. My friend and I still have nostalgic moments where we talk about the unique flavors of the herby chicken alongside the chewy and crispy sweetness of the waffle. *Pro tip: add some hot sauce with your maple syrup, a brilliant combination I learned about from Berkeley's 900 Grayson (which also has excellent chicken 'n waffles if you are in the area). SO DELISH AND SO DIFFERENT.The two things I love finding in my dishes. After having been to multiple brunch spots throughout northern California, I have yet to find a dish so perfect and quintessentially brunch-y. Other than this, they had on-point egg dishes and very yummy (but a tad too sweet) french toast. Come here and SHARE your dishes!! All the dishes are super cool and big, so it's better to share one dish per two people and then you get to try more things! Also, they have a 'Bring your own' wine service, which we didn't know about but that would have been a great concept to take advantage of! #TLDR: yes, small place but SO WORTH THE WAIT for all my brunch foodies out there, says a brunch lover miles away craving those chicken 'n waffles right about now."
2/1/2015,20150201,5,4.15,One of the best breakfast restaurants I have ever been to. Seriously worth spending a few hours digging my car out of this Chicago winter storm to be here. I had Banana Puddin French Toast and Chicken and Waffles. Can't emphasize enough how much I love this food. Yummmmmmmmm
2/2/2015,20150202,5,4.15,This place is on point! Whoo hoo can't wait to go back!
2/4/2015,20150204,5,4.15,"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch. I highly recommend coming in a weekday or after 1pm weekday to beat the crowd and easier to find parking. I've been here few times and the service was attentive. There was a time when the entree took about 20min to come out. The manager apologized and waived the entree, which was a nice gesture and I was patiently waiting. Here are all the dishes that i've personally ordered over few visit. The waiter will present the daily special with photos from the ipad, which i think it's very neat. The entree may seem pricey $12 - $18, but the seafood portion is very generous and you pay for what you get.Flight of special french toast - It comes with 5 different types of french toast flavor that is in season. Generally, they serve blueberry, banana/pecan (fav), strawberry, and etc. The french toast in here is crispy and i can eat it without maple syrup. It's not the  typical french toast in a breakfast joint. I recommend ordering the french toast as a dessert and share it. Crab cake benedict: Daily special which is not on the menu. I've ordered this dish twice on 2 separate occasion, because it's that amazing. I've been to the east coast which crab cake is literally chunks of crab meat. This place does not disappoint and you will taste chunks of crab meat! chicken and waffle: i'm not a big fan and didnt finish this. I didn't like the savory waffle made from sweet potatoe. It's not my palette to eat savory waffle. The fried chicken was made from white meat and it was dry. It was quite miserable trying to finish this entree. Total dislike.Buffalo shrimp wrap - comes with large shrimp (generous portion of LARGE shrimp). Deconstructed steak: It looks better than what it is. The steak was mediocre and dry. Go for the seafood entree!Entree I would love to try in the future: lobster omelette, scallop omelete lobster benedict. By the way, it's BYOB!"
2/6/2015,20150206,5,4.15,"This is by far my favorite breakfast/ brunch place! The food is AMAZING!! Fast and friendly service. The specials change weekly, but if you dine during the banana pudding French toast, I highly recommend it."
2/8/2015,20150208,3,4.15,"I really want to give this place a better review... I do... but I didn't have the best experience there. When we arrived, we were expecting a pretty bad wait time - and were told it would likely be about 2 hours. That's fine, we had a group of 4 people and it was a busy time on a Sunday. We tried calling from across the street (we were waiting at Atlas Brewery) and the hostess hung up on us twice. We decided to head on over and were told to wait in the ""front area."" There were three hostesses who sat there on their phones and talked to each other while the wait staff worked like crazy to get the tables ready. The front table was cleared off and one of the hostesses gave us a ""shoo"" motion saying, ""You can sit there.""We sat down and looked around, wondering where the menus were - but there were none. Normally... a hostess would seat you... and bring you the menus? When our waitress approached our table, she saw we didn't have them and walked back to the stand, ""Uh.. guys.. my table doesn't have menus."" One rolled her eyes and brought them over. Our waitress seemed a bit stressed out but explained the menu (none of us had been there) and made suggestions. Given what I've mentioned before, I would normally give this place a 1-2, but the food made up for it. My girlfriend and I split two dishes: the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof), which was quite good, a sweet potato waffle (stuffed with chicken) and a piece of fried chicken with nutmeg hot sauce on it. The only thing I found upsetting was that there was no syrup for the chicken and waffles. (it's all infused in the butter) and began tasting a little dry. The second dish was the french toast flight (we opted for the ""super flight"" which included the chocolate strawberry champagne toast as well) - the french toast was delicious, very flavorful and cooked very well.Overall, I'd say it was an interesting experience, but the welcoming staff really needs to get it's act together."
2/8/2015,20150208,4,4.15,"We went here on a weekday around 11:15 am. We got seated within 5-minutes. I was surprised how busy it got 15-minutes later. The line was out the door. We had their two specials that day. I ordered the shrimp which was tossed in light fluffy eggs and came with some wonderfully seasoned, tender potatoes. The shrimp was huge and fresh, but it was overcooked so it was not tender. This is the reason for my 4-star review. The customer service is excellent. They take very good care of you. The Manager (possibly Owner) came to our table to ask us ""how is everything?"" I was honest and told him my shrimp was overcooked, but otherwise everything else was fantastic! He offered to replace my meal, but I was more than 50% done with my food, so I said ""No thanks."" However, this will not prevent us from returning. We really, really like this place. Service is worthy of 5-stars. We spent $35 (excluding tax and tip), but we only had water (no coffee or juice). It was a cold winter day when we hit up this joint, but the space heater near the table kept us toasty warm. It was loud and got crowded quickly. We were glad that we arrived early enough to beat the lunch crowd. My niece enjoyed her meal immensely. This area is ""Pay to Park,"" but we got lucky -- a spot almost in front of the restaurant. TIP: Arrive before the crazy lunch crowds. Enjoy a nice lunch or super early breakfast. The tables get turned over quickly. Of course, the faster the tables turn-over the more money they make. We never felt rushed or pressured to leave despite how crowded it got. I run everyday at 4 am, so getting to Batter & Berries super early works perfectly for me. I prefer being here when it is a bit more quiet and less crowded. The vibe here is very friendly, and the Owners/Managers are very hospitable. It's a great place for people watching. They have a large table in the center with tall stools which gives the feel of a large community table. We will definitely return again. If you have never been here before, but have this restaurant on your bucket list for 2015, hit it up."
2/8/2015,20150208,2,4.15,"I DO NOT recommend this place. My friend is visiting town so I wanted something to eat that was fast and not so far from where we are in Lincoln Park so this was it. We got there and immediately were greeted by a very sassy hostess who didn't eve look at me at any moment and told us, quote, ""you can go seat in the waiting area over there cause you gotta wait at least 45 min"". So we go to the waiting area, honestly 4 tables can be arranged there and wait time would have been less. What a waste of useful space right in the middle of a restaurant. We wait and wait and wait. Finally we are seated right next to the bathroom door so we asked to be moved to another table. They did. My impression was that they don't really take care of who they hire as servers in this place. Service really sucks. There were 3 girls behind the hostess podium just chit chatting as one of them was sitting in a chair with customers sitting on that table. Buzz boys and waitresses walking up and down and standing around looking at each other and having conversations next to customers. It seemed to us like the servers literally go out of bed and went straight to work. Nobody working there seemed to think that their image and the way they present to the customers is how successful their business can be. I mean one of the 3 hostesses was sitting at a table with customers eating on that table as she chit chatted with the other two about people walking in and out. That's not ok. Management in this place, they must get these issues together and train their staff on proper serving manners. I have a lot of friends in the service industry and anywhere else that would be unacceptable. And now to the food. The heater in there was warmer than our food was. Food was tasteless. I can see this place being busy while people want to still go try the new place around but once it's been there for a bit, if not taken care of their service/ staffing issues, I see them closing down sooner than they expected. I will not be going back to his place."
2/10/2015,20150210,5,4.15,"Let's be real here. There really is not a better breakfast option in the Lincoln Park area. I consider myself the Tim Gunn to the breakfast eateries world, harshly judging with just a hint of sass....and this place, like a good Michael Scott ""that's what she said"", always leaves me satisfied and smiling.This place brings actual art and craft to breakfast, creating exquisite plates that one would only imagine to see on the deepest depths of Pinterest, but you can get it here, for very reasonable prices.They're famous for their French toast flight (best French toast I've ever had) so be sure to check that out.Hurry in, and make all your Instagram followers jealous after you inevitably post that picture of your meal to your profile."
2/11/2015,20150211,3,4.15,"I love the food here- the French toast is amazing- so I had to give it a 3, HOWEVER, the hostesses have much to be desired. When we got there, we were not greeted or spoken to, granted it was very busy, but I had to ask the hostess to put our names in and asked how long the wait would be. She said 35-45 minutes (for 2 ppl) which was fine with us. 40 minutes later my fiancé went up to ask if they knew how long it would be until we were seated and the hostess rudely said ""I already told you it would be 40-45 minutes."" She acted like she had no time for this, or it was an inconvenience to her when IT IS HER JOB. When we got seated, about 15 minutes later, she said our names to call us up for our table, didn't make eye contact or say a word and motioned with a point of s finger a table for us to sit at. Still without speaking a word to us. When she brought us our menus I made a point of saying thank you, and still no word from her. This started our experience here off extremely poorly. I wish I would've gotten her name to call and complain.However, most of the staff seems great and very friendly. Our wait staff has always been great here. I hesitated to write a review because I really love batter and berries, but I would be embarrassed to bring out of town friends here based on the welcome staffs attitude and behavior."
2/12/2015,20150212,4,4.15,"Amazing French toast here. I would give this place 5 stars except they wouldn't let me order a plain cheese omelette. Thought that was kinda strange, but other wise everything is very good. And they play disco house!"
2/14/2015,20150214,5,4.15,"The wait was 2 hours, but worth it .The caviar seafood omelet was so good. Will definitely come back."
2/14/2015,20150214,2,4.15,"In town visiting from Texas and my friends raved about this place, but I was underwhelmed by the menu. The food was just ok. I had a deconstructed spinach and mushroom omelet and it was so bland. The cheesy hash browns were good, but not amazing. The prices were great, the atmosphere is very cool, but it didn't live up to the hype. Maybe my expectations were too high."
2/16/2015,20150216,4,4.15,"The cluck and goufre is culinary genius, and I'm always impressed by the lower carb breakfast offerings (steak and eggs, creative ommlettes).Service is always great, service staff are very knowledgeable about the dishes and specials. The owner/chef had come out on multiple occasions just to walk around and check on tables. Get here early, before 10am. Cramped space and long waits hold this place back from 5 stars."
2/17/2015,20150217,5,4.15,"You must get the chicken and waffles here. Amazing! Worth the long wait, believe me! Menu has great savory and sweet options, like the French toast flights!"
2/19/2015,20150219,5,4.15,"My only hang up is the looooong wait time. The food is great, I've visited B&B twice and it only gets better, the sweet potato waffle & fried chicken combo is delicious, the waffle is filled with chicken pieces and there is no need for syrup, it is served with their specialty butter. The fried chicken is great and not overly seasoned. The French toast flight is great as a sharable brunch appetizer. The pork chop executive is delicious as well and a rather large portion (I couldn't finish it). The restaurant is rather small but i think this allows for a more intimate dining experience. I would recommend anyone go at least once to try the food, I feel you won't be disappointed but don't go when you are hungry or when it is cold because the wait time is outrageous!"
2/22/2015,20150222,4,4.15,"AMAZING! This breakfast was the best breakfast I think I've ever ever had EVER. Why the 4 stars you're asking? Well the ambiance is frankly not great. We stopped in at around 1:30ish on Sunday and it was SLAMMED! We were told the wait was about an hour and a half for a table for two. We put our name on the list and actually waited, but we left and came back because the space is too crowded to hang out in. It's a really really small restaurant which makes it feel very crowded, uncomfortable and loud. It was hard to even speak to my husband it was so loud. Also it wasn't the cleanest place I've been too, but considering its tiny and busy I'm assuming it's just very difficult to keep it squeaky clean during a Sunday rush. They seated us at a table which was right next to the restroom, which I thought was kinda gross. People walked in and out consistently and left the door open which faced right into the dining room and, lucky me, opened right up in front of our table. I kept praying no one passed gas or fell ill while we were eating breakfast. I really have to say that the placement of the tables right by the restroom like that needs to be rethought because that alone made me feel as if I wouldn't want to go back. I ordered the salmon executive, which was a cut of salmon with a lemon sauce with a side of scrambled eggs and cheddar hash browns. My husband had a ham and bacon omelette and then we ordered the peanut butter French toast to share. The second I took one bite of the salmon I knew that they could have seated me inside the restroom and it would have been worth it! Every single item served to us was perfection. I will definitely go back and maybe next time request another table."
2/24/2015,20150224,3,4.15,"One of my favorite breakfast places honestly. Today we left because after the host telling us it would be 35 minutes we waited, and waited. All the while while about 5 different tables got seated that were not even on the list...we had been next on the list the whole time we were waiting. I would have said something but the host kept disappearing. Very disappointing."
2/24/2015,20150224,2,4.14,"This was my sister and I first time here and it was not impressive. First, trying to get in door to get on the list was inconveniencing. Everyone trying to get in and out one door is ridiculous. When were about to be seated, one of the male employees yelled across the room, ""keep the door closed because when you eat, you won't like it either"". Here there's no standing room. After being seated with everyone at this tall bar in the middle of the restaurant, they were playing House mixes on a Sunday for music. It was so loud and our conversation wasn't private. Everyone was chaotic. When our food came, I asked the waitress for syrup and she got mad informing me my butter should be enough. I had to I form her it wasn't and she finally brought it to me. When I asked for ketchup, they bought mini cups to us. I couldnt believe this place. It such an understatement. Last but not least the wait staff wait for you to finish eating, literally, so they can take you plates immediately. When I had one bite left the guy actually waited and got upset we were still in conversation. Rushing your patrons out is not good idea and it's pricey. I will not return."
2/25/2015,20150225,5,4.14,"This place is awesome the food was amazing I had the chicken and waffles !!! I was a little skeptical when they brought the food out and I saw hot sauce!!! And no syrup... But the hostess guided me on how to obtain the full enjoyment of my first bite... The waffle, maple butter and chicken all in one bite !!! And it was awesome also the hostess was very informative about the menu , and even at the end as we were leaving the chief come over for our opinion of the food overall the place was great... I felt horrible because we didn't leave a tip for her my bestie paid for us this round and she didn't have cash on her... That's why I had to take time out of my day to write this review of this place because it was really awesome and I will be back !!! With a double tip !!!!"
2/26/2015,20150226,5,4.15,Excellent service. The owner/chef greeted us and ensured our satisfaction which was a refreshing reprieve. He really cares about his work and it exudes through the polite and professional staff. I was fully welcomed and informed of the options available and the food was delicious! I can't wait to return.
3/1/2015,20150301,4,4.15,"This is a great little breakfast place. The ambiance and decor is nothing to rave about but the food and service makes up for that!My friends and I shared the super french toast flight, which comes with a salted caramel (my favorite), strawberry, blueberry, lemon and french toast special which happened to be trix cereal. We also shared the crab cake benedict which was very good. Our waitress was extremely friendly, and despite the large crowds we did not have to wait for a table. At the time I dined here (August 2014) they did not have a liquor license and you were allowed to bring your own alcohol (think mimosas!) so maybe call ahead and see what is going on with their alcohol now."
3/1/2015,20150301,2,4.14,"Everyone has been telling me about this place so I decided to give it a try. I was not impressed during my visit. Let's start with the wait, most restaurants have waits so I'm not going to ding them for that. However, if your party is less than 5, they will not call you so you have to wait outside in the COLD or in their OVERCROWDED ""wait area."" Is my business less valuable because I didn't bring four friends along???? Fine, don't let this ruin it Tiffany, everyone says it's worth it. We sit and wait about 10 minutes for our waiter. My daughter's food came out rather quickly, however, mine took a little longer. My daughter had the banana waffle which I enjoyed. I had the chicken and sweet potato waffle which I did not enjoy. The chicken was flavorful but I didn't care for the waffle. So based on having to wait 40 min in the cold, 10 minutes to see a waiter and a $40 breakfast that was ok at best, I'm not really dying to go back. Maybe in the summer when I have four of my friends with me so they can call us when our table is ready."
3/3/2015,20150303,4,4.14,"On weekends, expect a wait of up to an hour, could be shorter depending on the time you go and how many are in your party. There's not much room to wait inside, so there's always a lot of people standing outside. Your entire party must be present before they'll seat you. Once you're seated, the servers are quick at getting your drinks and explaining the specials, but not the quick that makes you feel rushed just to get you in and out. More of an attentive, ""how can we make your stay more comfortable"" sort of feel. The kitchen is visible, which I always enjoy being the glorified germaphobe I've been decorated to be ;). The daily specials are posted overhead on chalkboards for your convenience. The restaurant is also BYOB. The French toast flight is delightful. It includes a sample of each of the four different kinds of french toast. The super flight throws in a sample of the flavor of the week. Don't be afraid to try one of the specials. This place does an excellent job of combining flavors for an awesome, flavorful experience."
3/4/2015,20150304,5,4.14,"I absolutely loved everything about this restaurant, homemade food, awesome energy from the servers and amazing food. I will visit each and every time I'm in the area!!!"
3/5/2015,20150305,4,4.14,Good breakfast had lobster benidict was good not best I ever had but then again I'm comparing to spot in new Orleans I had them but overall great place for breakfast never been on weekend I hear it gets really packed .
3/5/2015,20150305,1,4.14,"Hi....as I sit here in your establishment I can not believe what I see...as me and my friend are looking over your menu I see one of your employee's with head phones on and taking orders!!! That is so disrespectful while the guest is trying to order their food. I hope u have a talk to your hostess, waiters, and staff!! They need to be retrained...other than that the food is FABULOUS!!!"
3/7/2015,20150307,5,4.14,Today was my first visit here. Me and my family were not disappointed! As soon as we walked in the greetings were so warm and friendly! We were seated immediately because we got there early LOL! Everything we ordered was so DELICIOUS! Our waiter was so nice and the owner is hilarious. They made us feel so comfortable and can't wait to go back!
3/8/2015,20150308,5,4.14,Had a heavenly brunch here and highly recommend it. The French toast flight is a must! The staff was very sweet and attentive too. On my list for my next Chicago visit.
3/9/2015,20150309,4,4.14,"This experience was really interesting and cool at the same time. This was my first time eating at this spot and I was definitely happy I tried it out. We waited about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The service was fast and efficient. We ordered the Waffles and chicken. The portion size is decent and filling. The orange juice is $4 dollars, I think I will stick to water or coffee next time. Other than that this place rocks."
3/13/2015,20150313,5,4.14,"What a wonderful dining experience for breakfast. The menu is absolutely amazing and very unique. The service is super fast and friendly and the place was packed with some very happy people.You have to try the French Toast Super Flight and the crab omlete! Also, the chicken sausage is the best I've ever had.Management is engaged and ensures that every customer is well-beyond satisfied and certain to return. This is a ""must go"" eatery!"
3/13/2015,20150313,5,4.14,"Quick, friendly & delicious. The sweet potato waffle & fried chicken is perfect. Has the right amount of sweet & perfect touch of hot sauce, impressive. Shrimp & crab Benedict disappeared before I could try it so it must have been on point. Will be back for sure"
3/14/2015,20150314,3,4.14,"Came here at 2:30pm on a Friday and there was no wait. (We learned the lesson from coming unsuccessfully during rush hour on a weekend). The french toast flight was great, but not as amazing as everyone else made it out to be. The (four half) slices of bread are definitely on the smaller side, which at $11 something, doesn't make it a good deal. The waffle and gough (?), basically chicken and waffles, was very mediocre. The waffle is a sweet potato waffle, which I personally found to be too sweet. The chicken had good seasoning, but was way too dry (and small!)My verdict: decent food, but definitely not worth any wait over 30 min.This place is byob, which may interest some."
3/14/2015,20150314,5,4.14,"This should be your first stop for brunch when you're in the city. Excellent wait staff, incredible food, and its byob."

3/15/2015,20150315,5,4.14,Simple. AMAZING food! Omg! The food was very tasty. I had the crab cake omelette and I must say it was absolutely delicious. I also had the the Carmel French toast! It was like heaven lol! Never had anything like that before. My best friend and I was fighting over the last piece that's how good is was. If you are ever up north please try this place you will not be disappointed. Get there early it takes 25-30 minutes to be seated.

3/20/2015,20150320,4,4.14,"If this bright little breakfast place were a microcosm of the world, I'd be over the moon. Smiling people and french toast flights. Genius.My friend and I arrived around 9am on a Wednesday and had a precisely 3 second wait for a table. I hear that weekend mornings aren't quite as snappy. If you work a weird schedule, check this place out on a weekday.The hostess and wait staff were all very friendly, attentive, and helpful. Water was refilled super frequently, and an appetizing picture of each special was displayed on a tablet as our waitress described them. Hooray for technology.Coffee was good, but not particularly mindblowing. I picked a crabcake benedict and my friend went for the french toast superflight. Food arrived FASTLY (that's quicker than quickly). My only complaint was that our food wasn't very hot when it arrived. But it was pretty tasty! The french toast flight was interesting for sure. I don't think I'll make another trip to Chicago just to eat here, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely pop in for brunch again."
3/20/2015,20150320,2,4.13,"Hurts my heart to downgrade but I've had, at this point, a half-dozen meh-to-outright bad experiences here. I think they are honestly ""victims"" of their own success. They were so good when they first opened and the word of mouth spread so fast that they really are unable to keep up quality with the volume of guests they're receiving. That's the only thing I can figure for food that isn't freshly made or served hot, or served well. I'll just give one specific that is indicative of the entire problem: Last time I was there I had crab cake Benedict special. I was surprised when it came out about 4 minutes after I ordered it. Not only that, but it came out cold. Now, you'd think that if an order came up that fast, it would be PIPING hot. Nope, it was cold. Which led me to believe one thing: It hadn't been made-to-order. Tasting it confirmed that.I discreetly asked the server about this and he was honest enough to admit that several other people had complained about the same thing (coldness, staleness) and that because of the volume, no, everything was not made-to-order. He was also kind enough to remove it from the bill. So you have servers like that who are professional and honest. But I've also had other experiences there with servers who were totally AWOL, unprofessional and unhelpful.The admission that my entree was not freshly made was disturbing, to say the least. I don't think you can really cut corners with breakfast food, and especially not with something like eggs benedict. You have lost the quality war when you start cutting corners like that.I'm also incredibly put off by the fact that they seem to spend an inordinate amount of time pandering to celebrities. It's not celebrities who have made this place as popular as it is -- it's ""regular"" people like me who went back and told all their friends, co-workers, relatives, etc how good it was. I have to wonder if the ""celebrities"" are the ones getting the fresh food while the rest of us are getting the cold, stale and/or undercooked food. Hmmm. Well, I wish Batter and Berries all the very best, but until I hear that there's a return to the original quality that made this place so special, I'll be saving my money."

3/22/2015,20150322,4,4.13,"I was recommended to Batter & Berries by a fabulous Chicagoin and I was not disappointed. I had the Strawberry French Toast, and it is very flavorful, no need to add syrup because it holds its own. My french toast was accompanied by the chicken sausage, the waitress warned me that the chicken sausage was sweet, well it was. It was not a good combo with my already sweet french toast.On the flip side, the crab omelet is AMAZING!! It is stuffed with gouda and SO much crab. Topped with zucchini and squash, the flavors meshed together so well.I enjoyed Batter and Berries, but come prepared to wait. Our hour wait turned into one hour and a half."
3/22/2015,20150322,4,4.13,"My first experience was the best and that is why I still come. Since then, I've had an average experience here. The food is really good.

They should consider expanding or creating a RSVP list. Overall, you should try them out if you want to experience some Good Chicago Food. The food will make you forget that you had to wait 2 hours to be seated."
3/22/2015,20150322,1,4.13,"RUDE STAFF. INSANE WAIT. STAY AWAY. I can understand the concept of having to wait for brunch on a weekend, but waiting 2 hours and watching the hostess seat other parties clearly behind us in the line was just ridiculous. We waited 2 HOURS and finally just left. Such a rude staff. I will never ever go back to this place, I don't care how good the French Toast is. Save your time, money, energy and go somewhere else."
3/22/2015,20150322,3,4.13,Good food but terrible service when trying to get seated. We went for Sunday brunch and of course it was packed but we were willing to wait. Fast forward to over an HOUR later when we went to check on our table we were told we received a text a while back however that was not the case. We were then asked if we gave the correct number which made us give the ultimate stone face. Then we were promised the next available table...commence to watching folks get seated ahead of us. So then she comes to us and asks if we were the party of three...well we were not three people so the discovery that there were two parties with the same name and apparently there was no party of three ever it was just another party of two. At this point it is like an episode of hunger games but we have waited too long to quit. The hostesses were definitely in over their heads...so then FINALLY we got a table. It was like we won the lottery for dumb people who stay too long in line at a restaurant. So after we got seated we were immediately given drinks which helped to stave off the momentary fainting spell I was going to have. Thankfully we had an all star waiter (Tim) who quickly came over and took our full order (we studied in the time before we sat down) and made sure we were taken care of. The good was good and hot but I just could not get past the whole ridiculous seating situation. It just seemed like the ladies at the front had issues maintaining and establishing control.

3/23/2015,20150323,2,4.12,"Went here with my family for my birthday breakfast. I heard such rave reviews, we decided to make the drive from the south suburbs to try this restaurant. Though the food is delicious. It is not worth the wait (hour + wait) The atmosphere is not ideal for a good dining experience. People are literally waiting in groves. Standing right next to you while you eat. Elbow to elbow. Hostesses are rude, not a smile to be seen. The food is not piping hot, but it comes out faster than Quick Silver. I had the Lobster Benedict. Hubby had steak and eggs. Our 2 children had french toast and pancakes. Everything for the most part was al a cart...except the hash browns.   After waiting for over an hour, they rush you out. You haven't even seen the bottom of your plate and there is the check on your table.Food is good. Dining experience is horrible. Not worth an $80 tab. I tried it, but I will not make it top priority to come again. Sorry. I really wanted to like it."
3/25/2015,20150325,5,4.12,This place is awesome. Its cozy but accommodating. I had the lobster and shrimp Benedict. It was so fresh and tasty. My husband had the French toast flight. It was very good as well. The service is fast and friendly. I would definitely visit this place again
3/26/2015,20150326,2,4.12,Not worth the hype. $13 omelet that was VERY oily and had some weird veggie paste on top. The server was sweet but the guy who sat us was kind of rude. I would be bummed if I waited for an hour to go here!
3/27/2015,20150327,5,4.12,"This was a beautiful restaurant. From the moment we walked in the vibe was great. When we sat down, our server Tim, was there to help us and we got water and great seats. He let us know all the specials of the day and was ready to take our order in a timely fashion. We sat down at 2:25 and got our food at 2:35. One may think that because it was given to us so quickly that it wasn't good or fresh, but quite the contrary. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. You could taste all of the seasonings, and being a college student, this was a total change from DHall food. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the kids strawberry french toast and fajita omelet. The french toast was the bomb dot com and the waffle was actually sweet potato flavored and had chicken in it. You do not need syrup to enjoy this meal, that's how flavorful it is. All in all, this is a great place, and I will continue to go here when I come to chi-town to visit."
3/28/2015,20150328,5,4.12,This place was amazing! The line was out the door and there was a 45 minute wait for two people. I was spending the day in the city so we figured we would wait. Half hour later my name was called. I got the banana nut waffle and it was really good! It was the perfect size and the vanilla drizzle they put over it was icing on the cake.! The staff was super friendly too! It's also a BYOB which we didn't know!! Great food! Definitely coming back! It was worth the wait.
3/28/2015,20150328,5,4.12,"Best brunch ever. Wait is well managed, and well worth it. My kids love their strawberry French toast and I love their lobster Benedict. Yummmm."
3/29/2015,20150329,1,4.12,I had a terrible experience with their hostess. She was mean and rude. I erased my old long review and I regret it. I was bullied by someone who works there or knows someone who works there. They sent me an awful and offensive message.
3/31/2015,20150331,2,4.12,"We went to check out this place on a weekday afternoon. Not much of a wait. Service was pretty slow and not very attentive. We ordered the seafood Benedict, the biscuits and gravy, and the chicken and waffles. The Benedict was basically an over cooked poached egg on a dried out seafood patty. I don't think there was even an English muffin underneath. The potatoes were very greasy, but decent. I was really disappointedChicken and waffles had a dried out chicken breast that was probably pounded and double fried. The waffle was okay. They forgot to bring any syrup, so we had to wait for someone to come around to get it. Took around 5-7 minutes to finally get someone's attention. The biscuits were probably the best thing we had. But really just average. Gravy was pretty thin though. The space was kind of dark and felt a little dirty. Overall I don't understand why this place gets such top reviews. We really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work out for us. Service was below average and the food was dried out and just not that good. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but we will not be going back."
4/1/2015,20150401,2,4.11,"Disclaimer: this is all based on my attempt to have brunch on a Sunday, so not sure if things are different on other, less busy days. Take with a grain of salt.Attempted to get brunch last Saturday around 1pm. This was my experience...I was completely taken aback by the rudeness of the hostesses when I entered to inquire about wait time. I wasn't greeted, or welcomed. They just stared at me, with a look of disgust and annoyance in their eyes. The restaurant was set to close around 3pm, and given I had arrived 2 hours prior to that, they flippantly scrolled through an iPad, then said the wait was 2 hours, 45 minutes. The answer is annoying since it was clearly after they were set to close. And there were maybe 5-8 other people standing around and waiting, so where was this coming from?So, I didn't wait, nor will I ever attempt to. If this is how they greet and treat first time guests (with rudeness and flagrant dishonesty), I don't see why I'd spend those nearly-three-hours here when I can go to any of the great brunch places around time. Including the ones that sensibly offer reservations!The food could be amazing, but the the first sip of service left a distinctly bad taste in my mouth."
4/1/2015,20150401,5,4.11,"I've been 3 times before and this time I had my cousin from Atlanta who never ate any type of waffle. We had a group of 4 so we ordered Chicken & Goufe, French toast Super Flight, Traditional w/ Chicken/apple sausage, Blue Crab Omelet, and a Steak Omelet.My cousin says she can never have another waffle unless it's this sweet potato infused with chunks of chicken breast(no syrup needed). This chicken and waffle will be the best one you ""EVER"" had hands down. I don't normally spring for French toast but they out did themselves with the flight where you receive a half slice of all available French toast.On to the omelet. The crab smelled and tasted fresh. I would definitely have this the next time if it wasn't for a limited time. This is not your imitation crab made with fish, this is the real deal!The potatoes and eggs are just potatoes and eggs. I can't expect them to be great at everything, that would be selfish. Although, you do get a lot. The homemade chicken/apple sausage was super good. I've had chicken sausage before but the flavor in this one was kickin' like Bruce Lee. Please! Please! Please go eat here you won't be disappointed!"
4/2/2015,20150402,3,4.11,"My overall first impression of this place is, meh. A rating of 2 1/2 is more accurate versus a solid 3 stars. I've actually had a more satisfying breakfast experience at IHOP. This is yet another brunch spot in the city with some buzz. Sure enough, when we got there, the place was packed. The wait was actually not too bad at 10-15 minutes or so. We went during a weekday-- typical brunch/lunch hour. The food arrived sooner than anticipated. Looked great, but tasted just so-so, from the coffee, to the hash-browns to the deconstructed omelet and pancakes I ordered. Maybe I ordered the wrong things? The ambience and décor were.. homey, I think that is what they were going for, but something seemed lacking there as well."
4/3/2015,20150403,4,4.11,"This place was delicious! The Super Flight was fun to try. It was a taste of a variety of the French Toast that they serve. Absolutely delicious! My favorite was the lemon French Toast. I also had the steak and eggs. My steak was nice and tender, smothered in gravy and mushrooms. Yes! Definitely understand what all the hype was! Will return!"
4/3/2015,20150403,5,4.11,"Came out to this Lincoln Park spot on Good Friday with my mother for brunch. We waited nearly an hour for a table, but it was more than worth it. We tried the Supreme French Toast Flight, the Cluck-n-Gaufre, with a side of the homemade chicken sausage and egg whites with cheddar cheese. Everything from the food to the service was excellent. The waitress asked us which french toast was our favorite and we honestly could not decide - they were all amazing. They also serve Le Colombe coffee which was my first time and it tasted great. Can't wait to come back and try some of their omelettes!"
4/6/2015,20150406,4,4.11,"Just went here this morning as it was nearby and had great yelp reviews. I also remember seeing it on check please so I had to check it out. We were the first ones in there and ordered the special ham and bacon omelet with a super special mushroom sauce as our server said it was her 2nd favorite dish. We also ordered the Chicago's best and check please sweet potatoe and chicken waffles with fried chicken.The food came out quick, and let me tell you, the chicken and waffles were the best I've ever had. The reason for the 1 star off was the special didn't have any of the ""super awesome mushroom sauce"" on it. They happen to be out, and just served it up without it anyways. This made it a very bland, not worth 17 dollars, not worth 10 dollars, not worth 7 dollars meal. However the chicken and waffles I will gladly pay whatever amount you want! You call it! If they opened a chicken place, they could sell the crap outta that fried chicken! All in all, I will be back and I will re-review!"
4/7/2015,20150407,5,4.11,"Their food is the bomb, their customer service was great what more can you ask for. I wish their chefs can come to my house every morning and cook for me lol"
4/10/2015,20150410,1,4.11,"After waiting over 30 minutes for table we were anticipating an extraordinary breakfast. Unfortunately, the food was inedible and the prices was too expensive for the quality of food served. We will not be going back."
4/12/2015,20150412,4,4.11,"Heard so many good things about this place and I must say things went smoothly for me. Went on a Sunday morning only had to wait about 5minutes. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials. Even though I had my mind set up on what I wanted (after viewing pictures on here) she still broke it down for me and the hubby.I ordered the Super French Toast Flight (the special was the butterscotch rum) and had the Crab Cake Benedict, hubby had the Salmon Omelet. The food was delicious. The only problem I had was that it was barely warm I think they got his order wrong cause they brought out the lobster omelet (he's allergic to shellfish) and had to remake his and they just let mine sit while his were being remade!Overall it was a good experience and we planned on coming back with the in-laws. I just want my food to be hot next time!"
4/13/2015,20150413,5,4.11,Crazy long wait but it's well worth it! Had the caramel French toast and pork bacon. Prices are good too
4/13/2015,20150413,5,4.11,"Go on a workday during brunch hours or after lunch to avoid the long wait. Food is flavorful. I had the special ""pork chop executive"" and the Mrs, the deconstructed salmon omelette. Plus we shared a caramel candied walnut French toast (no syrup required). If I had to critique one thing, I'd say, avoid the coffee and BYOB."
4/13/2015,20150413,1,4.11,"I was in chicago visiting friends and family. I came with four friends and this was one place we decided on. We attempted to visit this restaurant twice in three days. We drove almost forty minutes for the nasty hostess to tell us it would be almost three hours for us to be seated. Three hours would have put us past the closing time of the restaurant. Not to mention people who were on the list received text messages when a table became available. They had people who hadn't even shown up when they received the text and they held the tables for them. I would think after five or so minutes if someone hadn't shown up, next person in line would be seated. This wasn't the case at all. Needless to say we went right down the street, got serviced right away and will never return batter and berries!"
4/14/2015,20150414,4,4.11,"Soooo yummy!I had been telling my mom about this place for awhile and finally we made it. It took me awhile to write this review, actually I thought I already did.. hmmmmThis place is small inside, but very cute. We did have to wait out for what felt like forever. There is no correct time to come here and beat the crowds.  Just be patient and wait. Luckily, we were seated along the wall. Since it is small in here, it can easily get congested. There is also a large table in the middle, which holds a lot of people, but I personally would not bring a big group due to the wait. It is also very loud in here, which is something I did not like.However, this rating is for the food. I had the banana foster waffles and MMMM MMM it was good. My mom had the french toast and she really enjoyed it. It looks very sweet, but she said it was just the right amount. That was the same for mine. I at least recommend to try it once. As far as a breakfast spot to go and have a conversation, I wouldn't recommend, you wont be able to hear!"
4/15/2015,20150415,4,4.11,"I went for my birthday in January 2015 for brunch. The staff was friendly and prompt and the menu was a great variety of savory and sweet dishes. We definitely took advantage of the BYOB and brought a few bottles of champagne. The line is usually pretty crazy for brunch so expect a wait when you get there, but it's worth it. The French toast flight is a must for your first time."
4/18/2015,20150418,4,4.11,Delicious! My friend and I stopped by for brunch on a Saturday around 9 and didn't have to wait too long. In fact we had just enough time to grab some champagne at the 711 next door for our mimosas. I had biscuits and gravy and my friend ordered the chicken and waffles; both were excellent. Our waiter was extremely friendly and the service was quick and efficient. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the neighborhood.
4/18/2015,20150418,5,4.11,Be prepared how beloved and popular this place is. I went on a Thursday at about 10am and I was lucky to get a seat at the community table. The French toast flight was awesome and everything else looked equally scrumptious!
4/19/2015,20150419,5,4.11,From the zesty chicken and waffles to the lobster/spinach everything had such rich flavor!!! Omg! def coming back! The French toast flight were orgasmic!!
4/19/2015,20150419,5,4.11,There's always a wait but it's well worth it because the food is amazing. My husband always orders either the strawberry or blueberry french toast & I absolutely love their deconstructed omelets.The chef & owner Derek Rylan always has a smile on his face. As a reminder make sure to plan enough time for breakfast because you will have to wait to be seated.
4/25/2015,20150425,5,4.11,Shrimp and crab Benedict was excellent Cluck and gauf was also greatGreat serviceWe were here at 7:58am and sat right down
4/26/2015,20150426,3,4.11,"The French toast flight is a fun concept, but some slices were much better than others. The blueberry and strawberry were quite yummy, but the lemon curd and sweet potato were meh...missing something. My friend ordered the shrimp Alfredo omelet, which he did not realize was ""deconstructed."" The Alfredo sauce was tasty, and the shrimp was big, but overall it needed salt. This place had been on my brunch list after seeing an episode of ""Check, Please!"" The episode said it was great for sweet brunches -- wish I had remembered to tell my friend that!"
4/26/2015,20150426,3,4.11,Food was good-had the lemon French Toast-but the service was weak. They don't have diet coke.
4/26/2015,20150426,5,4.11,"I have never been somewhere like this! The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD INCREDIBLE! The service is great, and environment is artsy and interesting. The only thing that needs any altering is how scary loud the music is. I couldn't talk to our server or my family and it was 11am. But I can't wait to come back!!!"
4/28/2015,20150428,5,4.11,"After hearing so many great things about Batter & Berries,(and the mishap of experiencing bad service at another popular restaurant)I decided to try it for myself. ""To my wonderful surprise, it was as good as it was hyped up to be!""""The Buckwheat pancakes w/chicken sausages were excellent!"" To top off the buttery rich flavor of the pancakes, I added fresh fruit as a topping, and it wouldn't be me without a little bit of whipped cream..lol.The restaurant was clean, bright in coloring and the atmosphere was very pleasant and welcoming. This should have been the 1st choice of the day. I will definitely revisit, but next time I will explore more into their extensive menu. ""I will be back very soon..!"""
4/28/2015,20150428,5,4.11,"POSSIBLY my all time favorite place in Chicago!! The chef is a genius, the staff is first class. Cant recommend this place enough"
4/29/2015,20150429,5,4.11,"Phenomenal customer service.No wait. I went on a Friday morning. We had the flight of french toast as an app.Lobster omelet.Absolutely delicious. This place is byob. Can't wait to go back and, try other things!"
4/30/2015,20150430,1,4.11,Worst service! We were charged $9 for an espresso drink. The manager came over and expressed that he had been a Starbucks manger and that that was the proper charge. He kept arguing with us until I finally just agreed to pay the bill. This is not to mention that the food was completely bland. Don't go here unless you want to waste your money on tasteless food and espresso drinks that cost more than your meal.
5/1/2015,20150501,5,4.11,"Excellent breakfast options and service is really quick. Right now, it's my favorite breakfast option in the city."
5/2/2015,20150502,2,4.11,"I don't get what all the hype is about. We waited for over an hour, the hostess was very rude and aside from the sweet waiter we had everyone else acted like they were doing us such a big favor. The crowd was rowdy and loud. Not a relaxing or nice environment for weekend brunch. So disappointed because the photos on yelp looked amazing and the reviews were generous.FOOD: coffee- (3/5) Meh.french toast flight- (3/5) Cool concept and presentation. It just didn't taste as good as it looked.crab & shrimp benedict- (3/5) The crab & shrimp benedict was ok, but the cheesy hash browns everyone was raving about were gross and looked like they had been reheated.buckwheat pancakes (2/5)- Very dry."
5/2/2015,20150502,5,4.11,Awesome people and love the food! I rarely give five stars but my experience here was amazing!
5/2/2015,20150502,5,4.11,"This is a fabulous restaurant! The food was on point and perfect! We had the porkchop executive, super flight French toast, and deconstructed steak omelet. As soon as we sat down and ordered the food came right away. There's definitely a long wait, but with the service and good food we had, it was well worth it. What made an even greater experience was the waiter we had. Super funny guy. Made the entire time at the restaurant fun. Thanks Tusiime!"
5/8/2015,20150508,5,4.11,Outstanding service...from the greeting at the door to the knowledgable wait staff. And the food? Well worth the 40min drive!

5/9/2015,20150509,4,4.11,"My husband, 3 friends, a child, and I were came here for breakfast last Sunday. The restaurant was busy and we feared we'd have a super long wait. 30 minutes wasn't too bad of a wait. The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious! I can see why the wait was so long. All of us enjoyed our meal: my husband loved the pork sausages (seem homemade) so much we tried going back today but the wait was 90 minutes so we went somewhere else. The salmon omelet was delicious as was the crab cake benedict. My only complaint is that the place is too popular with long waits. I hope the restaurant expands to other locations or in their current place. We're definitely returning. 8:00 AM next time."
5/10/2015,20150510,2,4.11,1. 40 minute wait that was actually an hour and 20. 2. Poached egg that was raw.3. Second try at poached egg that was closer to fully boiled4. Bland shrimp and crab Benedict. 5. Pleasant server.
5/11/2015,20150511,4,4.11,"I have been hearing people rave about this place for breakfast for a while now. I went on a Tuesday around 11 and didn't have to wait at all. We were seated and served coffee quickly. Our waiter was superb with his service and very knowledgeable in terms of the menu and suggestions on what to eat. I had the pork chop and my mom had the steak. Both were seasoned well and were very tender as well. On my next visit, I hope to try the french toast that everyone raves about. Street parking was readily available at that time - which was a bonus!"
5/13/2015,20150513,5,4.11,"Great food , fast and friendly food so good make you want to bring your mama . Not only was the French toast of every flavor great but the shrimp and crab Benedict fabulous"
5/14/2015,20150514,5,4.11,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!Saw my friend's pictures of the French toast and lobster omelet, and I was like ""I have to go to this place.""Eventually after three weeks waiting, I went and it was AMAZING!!! We were told the waiting would be about an hour and half. Even though we came with the preparation of waiting, an hour and half still sounded crazy. We still decided to wait and walked around in the community (the Japanese stationary store in the corner is cute and good for killing time btw). And surprisingly, I got the message half an hour later saying that we got a table! Lucky! (It's really convenient that you left your phone number there and they would text you when your table would be ready) We got the super flight of French toast! Great concept but as others said, some are better than others. Blueberry one is definitely our favorite! So yum! We also got the lobster omelet! GREATTT! The server was really pleasant and funny haha. Loved him! The place is pretty crowdy and probably a little bit loud, but the food is amazing! Definitely want to go back!"
5/15/2015,20150515,5,4.11,I don't think I can express how much I love the food at the restaurant. I especially enjoy the Carmel French toast and apple sausage!!!  Try to go as early as possible ... I've waited up to 2 hours for a seat.
5/16/2015,20150516,5,4.11,"Enough said...don't walk, run to this spot! The bacon was perfect, the cheesy hash browns were yummy. You can believe the hype!"
5/16/2015,20150516,5,4.11,We travel a lot and there are few places like it around the country if you are visiting sit at the community table and mingle. Food is amazing and their staff and atmosphere matches.
5/16/2015,20150516,2,4.11,"Food: 5 starsHostess/Wait: 0 starsI have been to Batter & Berries three times and LOVE the food, but the service prior to actually being seated is a nightmare. 1st Experience: Told a 20 minute wait, and we were seated in roughly 25 minutes. Good first experience. 2nd Experience: Told a 50 minute wait, which turned into a 2.5 hour wait. Tables for 4 would open up, and they'd ask ""are there any parties of 3 or 4 here?"" and would seat those tables ahead of the parties of 2, even though we were ahead of them on the wait list. Also, after 50 minutes we returned, told it was another 45 minutes, so we left again, then went back, and were told it would still be another 35-45 minute wait. Seriously...? During the waits my friend and I went to a bar, so at that point we were tipsy and just wanted food so we kept waiting. 3rd Experience: Told a 50 minute wait, so we left to go grab some beers down the street. 10 minutes later I get a text that my table was ready, but I was just served a full beer. My party heads back about 20 minutes after that text, and was yelled at by the hostess for not returning when they texted. We then had to wait another 10 minutes to be seated.I understand it's hard to give 100% accurate wait times, but you should not be that far off. If it wasn't for the amazing food (pancakes!) I would not return. Also as other reviews have noted, the restaurant isn't huge and it is a loud environment."
5/18/2015,20150518,5,4.11,"I'd never had chicken and waffles before, but WOW theirs were great! I ordered bacon and that was great and so were my sunny side up eggs.The waiter refilled my water all the time, which was nice. This place is not your regular ""quite breakfast place."" They match the lively atmosphere and hustle and bustle with up-beat instrumental music. Great place to go if you're with a friend or a group."
5/18/2015,20150518,5,4.11,"Came here on a trip to Chicago. I got the chicken and waffles, which were really different than what I'm used to at home but good. The waffle was almost like pumpkin cake, but with some chicken inside, and fried chicken with hot sauce on the side. Service was really fast, both me and the table next to me got our food in under 5 min. The place was full on a Monday morning so I'd guess weekends are crazy."
5/19/2015,20150519,5,4.11,"Holy good god this place is good! Fast service, the food is insanely delicious!!! Props to the chef! Pricey but that's Chicago!"
5/19/2015,20150519,4,4.11,"Nice to see diversity especially on the North side! We were impressed to see how busy it was on a Tuesday at 11am. On to the review. For people who really like French toast, this seems to be your place. I had the crab cake and shrimp Benedict. I took a chance as I'm not a big crab cake person. It was ok. Slightly fishy but then I'm pretty particular when it comes to that. Also, they use those tiny shrimp. I would have preferred the prawn cut up in pieces. More flavor. The potatoes were good. Cheesy. Needed a little salt tho. I don't know what they cook their food in, but it left a shiny residue on our plates which l, to me, isn't terribly clean tasting. Our waitron was fine, if a little solemn but I made her laugh and she was fine. Service is blazingly fast! The food came out quite quickly. Must be those mini iPads they use. One suggestion for them: they have a waiting area plopped in the middle of the tables. I think they're missing out on more revenue since it's so crowded. Put those stone benches outside and more tables inside."
5/20/2015,20150520,1,4.11,"I will never come here or recommend this place. I live and love Lincoln Park but this place needs to check themselves. Extremely rude and terrible staff. I also was contacted by someone who may work there or knows someone who works there and their message was EXTREMELY vulgar, harsh, and offensive. They did not like my initial review I posted about being mistreated by the hostess when I asked her simple questions regarding wait times and help with our parking situation during a rainstorm. Get over it B&B, I am not eating there and I don't think that your staff is nice. No one should subject themselves to mean employees just for chicken and waffles. Lincoln Park is a neighborhood filled with amazing brunch spots with sometimes disgruntled employees but who are at the very least professional and competent."
5/21/2015,20150521,5,4.11,"OMG - incredible restaurant on Lincoln Avenue in the Lakeview/Lincoln Park area. I had seen several reviews on this place and decided I would need to try it. So glad I did.A buddy and I went to this restaurant on a Monday shortly after 11am. The place was already packed. We were able to find couple of seats at the communal table. Yessica was our server and she went over the extensive menu with us. Then departed so we can review the menu ... again and again. Everything looked so good.When Yessica came back, we were finally ready to order. My friend had ordered the Steak Omelet and I had ordered the Strawberry French Toast with sides of bacon and the Cheese Hash Brown. The decor is very bright with the yellow walls, sunshine from the large windows and the paintings hanging throughout the restaurant. There are various sizes of tables throughout this wooden floor restaurant. The volume was not as bad as it could have. The food runner had brought us the meals within an appropriate amount of time. As many people that were there, the food could have taken longer. Kudos to the kitchen staff!!Regarding the food... incredible. Everything was done perfectly including the service.As we were eating, more and more people to being seated and waiting to be seated.Get there early - enjoy a great neighborhood restaurant. Looking forward to go back."
5/21/2015,20150521,4,4.11,This was such a quiet day when we came in. The food was great and our server was really sweet. They have a french toast flight.I repeat:THEY HAVE A FRENCH. TOAST. FLIGHT.you're welcome.
5/22/2015,20150522,5,4.11,"Really good food for a really good price! Waiter was friendly and service was really fast, definitely recommend this place. Got the executive and the waffle sampler, definitely try out both!"
5/23/2015,20150523,5,4.11,"This place was fantastic! We had to wait a half hour and it was extremely loud in there that I could barely hear myself talk, but the food was absolutely delicious. I got the deconstructed chicken fajita omelette and it was one of the best omelettes I've ever had! I tried a bite of my friends French toast and that was also delicious. Doesn't have great ambiance but fantastic food."
5/24/2015,20150524,5,4.11,"It was busy and loud, with terrific food. At 10:30 on a Wednesday morning there was still a wait for a table. For good reason.We had efficient friendly service and comfortable table spacing, so we didn't have to hear everyone else's conversation. I had absolutely awesome blueberry French toast. With a side of good thick bacon. Ladies with me had the French toast medely - half a slice each of blueberry, strawberry, lemon, and caramel. They were served on a long plate which allowed each of them to be separate from the others. Well received.The full menu had lots of interesting choices. We'll go back, but I don't expect to try to fight weekend morning crowds."
5/24/2015,20150524,4,4.11,"I did not experience a long wait time and the service was quick and friendly. I got the Chicken and Waffle, and it was definitely a new take the flavor. The maple butter is one of my favorite. All the food that came out of the kitchen looked delicious and I loved the chefs suggestions on how to eat the food."
5/25/2015,20150525,5,4.12,Fun atmosphere - plan to wait at least 45 min on the weekend. Good solid coffee. Best French Toast- we ordered the flight and you get 1 slice of each flavor good for sharing. Don't ask for syrup. Each piece is to be eaten as prepared. The omelets are deconstructed so there is cheese in the omelet and the meat and veggies come on the top. Their cheesy hashbrowns with a side is hot sauce take it to a new level. I can't wait to come back!!
5/25/2015,20150525,4,4.12,"Great brunch option and like all the other popular brunch spots, you'll have a bit of a wait. Our original wait was around 1 hr and 45 minutes but they managed to seat us around an hour.Luckily, if you put your name and number down, they'll send you a text when ready so you can walk around the town a bit and waste time. The whole place is small, loud, colorful and everyone looked like they were having a great time. I had two in my party and we were seated at the 'communal table' in the middle of the room which was cool. There was enough room on the table so you didn't feel like you were right up on the next party. We ended up ordering their Cluck-n-gaufre (Chicken and Waffles) and Lobster/Spinach omelette which I basically inhaled. The chicken and waffles actually came with bits of chicken cooked into the waffle with another piece of chicken on the side. My friend had this and said it was amazing so I definitely will be trying it next time. My lobster and spinach omelette was actually better than I expected. No one element of the dish was overpowering (i.e. too much salt, weird lobster taste) and while it was a tiny bit runny, I thoroughly enjoyed it along with my side of pancakes. We also had tea with our meal. They give you a sort of sampler board with little shakers of tea from which you can smell and see which one you want. After you choose, they'll bring you your own little personal ""tea pot"" brewed with loose tea from which you can get about three cups. I had English Breakfast w/ cream and my friend had some interesting walnut/flower mixture.Bottom line: From what we had and saw (spying at other people's food), this place has great flavor, nice service and a great price. BYOB...nothing more said there. If you're picky and looking to order plain waffles/pancakes/french toast, try going to IHOP or something because I didn't see too many options for plain anything (except maybe the pancakes and the protein). Definitely a place to try."
5/25/2015,20150525,5,4.12,"The best french toast and breakfast spot in the city, hands down. Food is excellent and quality is consistent!!"
5/26/2015,20150526,5,4.12,Oh wow best I've had. Will be backFor sure :) people are all friendly - chicken and waffle? Really but awesome
5/26/2015,20150526,5,4.12,Enjoyed a great breakfast at B&B on Memorial Day. There was a line when I arrived with a 1 hour wait but it moved quickly and once seated the service was fast and my food served in less than 10 minutes after ordering. I enjoyed Strawberry French Toast and a plate of delicious bacon as a side with a glass of OJ. The crowd was energetic but classy. Definitely come here when you can for the food and for a great way to start any morning!
5/30/2015,20150530,5,4.12,"This place is awesome!I went during Easter Sunday with a group of friends (5 of us). We waited a little outside and during our wait the owner/main chef, came out and warmly welcomed us to his place. He recommended we try the french toast flight and he said if we did not like it he would cover the cost of it. Once we sat down, not only did we love the french toast flight, we ordered another 3!I had the ""Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof)"" - chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle topped with a delicious fried chicken breast & drizzled in a nutmeg hot sauce & b&b maple butter.I absolutely loved it!!! What a clever idea to stuff the waffle with sweet potatoes. The others at my table had different kind of omelets, the buffalo chicken sandwich and some kind of salmon dish. (The salmon dish was for our super health conscious friend who lives at the gym lol.. He claimed it was amazing). We are all secretly jealous of him though! Highly recommend this place for breakfast and brunch!!"
5/31/2015,20150531,2,4.12,"As a few of the other yelpers have said, IT IS over-rated and over-priced. I had their shrimp/crab eggs benedict and it was just bland. First, they didn't even include an english muffin but just had the crab cakes topped with the poached egg. They didn't put enough hollandaise sauce. I also had a side of biscuits ($2) and gravy ($3). It was sort of dumb that they couldn't just combine the two so that's how they priced it. And I usually judge restaurants that serve brunch by their orange juice. I think they just used the tropicana from the carton instead of serving it fresh squeezed. I gave them one extra star since the crab cakes were made from actual crabs instead of crab sticks like the last restaurant I was in. I wasn't crazy about the service; I waited forever for my OJ. And the ambiance was incredibly loud. I sat at the communal table and the guy next to me was loud, cursing up a storm along with the chef who came out to converse with him. For a place that mentioned I had to wait an hour (I got in 10 minutes later since I was dining alone), I was left in a quandary as to why the place was so crowded."
5/31/2015,20150531,5,4.12,Yaaaaaas. This place is EVERYTHING. Cheesy hash browns and French toast sampler/flight hits the spot every time. Do I wish they took reservations? Everyone does. But it's so worth the wait. I'd wait 10 times longer cuz it tastes that good. Hope you get the staff member that will offer a riddle or a joke cuz it's amazing. Great family business in Lincoln Park and I hope it continues to thrive.
6/2/2015,20150602,3,4.12,"So I finally visited the infamous Batter & Berries, and I will say it's a little overrated. The wait time was very long, but it was a Saturday. The hostess was average, but our waitress was great. Our food came out very quickly, but it wasn't hot. I ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs, beacon, and hash-browns. The pancakes were good. The hash-browns were too cheesy, and once the cheese got cold the hash-browns became super hard. After our meal, I wanted to hang around and chit-chat with my girlfriends, but the line of people waiting to sit down was so long that I felt guilty doing so. Although my review is average I plan to return to give it another try. Pros!PancakesCons!Long wait timeFood is overpricedLimited seating Congested"
6/2/2015,20150602,5,4.12,"I found this spot via Tumblr. Can you believe that tumblr! When I found out it was black owned, I decided yup this is a must. I was thrown off by the wait (1hr 30), however my sister and I had no problem exploring Chicago. I loved how tech-savvy they are. When you put down your name, they send you a txt to say when your table is ready. amen!FOOD: A++ The food came within 10minutes of us sitting down and ordering! This place crowded from wall to wall; so yes they deserve these 5 stars. The food was great. I ordered the Maple Rum French Toast. Excellente... Did not need any syrup and added bacon to finish it off! My sister enjoyed her biscuits and gravy which came with eggs and hash browns. COST/HOSPITALITY: A++ Our meal came out to $35. Well worth the money and wait. Everyone was friendly and I had a blast! Will be coming back and telling and bringing my friends & family."
6/2/2015,20150602,5,4.12,"Went on a Wednesday at noon and was by myself so I was seated immediately. My server (Leslie I think??) was sweet and knowledgeable. She talked me into the french toast super platter but honestly, I required very little coaxing. Maple rum and caramel were my favorites. This place is great. Come on a weekday if you can. Leslie told me the wait is usually 2 hours on the weekends."
6/3/2015,20150603,3,4.12,I went on a weekday I thought the food was pretty good I will never give a restaurant a lower rating because of a long wait ( REALLY PEOPLE?) I had the crab meat eggs Benedict .. They were decent ...I agree I was a little surprised it came with no muffin .. I tasted my friends French toast and it was great .. I like the idea of using iPads to show the food .. However our waitress had a THICK accent and it was very difficult to understand her ... One thing I'll say is the name is PERFECT .. Because the French toast sampler was VERY good
6/5/2015,20150605,3,4.12,"Batter & Berries is nothing to write home about. The food was good. We had the lemon French toast, caramel French toast and the traditional plate which included cheesy hash browns, eggs and bacon. Very underwhelming especially for the price- 4 wedges of french toast that equals 2 slices of bread, costs $10. If I am going to pay 10 bucks for 2 slices of bread dipped in eggs, it better be an orgasmic experience. And it was not even close, the French toast was not even made with brioche bread and as stated on the menu. I guess I bought into all the hype. The hash browns were interesting and not in a good way. They were more like fried lumpy mash potatoes and when cooled off the melted cheese turned rubbery. Ok so I know I am a little harsh but I was really looking for my taste buds to be blown away.... We went on a Friday morning around 9 am and we were seated promptly. Courteous & fast service and a clean setting but the location size was on the cozy side. I recommend you give them a try but know this; they are a regular breakfast/ brunch place nothing out of the ordinary with overpriced food, and certainly not worth standing in a long line. Once you understand that, you should have a favorable experience!"
6/10/2015,20150610,3,4.11,"I had very high hopes for this place was let down unfortunately by undercooked meat and overcooked eggs and a little bit of bad service! First, we checked in. Lady (thin, with long hair and eyelashes) told us about 20 mins. We ended up going to put more money in the meter down the street and when we returned we noticed ""new people"" we're getting called before us. Not only did the lady we checked in with look dead at us she went on to call another group of new people. she never came back out to see hmmmm why are they still waiting. We ended up asking another employee if our names been called and indeed it was. He was great. Polite and apologized. He showed us back to the greeter who didn't acknowledge us at all but began to walk. My brother and I looked at each other and said the same thing... ""Do we follower her"" down the aisle she turned back and seen we were still right where they left us she waved to come to her. (Like a pet) We sat down said thank you She said nothing. Our waitress was amazing! Came out like she wrote the menu her self. (I loved that) Explained everything in detail and was happy to answer any we had. The menu was great. I was a bit indecisive cuz it all sounded so good but decided to go with the French Toast Super flight. It was delicious. Every bite. My brother on the other hand ordered the Executive. Well done with poached eggs. His meat came back red. Again, waitress went above and beyond and got him a new steak. Only bad thing is by the time it was cooked he finished his food and so did I. The new steak was fantastic. But the timing and waiting was aggravating and inconvenienced us terribly since we were on the other side of town hoping to beat traffic to make it to pick up kids from school on time. Mgr asked how everything was. We explained. He took the entire meal off the order. My brother won't be back, I know that. But I just might give them another shot! We all have bad days.... I'll take it that was there's."
6/13/2015,20150613,2,4.11,Service played a pretty big part in this score. Our waitress was generally unenthusiastic in the beginning but that's not the worst part. I had the Cluck-n-Gaufre which is a sweet potato waffle stuffed with fried chicken with a side of fried chicken. Sounds good but it was terrible fried chicken. It's like they didn't brine the chicken. It was really dry in the center and I just gave up eating it. Like how does a restaurant screw up fried chicken that badly? Should have bought some KFC and served that instead. The waffle itself was good but not enough to redeem the dish. My friends got the French toast flight and those were solid but nothing out of this world. I mean it was just toppings on top of French toast. Macerated blueberries or strawberries for blueberry or strawberry French toast. The salted caramel was tasty as was the mango. The food would have been a 3 and I would have come back to give it another try but the service killed it for me.I told the waitress about the dry chicken when she came by and she said sorry apathetically and just left. No manager or hostess came by to address the issue. Then the waitress brought the check and said no rush before we even finished our food or asked for it. They must have really wanted that table for that line outside! We took a look at the check and kept eating and she immediately came by because she thought we were paying. She did say no rush right? The guy serving water was way more professional and courteous than she was. If I could give 1.5 stars I would. There are so many better breakfast places in Chicago like Longman and Eagle where the service is just as good as the food that I see no reason to go here.
6/13/2015,20150613,4,4.11,Loved the food! I took my friend for her birthday and we tried the chicken omelette and strawberry French toast. the service was super fast and the food was so delicious and fresh. Would defiant leg recommend and go back
6/14/2015,20150614,5,4.11,Great food friendly staff. Love this place. Excellent service and the owner was very nice.
6/15/2015,20150615,4,4.11,"Great/okay brunch spot! The good: -BYOB -french toast flight - great variety -chicken and waffles - tried my friends and they were REALLY good -good price for very tasty orange juiceThe not so good: -wait was long but expected for a brunch spot -all the food is very sweet, not as much a savory spot -long/crowded inside-bathroom was awkward, in the middle of the room so it felt weird waiting, also it was very dirtyOverall I'd come back but not before trying other spots in the area."
6/16/2015,20150616,2,4.11,"Came here to have brunch for 2 on a Sunday. Threw our names down around 1045a-11a and weren't seated until 1230p or so. So the wait was deffiently substantial if its over 1.5 hours for a table for two! I would have to say the food was ok. My friend ordered the Chicken & waffles which were mediocre and I ordered a steak omelette which was not good at all. The only good item we ordered was the french toast. Not going to lie, we got the sampler plate and all of them were good but the strawberry & blueberry really stick out! The atmosphere was very loud and it was not pleasant. You literally had to scream to the person sitting across from you to get a sentence out. I would not recommend going unless you have a lot of patience"
6/17/2015,20150617,3,4.11,"Definitely the type of place you would only come to for some sort of special occasion. Overall the food is very heavy and probably too pricey to go to all that often.I ordered the broccoli and cheddar omelette (don't be surprised when it comes out open faced - still tastes good). It comes with cheesy hash browns as well, which were good but nothing amazing. I went with a large group and everyone else said their food was amazing - the chicken and waffle plate had the best reviews. Maybe what I ordered was just too plain but I probably wouldn't go back."
6/21/2015,20150621,3,4.11,"The anticipation! The smell of good food. And then... We waited 55 minutes to get a table and the wait itself was entertaining. Where else can you get yelled at while waiting for a table. The hostess came outside several times and yell at the crowd to reply to the text messages or be removed off the waiting list. I'm not and expert at this but wouldn't it be easier to inform people when they arrive and give their name? Or maybe put a note at the bottom of the text message? Just a thought! We finally were seated and noticed that the gentleman walking around outside checking the door was the chef. He was walking around inside chatting to the crowd. Note- loose the Bluetooth from the ear and baseball cap. Just my opinion.On to the food, we order the chicken and waffles, Blueberry ""waffle"" and broccoli and cheese omelet which came with cheesy hash browns. The chicken breast was carved into a small portion and came with hot sauce on it. Not typically what you would want on a breakfast meal. The omelet was not an omelet, it was a egg with cheese slices on top with a couple of stems of broccoli on it. I though the definition of omelet was the ingredients were inside not on top. The cheesy hash browns were just that nothing to really get excited about. Over all the food was average. Everything is priced more a la cart so you will spend a good dollar for breakfast. Our meal was just about $50. At that price point my expectations are higher than iHop. This is a trendy spot right now but I think it can use a little infusion of style. Just a couple of notches from a 4 star restaurant."
6/22/2015,20150622,5,4.11,"From Los Angeles visiting a friend. She recommended this breakfast spot. Attempted to come on a Sunday however the wait was over an hour, I now know why. We ordered the flight of French toast. It was Ah-amazing!!! The lemon French toast was by far my favorite! It was a party on my palate!"
6/22/2015,20150622,1,4.1,"Overrated. Food was good but anything would be good if it's slathered in buttered and sugar. Service was horrible- from over an hour wait, to the rude manager and the inattentive waitress. The manager had no business running a restaurant and would be better suited as a DMV worker. We never got refills on coffee or water. Save yourself the headache and take your food to go or better yet visit Jam and Honey up the street."
6/23/2015,20150623,5,4.11,"As others have said, get the French Toast flight...loved the lemon and pecan ones.Also bring champagne if coming for brunch. Otherwise you'll be the only ones who didn't."
6/27/2015,20150627,2,4.1,"People there are friendly and quick to get your order and explain the dishes. The French Toast was subpar, they had different ones and I ordered the super flight; but it seemed like a blanket french toast with a different glaze ... nothing to write home about. I also tried the chicken and sweet potato waffles ... that was the star ... wished there was more sauce and less salt."
6/28/2015,20150628,5,4.1,"Many places can claim to do chicken and waffle, but no one can reinvent and elevate the dish quite like Batter and Berries. First, this is no ordinary waffle. This is a sweet potato waffle with chunks of chicken baked right inside the batter... yes, you read that right. Chicken inside the batter!!!!! The batter itself taste almost like a sweet potato pie, but better. The chicken is boneless, and lightly battered, so it's not a think heavy crust, but still has that crunch you want in fried chicken. The dish is also served with a maple butter that is so much the perfect addition to the waffle, syrup is not needed. Finally, the chicken comes with homemade hot sauce. But, don't fret, the hot sauce isn't spicy, rather it adds just the right amount of tang to the chicken. Combined, the sweet, salty, tangy bite of the waffle, butter, chicken and hot sauce makes for umami (ie heaven) in your mouth. Things to note, the wait can be llooonnnggg (first time I went, I waited almost 3 hours!) But the wait wad worth it. The next time, I got smart. I went about an hour before it closed and the wait wad much shorter ( in and out within an hour). Also once you get inside and place your order, the food comes out fast. I mean freaky fresh fast, lol. I've always gone with a party of two and waited less than 7 out 8 minutes got out food. This is super impressive because the restaurant is always jammed packed with people. Overall, this is a great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot to try. The place is small, but inviting, good for kids (they have booster seats) and can please even the pickiest of palates. The owners ate always around to make sure everything runs well and that people love the food, which you will. Bon a petit!!"
7/5/2015,20150705,4,4.1,The French toast here is amazing!!!! Seriously the best I've ever had. I would say that their sweet dishes are far superior to their savory ones (namely the crab cake Benedict and chicken and waffles). Service is terrific as well.
7/5/2015,20150705,5,4.11,"Super flight fench toast & chicken & waffles = fabulous. The Chicken & waffles are amazing. The waffle is sweet potato and in it has bit & pieces of fried chicken. No syrup or anything needed because its all in there.The french toast is thr star. I am not a french toast kinda girl but everytime I go here sure enough I order this to share. They have a lemon one that is to die for! Tart & yummy.The wait is a PAIN. Get here when they open since the place is small. Better yet, get food to go.BYOB, ample of parking space, delicious brunch place, LONG wait! Must try!"
7/5/2015,20150705,5,4.11,Tasty breakfast! Loved the fajita omelet and shared the French toast flight.. So full but happy ... Will return!
7/5/2015,20150705,5,4.11,"SCALLOP OMELETTE!!!!! Creamy goat cheese in the middle topped with jumbo scallops, perfectly cooked asparagus and mushrooms in a white wine sauce!!! So delicious! By far one of the best dishes I have ever had!!! Amazing! You will not be disappointed!"
7/6/2015,20150706,4,4.11,This place is small inside - but cute. Our wait felt like FOREVER but I think it was worth it. I have yet to come and not wait. I dont know if there is no correct time to come here and beat the crowds. Banana foster waffles ARE LIFE CHANGING! soooo good.
7/9/2015,20150709,5,4.11,"This place was just amazing!!! Food was great, excellent service and the people are real down to earth. Came all the way from Ohio to try and was wowed for sure! I had the super flight which is all of the French toast flavors in one serving and it was heaven sent!"
7/9/2015,20150709,5,4.11,"THE best brunch! SO good! Plan to order like a thousand things off the menu. You cannot go wrong with anything. Louisiana in Chicago! Every flavor of french toast is delicious so get the flight. All of their omelets are ""deconstructed"" which compartmentalizes the flavors. I had their special omelet which as a Cajun crawfish and veggie omelet which was literally to die for. Sweet potato hash browns are soooo good! All the staff members were very nice. Would come back a thousand times over. Very special and unique spot!"
7/11/2015,20150711,5,4.11,"Excellent place to come on the weekdays, no lines. A comfortable place where they serve great comfort food. We ordered the popular sweet potato waffles with fried chicken and oat bran pancakes. So yummy you guys! I can't believe it's taken us this long to come here. Great service!"
7/12/2015,20150712,5,4.11,"I took my son and sister here for a birthday celebratory breakfast. I was forewarned that they have crazy wait times so we arrived shortly after opening and there was no wait at all. I guess because we went on a weekday. There was plenty of street parking available. First impressions..I will say that the place is really small and cramped. However, the food was just excellent!! I love the french toast super flight, which has 5 pieces of french toast. We also had the hash browns and the chicken sausage. The waitstaff can be more a little more friendly and attentive, but our actual waitress was awesome. A lot of the staff just moped around the large table in the middle of the room, which I thought was weird. I hope that they open a 2nd larger location. Overall a good experience. I will be back."
7/13/2015,20150713,5,4.11,"I'm in love with this place. Always an enjoyable experience with GM Don at the helm. I find the journey into the city on the weekend to be my best bet. There always seems to be an early start to the crowd. The staff typically does a stellar job of keeping the crowd rotated. They have the cool check in system that will text you to confirm your table, if there's a wait. I have certainly enjoyed the Lamb Chop Trio and every French Toast Flight to date has been fantastic. The Chef is always enticing you with a new creation. A great communal table is available too."
7/14/2015,20150714,5,4.11,"First let me say I love a good brunch! We were visiting Chicago and I wanted to find a good brunch spot (preferably with a mimosa). I did a little research and came across this place. We arrived close to noon and it was packed. Yep, on a Monday! We waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The staff were very nice and professional. Everything on the menu sounded good but be mindful, there's 2 chalkboards (one in the main dining area and another close to the kitchen) with other specials and desserts written on a chalkboard. One thing on the chalkboard that stood out was the crawfish omelet *insert drooling emoji* I would have LOVED to try it but my mind was set on the wings and waffle. I also wanted to get some peach cobbler to-go but I forgot. I was fat and full by the time I left. LOL Anywho, I ordered the succulent sweet potato waffle which was topped with maple butter and a fried, crispy boneless chicken breast splattered with their homemade hot sauce. This is in the running for the best chicken and waffle I've ever had. It was sooooooooooo good! I did order extra hot sauce (.50) but the waffle really needed no syrup as it was already sweet enough. I had our waitress bring syrup anyway just so I could try it and it could go without. The maple butter was enough. I would definitely recommend this place if you're visiting Chicago. Don't shy away if it's a wait, they move pretty quickly and the food came out fast, hot and very tasty. Kudos!"
7/15/2015,20150715,2,4.11,"Not impressed. I told my lady we could have went to wildberry or yolk and got better food. Scallop omelet and crabcake benedict. Really bad fishy smell. Stale bacon...Peach cobbler french toast was good, and they had nice plates lol, but Not good enough for us to do this twice."
7/15/2015,20150715,5,4.11,"My first time at Batter & Berries is definitely one I will remember for a long time. The food was amazing (of a party of 6, everyone got the French toast flight or the Cluck 'n Gaufre). I had the French toast super-flight; the ""special"" French toast of the day was peach cobbler. Amazing. One of the best brunches I had in a long time. Our server, Tusiime, was hands-down, the best server I've ever come across. He was so fun and asked our table riddles. It was fun and our entire table was constantly laughing. Our host was great too, we felt very welcome as soon as we stepped in the door. We were there on a Tuesday at 9 AM and the place was already hopping. Our group was able to be seated immediately, but from what I've heard, there is always a line out the door on weekends. I guess if there's a place with great food and remarkable service, people aren't going to keep it a secret!"
7/16/2015,20150716,4,4.11,"The best French toast I've EVER had in my life. If you travel to Chicago, you MUST, have breakfast here. Great ambiance, good service, decent location. Everyone in my party, (7 of us) loved the food. Get there now!"
7/16/2015,20150716,5,4.11,"This place is Awesome. The food is made to look visually appealing and seems like they take care to make each plate special and unique and not only does it look great, it tastes wonderful. My wife had the French toast special with five different types of French toast and loved every bite. I had a cheeseburger because I'm not a breakfast person and thought that I would just get that since my wife likes the place and I fell absolutely in love with this cheeseburger and large onion rings. This place is great go there and don't worry about the wait because it might be long."
7/18/2015,20150718,5,4.11,Be prepared to wait as lots of people seem to be trying to get in this place. The food was well worth the wait. I had the Scallop Omelette which was very good. My wife had the sweet potato waffle with chicken. This had to be the best waffle in the world. We didn't even need syrup. Food was hot and fresh even though there were a lot of people there. Management stopped by several times to speak and also thanked us for our business and invited us back next time we're in the area.
7/20/2015,20150720,1,4.11,"I live in the area and have been here a few times. There is always a long wait, but it had been worth it for the food. I brought my sister there on a Sunday morning. The host quoted us 1 hour and 20 minutes which was accurate. When our table was ready, the host asked if we were willing to share a 4 top with two other women we didn't know. We did not wait that long to share a table! Luckily, the communal table opened and we found two spots there. My sisters food came out (French toast flight and hash browns), and I had to wait another 5 min for my food. Her French toast was cold, so we waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to see if we could send it back. When my sister told him about her food, his response was ""well what do you want me to do about it?!"" She said she didn't know, and he started to raise his voice and said ""I don't know what you want me to do about it."" I finally had to step in and ask for him to get her a new plate. She looked like she was going to cry. The manager ended up comping her meal. Overall, they have terrible service. That is not a way to treat your customers, and I will never go back there."
7/27/2015,20150727,4,4.11,"This review is solely for their food, as I did not dine in. Boo scooped me up some food to go as he dined there for Sunday brunch.I got the sweet potato waffle and chicken. I tend to order chicken and waffles if a place has it, but I often find it to be mediocre. Most of the time, the chicken and waffle itself are pretty good but doesn't quite come together as an actual dish. However, at Batter & Berries, their chicken and waffle was just how it should be. The sweet potato waffle meshed well with the chicken and the chicken was very flavorful and moist. The fact that the waffle was also stuffed with chicken was quite genius and made the sweet & savory dish work very well. The maple butter was yummy while the hot sauce was somewhat basic. It wasn't bad, but was reminiscent of Frank's red hot buffalo sauce.Overall, best chicken and waffles I've had. Would like to dine in and try other items sometime, but not sure if I would wait 1.5 hours for it like the bf did."
7/28/2015,20150728,5,4.11,"As some of the other reviews point out, some of the operational, customer service aspects could probably be improved I'm sure... but whatever, the food is impeccable and comes at a good price. I'll deal and so should you. I didn't see nor experience anything unusual or unfortunate that I wouldn't also expect from other mom & pop operations. If anything I've been to chain and more prominent/expensive restaurants that should know better and have had much worse experiences. We had the Pork Chop Executive (special), which included a virtually perfect, tender bone-in pork chop that had onions and Rosemary, two eggs, and cheesy hashbrowns as well as the French toast flight, which came with some of the best slices of French toast they have to offer including the blueberry, strawberry, and lemon options, plus an additional (special) slice that featured Twix. The Twix option was too sweet/over-the-top for our tastes, but not bad. That was the only criticism we had from our visit. By far, the pork chop was one of the best I've ever had in my time on this planet.Service was acceptable and timely, and our server was polite and pretty knowledgeable despite her acknowledgement that they were short staffed (I couldn't tell). Every bite was a dream and I will definitely be sure to visit this spot every time I come to Chicago. I thought it was an excellent meal for what we paid and we both left very pleased."
7/29/2015,20150729,4,4.11,"5 stars for the food. Absolutely delicious. My friend and I had the scallop omelette and the French toast flight which comes with half a slice of all the French toasts they have to offer. Both were stellar. -1 star because it was so loud! My friend and I felt as if we had to yell at each other. One of our servers came by our table, and I think she said something along the lines of ""let me know if you need anything."" But I only got that much from reading her lips. We came here on a Tuesday morning. There wasn't a wait, but it was still very crowded!"
7/29/2015,20150729,5,4.11,Had some tasty Twix french toast and it was delicious :) I don't think they have it every day though...My friend had the scallop omlette (is that how you spell that?) And I had the chicken fajita omlette...So stuffed! I would definitely recommend this place :) We will be back for sure!
8/1/2015,20150801,3,4.11,"Cliff notes: good French toast flight, BYOB, don't get the crab cakesThe French toast flight was delicious, and I highly recommend it. However the crab cake Benedict left much to be desired. It did have a lot of crab, but it was not seasoned well. The cheesy hash browns also lacked flavor, were undercooked (crunchy), and the whole dish came out lukewarm. The cheese had congealed. The food came out VERY quickly, which generally is a good thing. But, based on the fact that the food wasn't warm and the cheese was congealed I suspect that dishes are pre-made to speed up service. Again not a bad thing but, but the dishes need to be heated up and assembled properly so that the meals still taste good. Others in my party really enjoyed the chicken and waffles, and the biscuits with chicken gravy. Seemed to be popular. Also, as you likely have read, there is quite a wait, 40+ mins. They will text you when your table is ready, you reply to confirm, then you come inside they walk you to a little waiting area with a bench. This extra step seemed really unnecessary. Got my hopes all up, lol, and I had to sit and wait some more."
8/1/2015,20150801,5,4.11,One of my new favorite breakfast places. I had the crab cake benedict and it was exquisite. My girlfriend had the french toast flight so I got to try some of that too and it was nothing short of amazing. It was definitely crowded because it was Saturday morning but it was only a 20 minute wait. I will definitely be back to try the chicken and waffles. Also don't forget to BYOB.
8/2/2015,20150802,2,4.11,"I came when they were still wanting customers a couple years ago and it was amazing, now it is so packed and I'm not altogether sure why. I'm sure they have some good signature dishes but I was less than impressed with my breakfast wrap and my boyfriends broccoli and cheese omelette. Experience could've been improved if there wasn't an 1.5 hour wait, more expanded dining area, and a waitress who cares that you're paying for the food and the service.Needless to say I doubt we will come back."
8/2/2015,20150802,4,4.11,"First time! The crawfish omelet, and flight french toast were excellent! Be prepared to wait...once you get in the service is good."
8/3/2015,20150803,4,4.11,"Okay, everyone was right about the French toast - it is as amazing as advertised. I got the chewy chocolate chip toast (special of the week) and it was amazing. It was sweet and chocolatey without being overwhelmingly so, as was the sugary butter that came with it. I ate every part of this toast, even the crusts. There's no point in over describing - suffice it to say that this French toast is flawless. It is not overly sweet, it's interesting, just the right texture and firmness.I was lucky enough to go on a Monday morning, and thus got a table without a wait. The service was friendly and great, with everything coming quickly, water and coffee being refilled often, and the manager coming to check in on us. However, I was less than impressed with my deconstructed broccoli and cheese omelette. Although the cheesy hash browns on the side were great (I literally couldn't stop eating them - they were crunchy and soft and cheesy and had just the right amount of spices), the omelette itself was meh. It was just an omelette with orange cheese and nearly raw broccoli on the top. Furthermore, the pieces were so large that I struggled to cut them with my little knife and fork. The omelette was not new or innovative, nor was it particulary tasty and it was also difficult to eat.Most of the food here seems great, and the French toast is exceptional. Worth a visit if you're a fan, and you may get a short wait if you're lucky."
8/5/2015,20150805,4,4.11,"A couple lovely ladies and I came here for Brunch on a Sunday. It was a very tasty experience and I recommend you give them a try! The wait can be a bit long, but it's worth it. You give them your phone number and they can text you when your turn is coming up and again when your table is ready. We waited about 1 hour after being given a 1.5 hour estimate.They sat us at a communal table and were very prompt with our drink order. We got pineapple-orange juice to go with the bubbly we brought (they are BYOB) and one of the employees opened the bottle for us with ease.The food order didn't take long to appear. Aimee M got the Crab Cakes Benedict, Angela P ordered the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof), Osi V had the Executive Pork Chop, and I also went with the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof). We were happy with our choices and also enjoyed the others. The chicken and waffle with a sweet potato batter and sweet-n-spicy sauce was good, but I personally preferred the benny and the pork. Their pork chop was so tender! The pork sausage was good too, but next to the fried chicken it was a bit too much of a muchness. The cheesy hash browns were a nice side that went well with each entrée, though.We couldn't decide what kind of French toast we wanted so we made the logical choice to try the Flight Of French Toast, which gives you a sample of the Blueberry, Strawberry with whipped cream and maple butter, the Caramel with nuts, Lemon with shredded zest, and Chips Ahoy cookies and chocolate. I gotta admit that I was disappointed by this dish. The Strawberry was the crowd pleaser and I think that's because it had the most flavor and was the most moist. The Lemon came in at a close second, but all of them had a superficial flavor. It's made with a thicker toast and I don't think they were dipped in egg long enough. I'm not sure if that's their normal way of prepping it, but it seemed rushed.We would definitely come back, but maybe arrive closer to 12pm so we can wait it out over at Atlas Brewing across the street."
8/7/2015,20150807,5,4.11,"This place was so unexpected. It gets packed easily, so I wouldn't be surprised if they make some changes location wise soon. I just hope the food doesn't change as they grow. I ordered the Cluck n Gaufre. This was the perfect combination of sweet, savory and spicy. I'm not really into chicken and waffles, but the sweet potato stuffed waffle caught my fancy. The waitress was fairly knowledgable, which is always refreshing. It's good to note that you can bring your own beverages."
8/8/2015,20150808,5,4.11,"I'm pretty sure I am in love! I was told to try this place out by a friend and oh boy!!!We were there shortly after 8am and waited about 10-15mins. They use a text message system to call you for your table. I received one text saying our table would be ready shortly. This text you have to respond to or they will pass you over and you would have waited for nothing. Then you receive another one saying ""Your table is ready.""The inside is small and quaint. Decorated nicely and efficient. All the staff was polite and friendly. Which is always a plus!As we were being seated we were asked about drinks and and they arrived instantly. The server shared the specials with us and allowed us time to review the menu.My friend and I both ordered the Top Flight and bacon. The Top Flight is their French Toast sampler. There is Blueberry, Strawberry, Carmel, and Lemon.All the flavor a were perfect, not over powering and the bread was cooked with a nice crispness to it. I can't stand no soggy French toast. Each one had a little sauce and fruit on it. The maple butter is heavenly, light and not to sweet. I did have to send my bacon back...I need my pig cooked a little longer. Can't eat no limp bacon so be careful about that.Our food came out so fast I didn't even have time to play on my phone after ordering . And yes it was HOT!If you're in town DEFINITELY GO EAT HERE!! And I'll be back!!!"
8/9/2015,20150809,4,4.11,"The place is totally worth the wait! Only reason I gave this place a 4 [wish I could do 4.5] was the poached eggs on my crab cake Benedict. They were over done and not runny at all. BUT the flavors are beyond amazing. As the chef recommends, no need for additional condiments, not even more salt or pepper...seasoned to perfection. Definitely go and stand outside for an hour, you'll be happy you did!"
8/10/2015,20150810,5,4.11,"The ""Chicken and Goof,"" a sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken and topped with fried chicken tenders, a spicy sauce, and maple butter, is the BEST brunch dish I've ever had in my life. I've had chicken & waffles many times, but the sweet potato waffle at Batter & Berries changed the dish, for the better, completely!We also dug into the French toast sampler, which included 4-5 of their French toast dishes. My favorite was the lemon and strawberry. I highly recommend this if your idea of breakfast is dessert.Batter & Berries is BYOB, and the pitchers of mimosas (pineapple, orange, or both) are a must.This place is hot, hot, hot! They do not take reservations, and you will have to wait. I arrived around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. I knew there would be a lengthy wait, but the hostess was really wishy washy when I asked how long it would be. She told me, ""an hour...hour and fifteen...hour and a half..."" okay, which one is it?! I checked in later and got the same response. You can give them your name though, and they will text you shortly before your table is ready. I already said it was hot, but that's also in regard to the temperature. This restaurant is small, there is a kitchen cooking lots of food, and there are a lot of people crammed in here. Don't be afraid to roll on an extra swipe of deodorant, and do dress for the weather.Despite the long wait (which was anticipated anyway) and the swamp-ass feeling when we left here, the food is just so damn good that you have to give this place 5 stars."
8/10/2015,20150810,2,4.11,"I was expecting a lot after hearing about the chicken stuffed sweet potato waffle with fried chicken. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this experience. We ordered the chicken and waffle dish and a ""deconstructed"" broccoli and cheese omelet with cheesy hash browns. The cheesy hash browns sounded great and looked delicious but they were completely lacking in flavor of any type. I could barely taste any cheese, tried putting salt on it, but the coarse salt they put in the shaker couldn't fit through the holes! What's going on here?? I can't be the first one to notice this. The omelet, which was a 2 egg omelet for $9 was also completely flavorless and I was left without the option of adding my own salt. Thankfully the pepper flowed freely. This ""deconstructed"" idea for an omelet just seems lazy. There was a small egg patty with some cheese on top, which had a few basically raw stalks of broccoli. Like I said, this just seems lazy, so you don't cook the broccoli and then I have to cut it up myself?? Jedi mind trick way of making this seem gourmet while saving labor costs if you ask me. I'm not sure what they were going for with this deconstructed concept, but it was a flop in my opinion. I'm dumbfounded that they were able to ruin two seemingly easy slam dunks: omelets and cheesy hash browns.... Now to the better dish, the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great! Wonderful flavor and the house made hot sauce actually adds a lot of flavor and balances out the sweet flavor of the waffle. Maple butter was good. There is supposed to be chicken inside of the waffle, but I was only able to find two or three small pieces, not what I would call chicken ""stuffed."" The ""fried"" chicken that came with it was oddly spiced with too much rosemary or thyme, not sure what it was, but the flavor was way off for the other flavors in this dish. Also, for fried chicken there was no breading and it was not even close the the crispy texture I expect from something called fried chicken. I found the price to be just a little steep at $13, mostly because the chicken was not at all a worthwhile addition and the only thing satisfying about the experience was the waffle which should be sold by itself for something like $7-8. Now I certainly don't mind paying more for great food, but this was not great. Service was fine, no complaints, no compliments. Coffee was good. Restaurant was clean. I do not like the communal table idea that was in the middle of the restaurant and would probably refuse to sit there personally.I don't think I'll be back, but if I do go, I would probably try the french toast. Given their seeming lack of ability to flavor anything other than breakfast sweets, I think that would be the safest bet. I almost gave them 3 stars, but three out of the four main components of the meal were a total failure in my opinion. That, coupled with the salt shaker thing and the price = a negative rating from me."
8/10/2015,20150810,2,4.11,"Small, crowded, overrated. One of the owners comes outside & like a ghetto ass classless clown, continuously hollers out patrons names. Wtf kinda ish is that? Ur an embarrassment for ur own establishment. He then belittles his staff publicly, hollering at them as well. The food, just meh. I had the sweet potato waffle & chicken and the waffle was awful. U didnt taste any sweet potato, tasted like a piece of awful gingerbread. The chicken was drenched in hotsauce after i asked for no hotsauce. Tables right outside the bathrooms, complete turnoff. Definitely wont be back, not worth the wait or hefty price"
8/11/2015,20150811,5,4.11,"PSA: 1. Prepare to wait, but I assure you it's worth it. 2. No split groups will be seated so make sure all of your party is there when you're ready to be seated 3. The line forms outside before the doors even open at 8am, arrive early4. The space is small (maybe tight for larger parties5. The dishes are ""saucy"" if you're not a heavy eater ask for sauces on the side or to be held6. Portions are large (split a few dishes to try a variety)Now that we have the formalities out of the way, enjoy this amazingly succulent food made with the most TLC imaginable. That was a bit dramatic, but seriously, the food is spectacular. Once we were seated the service was fast and friendly. Although it was crowded, everyone seemed to be engulfed in their plates presentation and the taste of their meals. It was like being in a slow-mo movie. The food is prepared and plated to perfection; colorful, flavorful, strategic and downright mouth-watering. It's apparent the Chef, Derek Rylon, puts his heart into his work.Lobster Benedict - 5/5Veggie omelet & Hash - 5/5 Waffle - 5/5Batteries & Berries is in a class of its own when it comes to breakfast. They just do it right.Thank me later."
8/12/2015,20150812,5,4.11,"This is one of my fave spots in the Chi. Worth the wait, though none today! I tried the signature French toast which is a sampler of lemon, pecan, strawberry and blueberry! Surprisingly I think I liked the lemon best."
8/13/2015,20150813,5,4.11,"What a gem! We stopped in a on a Thursday afternoon and still had a wait. Not too long but about 20 min or so. Well.worth.it! My fiance and I split the Buffalo chicken omelette and crab cake benedict. The one thing that I noticed, was the poached egg on the benedict was actually more on the cooked hard boiled side but in a good way. Both dishes were awesome! Service was quick and pleasant. I was happy that they had the text to table feature that let us know when it was time to be seated. I can imagine this place is slammed on the weekends so I think I will stick to weekdays but will definitely be back!"
8/13/2015,20150813,5,4.11,Coffee was good. Host staff friendly. thanks to YELP we were prepared to wait. Food came out fast. Server was charismatic. Told jokes and riddles. French toast flight was fun. Chicken and waffles is amazing. Huge portions. Friendly to our 5 year old. Overall a good experience and we will be back!
8/13/2015,20150813,4,4.11,"Solid four stars. I had the French toast flight, which was a nice sampler. If I were to order again I would just get the lemon French toast, since the lemony flavor really shines through. It's nothing out of the ordinary for brunch places, though, but the flavor is great and so is the service."
8/15/2015,20150815,5,4.11,My sister and her daughter invited me here with them.. Although the wait was very long. The food and the serves made up for it.. This food was totally off the charts delicious.I had the lemon French toast and the chicken omelette omg I love it Tracey G.
8/15/2015,20150815,5,4.11,"The only thing I can see putting people off when considering trying this place is the wait. You will wait, but it's 100% worth it. The amount of food and quality of food itself would be enough to satisfy me, but the experience here was fantastic. We had a French toast flight to start and share, and the server was kind and knowledgable and his recommendations were spot on. When three of us couldn't decide what to get, he suggested we each get something different and rotate plates. Best solution ever. We tried a crawfish omelette (with about 50 crawfish on it--they don't skimp), chicken and waffles which was heaven, and crab cakes Benedict. The meal was amazing, and the atmosphere was so home-y. Different servers kept checking in on us, so we always felt well attended, and during our meal, the head chef came around to thank us for coming in.We left satisfied and happy."
8/15/2015,20150815,5,4.11,"First time here this morning had the cluck n gaufe(chicken and waffles). But not just any chicken and waffles. The waffle is sweet potato with a maple butter. The chicken is expertly seasoned and has a nutmeg hot sauce. Oops forgot to mention there is chicken in the waffle batter. Ohh yeahhh! Had some cheesy hash browns which were delicious. We also had the traditional eggs over easy, the cheesy hash browns, and an incredible carved ham. Absolutely delicious, have been wanting to come here for awhile and I wish we would have come sooner. The French toast flights look amazing. Can't wait to go back this place has sweet and savory done right. YUM!!"
8/16/2015,20150816,4,4.11,"I visited this place last Thursday, and I must say I enjoyed the food very much. I ordered the super flight french toast combination, eggs and the chicken sausages. Did not enjoyed the chicken sausages as much, but I definitely loved the french toast. Not too sweet, and definitely did not need any syrup, they were just right. I plan on visiting again real soon. I used to patron the original pancake house in Hyde Park, however this will be my new spot."
8/17/2015,20150817,5,4.12,To be honest just plan ahead for the wait cause it pretty bad. Notice that doesn't change the fact that it's 5 stars. Was it annoying waiting in my car outside or a bar yes. The server was so entertaining the guy was clever. A good idea is to get the french toast flight for an appetizer so you and your friends can taste what's felt like it was made by the hands of God.. I had a taste of the chicken and waffle. This is the best chicken in and around waffle ever tasted by anyone probably. Seasoned chicken baked into a waffle with chicken on the side. God is good.. I ordered Carmel french toast eggs with cheese and Bacon. That frent toast topped with maple butter maple syrup and glazed pecans easily one of the most delicious things I have stuck a fork in.. Everything there was made in house and I honestly can't imagine going to Chicago and not eating there now..
8/17/2015,20150817,5,4.12,came here on a monday morning expecting the outrageous wait time to be way less than what it is on the weekend.. yeaaaaahhhh no.still waited 45 minutes to get seated but wow it is well worth it. i got the flight of french toast and it was out of this world! i have never had lemon french toast prior to my visit and it is for sure my new favorite. the sweet potato hash browns are an awesome twist on the traditional side dish. definitely coming back again soon
8/22/2015,20150822,5,4.12,"The staff are so nice and very knowledgeable about the menu! It's usually a long wait if you don't get there early enough. It opens at 8am and I got there 5 minutes after and there was already a nice crowd.I had: French toast flight (not bread person..but it was delicious). With the ""flight"" you get a sample of all of the flavors and the flavor of the day. (Blueberry, lemon zest, caramel w/pecans, strawberry and honeydew was the flavor of the day. *no syrup needed.Crawfish omelette was one of the specials (I substituted the ""cheese bacon for regular cheese. It also came with a side of cheesy hash browns. Everything was delicious!"
8/22/2015,20150822,5,4.12,"Very refreshing and unique place in Lincoln Park! It's not an easy task to stand out as a highly recommended must try in Chicago: a foodies paradise of deep dish pizza,hot dogs and cheese corn. Batter and Berries owner Chef Rylon came out to greet us as we were eating and had a long discussion about the awesome coffee he serves. Of course I had to ask because (in my opin)nothing shows that you care like a carefully selected cup of java. And he does, displayed via his vast array of French toasts and non traditional brunch dishes such as the Rylon salad I had. It was made of a spinach shell, shrimp,mushrooms and a light citrusy but perfectly buttery scampi dressing. I will make this a stop every time I am in the city!"
8/25/2015,20150825,5,4.12,"Best brunch in Chicago. Me and a friend went on a Tuesday (we heard of long wait times on the weekend) and it was packed. The atmosphere is great and there is the potential to sit and a communal table.We ordered the breakfast burrito, crab cakes and after talking with the waitress we split the French toast flight. The burrito and crab cakes were delicious but the French toast was even better.Whatever you order get some French toast to share!"
8/26/2015,20150826,4,4.12,"Yelpers reviews didn't steer us wrong. Everyone talked about a wait, and wait we did...I think it was about 90 minutes that Sunday morning. But after about an hour, I lost track. They have a system of texting you when you are up next to be seated. And when you're lethargic from a lack of caffeine, lack of sleep and hunger pangs, that text becomes one of the most blessed texts you can ever receive. Our foursome decided to each order a savory entree and then selected the french toast flight to add a bit of sweetness. Everyone's entree looked at tasted wonderful (we are a sharing bunch). From my crabcakes benedict (which was full of lots of fresh crabmeat but unfortunately the poached egg was a little overdone), Osi V's pork chop breakfast (super tender and flavorful chop), Ericka A and Angela P's fried chicken and sweet potato waffle (tender chicken and flavorful waffle with a bit of a spicy kick). Of the flavors in the french toast flight, my favorite was the strawberry and then the lemon with the chocolate chip being my least favorite. Gotta love a place that is BYOB. The orange pineapple juice they provided for our bubbly made for some refreshing mimosa's. Now when we visited it was super hot outside; so being overheated, plus being in a crowded restaurant, I couldn't feel any AC at all and that made for a super sweaty brunch. But very grateful the staff kept our water glasses filled too."
8/27/2015,20150827,5,4.12,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots!!! I drive all the way from the south suburbs of Chicago just to eat here..50min drive!!!! Amazing French toast!!! My favorite thing to order is the caramel French toast and the traditional, but I've pretty much have tried everything. I thing the cost of food is worth every penny!!!! This place has changed my view on what brunch is supposed to be!! If you have not been, you need to go right now!!!"
8/28/2015,20150828,5,4.12,"I have been hearing the buss about this place from friends and co-workers. Well, I've been there 3 times in 2 months. It's definitely a HOME RUN...you will not be disappointed. Maybe by the wait time, but definitely not the food or service. #loveit #loveit"
8/29/2015,20150829,3,4.12,"If waiting for an hour and some change for a seat to eat, you'd think the food was stellar as well as hot. The food was ok not great, and half of what ordered was cold. Our waitress was great and food came quickly. I would recommend going on a day they may no be so busy. Also, sitting in a back corner does little for ambience."
8/31/2015,20150831,3,4.12,"I've gotten the chicken and waffles here and they were okay no complaints my mom had the eggs benedict and it was mediocre nothing to brag about the place gets crowded quick,but i probably won't b back, so thatll b one less body to worry about at least."
9/2/2015,20150902,1,4.12,Please do not tell me to get here by three and you will serve me. 2:56 kitchen closed.  Too bad for you. I knew what I was going to order.  Three dished to taste for one person.  Your first loss of many.
9/4/2015,20150904,5,4.12,"I kept seeing my facebook friends going to and posting about Batter and Berries and I was dying to go too. So a friend visits from out of town and wants to go so it's a no brainer. I finally got my chance!My friend, my husband and I went first thing (around 8:30) on a Friday morning so we avoided the long wait that people mention on the weekends. It did get much busier as we were leaving though so I think we were smart to arrive so early. We were seated promptly and approached by a fantastic server. He welcomed us all, and asked if it was our first visit. When we told him it was he made us feel very welcome and ran down the specials and suggested the French Toast flight. He made everything sound delicious so it was hard to choose.I ordered the crab cakes but also had tastes of my friend's French toast flight and my husband's chicken fajita omelette. The crab cakes were good enough to want to order them again but I think I'd like to try more things on the menu in the future.EVERYTHING was delicious! They don't really do special requests but there's something for everyone on the menu and the food is so good it doesn't really matter. The food arrived promptly, our water and coffee were refilled in a timely manner and we had a manager check in on us toward the end of our meal. My husband was wearing a Phi Beta Sigma shirt and the manager told us the owner was an Omega. My friend and I are Deltas so we were also pleased to be supporting a member of the Divine Nine! I now see for myself why this place is so popular and just as I guessed, I've been missing out! It was a win win and we will ALL definitely be back for the delicious food and great service."
9/6/2015,20150906,5,4.12,"Ok so look... THERE IS GOING TO BE A WAIT... BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT. The atmosphere is busy and active. The host and wait staff are friendly and knowledgable of the menu. THE FOOD IS SO GOOD ... Temperatures are correct. PLEASE TRY THE FRENCH TOAST FLIGHT. It's four different flavors (lemon, caramel, strawberry, and blueberry) the bread is so sweet with a slight crunch at the crust.. Perfection we also ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffle as well as the deconstructed steak omelet. The chicken breast we cooked to perfection it was Juciy and seasoned well and the waffle had just enough sweeteness. The steak was cooked to a medium and accompanied with a very tasty gravy over the cheese filled omelet. Everything was tasty and worth the money. Defiantly a must try in Chicago!"
9/9/2015,20150909,5,4.12,"There are few times in my life I'd ever justify a wait greater than 1 hour for food. I suppose this was one of those times. I had a guest in town, and I had heard great things about this place. I got there around 10am on Labor Day weekend Sunday, and our wait was about an hour and 15 minutes. The beauty of it was that as soon as we sat down we ordered our food, and it came within 10 minutes, no joke! I had the French toast flight - excellent! And I normally NEVER order French toast at restaurants. My friend tried the sweet potato waffle and fried chicken. She mentioned the waffle was a bit sweet, but the hot sauce with the chicken toned that down a bit. The service was pretty good. And the food was great! I'll definitely be back again..."
9/10/2015,20150910,5,4.12,The service here was absolutely incredible. I went on a busy Sunday and my coffee was always piping hot and filled to the brim! I enjoyed an omlette and my friend ordered the sampler of French toast and we were vey happy! Would recommend to anyone-- my favorite breakfast spot in chicago thus far!
9/12/2015,20150912,3,4.12,I have heard a lot of great things about this restaurant so I was pretty excited to go. The wait time is unacceptable. The restaurant needs to find out a better way to accommodate people. My party had to wait 2 hours to be seated. Therefore with that being said the food was pretty decent but to wait 2 hours for food and you're really hungry anything might taste good. Everyone in my party thought that their various entrées were good but I don't think it was worth the travel or the wait time. If you are in the area and the line is not really long then definitely try it out.
9/12/2015,20150912,5,4.12,You have to try the crab cake eggs Benedict and french toast flight! Definitely a food experience not to miss. The only downside is the long wait (1 hour minimum) but the food makes up for it! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
9/13/2015,20150913,4,4.12,"Went to Chicago for Labor Day weekend, and received a tip to hit up this Black owned business. The wait is ridiculous, which is the reason for 4 stars, but the food was bomb. Hit that french toast flight...OMG.Dont go if you super hungry, cause you can expect an hour to hour n half wait on the wkend, bt if you love good food it will be worth it."
9/13/2015,20150913,5,4.12,"Hands down the best breakfast spot in Chicago. The food is mouth watering. The service is superior and the ambiance is very pleasant. Considering the wait was 90 minutes, I was happy that the atmosphere was very plesant."
9/13/2015,20150913,5,4.12,super busy! but theres a reason why....it's so good. After having it once I've wanted it every weekend morning after. The french toast are perfect and the give you a butter to eat it with. The hashbrowns are so good. So yum. You can also request hot sauce. I love everything spicy so I put it on the hashbrowns....the coffee is good. Every time I've gone I've had to wait but they text you when you're up so I like that because that way you don't have to hold those dirty square vibrators that you know they never clean. The wait has never been that bad. worth it.
9/14/2015,20150914,4,4.12,"Incredible chicken and waffles - definitely get this. Interesting French toast flight, but not mind-blowing. Hash brown was out if control - definitely get it as a side. It's like a Mac n cheese - hash brown fusion. Service was not the best - had to wait about 15 min before ordering. Would definitely come back though to explore more of the menu. Could reach 4.5 if service is improved!"
9/17/2015,20150917,5,4.12,"This was one of my favorite spots in Chicago! Our group of 4 wanted to check out Lincoln Park and Oz Park nearby, and wanted to get a head start with brunch! We were able to walk in around 9 on Monday and got seated immediately. Our table ordered 3 dishes-the french toast flight, the cluck-n-goufre, and the deconstructed steak omelette. We loved each of these dishes! No frills, just great food. The french toast flight came with one each of strawberry, lemon zest, caramel, and blueberry toast. This came with this amazing maple butter that was addicting-and I'm not even a fan of maple taste! The chicken and waffles was made of a sweet potato waffle and fried chicken drizzled with hot sauce that gave just the right amount of a spicy kick to the dish. Too good! The deconstructed steak omelette came already cut up for us, and hash brown was great as well. This was a pretty saucy dish, but it was perfect taste!Portions were large enough to fill us right on up and ready to explore more of Chicago! Service was fast and friendly, food was amazing, and this is definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots ever!"
9/17/2015,20150917,5,4.12,"Great place with a lot of variety, great people and easy to meet new great people in the neighborhood with the communal seating! The strawberry French toast is awesome! Had the shrimp scampi omelet it was great if your a garlic lover this is definitely the omelette for you!"
9/18/2015,20150918,5,4.12,"Excellent. They were packed and busy but got us seated quickly, immediately with drinks, then they got our orders in and food out fast. And it was delicious, I went with the french toast flight since it was first time and my girlfriend went with the lamb special. We shared and both were delicious. Of the flight, the caramel french toast was off the charts."
9/20/2015,20150920,5,4.13,"Food was delicious we had a table of five we each ordered something different and tasted each other's and everything was fresh and amazing. The waiter was friendly and upbeat. Food came within 5 minutes. We're visiting from houston and this is definitely one of the best breakfast's I've had. If your going to cheat this is definitely the place to go to. Will be back, food and service phenomenal 5 stars"
9/21/2015,20150921,3,4.12,I got the chicken n waffle the chicken was ok but the waffle was ti crumbly service was cool too the environment was very busy but that's a sign of a good place
9/22/2015,20150922,5,4.12,"One of the best brunches I've ever had. The French Toast Flight is a good choice, but the Chicken and Waffles is the winner here. Come early and expect to wait, it's a small, cozy place and the locals know how good it is!"
9/22/2015,20150922,5,4.13,"Food was fantastic. I ordered the caramel french toast. Oh my. I was full after the third half, but it was so wonderful I wanted to continue eating. Service was fast. Seated in approximately 10 minutes on Tuesday at 10:45 am. Waiter had a great attitude and was very upbeat. It was a pleasant time all the way around. I will definitely tell friends about it. I will also return soon."
9/23/2015,20150923,5,4.13,"this my 3rd time here, and each time is better than the last. the food gets 5 stars, but even more, the service gets 6.... I'm always made to feel welcome, never rushed, and when they tell me they hippie to see me again soon, I believe them. French Toast flight, omg, house made sausage, double omg.so worth a visit."
9/23/2015,20150923,5,4.13,"This place lives up to the hype!!I stopped by this morning and had the best breakfast I have had in years! Our waitress was great and the manager was extremely friendly!We ordered the chicken and waffles and bruschetta omelet (which was a special, but should really be on the menu). Both were FABULOUS! They were absolutely delicious!I cannot wait to come back!!!! It is my new favorite breakfast spot!"
9/25/2015,20150925,2,4.13,"Really looked forward to trying to this place while in town and have to say we were extremely let down.The dishes sound amazing but here's the sad breakdown. Cheesy hash browns - 4/5 unfortunately the best item we ordered lobster Benedict - 2/5 Poached eggs overcooked, more like the consistency of over medium eggs. Lobster lacking in flavor and textureSweet potato hash - 1/5 came out almost raw and had to send back to be cooked moreFrench toast super flight - 3/5 good but not great. Each one was drowned in either butter or sauce that didn't allow the flavors to come through. Sad as we really thought this was going to be stellar. We'd prefer to add syrup to our own liking. Wait on Friday around 11:30 am was quoted at 30 minutes and pleasantly turned out to me much less. Thank goodness otherwise we'd be even more disappointed!"
9/25/2015,20150925,2,4.12,"This morning I had my very first experience and my meal was carry out at this place and I must say that when I got to where I was going I was truly impressed with the meal but not impress with a comment that one of the staff told me. He stated when I asked for a carryout menu that if it was up to him then he would cut it out all together. I like this place for the first time dining out and I would love to continue doing so, but I would like to one day eat there as well but I believe that the restaurant have a bigger location."
9/27/2015,20150927,5,4.12,"5 Stars is deserved! I've been thirsting to try this place for some time now. I found them on a list of Chicago black businesses you should try. Omg, why did I wait so long to try this place puzzles me! The food is delicious and made so quickly. I went on a early Sunday morning and my food was ready in 10 minutes. Great customer service. Small restaurant but hey it's a in and out spot. Prices are great for the restaurants location. I ordered the lamb chop trio and it was finger licking good. Great portion sizes, I couldn't even finish my meal. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles, lawdy that chicken was the best I'd ever tasted. Definitely going back. Soon!"
9/27/2015,20150927,5,4.12,We drove all the way from the burbs to check out this highly rated breakfast joint. We didn't exactly know what we were looking for but wanted a new experience that would excite our senses. This place delivered. The French toast was decadent. Wevtried the sampler. Our favorite was the lemon followed by the blueberry! The servings were ample and the service friendly and impeccable. There was a wait but they managed every aspect efficiently and with a smile. We'll be back!
9/27/2015,20150927,5,4.13,"This place is amazing!!!! Great food, superior service and a friendly atmosphere. Long wait (hour and 20 minutes) but it was SO worth the wait!!!"
9/28/2015,20150928,3,4.12,"Finally made it here after putting it off forever due to long wait times. They have an interesting policy where you give your name and they text you when your table is ready. I got the traditional chicken and waffles which is made with sweet potato infused waffles. Very rich and delicious, the syrup is baked into the waffles. Definitely a place to go for a once in a blue moon treat. I also got a side of poached eggs which were very runny although I asked them to be cooked well. Ones I sent them back to be done again they came back the same.Overall a bit pricey for breakfast and not sure if it's worth such a long wait."
9/28/2015,20150928,1,4.12,"I love this restaurant and am always recommending it to people which is why I'm surprised at my last experience here which has me never wanting to spend another dime here! We arrived about 11 on a Sunday morning and the wait was about an hour and a half, we requested a table for 3 as there were two adults and a baby. Once we got back to the hostess stand and were about to be seated the hostess told us we could not have a stroller at the table and asked us if we wanted a high chair and as we were explaining to the host the child was disabled and was unable to sit in a highchair she rudely cut us off and repeated we couldn't have a stroller in the restaurant. The restaurant was loud so we weren't sure if she didn't hear us or she just didn't care. So we tried to explain again and once again was cut off, so we were forced to take the child out of her stroller and hold her in our lap as we ate!! Never receiving an apology or being accommodated for our inconvenience. This experience has me completely disgusted and disappointed in the lack of sensitivity and accommodation for a disabled person we received from this establishment!!! We definitely will never come back to this place!!!"
9/28/2015,20150928,5,4.12,"This will be my new go to place in Chicago for breakfast! Everything and I mean everything was great.... Food, service, food again! Pork sausage, lobster benedict, sweet potatoes waffle and chicken....truly delicious!"
9/29/2015,20150929,5,4.12,"I really liked this place. The hostess was really friendly and took me to the waiting area, while I waited for my boyfriend. As I was waiting one of the servers asked me if I wanted some coffee. That was really nice, since it was kind of chilly and raining outside. When my boyfriend got there, we were sat immediately and coffee and water was brought over right away. Our server came by, and knew the menu very well. My boyfriend got the smoked sausage omelette and I got the chicken and waffles. Yummy. Thank for a great birthday breakfast."
9/29/2015,20150929,4,4.12,"I understand how important a Yelp review ways upon a business. It also helps steer my fellow foodies in a pleasant direction. So, while I want this place to be a 5 star, I reluctantly give it 4. The chef owner is amazingly patient and knowledgeable about his menu. Our group was unsure about a few items, and he took the time to explain and reassure us about those things. When my dish arrived, the well-cooked egg request arrived runny and under cooked. My waffles were great, sweet and dense. The chicken sausage was above average (even though pork sausages originally arrived with my order). Many of our tables dishes were originally ill prepared, though the re-do was brilliantly thoughtful, filling, and delicious. The loudly busy restaurant may need to invest in more kitchen staff for it's growing demand of clientele. I will still send our breakfast groups and friends here to patronize the chef...though his kitchen staff needs to learn to cook eggs."
9/29/2015,20150929,3,4.12,"I visited this restaurant a few months ago. The food is SPECTACULAR, but I am only giving them 3 stars because everything else was disappointing. The wait was long, the tables were too close together, the service was friendly yet slow. As great as the food was, I am definitely not going back to this restaurant. Unless of course, they decide to fix the problem somehow. Perhaps they need a bigger location with more staff. They certainly cannot handle the amount of publicity they have gotten. But the food is GREAT!"
9/30/2015,20150930,5,4.12,"French toast... YUMMMM went on a Sunday and were sat right away. The service wasn't very good but I can't blame them.. They were PACKED spoke arrival. The food was perfect, everything about the french toast was so good. I am now on a hunt to find a breakfast place like this one by my house in LA"
9/30/2015,20150930,4,4.12,"Went yesterday (9/29) for my 64th birthday. As always had to get the French Toast Flight, but, this time I also got the Lamb Chop Trio and I ate everything."
9/30/2015,20150930,5,4.12,I totally under estimated this place. I went to this restaurant thinking it was just another breakfast joint. And boy was I wrong. The staff was so friendly and engaging. The food was the best if I could go back and hug the chef I would've. Especially after tasting the caramel french toast. I love this place I would go over and over again. I definitely recommend

10/2/2015,20151002,2,4.12,"So, I love the food here...when it arrives hot. We keep giving this place chances and sometimes it's a hit and sometimes a miss. When it's a miss and you complain, prepare for an arrogant response from the manager. It all started when we were quoted a 15-20 min wait that turned into a 45-50 minute wait. After we were seated, near the front, we saw that this is what is done to keep customers from leaving...so be prepared. After a long wait, the food arrived lukewarm. We were offered new food, but after waiting a while just to place our order, we were just ready to eat. I am frustrated when new busy restaurants in Chicago begin to take their customers for granted. You have just loss a faithful one due to poor customer service."

10/3/2015,20151003,5,4.12,Arrived at 8 AM to make sure we were seated. They waited for my party but did not have to wait too long to eat. Food was amazing I had the French toast flight which was so sweet but not too sweet. They have a few items listed on the menu but most of them are handwritten on the chalkboard so make sure to check for the specials. The carry mini iPads which was really cool because we got to pay for food right at the table even with split checks with credit cards. My only complaint is once you get the check or once you pay you're not really sure what you're paying for because they just give you a number and not a detailed list. They are extremely friendly; some of the other wait staff came to mingle with us just to pass the time. It is a must eat place if you live in Chicago or visiting Chicago definitely try it out

10/9/2015,20151009,4,4.12,"Great breakfast spot on the north side of Chicago! I've come here a few times and have had a good experience on every visit. I like their French toast flight, lobster benedict and most recently the lamb chops with red wine sauce and cheesy potatoes with an egg over medium, yummy! The service is pretty good, but it's also holding me back from a five star rating. It's a bit hit and miss, as we have had good service, but not every time. If you are going on the weekend, be warned, it's very crowded. We usually go early and wait for them to open, so we can get seated right away."

With a 1hr and 15 minute wait, be prepared to plan ahead and not be pressed for time. I had the Lobster Benedict which was tasty, but on the bland side. On the other hand, the Lemon Zest French toast was very flavorful. There are many unique flavors to choose from. With the exception of my server, I must say that the staff is quite unprofessional. My experience was subpar but the food is decent enough to endure the urge to leave. I would may try this place out again on a less popular day."

10/15/2015,20151015,4,4.12,"First things first: if you're not a patient person you may want to steer clear of this place. There seems to always be a wait. As for decor, it's nothing spectacular. It's simply a diner looking restaurant.. One that gets a little too crowded for my taste but hey! I get it. This will happen when the food is good and the people keep coming. There is an odd waiting area located in the middle back of the restaurant- something is better than nothing. Nevertheless expect close quarters and a very loud atmosphere (at least when we were there)My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken Alfredo omelette and the French toast flight. We contemplated the super flight but decided we had enough food as is. I must say: the maple butter is phenomenal. It's just perfect; not too sweet and just enough flavor to know its special butter. The flight included the following flavors: lemon, caramel pecan, strawberry, and blueberry. I am a blueberry lover and that of course was my fav. We were however very surprised with the lemon French toast. I will candidly admit that I was not looking forward to the lemon toast and it surprisingly came in as my second favorite. They were all delicious and it was an overall good plate to share. (In case you're curious, my boyfriend's favorite was the lemon :)) Now for the chicken Alfredo omelette. The omelette consists of egg whites with parm cheese, chicken and broccoli in Alfredo sauce on top. I can honestly say it's one of my favorite omelettes. Ever. Please note however, I am not a big breakfast person and the fact that I felt like I was eating a non-breakfast meal with some egg tossed in was what did it for me. My boyfriend who is a big breakfast guy however loved it too. Now you may be asking why four stars when I loved the omelette and the flight? I know I would be asking myself the same. And here is the answer: the price. While I believe the flight, coffee, and hot chocolate were well priced I think 17.99 for an omelette is a little ridiculous; especially when you're not told the price of the omelette before had. I should have mentioned that the waitress/waiter shows you the specials on an iPad but there is no price indicated on the same. In my opinion 17.99 for an omelette that has normal ingredients is overpriced. Now had the omelettes had some kind of seafood I would understand but chicken, cheese, broccoli, and eggs are all pretty cheap common ingredients. Also, small side note, the hot chocolate seemed to be that of a pre-made package and I was expecting something homemade. Maybe my fault for expecting homemade but nevertheless a little disappointing. I may however come back for some maple butter. Enjoy!"

We were told the wait would be about 2 hours but since I was curious and spotted a nail salon across the street I figured why not get a Mani-pedi while I wait. By the time I finished with my nails our table was ready( the wait was less than 2 hours) We sat looked at the menu and noticed everything I saw on the Yelp and other reviews, which was what persuaded us to come wasn't on the menu!! Once our waiter came and greeted us he began to tell us about the ""Specials"" for the day, NOW WE'RE TALKING!!! Everything was music to my ears. I wanted to try it all! I went with the pan seared catfish and eggs with cheesy hash browns, my girlfriend got the Lobster Benedict. My taste buds were dancing with every single bite. We also got a side of pancakes just to try them, way too much food for the two of us but man, how I wish my belly was bigger. I was sad to leave any of it behind. All I have to say is the wait is WORTH IT. Our waiter was fun, funny, kind and polite. Everything about this place is awesome. I wish there were one back home in Los Angeles."
10/19/2015,20151019,4,4.13,Delicious! Such amazing flavors and bold and daring combos of hearty and satisfying food perfect to supplement your lazy sunday vibes!WARNING: Lines will be babout 45 min to 1 and half. I was on vacation and ran to the restaurant at 10 am to get a table at 12. Smart move if you can do the same!For lunch ordered the lobster cake eggs benedict and hash browns and the lamb chip trio. LOVED the lobster cake. If you are a crab cake fiend like me -- MUST Order. Also loved poached eggs and this smiffy seafood/egg pairing was the bomb! For the lamb chops -- not the best i've ever tasted in terms of seasoning (i thought they were a little too oily) but cooked perfectly and sat on top of hash browns with gravy and the cutest little caramelized onions. Also had a sunny side up fried egg on top -- DELICIOUS!!LOVE chicago and LOVED this restaurant and will be back to try their other specials as well as that chicken and waffles!!
10/19/2015,20151019,2,4.12,"I really wanted to like this place, but my first experience here made me think otherwise. We had a 30 minute wait even though we got there at 1:10pm. Then our waiter served drinks to the table next to us before us, even though we were seated first. I also feel that our waiter was age discriminatory towards my party when it came to the BYOB deal. I know we may look young, but IDs should be asked to every table (hence the table next to ours didn't get carded). The food was good, I can not deny that. But the service will make me think twice about going again. I had the Lamb Chop Trio that was very tasty, but a tab bit salty. It came with an egg (any style) and their famous cheddar Hash Browns. I ordered another egg and my friend asked for more bacon, let's just say it never came BUT somehow showed up on our bill. Wher dey do dat at??"
10/19/2015,20151019,3,4.12,"We ate there today. Well, our second visit to this restaurant wasn't close to our first experience. The food was just ok. The service was marginal. I asked 4 times for whipped cream. Finally, the waitress said they didn't have any, but they went to the store to get some. I appreciate the effort, but by the time I got it, I was almost done eating. The place was special when we first went. Not now. Hubby got the French toast flight and said it was just ok. I got the ribeye omelette with no cheese. Of course, it had cheese. The service is lacking and the food used to be fantastic, but not any more. And the size of the place is a turn off. It's too small.We'll try it one more time in a few months just to give it another chance. . What a disappointment."
10/19/2015,20151019,4,4.12,Was good breakfast but we couldn't stay to eat there there was a 2 hour wait! Took it to go though and it was tasty. If you're going to go for breakfast you probably want to make it early and expect to wait a bit.
10/20/2015,20151020,4,4.12,"I finally mastered the art of coming to this restaurant for a pleasant dining experience on 10/17/15. My other 2 experiences weren't that good. My friend and I arrived at 8:30, which is 30 minutes after opening. We only waited 10 minutes as opposed to an hour starting around 9/10. We had the steak executive, taffy apple French toast and shrimp scampi omelet with cheese hash browns. It was all good! Bon appetite."
10/21/2015,20151021,3,4.12,"I came here with a group of 10 people at 9am on a Sunday. Surprisingly, we were able to get seated in about 30 minutes. The service was warm and friendly despite how busy and crowded they were. Their menu is large and has some fun/weird creations. I had the lobster benedict, I can never say ""no"" to one. It didn't come on any type of bread and the lobster was in the form of lobster cakes. The consistency of the lobster cake was smooth and mushy. I was hoping for some lobster chunks and I kind of missed the english muffin. The hollandaise sauce was good. And I thought the hash browns were a bit bland. I wasn't really impressed."
10/21/2015,20151021,5,4.12,"There super flight of french toast was soooooo good. I don't think I have ever gone to an amazing brunch place like this. I go out to eat so much and this place hit the spot. It was so yummy. The french toast was on point and they did not even need any maple syrup. It was so amazingly good! We also ordered the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof), that was really really really good as well. There was no need for any condiments to put on it. I can't believe how amazing this place was. I ordered the The Executive as well. It had a rib eye steak, grilled onions and mushrooms in a red wine sauce with the 2 eggs cooked to order and hash browns. I finished the whole thing! It was filling and so good. Can't wait to go back to eat that again. The service was fast and the staff was very friendly."
10/22/2015,20151022,2,4.12,Less than a 20 minute wait on a Thursday. They texted us to let us know that they were ready for us. We got inside and the host walked us to our table which was not cleared/clean. The hostess told us to wait until they cleared it. Took about 3 minutes for that to happen. I was a bit annoyed but I let that slide. We sat down and the waitress sped through the specials via an iPad and we asked her for more time. She came back and we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the sweet potato waffle with chicken with a side of BB hash browns. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with pork sausage. The food isn't anything to brag about. The waffle is very sweet so adding syrup makes it overwhelmingly sweet and no syrup is just the right amount of sweetness but it's too dry. We asked that our hash browns be fried hard and they came out the first time not fried hard and we sent them back. Then they came out again the exact same way - not fried hard. Lol. We just kept them. My breakfast sandwich was meh. The pork sausage was flavorful but I didn't like the fact that I had to pay extra for the meat. And they only gave me one small Patty for a big sandwich. The food was okay but nothing to brag about. The restaurant was clean and the staff was polite. The restroom was also clean and there is a waiting space for guests inside the restaurant.
10/23/2015,20151023,5,4.12,"The first rule of flight club is...don't talk about flight club. Yeah...they do a French toast flight here that people really need to stop blabbing about otherwise it'll take even longer to get a seat than it already does. That shit is f**king delicious and this is coming from someone who only ordered them cause how can you not at a place called Batter and Berries?Besides the batter though, they do awesome everything. Specials change often, but if you're here during crab cake Benedict season be sure to give that a whirl. It's incredible and it comes with cheesy hash browns. The place is small and close quartered so don't be surprised if you find yourself sitting at the commune tabes or waiting awhile. Good thing delicious doesn't care where you park your keister."
10/23/2015,20151023,5,4.12,I'm from Los Angeles visiting Chicago and this is by far the best brunch place I've ever been to. I highly recommend ordering one of the omelets and the French toast. Caramel French toast is my favorite. Overall amazing experience!
10/25/2015,20151025,5,4.12,"A fabulous place for breakfast. Split the signature French Toast Super Flight. Each flavor is excellent and beautifully presented (strawberry, blueberry, lemon, caramel and the flavor if the week). The omelets are creative and savory - bruschetta or crawfish were great. They also have traditional fare. To top it off the people are warm and welcoming."
10/25/2015,20151025,5,4.12,"I got their crab cake while my friend got the chicken waffle. They were both really good and worth the hour wait. Too bad they don't take reservations and have limited seating space, but the food is to die for!"
10/26/2015,20151026,3,4.12,"So going into this joint for the first time the decor and overall appearance is pretty basic.Its a very small restaurant and people start to pile in pretty quick. The waitress was nice however she had an accent and the place is loud as is,so we couldn't really hear her.The tablet she showed us had a bunch of stuff on it and it was kinda annoying sitting there listening to the memorized run down. Enough with that and let's go to the food. The food was good but not worth driving all they way out there to get basic breakfast. I had the Lobster Benedict which was yummy, the fam got pancakes,cheesy hash browns, and a deconstructed omelet.My bro said the omelette sucked and he could of made that junk at home which is very true. Anyone can cut up some vegetables, make a egg, and serve it to you. Oh and on the flip side I went to use the restroom and an employee came out of there and left pee in the toilet....so that was nice. Overall this joint is waaaayyyy overrated."
10/31/2015,20151031,4,4.12,"Expect to wait 1+ hour, but they're pretty good at texting you to let you know when you're up next. Colorful decor inside. We tried the flight French toast (strawberry was my personal fav) with their spiked pumpkin pie as the flavor of the week, the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken, & their crab Benedict with cheesy hash browns (my favorite of the 3). The lobster was cooked with garlic, but they did over cook 1 of my eggs... 1/2 runny yolks is okay though(; we had enough HEARTY food! I was bummed for only 0.5sec.. First world problems right? Needless to say, don't worry about dieting when you come here. I have the ITIS now (food coma). Thanks B&B.. It was delicious!"
11/1/2015,20151101,5,4.12,"My girlfriend and I came here late friday morning, around 11:30am and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get our seats. Blah, this was the first time we had to wait over three minutes during our week long journey in Chicago but it was well worth it!! Their most popular item here is the french toast flight and although they are amazing (my favorite was the Caramel and Blueberry), the items you certain must try include the Lobster Benedict and Cluck-N-Gaufre (basically chicken and waffles). You won't see the lobster benedict on the menu but it's written on this chalkboard hanging on the wall. I am generally not a fan of eggs benedict (only other benedict I like is the fried Catfish at Brenda's (SF)) but this was so amazing. The ""muffin"" is lobster pieces with some kind of batter and oh my god was it a perfect combination. The hash it came with was okay, but definitely had to eat it with some hot sauce.The Cluck-N-Gaufre (pronounced ""goof"") is the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. A bit strange to have a sweet potato waffle but it was delicious with the spiced chicken, hot sauce, and maple syrup. Supposedly the waffle was chicken stuffed but I didn't notice (most likely because I was hungry and wanted to devour this amazing goodness. Our food came out super quick also so that's always a plus in my book! A must go-to if you're ever in the Lakeview area. We were so fortunate this was place was close to our airbnb :)"
11/1/2015,20151101,4,4.12,Love the steak omelletes... And french toast... Chicken n waffle..a lil too sweet and the chicken was dry..but this was my second visit.. Crab omelletes mmmm so many delicious flavors
11/1/2015,20151101,4,4.12,It's one thing to wait 2 hrs for food. But to hear the female hostess talk crap about customers is another. Customers are already irritated because of the long wait. And to hear her say all the stupid shit makes you not want to get your business to this establishment.
11/3/2015,20151103,2,4.12,"Well... the place came highly recommended so we thought we would try it for brunch. Fist, the wait was insane... one hour... second, we responded to the text that our table was available within 2 min, and when we got to the front reseption desk within 3 min, we were given an attitude for been late,...  third, our weitress must of had a bad morning, cause she was in a bad mood, and did not even crack a smile, fourth,.. she got the order for my friend wrong and brought the wrong dish. But when the food finally got to us I have to admit it was good. Regardless, if you like long wait and snobby waitresses, and loud place...? Go for it. Personally, I will not go back."
11/4/2015,20151104,5,4.12,The breakfast was amazing.... Great job with everything and our server was very knowledge about the food. Loved the BYOB
11/4/2015,20151104,5,4.12,"First time ever eating here must say the service was quick my glass never went empty and the restaurant was clean. My server was very knowledgeable of the menu and quite friendly. I ordered three entrees for myself lol I had to try it ! Deconstructed steak omelet, the Lamb chop Trio , and the Crab omelet and I must say good God amazing. On top of all this great food they are BYOB and were playing house music I was in heaven. I suggest getting there early since there always packed and limited seating but once you've been sat and have ordered all of that is out the window"
11/4/2015,20151104,5,4.12,"Had breakfast here with my daughter today...it was well work every cent I spent. The service was awesome, shout out to waiter Tim!!! He gave great suggestions."
11/6/2015,20151106,5,4.12,"Another amazing dining experience. My husband is big on ambiance and exclusivity so I never figured he would not appreciate the often crowded, busyness of this place. I encouraged him to come. I ordered the steak omelet and he had the lamb chop omelet. The food arrived so quickly i was convinced it was the wrong order. It wasn't. After his first bite, my husband asked why I hadn't told him about this place sooner. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of my steak omelet. I tired the lamb chop. There was a burst of wonderful flavor. We were in food heaven. The server was incredible. Personable, non-intrusive, yet attentive and engaging despite the busyness. Kudos to this establishment and I look forward to my next visit."
11/6/2015,20151106,5,4.13,"Wait was long but the food was amazing! Worth it. Loved sitting at the ""community table"" and chatting with a few other parties.Great staff, pinnacle of Midwestern charm!"
11/7/2015,20151107,3,4.12,"Place is packed at 8:30 on a Saturday, but luck was on our side when we got seated right away...had the French toast flight, lobster benedict, eggs and bacon and side order of sausage...the waiter suggested that the French toast be sent out first as an appetizer which we agreed, but everything came at once, which is no big deal but it would have been nice if the waiter had acknowledged the error.The food was ok, I was expecting bigger pieces of lobster, but it was more like a crab cake mix...the French toast was good, and so was the rest of the food...now here is why I don't think I will be back...no ice tea...how strange is that...while the waiter appears very friendly, it does come off as being fake, the whole experience seemed very rushed and not relaxing at all, to make matters worse the bus boy insisted on clearing our plates...I was still working on the French toast and he insisted on taking all of the other plates leaving only the French toast plate, now I prefer not to eat off a plate that is shared, that was the biggest turn off...but I guess they were running low on dishes...my suggestion...go to ikea and get some more...it is not that expensive!!!"
11/8/2015,20151108,5,4.13,"Batter and Berries is well known for their French toast flights. I'm not a huge French toast person but if B&B can change my taste buds then this place is worth it. Their entire menu is nothing to be disappointed about. The chicken and waffles, crab cake Benedict, and the freshest fruit on this planet!I cannot wait until they expand, the wait time can be discouraging and turn people away of an experience that they will regret. Me and my bestie always get here at least 30 minutes before they open and at that time, there's a 10-12 person line outside. There's only street parking but you can always find something within a few blocks."
11/8/2015,20151108,1,4.12,"So I've tried numerous times to like B&B to no avail. While the food is good, the wait and experience always leaves me very frustrated and not happy with my decision to give this ""another try."" The lackluster customer service and wait queue leave a lot to be desired. We were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait. After waiting 2 hours and 15 minutes, we went inside to inquire. As soon as we did, we received a text that our table was ready. How coincedential. Once we get inside we find out that the text was merely to let us know to come inside and wait inside for a table. After watching 3 other parties be seated, we finally got our table. The lack of adequate space and overall concern for the customers experience are two reasons why I will not be back. Maybe I'll go if they open a larger location and that's highly unlikely. There are tons of places to eat in Chicago that have great brunch options and it doesn't take 2 hours and 15 minutes. This place is BYOB - Bring your own brunch."
11/9/2015,20151109,4,4.12,"The food was very yummy. A great place to eat brunch basics with a delicious twist. I am not giving 5 stars because I didn't like how rushed we were made to feel. The wait was almost 90 minutes long, which I fully expect and accept for Sunday brunch anywhere worth going. However, once we were in, the waitress didn't really give us time to look at the menu until we asked her to come back. She came back about 3 minutes later, spoke very fast, and felt cold in her delivery. The food was out in about 10 minutes and the ""ambiance"" music was fast paced techno. The overall feeing was, ""enjoy the food as fast as possible because we have a line, so hurry up."" It felt very automated. It was not the relaxing experience I expect on brunch Sundays and therefore can't give this place that 5th star."
11/9/2015,20151109,5,4.12,"After hearing so much about this place I decided to give it a try. My best friend had a Friday off so we drove down to Batter and Berries. I didn't expect a 40 Minute wait, but we wanted to try the place so we waited. We got a text literally 40 minutes after they said it would be 40 minutes so they are pretty accurate on that point.We were seated and greeted by our server within seconds. JESSICA was probably the friendliest server I have ever met. She was nice, energetic, and knowledgeable about the menu.We both ordered a suggestion of hers, I had the Lobster cake Eggs Benedict and my BFF had The Executive, which is steak and eggs....we also shared the Super French Toast Flight.So one little gripe I have, is that our juice pitcher came out several minutes after our food, and glasses for our juice minutes after that, BUT on the plus side, we waited nearly NO time for our food, seriously it was like magic how fast it came. Jessica again checked on us with a big smile.The Food: OMG.... I hate when restaurants don't season their food... That was NOT the case here. I didn't break out the salt or pepper for anything. Everything was seasoned perfectly. It was delicious. The french toast was amazing and I wish I had a better word for it. I didn't even realize that I didn't ask for syrup, you don't need it, it is awesome the way it is prepared. I even got a taste of my BFF's steak and it was perfect.My bill was a little high on account of me ordering the lobster cakes, but other than that I believe the prices are bargain.All in all, this place is great and a MUST visit in Chicago. The whole staff works together, and have great attitudes. The food is a showstopper and if you can get pass the long wait, which this place is worth, you will have a great experience."
11/13/2015,20151113,5,4.12,"I figure an update is due, because any of the issues i expressed in my initial review have been rectified, which makes this an even more inviting experience.First, the rotating menu is always innovative and surprising, and I think presenting new choices rather than always offering a static menu is commendable and ambitious. This wouldn't be such a positive feature if the offerings were not always as delicious as the intent. The servers are much more on top of things; even when the place is bustling. They never seem to be missing in action, either before or after we've finished, so no more concerns about the meter running out. A designated coffee server or two or four, routinely cruising the tables has answered my complaint about my three dollar cup of coffee that ran dry and was never refilled. Now I have to politely decline their bottomless cup approach! Last, since i'm a dyed in the wool omelet addict, I'm happy to say that their spinach and mushroom omelet has become my drug of choice. We visit at least once a month because I know I can count on a light, well seasoned, overly generous portion of goodness.This has become a staple in our rotating menu of Saturday breakfast haunts, and it never disappoints."
11/15/2015,20151115,2,4.12,"JUST WASN'T WORTH THE HR & 20m wait ... French toast flight was good , my bacon was nice and crispy I also order the crab omelette, omelette was decent the cheesy hash browns were wack undercooked sent them back twice came out the same way both times low grade ass American cheese better eat them quick or the shit will turn nto clay ... My waitress was nice it's a BYOB place tht was cool, other then that not worth waiting an hr anybody can make chicken and waffles whoop Dee dooo!!! Will I go back hummmm .... Not gonna wait on it , I'll take my ass to yolk. I knw its a black owned business so don't take my word for it try it out 4 your self ... P.s on the way out the guy ask me how was everything I told him the hash was cold&wack he said nxt time send it back .. Told him I did twice , he just had the GOOFY LOOK."
11/15/2015,20151115,1,4.12,"On 11/15/15...I am for supporting black own businesses, but this place is a joke! Me and my 13 year old been waiting since 10:40 am and it is now 11:54 am and we still have not been served. I talked to the rude person who checks you in after I noticed parties who arrived at least 15 mins. After we did being seated...not only did she get smart with me but I just left! I will not patronize a business where I receive bad customer service. No French toast is that good!"
11/19/2015,20151119,4,4.12,We had a great breakfast here with friends we hadn't seen in ages- the lemon french toast was unreal and the food came out so quickly. My 10 month daughter was with us and the server was so cute with her and brought her apple juice. They didn't rush us and checked on us several times without being intrusive.I want to go back and try more items....there was no wait but this was a Tuesday afternoon.I forgot to tip my server as I was dealing a fussy infant- and I've tried to rectify the situation by calling a few times- just a machine and no calls back or a live person which was disappointing ...so if you have a question about something I think it's better to just go in- I would definetly come back- and not forget to tip.
11/19/2015,20151119,4,4.12,"Batter and Berries is a must try if you live in or visiting Chicago. It's not your typical breakfast spot. You may not be able to get your traditional 'hungry man' full stack of buttermilk pancakes, eggs and sausage. With that being said, expect to have more of a party in your mouth. The food is spectacular, the service was superb and I would definitely go back. I've been twice now and I do have some must try items...You must try the French toast flight and turkey sausage. I didn't care for the lobster omelet, buffalo shrimp wrap or fries. It just wasn't good to me. They are a bit pricey. You don't get a lot of food so please don't expect to be overly full. Don't go during prime breakfast time, just don't do it. Saturday mornings....NO! The place is fairly small so the wait is going to be ridiculous. The waiting area is the size of your pinky. If you can then I would recommend trying this place during the week day."
11/22/2015,20151122,5,4.12,absolutely amazing! everything the entire party consumed was worth it.do be prepared to wait a while to be seated.
11/23/2015,20151123,5,4.12,"Batter & Berries...Ok, Ok, I feel you. This place is a definite contender for the ""Best Breakfast Spot of My Heart."" I mean c'mon now... FRENCH TOAST FLIGHTS?!?!?The lovely fiancé said we should check this joint out. So we did and B&B did NOT disappoint. We got there about 15 minutes before they opened (8am on a Sunday) and there was a line already forming. After seeing the line, I immediately knew that this place was going to be MAD DELICIOUS. When the doors opened, we were greeted with smiles and menus as the hostess directed us towards our seats.Our server was prompt, courteous, kind, friendly, and funny. He told jokes which definitely lightened up the morning mood, then made sure our drinks were filled to the brim each time he would visit our table.Here's what we ordered:-Sweet Potato Waffle w/Crispy Fried Chicken Breast-Biscuits & Gravy covered w/Sausage bits-French Toast FlightThat's it... I'm done with this review. This place is too delicious to continue to talk about. My head is going to explode. Goodbye."
11/23/2015,20151123,5,4.12,"Long wait at 9am on Sunday but worth it. Because we all wanted something sweet and something savory, it was fun to order different dishes and share a bit. I had the Cluck n' Gravy which was so delicious! The gravy had so much flavor, not as bland as gravy at other brunch places. And the presentation was great too, very colorful. I also tasted the cheese hashbrowns and the strawberry french toast. SO RICH and YUMMY. Friendly service too. Price wise, it's about the same as most brunch places but actually worth it. Well done!"
11/23/2015,20151123,5,4.12,"Let's start with the least impressive...I am visiting Chicago for the 1st time and this was my 1st stop. Walk in and we were seated within 2 mins, service was rendered shortly after and she was pleasant, her excitement for the food was contagious..you couldn't help but get excited. Food was cooked.to order in no time...favorite part of this adventure was the meal....ooh weee! Everything was cooked to perfection. I thought about the mealy entire trip. I couldn't wait to come back to Chicago just for another visit."
11/27/2015,20151127,5,4.12,My husband and and I are from the South and relish the taste of a true southern meal.  EVERYTHING was great!!!! We can wait for friends and family to visit. .
11/27/2015,20151127,5,4.12,"It was worth the wait!!! Their super flight French toast were to die for! It's a sampler of all the different French toast they had and each flavor has its unique tastes to it! Also has the lobster Benedict, amazing portion, but should be shared with friends!! Way way too much!! The crab omelette is yummy in your tummy!!"
11/29/2015,20151129,2,4.12,"Unsolicited suggestions have been given to us about B & B. So today being a weekday we decided to give it a try. We were surprised that at 12:15pm on a Monday we would have to wait 25 minutes for a table. The hostess although pleasant were dressed as if they were going for a run.Let's discuss the service- how does a waitress bring us the ""check"" before we have even placed our order? Better yet how can we place an order when we are not given menus until we ask for them? When we finally reviews the menu and chalkboard we really weren't impressed with the selections but decided to try the French toast flight. My husband and I decided to share it. On a scale of 1-5 we would give it a 3.One of our favorite meals to have is breakfast/brunch. This restaurant would not be part of our top ten places to return and eat our favorite meal of the day!"
11/30/2015,20151130,5,4.12,"This was a mindblowingly good breakfast and brunch place. I ordered the French Toast platter and was NOT disappointed. It came with 5 pieces of french toast, each one delicately laid out in a beautiful and colorful fashion. My waitress was very friendly and gave clear instructions a specific method and order to eat them in. There were fruity ones (blueberries, strawberries) and also nuttier ones (almonds). The butter was also a special concoction of flavors - not too sure what, but I loved it. I was instructed to eat from left to right, and I loved the order. I felt like I was being taken on a journey, from the more rustic wooden earthy nutty flavors which were warm and toasty for a cold Chicago winter, and then went on to the more sweeter and delicate fruit flavors. My friend got the chicken and waffles which were also really good, ""best chicken and waffles in my life"" according to him. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it, but I trust him on it. Overall, incredible brunch place. I would give a 6 out of 5 stars if I could!"
11/30/2015,20151130,5,4.12,I had an amazing experience. My dear friend thought this place would be great for a new brunch experience. I was blown away! Chef Rylon came to our table and I mentioned my food allergies the rest is history. Hats off to the Chef Rylon who treated us like ROYALTY!
12/1/2015,20151201,3,4.12,"I liked this place. Arrived early enough to beat the crazy lines that show up here. I would say you should get there about 830 or so to save some stress. We ordered the french toast flight. Which was a decent amount of food but not insane and it was tasty. There were a few hits. The lemon was amazing. The Strawberry was good too. The biggest winner of the total order was definitely the Cluck-N-Gaufre. The chicken was other-worldly and the house-made hot sauce was so great. This was by far the best thing we had and I would venture back for the same thing again. The service was fantastic. Not kidding when I say, the food hit the table about 2 minutes after we ordered. Which is great, unless you're trying to read the Sunday NYT and didnt make it to the sports section."
12/5/2015,20151205,5,4.12,One word .... Amazing.Food and staff = amazing! So worth the drive! It is by far the best French toast I've ever had (don't tell my mom lol). The hash browns were to die for!
12/6/2015,20151206,5,4.12,"As far as breakfast/brunch food goes, the creativity here is really high. Yes, they serve stuff you will find elsewhere but the way they do it is different than other places. Let's take for example something like Strawberry french toast. At other places, the french toast comes with strawberry on top. At Batter & Berries, strawberry is actually mixed in with the batter so it really tastes like that in almost every bite. Chicken and waffles? Other places just place chicken on top of the waffle. Batter & Berries actually cooks a little chicken inside the waffle itself as well as having one on top. The syrup? It's inside a butter - really good.The presentation of the plates is beautiful, the service is great, and the food is not only a creative riff on what you may find elsewhere, but it's executed very well. You can tell the executive chef here has had really good training. The vibe is great and full of people and energy. It's the best french toast I've ever had as well. Definitely recommended as one of the top 5 or 10 breakfast brunch places in the entire city."
12/8/2015,20151208,5,4.12,Interesting set up for seating! You may be seated at the big table with people you don't know BUT the amazing food offsets this. The food here actually tastes like the people who make the food and menu have a lot of passion behind it. I actually looked up the owner on linked in because I was amazed by the flavor AND the service. I ordered a crab omelette and my fiance got the lobster benedict...both came with the yummy hash browns. These items are seasonal so they were not on the menu...but they used real crab and real lobster and oh my goodness was it great! We also got the french toast flight....best ever! Make sure you get the hash browns piping hot they are oh so delicious. I just wish all the great tea they carry here would be available iced :( I had to ice it myself lol...but over all 5 Stars!
12/12/2015,20151212,5,4.13,My favorite brunch place in the city! The food here is absolutely phenomenal. The chicken and waffles is definitely everything it's cracked up to be. Probably the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The omelets are wonderful too. The crab omelet I had had plenty of juicy crab meat. This made me really happy because I feel that other brunch places skimp on such ingredients. The French toast everyone talks about here is delicious too! Personally the savory dishes are my preference but you can't go wrong with the sweets here. Despite having to wait nearly 2 hours on a busy Sunday morning...the meal is worth it.
12/13/2015,20151213,5,4.13,"Everything great that folks say about this place, is 100% accurate!! The service was great....the food was AMAZING! It is a small small small location, thus the long wait lines. We visited on a Monday morning, which didn't have the super long lines as the weekends, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. We were able to wait in their small waiting area in the middle of the restaurant, so the wait wasn't that bad. We had the pork chops, French Toast Flight, and the chicken and waffles."
12/14/2015,20151214,3,4.13,"I visited this place on 11/21/15 for my birthday brunch. My friends had the french toast flight and crab omelette. I ordered the french toast flight which was delicious along with chicken sausage. I also ordered the infamous chicken and waffles and it was sadly disappointing. The chicken was flavorful with a sweet and spicy sauce but the waffle was so DRY and flavorless. I would go back if I were in the area and had a wait of less than 20 minutes, while the french toast was good it wasn't quite wait an hour and a half good. FYI: They charge an undercover corkage fee by requiring you purchase juice or ""Batter and Berries"" flutes per person. All in all they were ok but I probably will not make a special drive from Evanston in the future."

12/15/2015,20151215,5,4.13,"We are big breakfast folks, our favorite meal to eat out on a regular basis. This was one of the best breakfast experiences we have had! Everyone's meal was equally good, yet completely unique. Who would have thought biscuits and gravy would pair with a fabulous coleslaw??? The lobster omelette was top-notch, and the deconstructed spinach omelette was a joy. We shared some lemon french toast, it was like nothing we'd had before! The service was superb, we're just sad to be living in New Hampshire at present, so we can only return once or twice a year when we come home to visit family!!!!"
12/18/2015,20151218,5,4.13,"I absolutely loved the Baileys French toast, so delicious ! And the hot chocolate was amazing. The service was great our server was knowledgeable and our food came out quick."
12/18/2015,20151218,4,4.13,"I was sorta unimpressed by the long line and small venue. The first thing that came to mind was their marketing team was stellar, because the internet buzz was through the roof. Everyday, I would see raving reviews about this place. My aunt was even pushing me to get here. In the heart of Lincoln park, where parking isn't feasible. I decided I would see what all the hype was about. We get there and there was a wait to wait list. Fortunately, the lady who runs the spot recognized she knew me from somewhere and decided to put me on the list because it was only two of us. The ambiance feels like they were very smart and practical with finding a great location *which is key*,, as opposed to making the experience comfy. The seats are a little hard for my liking while enjoying a meal, but I must say the seafood omelette with lobster was AMAZEBALLS. I actually was impressed, the waffles were mouth watering. The portion sizes are plentiful. I would definitely go back again, but not on the weekend."
12/23/2015,20151223,4,4.13,"Holy brunch!!!! This place is so good! Let me get to the point my friend and I ordered the French toast flight and the lobster/spinach omelette. Talk about a party in my mouth. The omelette was an egg white omelette that came with spinach, parmesan,lobster (maybe something else but I don't remember), and a side of cheesy hash browns. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the flavor was out of this world. The French toast flight was pretty amazing as well (come from someone who has literally never ordered anything sweet for breakfast). The French toast flight included a strawberry, lemon zest, blueberry and pecan French toast. Each bite was more amazing than the previous. I didn't love the long wait so early but it was totally worth it. I would most definitely come back!"
12/23/2015,20151223,5,4.13,We got the French toast flight...the Carmel one on there is to die for! Also got the chicken and waffles...very good as well! Sausage was too spicy for my 8 year old and they took it back and comped it...place was packed and we were here on a Wednesday morning! Pass on the hash browns....
12/25/2015,20151225,4,4.13,The sweet potato waffle and fried chicken breast are amazing together! It's a quaint little spot for yummy breakfast and brunch dining and the service is phenomenal!
12/27/2015,20151227,5,4.13,The most amazing unique breakfast experience you will ever have! The food here is outstanding you can't go wrong with whatever you order. Service is impeccable waitstaff is very attentive. The wait at times can be long but well worth the wait!
12/27/2015,20151227,5,4.13,"If i could give 10 stars, this place would definitely get it. Oh my gosh, i have no words for how amazing the food tasted. We ordered the french toast flight and the chicken-n-gaufre. Every piece of french toast had so much flavor. My first time not using syrup. I was shocked! The chicken stuffed waffle is a must try. Wow, the hour wait was definitely worth it. I am telling everyone i know to try this place. You will not be disappointed. Pam, the waitress was so friendly and the way she described the entrees made me want to try everything. Rylon, well done and thank you!"
12/27/2015,20151227,3,4.13,"I do love this place. We live across the street and go often. Unfortunately the hostess was so rude on our last trip it might be our last. She told us where we couldn't stand without offering much of a solution. I've met the owner who is a great guy and most of the staff is awesome. Unfortunately when your front door is rude, it's hard to enjoy the great meal."
12/28/2015,20151228,2,4.13,"I really REALLY wanted to like this place. In short: the food is great (when it comes out hot that is), but the service is horrible. My very first visit was back in 2014 when myself and family decided to give the highly talked about restaurant a shot. We went on a week day, and were able to sit down within 30 minutes. The food was hot (I ordered the Banana Nut Belgique), and the service was amazing. The food was amazing. Everything was perfect.Due to my first experience, I talked to so many people about the place, and decided to go with more of my family. 2nd visit was the complete opposite. We went on a Saturday morning (9:30 am), and the wait was an hour and 15 minutes, and our server wasn't very nice. It was a bigger party this time (about 7 people), and when the chef brought our food out himself, he practically through our plates on the table (I'm guessing because it was busy?). 3rd visit and final straw. Visited this establishment the day after Christmas. Arrived at 1:00 pm. Was told by the hostess the wait would be an hour. Perfect. Gave her my cell phone number, and she confirmed they would text after an hour. I hung out with my family at a little brewery across the street for an hour, and then walked back over to the restaurant.. As I walked in, the hostess was too busy looking at a package of nutter butters where she didn't acknowledge me for at least 2 minutes. I politely said, ""Excuse me"" to get her attention. She puts the nutter butters down, and then says nothing. (Talk about great customer service). Again. I politely ask, ""how much longer is the wait?"" after giving her my name. She responds saying, ""We don't give an estimated time because we can never be too sure when someone will leave their table."" Then why tell people from the beginning the wait at most would be an hour? So I resorted to asking her how many people were ahead of us, she replied, ""8."" At this rate I turned to my brother, who was from out of town, and asked what he wanted to do. Of course since he had not been to Chicago in a very long time and an hour and 20 minutes were already invested into our wait, he responded saying, ""Let's wait 30 more minutes, and if it's still a lot of people ahead, we will leave."" I thought he was crazy, but then I saw a lot of people were clearing out, so we it appeared as though we would be sitting soon. Exactly after 30 minutes, we received our table. The popular item of choice at the table was the French toast flight, and I resorted to my usual banana nut belgique. Our waiter was very nice (the same waiter that served me on my very first trip), and the food of course was amazing. (Only cons were, all meals weren't brought out at the same time. My brother received his meal when others at our table had begun eating already. Everyone politely waited at least 10 minutes in an effort to not be rude, but his food still had not come). Until this guy gets a bigger establishment, it'll be a headache trying to get a table. And until this guy get's a bigger establishment, I will not be returning.. I'm sorry there is no French toast at this point in my life that is worth waiting 2 hours for paired with bad rude employees. I'll pass."
1/2/2016,20160102,2,4.12,I was really dissappointed in my visit to batter and berries. I normally do not write reviews but I feel that this experience warranted one.Everyone knows the food is great and the chef always delivers with fresh ingredients. The bad part is the most important part of a restaurant and that is the service. The service was horrible from the hostess with inconsiderate wait lines. I say inconsiderate because the way they put you in their waiting list for very long times. They treat the waiting like a fast food spot but it's a brunch spot where time is of value to customers.The food is great. The service is what holds it back for me. I have told others it's hard to give business to a restaurant that truly may not care for its patrons.
1/2/2016,20160102,5,4.13,"This place is tiny but packs a lot of flavor , I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast restaurant."
1/4/2016,20160104,1,4.12,"My review is not based on the quality of food but its customer service. I visited this place last week and was told 10mins wait time. I waited over 40 mins for the table and never got one. Got a message 5mins after I left but it was too late.The whole experience is important for the customer at your restaurant, not just whats on the plate. What happens at the front desk is equally important as what happens in the kitchen! Very disappointed!"
1/5/2016,20160105,5,4.12,"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday today & we LOVED it! It was both our first time. The host was very nice & we were seated right away. It was a pretty nice crowd for a Tuesday. Our waitress was very nice as well & made sure we were okay. I had the French Toast flight w/Blueberry, Strawberry, Caramel, Lemon & Grape Champagne, a side of Cheese Crusted Hash Browns, and Bacon. He had a Caramel French Toast Flight w/Eggs & Bacon. Overall nice staff. The food came out fast & everything was simply DELICIOUS! Will be coming back again soon!"
1/8/2016,20160108,2,4.12,"Meh, is it just me or is this place overrated? I went on a Thursday with friends for brunch. We weren't expecting a crowd on a Thursday, but this place was PACKED. They wouldn't seat us until our whole party was present, even though a friend just went to find parking and was going to be back in five minutes. We found the hostess to be pretty rude - not just to us but to other parties we saw her sitting. In addition, the food was just okay. I got the deconstructed steak omelette. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Definitely ask for the sauce on the side or otherwise your breakfast is going to be soaked in red wine sauce. My friends ordered french toast, their specialty. One friend even got the french toast flight to try out different specialty flavors. Everyone at the table wasn't super impressed. They were all just okay. The on great thing about this place is BYOB. We enjoyed some mimosas with champagne we brought ourselves. Overall I don't think this place is worth the wait."
1/9/2016,20160109,5,4.12,"Love this place! the portion size was just perfect unlike other brunch places. we started off with the French toast platter(this is their specials ask the waiter) I had an omelette with grilled veggies and curly fries. the omelette was tasty and very homemade fee to it.if you go before 9am you will get a seat within 15 min.they do require all the party to be seated so if you are waiting on your friends to come, you won't get a table till they show up."
1/10/2016,20160110,5,4.12,Love this spot and the food. Wonderful service and friendly atmosphere.
1/11/2016,20160111,4,4.12,"Service was good, food was outstanding!!!!! I would give 5 stars, but the restaurant is really small & overcrowded. Try the executive pork chop you would not be disappointed. (The Gravy is delicious) best breakfast I've ever had."
1/14/2016,20160114,5,4.12,"Simply an incredible breakfast. Creative meals that are beautifully presented by attentive and friendly staff. What is not too love. After two visits my favs: home pork breakfast sausage, cheesy hashbrowns, and buttermilk pancakes. My daughter claims the french toast ""super"" flight was awesome, and the hot chocolate (it was 9 degrees outside) was ""best ever""."
1/14/2016,20160114,5,4.12,Phenomenal service!!!! Delishious!!!! Culinary creations at its BEST!!!! Their salmon is unbelievable! DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!!!! :)
1/16/2016,20160116,5,4.13,The food was amazing!! Best french toast I've ever had. I will definitely come back again. Great service as well.
1/19/2016,20160119,2,4.12,"I used to go here at least once a month with my boyfriend. I went one morning with my boyfriend and his friend and as we were just getting our food, the power went out. Immediately, the manager calls a meeting and tells his servers to let their tables know whoever pays in cash gets 20 percent off their bill. Right away worrying about how people will be paying for their food they can't see. We finish and the power comes back on. My friend goes to pay with cash and the waitress brings back the check and says so the power came back on so there's no discount. What?! What is happening right now? I could care less about a discount and even eating in the dark because the food at this place is AMAZING. But, I probably won't be back for awhile because this really rubbed me the wrong way."
1/21/2016,20160121,1,4.12,"Aye aye aye!!! Where shall I begin?Firstly, I would not return to this establishment if my immortal soul were at stake! Incredibly overrated and the staff is mediocre at best. The food was forgettable and the overall atmosphere was extremely loud and cramped! My friends and I felt like sardines in a can. We were seated very close to the kitchen and cutlery area which meant that we had to endure staff taking forks and knives frequently as we made an earnest but foolhardy attempt at conversation and enjoyment of the meal.The one good thing, which taught me a lesson for future dining, was that we were seated immediately upon entering as we had made prior reservations. NOTE KIDS: ALWAYS CALL AHEAD AT ANY RESTAURANT!A word of caution to all yea who contemplate dining here, DONT!!! There are far better restaurants in Andersonville, Lakeview and Logan Square than this dump."
1/21/2016,20160121,5,4.12,"The French toast here is to die for! They have a lobster Benedict, it was simply amazing. They are always crowded so it's best to get there early or be prepared to wait!"
1/22/2016,20160122,5,4.12,"My sister and I, finally got to this place. We both really enjoyed it. We found parking directly across the street, we were seated right away and the food only took about 10-15 mins after ordering. We ordered, French toast flight, peach cobbler French toast and the steak omelet. I'll definitely go back one day."
1/24/2016,20160124,4,4.12,"First time going, and I must say the overall experience was great. The sample french toast flight was perfect. The executive rib eye steak was amazing. However the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle topped with a delicious fried chicken breast & drizzled in a nutmeg hot sauce & b&b maple butter, was not so tasty. The only issue with this dish was the waffle it self. It was gross, it reminded me of a plain baked sweet potato with an awkard extract flavoring with molasses. But hey that's just my opinion. I suggest they revamp the ""sweet potato waffle"". Probably should mimic a sweet potato pie batter, and make the waffle that way."
1/25/2016,20160125,5,4.12,Hands down the best breakfast place I have been to in a long time. They open at 8:00am everyday. I recommend being there when the door opens on the weekends because it is very busy. It is totally worth the wait though. I had the french toast flight and it was AMAZING!!!!! Also...you might have to wait for a table...but they bring your food out quick and hot!!!
1/27/2016,20160127,5,4.12,"What a great brunch place! Yes, the wait on weekends can be a turn off. It may have taken us an hour or two before we were seated. We just took the time to go check out the bean and other statues around the park during this time, as a part of my traveling no wasting time policy. We did grab a coffee and red velvet roll after getting our name taken down so it filled our bellies for a little while. They also give you a remote thing that vibrates and flashes when your table is ready. The menu was filled with all my favorite brunch foods it made choosing just one thing really difficult. I went with the corned beef hash topped with an eggs Benedict and needless to say it was orgasmic. My boyfriend got the skillet and it was huge and very delicious. We had to order pancakes so we got it as dessert. All. Amazing. The wait is so worth and I'm an extremely impatient person who thinks waiting is a waste of time. To top it off, our server was very sweet and helpful in helping us decide on our entrees."
1/27/2016,20160127,1,4.12,"We were denied a table at batter & berries due to the smugness of the manager/partner, Jared (?), and the hostess and their choice not to accommodate a pregnant woman. This was suppose to be our last meal before being induced later today. We visited the restaurant on Wednesday, January 27 around 11:30 am. The restaurant was about 65% full; there was no wait; and there were several 4 sets available. We informed the hostess that we wanted a 4 set, one which happened to have 3 chairs, because my wife's sister would be joining us after we ordered. The hostess told us that they won't seat incomplete parties. We tried to explain the circumstance and that her sister would be joining us to help us get to the hospital. The hostess cut us off by saying:""She can come but she won't be able to sit down.""How do you deny someone a seat? I then told the hostess my sister-in-law would be ordering food, to which she replied:""She can't order.""At this point, my wife's mind was made up and she heard toward the door in time for the manager to come over. I tried to explain to him what transpired and he told me that this was their policy. He told me that since this was their downtime, he would accommodate us by letting us sit at the high top community table and if a seat was available for her at the time of her arrival, she could sit in it. I said this doesn't work and that my wife was now upset to which he shrugged his shoulder and said, ""I accommodated you.""But did he? Because the seat was a barstool for a 9-month pregnant woman? Because her sister, who was going with us to the hospital, may not have a seat? We decided against going to batter and berries.Instead we went to Southport Grocery and had an amazing meal and ordered way too much. Southport Grocery, who also has barstools, understands the needs of patrons. Where would you rather go: a place that serves ego or a place that offers a fun food experience?I agree with several other reviewers who say dump batter & berries."
1/27/2016,20160127,5,4.12,This place is great! The service is fast (our order came out within 15 minutes) and the food was flavorful. The staff was very polite and came to check on us frequently. It was a little crowded but we went at lunch time on a weekday so it's to be expected especially for a place with such good food. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
1/28/2016,20160128,1,4.12,"Basic!!! Rude hostess with the worst attitude. My waitress was adorable and my super flight French toast were basic. I will never go back and wait an hour and a half for two people. The food has no quality at all, you can find same or better stuff at iHop. The place is too loud and I had to sit next to six other people because they have a sharing table in the middle. I posted a picture of my view while eating brunch yuck..."
1/28/2016,20160128,1,4.11,"This place is overrated. We had the most rude hostess. The food is nothing special, and way overpriced. I'v definitely had better at IHOP. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich in buffalo sauce and the breaking was soggy. :/"
1/29/2016,20160129,5,4.12,So yummy we had the French toast flight and biscuits and chicken gravy so good. My new favorite is lemon French toasts. Grat service too
1/30/2016,20160130,5,4.12,"Came here on a weekday morning. Don't come on the weekend unless you actually want to wait an hour and a half to be seated. We didn't wait at all since we went on a weekday.We ordered the Crab cakes with poached eggs, Salmon omelet, Apple belgique, and the Banana nut belgique with their fried chicken on the side. This place knows how to make amazing breakfast food! They cook all eggs perfectly. You will not be disappointed. I still dream about the food at this place. And not only is the food amazing, the service is awesome. It was free entertainment. Jackson is the best waiter in this place!!! Get his tables if you can."
2/1/2016,20160201,4,4.12,LOVE this place best breakfast place in Chicago hands down the food is amazing. I love the people that work there and the prices only reason for 4 is a little tight I space
2/5/2016,20160205,5,4.12,"The best French toast ever!!! Omgggg, that brown sugar butter, I can put that on anything. I got the French toast flight which included different flavors. You get everything you want, inventive, traditional, fruity, nutty, creamy, sweet. Just perfect. The owners and workers were very welcoming and accommodating."
2/5/2016,20160205,4,4.12,"Wow. I came here 2 times in one week (on accident). The first time, I had their Shrimp Gloucester Omelet, which was the special for the week. A seasoned egg omelet that was topped with 3 jumbo shrimp and shrimp sauce. On the side were cheesy, crispy hash browns. For my two year old, I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which he enjoyed. This time, it was myself, my friend and my son and it went well.The second time, I ordered strawberry french toast, pork sausage patties, and hash browns. The strawberry french toast was a little soggy at the bottom but edible, my sausage was a little bit pink so I ate around one and gave the other away, but the hash browns were delicious. When I received the bill, I saw a charge for the coffee which I thought was complimentary. It would have been nice to let me know it wasn't free instead of just asking if we wanted coffee. Now, you will wait 45 min - 1 hr 15 min for seating. This isn't an issue for me. My issue was getting into the restaurant after getting my seating text from them, and then having wait longer in the restaurant. I was with a group of 5, including myself, and we were told we were going to get a certain table. However, when the women at that table got up and left, they seated another group. I think the frustration on our faces showed as a host kept asking if we were doing ok. But, once we sat down, it was smooth sailing. The waiters both times were pleasant, but the guy I had the second time was very funny and very concerned about our happiness with the food and service. I think I will go here again."
2/7/2016,20160207,5,4.12,"Wait took awhile, but it was worth it. Chicken sandwich was one of the best I have had and fries were good too. Waffles were good, especially with the maple butter.Owner was a presence in the restaurant and talked to us on the way out.Friendly and funny. I was in a group of 5, and we stayed awhile. Waitress was nice and helpful, answered questions and rung us all up separately.Heads up- it was loud inside because it was crowded and the architecture of the space."
2/9/2016,20160209,2,4.12,Good food but extremely rude staff.
2/10/2016,20160210,5,4.12,"The best french toast, the best bacon, the best hash browns.... everything is literally perfect.Their chicken and sweet potato waffle is also divine. My favorite brunch restaurant in the city."
2/11/2016,20160211,5,4.12,"I was there for lunch today and had the most amazing food. I had the deconstructed chicken fajita omelet. So good. Plus, we had a super, great waiter. Tim couldn't be nicer and I think everyone at my table felt like we just made a new friend. Love this place and think I have to come back to try their french toast."
2/13/2016,20160213,5,4.12,"This place was amazing. They text you when your table is ready and the food was absolutely delicious. You can tell the moment you walk in, everything is made from real fresh food! The aroma almost made me hungry again even as I was walking out with a full stomach. Definitely coming back!"
2/14/2016,20160214,5,4.12,"Today was my first time trying this place, and I was truly amazed. Went for Valentine's Day so it was a bit crowded( to be expected), and now I see why. The food was absolutely amazing. I really can't say too much more about it, because I can't think of any other words to describe it. I had the shrimp Gloucester omelette and the strawberry French toast. You have to mentally prepare for the flavor party that takes place in your mouth. Today was my first time, and I'm already planning my next visit!"
2/15/2016,20160215,3,4.12,I have been here many many times and the food is always five star. The thin young hostess in the other hand is a five start BIT*h!! I observed her seat her friends above others yell and roll her eyes at customers and seat people out of order. Speak rudely to customers with small children present. It's really sad a place with such great food and a friendly manager employs a person who should be White Castle employee. Today will be the last time I stop here for a meal.
2/16/2016,20160216,5,4.12,"What a spectacular breakfast experience! Incredibly friendly staff; a very engaged chef and owner; delicious, well-thought-out food. I live in Hyde Park, but I'll drive up at least once a month from now on for this breakfast. I can't wait to share this place with friends! I wish this place the greatest success."
2/16/2016,20160216,5,4.12,"Great food! I loved the atmosphere and the waitress was great also. Very nice, a breathe of fresh air for me."
2/16/2016,20160216,5,4.12,"This place was jam packed when I came in but I waited it out and it was worth it! The staff here is very professional and calm in the face of crazy crowds and lots of people being... people. The chicken and waffle is famous for a reason. They have great coffee and I had perfectly done over medium eggs, too. PERFECTLY done! I couldn't have asked for better service or food. So enjoyable and worth the wait, but maybe have a snack before you come because you may wait for 1-2 hours!"
2/17/2016,20160217,4,4.12,"I had bookmarked this place a few weeks ago. I knew ahead of time that the wait on a Saturday was going to be long, I put our names in, though people were shoved inside a three foot stretch of space between the entrance and the hostess stand)... they were to shoot you a text when your spot would be ready. 80 min. I could see and smell the amazingness that was happening beyond these starved guests and I said, well, lets go in search of coffee and champagne (that ought to kill some time in the 10 degree weather outside). It is BYOB, and thank goodness, because who the hell waits 80 min without some sort of incentive... Unfortunately, there isn't anything walking distance as far as a coffee shop or liquor store, but we had plenty of time to figure that out.Our text was received around the 80 minute mark, and I felt the rush of excitement come over me like when you've been waiting in the line at the DMV and your number is called, but then you suddenly have to pee. Yes, that kind of rush and excitement. I basically maul over the people in the coffee shop to head back to Batter & Berries. The hostess (bless her heart) is still slammed between taking numbers down and getting people in who've been in the 80 min. line. We were sat in the back (on a cold winters day, the front of the restaurant gets very drafty with the thousand people opening and closing the door - which the server sporting long sleeves knew what she was getting into when she got her section that morning). Our server was bubbly and sweet, Leslie. Very animated, I felt like I was at Disney! Even though there is madness ensuing around me, she stays peppy and informs us of the specials and how many orders they have left of the more popular items that day. With an iPad system, its like clockwork, a tight run ship. I am very impressed. She brings us a bain marie (in kitchen lamens terms its a cylindrical shaped insert for soups or sauces to be put into a hot or cold table in the kitchen).... not sexy, but serves the purpose. She offers us OJ for our mimosas. Ahhh, now the bubbly is here!If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I'm in search of this cities' best chicken and waffles... Of course I order the Cluck-N-Gaufre. It is a crispy waffle made of sweet potato, and topped with a perfectly fried breast of chicken. The spices are on point. Served on the side is a ramekin of nutmeg hot sauce (which I tried, but the maple butter was good enough for me). Oh my (if I could swear here I would), that waffle, every morsel was just holy. I imagine church goers singing hallelujah coming here after service to indulge in this divinity. The combination of the sweet potato and the saltiness of the chicken cured any Friday night ailments I may have had. A real stand up dish.The cheesy hash browns were cold, and before I could complain, a server came and scooped the plate up, and replaced it within 60 seconds with a brand new plate of HOT cheesy potatoes. Maybe a little salt needed, otherwise pretty good.Also had the bruleèd banana waffle. Very tasty, nice thick pieces of biased sliced bananas, with a light layer of burnt sugar and creme anglaise. It definitely could've had more anglaise. The GM came over and was the jolliest of fellows (I'd like to invite him over for dinner kind of guy), asking us how everything was and our input. I am stuffed and tipsy at this point, and happy. Belly happy. My only negative comment is the glazed mosaic tables. The edges of the table and in the middle are very uneven, so you have to be very careful where you situate your glasses."
2/18/2016,20160218,4,4.12,"I am not a big breakfast person by any means and most of the time I would rather get up on my own time and just make a bagel or something quick. I went here with a couple of friends to try it out since my buddy was referred to this place before. This was honestly one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten. They are famous for their chicken and waffles as well as their flight of French toast with over 100 unique flavors. I ended up getting the chicken Alfredo omelet and it was very tasty. All omelets come with their cheesy hash browns, which were also very good. I am not a big sweets person so that's why I did not get the French toast but my buddy said it was one of the best things he's eaten.This place is extremely popular with long lines and sometimes there are waits to be seated with it being a smaller venue. Very quick service so sometimes it may feel rushed but that is only because they need to turn over tables quickly with how busy it can be. Some people may not enjoy that but it did not bother me. All in all great breakfast spot and most people wouldn't notice unless you paid attention since it's a smaller location."
2/18/2016,20160218,5,4.12,"Omg! Decided to take myself out to bunch. Second time here & I love it. The food is fresh and good. I had the special ""shrimp Alfredo omelette. Strawberries and champagne toast. Bacon and hash browns. Yummy. I ordered my food and it came right out. The server was very friendly and knowledgable! This place is a keeper! It's very popular so please be mindful of the time you go. It's also bring your own bottle in case you want mimosas. The place is small so keep that in mind if you have something against small places. The area is Lincoln park so it's pay to park."
2/18/2016,20160218,5,4.12,"My husband took me there this past weekend for our Valentine Anniversary, I was super excited.! My son met us there with his wife and 11 month old and the wait was 90 minutes. I didn't mind the wait because my son and his wife had eaten there a couple of times before and gave it rave reviews! The way he described the lobster eggs, French toast flight, and pancakes! Oh my! Would make anyone's palate drizzle with a desire to taste! So there we were with anticipation. After receiving a text to be seated we were happy and surely not disappointed! Our waiter was very nice and kept a smile in spite of the crowd and the fast pace of the restaurant. I told my husband I wasn't going to eat much but after going over the menu several times and seeing the delicious, colorful, plates of food passing the mere appearance was so appetizing and appealing. I ordered the French toast flight, eggs with spinach, cheese, mushrooms, cheesy hash browns! chicken sausage, Me oh my!! As they were bringing our food to the table I felt my tummy laughing with hunger as my eyes lite up all over again. Lol Finally, the taste.. Freshness! Flavor! deliciousness! Savory juicy chicken sausage, the eggs & hash browns cooked to the right firmness and texture the way i love them, the French toast with the right amount of sweetness . You can't go wrong with whatever you try here! Worth the wait time, drive and price. Everyone at my table was happy and satisfied! Even the baby happily eating his pancakes. Batters & Berries unique flavor in every bite mounds of deliciousness that makes you want to come back for more!"
2/20/2016,20160220,5,4.12,"Not too pleased with waiting 2 hours to eat..everybody looks too grumpy to enjoy the good looking food after such a long wait.It's honestly just that popular, I don't blame the management! The place could definitely do within upstairs balcony or something of the sort for extra space. Food looks divine, I must say!if I were a pup I'd be drooling and the flavors hits all the right spots too!!AMAZING FLAVORS!!"
2/20/2016,20160220,1,4.12,"I had a horrible experience here with my two friends. I live close by and always saw a line, so one day when we were up early we decided to go. The wait was fine, but when the food game it was incredibly mediocre. We sat and ate/drank. It is BYOB which I liked. The service was average. At the end 2 of us paid on card, and one of us paid in cash. I saw her put down a $20 and $5 bill on top of her check which more than covered her bill, tax and tip (she had made a comment about tip which was why I noticed). As were walking out we get across the street to our uber and the waitress yells for one of my friends to come back. We thought that she most likely left something, and I see that our window table is mostly cleared. After 3-4 min we go in to see what happened leaving the uber which charges us for canceling. The waitress claims that my friend only left $5 and owed more. My friend turned all her pockets inside out, tore her purse apart to make sure she didn't make a mistake, but she found no $20. Throughout all of this the waitress has the worst, most accusatory attitude. I point out that she's basically accusing my friend of lying, and she fires back well you're accusing me stealing. And I said... ""No, someone clearing the table could have taken it, bumped it and it could be on the floor, and new people are now sitting there obscuring the view."" The manager comes over, completely unsympathetic and also with an attitude, stating he'll go check the cameras. My friend and I wait for 20min while he's in the back. She eventually stands up and walks toward the kitchen, the hostess comes running at her that she's not allowed back there, and the manager notices the commotion, comes out and says ""oh, I forgot about you guys. I checked the tapes and I do see you put two dollars bills down, but when she picks it up its only 1, so I don't know what happened."" My friend says ""... So now what? I mean I really don't want this to come out of her paycheck as it's neither of our fault"" and he says ""well, we'll see. You can go."" We walked out feeling really confused and annoyed at how much time we wasted. The whole experience was unfriendly, unprofessional, and I will never go back or recommend this restaurant. No redeeming qualities."
2/21/2016,20160221,1,4.12,"The main issue with this place is that they seat who they want when they want. I was first given an hour & 15 min wait, that turned into 2 hours. We saw people go up and put their name on the list with bigger parties who were seated earlier than us. They move people up before you like you aren't a paying customer as well. I'll try this one time & never come back."
2/24/2016,20160224,5,4.12,"I love this place. I can't seem to try another breakfast joint because this place is so damn yummy. The waffle staples are all awesome, but the rotating specials is what keeps me coming back. Just go and try it out. It's breakfast with a southern and Cajun approach."
2/24/2016,20160224,5,4.12,The blackberry rum cheesecake french toast was the best of the best. I will defiantly be back to try out the many other foods. I'm amazed at the how great the food was with suck little wait once you ordered. The space is a bit small so I couldn't imagine going on a weekend but being able to go on a weekday was amazing. I haven't had this good of a breakfast for a LONG time. Thank you friendly staff and great chef
2/28/2016,20160228,3,4.12,"Awesome fajita omelet! They make homemade hot sauce that is to die for. French toast flight was good too, but not super filling alone."
2/28/2016,20160228,5,4.12,One of my favorite places for breakfast! My Mom and I were looking for a place to eat. I wanted to take her some place nice and a place that she'll enjoy since she was visiting me. I immediately thought about Batter & Berries. OMGoodness! We both weren't disappointed at all. I had the Crab Benedict and she had the French Toast flight. I had two bites of eggs and potatoes left. My Mom asked for a to go container to take it home. That's just how good it was! I ordered a Crab Benedict to go for my boyfriend. It took a lot of will-power to not eat it! Batter & Berries: HANDS DOWN YOU ARE THE BEST!!
3/3/2016,20160303,5,4.12,Awesome experience!! One of my favorite Chicago eateries. Customer service is great & food is the best!!  Their menu has a large variety of foods to choose from. I had the health nut salad. Most places will serve a bland & cheap looking salad. Not here!! It truly was the best salad I ever had with tons of fresh veggies and fruits. I will be going back there soon :)
3/4/2016,20160304,5,4.12,"Believe the hype! This place was excellent. Went at 2pm on a Friday and got seated within 5 minutes. When the server takes your order they have an ipad that shows pictures of all the foods as well in the case you need a visual. The chicken and waffles, as well as the lobster Benedict were BOMB. The french toast, while it looked pretty lacked good flavor so wouldnt get that again. I'll be back!"
3/5/2016,20160305,5,4.12,"Went here first thing on a Saturday morning, got seated right away. Service was really great but that French toast flight was phenomenal. My favorite was the strawberry, red velvet and caramel pecan."
3/5/2016,20160305,3,4.12,"Great food, great service. but wow. too crowded and people constantly coming and in cluelessly wandering around looking for the hostess. door constantly blowing cold air onto people. not a family friendly joint. fast-paced environment. but great food so worth a try for sure for the french toast."
3/6/2016,20160306,4,4.12,"I'll start off with a positive comment. The food was absolutely scrumptious! I had the deconstructed spinach omelet. It was just the right size and the best I ever had. However, I was told it would be a 2 hour wait. I'd been here before and was already aware of the long wait times. Although I find it annoying, It wasn't a surprise. Anyway, after waiting 2 hours I approached the hostesses who told me my name was not on the list. The man who entered my name into the ipad for the waiting list showed up and I asked him why name wasn't on the list. He found my name but said according to his ""system"" I'd only been waiting for 81 minuets! I showed him the text sent to me by him to confirm the time that I was placed on the list which read 12:01 p.m. and it was then 2:00 p.m. Once I showed him the text, he said I don't know why it is showing you've been waiting 81 minuets instead of 2 hours but we have people who have been waiting 115 min and I have to seat them. Huh???? By now I am beyond pissed off! I then tell him I've been waiting just as long if not longer than other people have! He responds ""well we sent you another text after the first one""! Again, huh? First, what does that have to do with how long I have been waiting? Second, I never got a second text. My grandchildren were with me and were hungry and excited about this French Toast I told them about that was so good. If not for that......! They finally let us sit in the ""waiting area"" inside the restaurant for another 30 minuets instead of in our car or on the sidewalk. I went out to get the rest of my party and someone who was leaving let the door go and it slammed right into my face! Hard! I saw stars and I was dizzy. One of the waitresses seemed very concerned and got me an ice pack. The host who I had been arguing with about my seating was very nonchalance and I believe he thinks I was faking. Not my style. Needless to say, there were no apologies. No offer to comp the meal. No nothing. I am sitting here with a headache as I type this review. The door issue really needs to be addressed. It closes way too hard and too fast. It is a lawsuit waiting to happen. All in all, I think the this establishment needs to stop taking their customers for granted. They're here today but they could be gone tomorrow. I would have given it 10 stars had it not been for the lack of concern about my injury and the complete disregard for the screw up on the wait list. Get it together Batter and Berries. You are not the only game in town!"
3/6/2016,20160306,1,4.12,"The Hostess was extremely rude and rolled her eyes at an elderly lady asking questions about the text check in. This should have been my first warning to go elsewhere. She told us it would be an hour wait so we walked down the street to grab coffee, when I got the text an hour and 45 mins later, I sent my wife in while I closed up. They sat her and asked where I was... she said I was walking over and they made her get up and leave the table and gave it away telling us it would be another hour wait. That expectation was never said , I would understand if it was a large party but there was 2 of us and regardless if I was 3 mins late she should have been allowed to order. Not only was the girl who sat us rude to the elderly lady she was horrible to my wife and talked to her like she wasn't allowed to be in their restaurant. We ended up walking over to bistro see which was amazing and had very friendly service! Terrible experience and no need for such an attitude in the service industry. We will never return---- just FYI: I notice a lot of the negative reviews have to do with the Hostesses attitude. Maybe she's not the best representation for your business !"
3/7/2016,20160307,4,4.12,"Finally got to come and visit Batter and Berries. The wait was not long even though the place was packed. The food was good, I could eat here again. The service by our server was horrible, at best. The busser (Albert) gave us way better service than our server. I really expected exceptional service and we did not get that at all. He was acting like he didn't want to be here or something. Oh well...at least the food was good. I gave 4 stars based on the food and overall atmosphere, could have been 5 but the server kept that star."
3/7/2016,20160307,5,4.12,"This is my third time at Batters and Berries. I real enjoy the food here, just always crowded. I normally just sit at the community table, which I think is the greatest idea. I had the super flight sampler, which includes the French toast of the week, Nutty Butter. It was quite tasty and not as sweet as I thought it would be. See them real soon again."
3/8/2016,20160308,5,4.12,"What else can I say about Batter and Berries that hasn't been already said? The food is delicious. The decadent and scrumptious french toast is worth the travel. Oak Park has plenty of breakfast spots, but they pale in comparison to Batter and Berries. Chef Derek Rylon and his friendly staff make everyone feel welcomed the minute they step through the doors. The warm hospitality just adds to the ambiance of this location. Due to the popularity of Batter and Berries, I recommend getting here early to avoid a long wait. If you're not an early riser, the potentially long wait is still worth it; however, you'll have to suffer a little as you watch people eat their delicious food while your stomach is rumbling."
3/11/2016,20160311,4,4.12,Hands down one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Make sure to stop by here when you're in town. Leslie was my server and she was absolutely wonderful. I've came here several times and everything on the menu is great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is b/c of the hostesses. Every time I come they seem to have an attitude problem. All of them are short and rude with customers. They need to remember they represent a business and a brand and they should be just excited to represent B&B as everyone else is who works there. I've been coming here for years and its always the same experience right when I walk in. I hope someone reads this and addresses them.
3/12/2016,20160312,4,4.12,"Came here right before our flight back to NY!What a great decision. Although the wait was about half an hour, the food and service were good. They even let us bring our suitcases in when it was super cramped without making us feel bad!They have a special menu which is not on the paper menu but on a chalk board in the front and back of the restaurant so remember to ask for it. They have really delicious meals listed but seriously everything looked and sounded so good I would've ordered everything. But then again I feel that way whenever I enter a restaurant. I am a true fatass. One bad thing though. My steak was fully cooked when I asked for medium rare. It made me really sad so if you decide to order that, remember to stress you want it cooked MEEE-DEE-UMMM RARRRREEEE."
3/12/2016,20160312,4,4.12,Wait was long but worth it. The French toast flight is the way to go if you like a sweet breakfast. We also had a blueberry waffle and scallop egg white omelette. All the dishes we great but the French toast was exceptional. Pay Street parking only on Lincoln st. I like the texting system they used allowed us to explore the neighborhood.
3/13/2016,20160313,5,4.12,"This place gets so busy! I can see why though. I came here at around 11 and the line was already long! They told me the wait would be an hour but I think I got texted that my table was ready within 30 minutes. All the dishes looked delicious! It's byob if you're interested in that. I saw a people with mimosas. Coool! I ordered the chicken and waffles. This comes with a sweet potato waffle, some maple butter and a nutmeg hot sauce. It also is topped with a chicken breast. The chicken breast was perfectly seasoned and the sauce was so good! Super spicy. I was recommended to include every part into one bite (waffle and chicken and butter). There was also chicken in the waffle too (#wafflegoals)! The waffle was really dense and deliciously flavored. I enjoyed the contrast of spicy and sweet from the waffle along with the butter. I forgot to add syrup but it was good by itself! I was so full from it and saved the rest for later. It was still delicious! The service was good and I would definitely come and try their other foods."
3/14/2016,20160314,5,4.12,"great service. our server asked if we were interested in hearing the specials or if we had any questions on any items on the menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles, my mother ordered the French toast flight and I ordered the kids chicken tenders for my son.the chicken and waffles were phenomenal. before eating, our server asked me if it was my first time eating the meal (I said yes) and she recommended me not to add the maple syrup because it was already going to be sweet and I'm glad she made that recommendation because it was not needed! the French toast flight was amazing, loved the variety (the blueberry was my favorite). my sons chicken tenders were delicious and it also came with sliced apples with caramel on top. (great idea!) the server was very attentive consistently checking up on us to see if we needed anything else. we went on a Monday around 11, waited about 15 minutes and the food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered. will definitely be back to try other things on the menu :)"
3/15/2016,20160315,2,4.12,"I decided to check out Batter & Berries since there always seemed to be a line for weekend brunch. My party arrived early to beat the rush and we were seated in about 20 minutes.I had the french toast flight, and while it was OK (it came out a little soft/soggy), I expected more from both the reviews and the price. The service wasn't bad, but wasn't anything to write home about either.All in all, I feel that there are other brunch places in the neighborhood that will give you a better experience and meal for the same price, if not cheaper."
3/16/2016,20160316,3,4.12,"Very good food! I had the chicken fajita Omlette, it was awesome! I loved all the big colorful veggies in it. I also had the French Toast Flight, GREAT!!! In not a sweet eater so I'm not into cakes, pancakes, French Toast, ext but OMG their French toast was BOMB! My boyfriend had their so called famous Chicken & Waffles, he didn't like it. I tried some of his and didn't like it either. He also had 2 pork sausages and a scrambled egg which was just ok! I had cheesy hashbrowns with my Omlette and those were BOMB! I would go back but probably on payday cause our bill was $55.. I could have went somewhere out south and got way more, better food for 2 for $20! Good place tho! We waited 25 minutes to eat."
3/16/2016,20160316,4,4.12,"This is my 2nd time coming to Batter & Berries and there's a reason why I keep coming back! The first time I went here, my brother ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered the French Toast Flight. My brother loved the sweet potato waffles and chicken and scarfed down the whole plate. I had the French Toast Flight and I thought it was okay, I'm not a big French toast person but I did like some of the flavors on the flight.The 2nd time I came here, I brought my dad and I loved it so much better!! We got there about 10:30AM and it was already busy. Luckily, we were seated right away and had water brought to us right away. It was busy and they only had 2 servers, so understandably, service was a little slow, but our server was very friendly and took our order as soon as he got to our table. He was very nice on explaining the menu and the specials of the week. They have a list of specials which changes every week. This week, they had the vanilla bean rum French toast and Shrimp Alfredo Omelet (my orders) and scallop omelet (my dad's order). The food came to our table very quickly (which was surprising considering it was busy) and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the Shrimp Alfredo Omelet which tasted like pasta (my favorite) which had an egg white omelet with a cheesy, gooey center and topped with Alfredo sauce, jumbo shrimp, and broccoli. I loved it and couldn't stop eating it! The portion was great and I enjoyed every bite. It also came with cheesy hash browns which I was too full to enjoy. I also ordered the vanilla bean rum French toast (which I heard about on Facebook) and it was so good!! It tasted like ice cream and it wasn't too sweet. The French toast also had maple butter on it which was a perfect topping along with the vanilla bean and rum. My dad had the scallop omelet and he loved his dish, the scallops were big and he ate everything off the plate.I would give 5 stars for the food but I'm deducting a star because $50 for breakfast is a little steep. Our omelets were $18 each which is pricy but where else would you get omelets topped with shrimp Alfredo and scallops?! It's definitely worth the price and will come back again!"
3/16/2016,20160316,2,4.11,"Food was good but super overrated. Was sat by the constantly opening and slamming front door. Waitress got mad cause I asked for syrup, twice. Way over priced. 12.50 for essentially two pieces of bread(French toast flight) that comes with no sides. Each side costs 3.50. Wow. Save your money. Go to ihop."
3/16/2016,20160316,5,4.12,"I'm here pretty much every weekend. Everything is good. EVERYTHING! Batter and Berries is walking that fine line between being a destination for foodies and comfort food seekers. Not that thin of line right? Pretty much something there for everyone. They used to be very restrictive with the menu no substitutions, instructions for how to best eat the food etc. Most of that has changed and they're just focusing on providing great service. The wait is going to be long, no call ahead's but, the food comes out the second your order it. Black owned, lots of minority employees and great team/family atmosphere. My friend and I close the place down most weekends and they eat at the middle table together like a little family, awww. They really take pride in their food and their service so don't let that wait deter you. I once was jus really hungry and my face must've showed it, Chef Rylon walked over asked what we were having then walked out of the kitchen with our food. He wasn't patronizing or anything, just a genuine ""no hungry faces in my house"" attitude. Any of the waffles are good. Sweet potato hash browns are EVERYTHING! Favorite omelet Salmon (on special) chicken fajita omelet and Scallop omelet. I'm from MD so I don't play with my seafood. Cluck and Gaufre is a favorite by everyone. French toast super flight allows you to try the French toast special of the week along with the other staple flavors of the flight. The executive is good, per my friend I've never had it, as well as the lamb chop executive."
3/19/2016,20160319,5,4.12,Great restaurent for breakfast. Its just you have to wait for at least an hour. Try the french toast flight because its the best in town!
3/19/2016,20160319,1,4.11,The worst host and seating service I have ever experienced. Not only was it unorganized but it was not fair. People would come in and wait 5 minutes and get seated and people would wait hours. The host was incredibly rude and abrasive. He was not apologetic for the long wait time nor did he apologize for skipping over our group multiple times. He also skipped over us because he said a group of 15 for the owners came in and needed to be seated. Any good owner of a restaurant would never push to be seated before their customers. Overall totally and completely shocked by the lack of customer service and experience.
3/20/2016,20160320,3,4.11,"Place is toooo small for me, but the food was good an service was fast Iwas expecting a little more of something don't even no what, it was just breakfast"
3/21/2016,20160321,2,4.11,"When this place first opened the food was excellent. After my second visit since 2012, the food quality has definitely suffered. I ordered the pancakes and eggs, and the eggs weren't scrambled, they were flipped and over cooked. The pancakes were so sweet you can actually feel the granulated sugar in your mouth! I sent the pancakes back for some hash-Browns and they were less than average for a breakfast spot. I really don't see what justifies all the hype around this place. Being from a city of very good food, this place has definitely fallen from the list of good breakfast spots. The only good thing I can take away from my experience was the service of my waitress Pam. This is the only reason this place gets 2 stars."
3/21/2016,20160321,3,4.11,"I live across the street from this restaurant and every weekend there are people waiting outside for hours. I was lucky enough to put my name on the list, go back to bed and wait for the text message. All the hype is around their French Toast flight. It's pretty good, but definitely not worth the 2 hour wait and the super cramped dining conditions. I was surprised to find out the shrimp omelette was really good. I'd consider this place average."
3/22/2016,20160322,5,4.11,"OMG!!! Their chicken and waffles was everything! It was spicy yet sweet, crunchy but tender...my mouth was having a party in every bite! I've never been sooo passionate about eating, it almost felt unholy lolThe wait was a taaaad long, which is forgivable due to their AMAZING food. What I could change about my visit was the seating area. Because I waited so long outdoors, I was ready to just sit and eat, however I was sat in the middle long tables which made me feel like I was in a grammar school lunchroom. So next time I will go before I'm actually hungry so I can wait a taaaaad longer for an individual table."
3/23/2016,20160323,4,4.11,"Very very good. Very very busy! My husband had their Rueben which came with fries. The corned beef is house made and my guy said it was the perfect Rueben.I tried to behave myself and had a veggie egg white omelette. It was delicious. Comes deconstructed with sautéed fresh vegetables that laid on top of the egg whites. It came with fresh fruit that was also very good. I really want to come back for the burger and cheesy hash browns. I plan on doing that very soon. Definitely a ""gotta try""!!"
3/23/2016,20160323,4,4.11,"Very creative menu and a very down to earth executive chef. They could certainly use a larger building so that the wait time does not exceed one hour. I've been here twice and it seems the wait time is increasing each time -- no matter how early you come on the weekend. The last time I visited, it was two hours and some change. The food is excellent, but the wait time is a huge turnoff, especially when the hostess is under-estimating it."
3/24/2016,20160324,4,4.11,"I come from Cincinnati where a place called ""Taste of Belgium"" has taken the chicken and waffle scene by storm. However, once I had Batter & Berries version, I can conclude that it is better. A sweet, yet savory sweet potato waffle with crispy fried chicken and some sweet hot sauce on top might sound weird, but boy is it incredible. Do not be alarmed with this combination... It has the right about of sweet, salty, spicy, and just the right amount of variation in textures that it is amazing. My boyfriend got the french toast flight, and thought they were good. I'm not sure he was sold that he was getting his money's worth since it is essentially only two pieces of bread and he's paying over $10 for it.If you're in Chicago come in here for the Chicken and Waffles and let it blow your mind."
3/25/2016,20160325,5,4.11,"O.M.G.Being from LA, I consider myself a brunch expert. I ordered the Lamb Chop Trio.....I think I died twice and came back to life. The food almost brought a tear to my eye. It's my first time in Chicago, and this was my first meal. Well done! Well done!"
3/25/2016,20160325,3,4.11,"Just had about the best French toast ever. Lightly battered and caramel / maple drizzle. Side of bacon was thick cut and crispy the way I like. Three negatives, and you will have to make your own decision. First, really, really noisy. Extremely difficult to converse on the two-top I was seated. Second, poor refill service on very nice coffee. Third, first try at French toast came out at room temp, way too cold to eat. Second try was perfect. Suspect it was wife's shrimp omelet, which came out nicely hot, so poor kitchen coordination. We will go back, just will try off hour when, hopefully, noise will not be do horrendous."
3/26/2016,20160326,5,4.11,"Absolutely loved this place! Service was great, very friendly staff, and the food was AMAZING! You can't go wrong with any of their daily specials or the French toast flight. My personal favorite is the blueberry waffle..Yum!"
3/27/2016,20160327,5,4.11,"Oh my gosh!!! I loooooved breakfast here! To start off I had seen online that this place was named one of the best places for breakfast, so here I go wanting to see what the hype is since it looked amazing. Friends and I came here around 9am and we happened to come at a good time because right after that it got super busy.Ok so I am not a fan of sweet potato...BUT I ordered their chicken and waffle made of sweet potato and it was the BESSSST I've ever had! Seriously nothing short of amazing! I got to try a piece of the crab cake benedict and scallops omelette and both were pretty good as well. We ended our breakfast with an order of the French toast super flight...WOW! aghhh I love french toast and this flight gives you a taste of the different flavors they have. Completely happy with the breakfast here, you must check it out. Please try the chicken and waffle and the french toast. Service was awesome, i don't remember our waitress name but she was soooo helpful and gave us great advice."
3/27/2016,20160327,5,4.11,"I don't know why I haven't come here sooner. But here I am with the lamb trio. Delicious!!!! The lamb is well seasoned and tender. The seasoning is not overpowered with salt or spices. If you are gluten free, ask that the gravy be left off and it still tastes delicious!!!!! The cheese hash browns were seasoned just right, also. We tried the homemade chicken sausage which was a little sweet, but nicely seasoned. The fruit was sweet and fresh. For those who eat waffles, pancakes and French toast, the aroma of cooking batter fills the air. The lemon, blueberry and strawberry waffles caught my attention-nice presentation.The wait at 9:00am on Sunday was 25 minutes, but once we placed our order, the food was served rather quickly. We also like that you can receive a text when your table is ready.The staff is friendly and attentive. They made adjustments for dietary restrictions without hesitation. And upon leaving they gently nudged us to return again and soon.We'll be back."
3/28/2016,20160328,5,4.11,Get the chicken and waffles. 5 stars. Absolutely delicious and worth the $$$ you throw down for Sunday Breakfast. You're fooling yourself if you get anything else other than their chicken and waffles.
3/29/2016,20160329,2,4.11,"My girlfriend and I came in for the first time on a Monday morning. Parkin was easy but it was still pay to park outside. We came in and they sat is right away. Seating was a little tight and not much room. It felt like we were eating with the table next to us. I ordered the chicken and goof and my girlfriend got a special with scallops, asparagus, and mushroom. We can say we didn't like the food at all. Nice preparation but the taste wasn't amazing. It was overpriced too! We paid $44 just for 2 people!! Not going back."
3/31/2016,20160331,4,4.11,WELL WORTH THE WAIT! Chicken and waffles is a must nut everything is good. The menu is put together thoughtfully and you get a true chef's touch with presentation and flavour. I just wish it was in a bigger space with better parking options. A Chicago treasure!
4/2/2016,20160402,4,4.11,"Whoa the food is fantastic!!! Love the cajun style breakfast options that you don't see in many places. I HIGHLY recommend going these times to avoid the massive waits: if you are going on the weekend, go EARLY or after the brunch rush."
4/6/2016,20160406,5,4.11,"This place stole my coveted position for top brunch place in Chicago and there are numerous reasons -- the French Toast being the biggest.My biggest advice for any first time Batter & Berries eaters is to be prepared to wait. We went in the afternoon on a Sunday evening and had to wait about 1.5 hours. I came super early on a Saturday at around 9AM and still had to wait until 10. My cousin has had experiences putting her name down, going to eat somewhere else with a shorter wait and returning home before ever getting a text that her table was ready. For people that MUST try and prepared for the wait -- They do text you when your table is ready! I would walk in, put your name down and even strongly consider coming back or exploring the block. There's a couple of bars and cool toy store (Rotofugi) at the end of the block. If you haven't gotten your drinks for the BYOB yet, there's a 7/11 down the street with a acceptable selection. You could probably find a good coffee shop (or bar) in the area and just wait it out. The wait aside -- the food is quite amazing. I think the savory options are kind of limiting as I wasn't a fan of the steak in the red wine sauce (which comes on the menu three different times) but the burger I had was quite good. I've heard the Chicken and Waffle is only ""ok"" and the Lobster Benedict (a special, not on the menu) was good but dense and hard for my friend to finish. Either way, if you find something you like, it will be absolutely delicious.To share, and what brings this place to the coveted 5-star area, is the French Toast flight. I would always advise to get the SUPER flight which includes the French Toast of the day (i have had the pecan pie, and banana pudding which are both great!) The Flight is basically a sample of each of their french toast and each one is amazing. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not try it. My friend and I each got our own dish and shared the Super Flight at about 3PM -- we did not eat dinner that night. Last but not least, the pitcher of orange juice (or whatever juice you like actually, we got a mix of Orange and Pineapple) comes at 6.50 and they let you bring your own bottle. Great service for what it's worth including uncorking it for you. A mimosa at other brunch places will put you down 10 dollar per but here you can get many off of your bottle of choice. An amazing deal!"
4/6/2016,20160406,1,4.11,I just left this place becuse they wouldn't allow me to sit while my date was placing the parking ticket on the dash. They saw her enter with me and run out for two seconds. There were plenty of tables and I only wanted a two top which would be what I got if I was alone. The hostess was completely rude to me as well. Don't reward this terribe behavior with your money. overpriced pancakes anyway. Never going back.
4/7/2016,20160407,5,4.11,"MUST COME TO THIS PLACE. The best breakfast spot I went to while in town by far. Get their french toast flight and share it with someone, b/c it's too much sugar and simple carbs for one person alone. Their portions are big and since I wasn't super hungry I ended up sharing the french toast flight with my friend and got a side of eggs and BB Hash browns on the side. The hash browns were cheesy carb heaven - I could eat that every single day, but I won't b/c I'd probably eat my way to an early death within a couple years. But definitely a must try if you come here."
4/9/2016,20160409,1,4.11,Not the greatest looks good but it's not all that. Service wasn't the greatest either felt like I was being rush to order my food and eat. Server wanted me to order quickly when clearly it was my first time so rude. Not coming back!
4/10/2016,20160410,4,4.11,"Batter & Berries is across the street from my fave pilates studio, so on the weekends, this section of Lincoln Avenue between Diversey and Schubert is HOPPIN' with people looking for parking or double parking to put their name down. After months and months of watching the crowds line up and hearing car horns honking because of coveted parking, I finally had the opportunity to try this place out this morning. I got there a little past 9:30am. I thought I was early enough to miss a big crowd and long wait time. NOPE. I told the hostess it was just me, so I needed a table for one (womp womp). She estimated a 50 minute wait time. DANG! Every table was filled. There were at least 4 parties in front of me waiting for tables. Fine...I'll wait...better be worth it, I thought to myself. I sat down in their ""waiting area"" which is a little section of a couple of benches and chairs near the back. Guess what? I ended up waiting a little under 20 minutes. Score! See? It helps being a party of one :)Now breakfast is my favorite meal of the day at any time of the day. So even though this place is called Batter & Berries, their omelets and other non battered and berried items sounded delicious. But no, I had to stay focused, I had to try at least one of the two. I decided to do their ""French Toast Flight"". I asked about their ""Super Flight"", and it's like the regular French Toast Flight, but with an added ""special of the month"" french toast, which this month is Tiramisu. Truthfully, I'm not a fan of Tiramisu, so I passed on the Super Flight. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs because my body literally NEEDS some sort of protein in the morning. I'm pretty sure I get ""Lack-of-protein-headache"" like others get ""lack-of-coffee-headache."" My food came out FAST. Within 5 minutes fast! Whoa!This shiz is delicious. I must say, I enjoyed every kind of French Toast, but blueberry was probably my favorite. My server asked if I wanted maple syrup, but I declined. That would have been sweetness overload! The eggs were soft and well made. They tasted a wee bit too buttery for my taste, but I enjoyed them. My server was super nice. She checked up on me often. The other workers were definitely on top of filling my water and coffee cups. Speaking of, the coffee was really good. Tasty and strong! They have a very efficient system of workers running this crazy busy restaurant. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here. Obviously the more people you have in your party, the longer you have to wait. This place is small so be prepared to eat closely to your neighbors. I would definitely come back."
4/10/2016,20160410,4,4.11,"went at 11 on a Sunday and the wait was quoted at 2 hours but we only ended up waiting 1 hour. expect to wait if you go at a peak time like we did! there aren't really any good places to wait in the mean time so take that into account. our waiter was awesome! we ordered a French toast super flight so we could all try each one (the caramel one was my fave). scallop omelette special was surprisingly delicious (scallops cooked perfectly). cheesy hash browns are amazing. they were definitely my favorite part of the meal! no shortage on cheese or flavor. it is loud, packed, and bumpin inside but service is still very efficient. I would definitely go back but NOT at a peak time."
4/10/2016,20160410,5,4.11,"Sunday morning service: There was a wait, but well worth it! The staff (greeter, wait staff, manager) was so helpful & friendly ....and then you the food... HMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm (humming like an old church mother as she pauses to reflect and meditate). Okay, okay, the experience began before the food hit our palates. Nadine (our main server) shared the specials and made us happy. We want a taste of each and every one. It was like she was sharing a testimony in church. We were dangling on every passionate description (she may as well have put it to music in a heart-moving song). At our table we had a French Toast Flight, side of Ham (steak cut straight from the bone), Shrimp/lobster Benedict, Scallop Omelet (OMG), and Buckwheat pancakes.The food was clap yo' hands good! The ingredients were fresh, the pairings fulfilling, and every morsel was tasty. We left satisfied, without filling overly stuffed. Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the experience. Now it's on you... Lift your hands and say YES!"
4/10/2016,20160410,5,4.11,"This place is incredible. We made the 1.5 mile trek from our AirBNB and every step was worth it (plus the walk back made us feel a little better about ourselves and the 1000+ calorie meal we ate, ha!) I meant to write this review right after we went, but I forgot, oops! From what I remember, you can't go wrong with what you order. They're famous for their French toast, and for good reason. We did the Flight of French toast and split it as an appetizer (we both took home half of our meal, don't regret a thing). One word: NOM. We also got the Cluck-N-Gaufre. Ho-ly cluck. Best. Dish. Ever. Seriously fantastic."
4/13/2016,20160413,4,4.11,"The ONLY negatives IMO is the long wait to get a table most of the time. Parking can also be a pain. Everything I've had on the menu is tasty and well prepared. The French toast flight is one of my favorites. Service is usually pretty good. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a tasty but different breakfast dining experience. If you love Mimosas, bring a bottle of your favorite champagne."
4/13/2016,20160413,5,4.11,"Great breakfast, worth the wait!  I love the French toast.  Best to arrive early or on a weekday if you don't want to wait a long time but worth it."
4/14/2016,20160414,5,4.11,My husband and I are truly addicted to this place. We were like drug addicts for the food. ITS AMAZING!!! My service has always been great. Some waiters stand out more then others. Especially the one that tells the riddles. He is awesome!!!! The wait can be long but totally worth it.
4/16/2016,20160416,5,4.11,"The wait was 1 1/2 on a beautiful 68° and sunny day. Of course it was and if you ever been here you know why. The food is amazing and quick! It was 7 of us and our food was out in like 15 minutes. Toseeme our waiter sold us on every food option and the specials and everything tasted great. My fajita omelet had the juiciest chicken and the peppers and onions, cooked perfectly. The Tirimsu French toast taste just like the dessert and while I'm not usually a caramel fan, the Caramel French Toast was sinfully delectable. I started to give 4-stars because of the wait but after dining in you see why. And besides, the liquor store was a few block walk so we bought Persecco for Mimosas. It's byob as well. This place is absolutely perfect, the staff was excellent and it was so nice to be surrounded by so many beautiful people. I will definitely be back."
4/17/2016,20160417,5,4.11,One of my favorite places in Chicago for breakfast and brunch. You can't count calories here--you just need to appreciate flavorful and fun food. The French toast flight is out of this world. The shrimp and lobster Benedict and the crab omelette are mind blowing. The cheesey hash browns are mouth watering. The menu is always changing and fresh. The servers are wonderful in explaining the specials and always so friendly and helpful. I typically get the best-sounding egg dish with a side of the special French toast. Come hungry; leave happy.
4/21/2016,20160421,5,4.11,Service is good and fortunately no long line for us. Came on a Thursday morning at 9 am and was immediately seated. Food is delish!
4/22/2016,20160422,4,4.11,Service at this place is great as well as the food!Only issue is they are very crowded and we had to wait over an hour and a half. But! It is worth the wait but I don't think I can do that every time. Hopefully they will be expanding in the near future. Business looks great so I am expecting they will. :-)
4/22/2016,20160422,4,4.11,"We went here on a monday morning around 10am and although the place was nearly full we were able to get a table for 5 persons easily. I like the different beautiful paintings on the wall! Unfortunately, it was very noisy at this place...we tried various specials on that day 2 of which were seafood so as expected it was abit pricey towards the overall bill. I really liked the Super flight! The Lobster/Shrimp Benedict and the Scallop Omelet were both ok! The Arthur and Pork chop executive both their meats were not tender enough...Service was good and abit pricey for portion..."
4/22/2016,20160422,4,4.11,"Loved the caramel French toast, and homemade chicken sausage, scallop omelletes delicious, my friend thought the pork chops were dry"
4/22/2016,20160422,5,4.11,"The food was absolutely amazing! There was a 30 minute wait but, it's worth it. Our waiter was a delight and made the experience that much better."
4/23/2016,20160423,5,4.11,"I'm mad it took me so long to get up here. I came up for breakfast with my family. Everybody says to get there early because the place gets packed. We got there early but still is a 30 min wait, because the place was packed. It was well worth the wait. First, EVERYBODY was friendly from the staff to the other patrons. I guess when you're happy and getting fed you're a lot nicer. Second, our server, Tusiime, was outstanding. He was knowledgable AND passionate about the menu, great with the kids, fast, efficient and even had some jokes for his tables!III, the food. The food came fast, hot and a-plenty. We ordered the Super French toast flight (as everyone told us to do) for the table. It was so delicious and, again a lot of food. I had the scallop egg white omelette with mushrooms, asparagus and goat cheese. On point!! She had the steak omelette. Again, a lot of food. Both came with cheesy hash browns. Scrumptious!!!This meal was a brunch to write a review about! So good. We will return often (and early). The price was a more than I like to spend for a family brunch, but I DO think it was worth it!~III"
4/25/2016,20160425,5,4.11,Batter & Berries has GREAT SERVICE. Short wait on the food is worth the wait in line. Very efficient with check out & customer service. No syrup needed for the French toast. Definitely the best I've ever had. Black owned in the Lincoln park neighborhood.
4/26/2016,20160426,3,4.11,Was given a gift card and checked this place out. Was a bit disappointed. It's hard to believe anything is fresh when the food is served within 5 minutes of ordering it. So for efficiency it gets you your food really fast. But quality. I guess it wasn't my kinda place. Plenty of people like it though!
4/26/2016,20160426,5,4.11,The food is so delicious!!! Anytime you can eat French toast with no syrup needed ...I mean what more can you say...this is my favorite breakfast spot in the city...
4/27/2016,20160427,5,4.12,"WHERE DO I START?!!! I finally tried this place. My friend tried to convince me to go for months, but I kept hearing about the wait. Y'all, I would wait in a snowstorm, climb a mountain, and jump through a ring of fire for their food! I have never given a restaurant review, but I just have to. I experience the butter pecan rum French toast and IT. IS. TO. DIE. FOR!!! It was like heaven on the first bite. My friend had the flight and I was into her plate as well. Our server (cool cat with grey dreads) made the experience even better. He was polite and had our order out very quickly. And did I mention it's BYOB!! Perfect!! The owner was so professional and cool when we met him. I also love the fact that it is black owned! Yes my brother. Def a place to check out!!"
4/30/2016,20160430,5,4.12,The chicken and sweet potatoe waffles are soooo good. We also ordered the crab/shrimp benedict which was also amazing. Our waiter Tussime made are experience memorable! We will definitely be back.
5/1/2016,20160501,4,4.12,"The food was amazing! It's well worth the wait. I suggest during your wait time you grab some beer, wine or champagne to enjoy during your meal. The place is BYOB with a valid ID. If you're a first timer, you must get the French toast flight, it's to die for!!!"
5/1/2016,20160501,5,4.12,I love this place! The Crab/shrimp Benedict is sensational and the service is exceptional. Great environment. 2 thumbs up
5/2/2016,20160502,5,4.12,"I decided to treat my mother to breakfast for her birthday. After searching Yelp for the perfect place, I chose Batter and Berries.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly by friendly staff. They had good music playing, and it smelled wonderful. We were seated by the window, which was nice. The inside tables are fairly close, but that makes it more homely. The noise level isn't bad at all, even though the inside is small. We could still hear each other without having to yell.Our waiter was just amazing, I think his name was Travis or Tyrese, sorry I have trouble remembering names. Anyway, he was so nice, explaining everything to us and answering our questions.We ended up ordering the French Toast Flight, and two of the chef's specials; the mango French toast and the lobster omelette. We got a little worried when we were given another tables order, but it was an honest mistake and our order was brought right out. In our opinion, these were the BEST French toast that we had ever had. They weren't super dry like some places, the insides were moist and fluffy and the outsides had a slight crunch; delicious. Each order of French toast came with a sweet butter, and the fruit was fresh.If you're used to having syrup at the table you'll be shocked to know that they don't have any bottles on the tables. But don't fret because you really don't need any. The French toast can stand on their own without the help of more syrup.The lobster omelette and hash browns were great, albeit the red onions and tomatoes on top of the omelette; we weren't a fan of those. But we basically enjoyed everything. You don't have to worry about your cups going empty because there will always be someone near by to fill it up.Can't wait to come back."
5/2/2016,20160502,5,4.12,"A line on monday at 12:30? It must be great? It is great. Servers were delightful, food was a very pleasant twist on sunday breakfast items. Value was as expected for the creative twist. The only problem is the wait. Have the deconstructed omelets they are fab."
5/2/2016,20160502,1,4.12,"I arrived at 9 AM and the place was basically empty. The hostess was very rude. I was waiting for a friend and I was not allowed to sit at a table. I said OK then I'm dining alone. She still insisted that I sit in the waiting area when there were only three tables being used. The waiting area consists of a series of benches that looks like a kindergarten. I am close to 70 years old have a bad back. I told them I cannot sit on a bench I needed to sit at a table. I was told no I was not allowed at a table they insisted I wait in the waiting area.So what did I do? I Took a table and order coffee.. My guest arrived five minutes after I was seated. There were still empty tables all around. I was the oldest person in the restaurant and was made to feel very uncomfortable. The food is just so-so. My guests waffle and chicken arrived ice cold, and my French toast was only lukewarm. By the time we left the place was filling up besides this below average food I will never go back because of the unprofessional and rude behavior of management and the hostess."
5/4/2016,20160504,5,4.12,"This place was so yummy! Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal and I'm glad we tried this place out. I ordered the chicken and waffles, which was ok, but the real 5 stars are for the sampler French toast. A table of 6 of us shared 2 orders and I wish I ordered one for myself! The wait was an hour, but at least they take down your number and text you when your table is ready."
5/7/2016,20160507,5,4.12,"Always great food, and great service. French toast is the Best!!!"
5/7/2016,20160507,3,4.12,"I decided to try this place based on the YELP REVIEWS. I really loved the sweet potato hash browns and the fajita omelet. However, I didn't receive much egg with the omelet. It was an extremely small portion.. Also the nutmeg in the sweet potato waffle that I ordered was too over powering! I didn't like the flavor... However the chicken was flavorful! Customer service was excellent!! We had to wait and hour and forty five minutes which was a little frustrating... We will give this place another try in the future... It was good but I wasn't blown away..."
5/7/2016,20160507,4,4.12,"The wait was well worth it(15min). We came early to avoid the crowd. The food was great. I had the Carmel french toast with walnuts(NoNeedForSyrup), cheesy hash browns, crispy bacon and hot chocolate. But I should've ordered milk...lol. They had house music playing in the back ground I wanted them to turn it up...lbvs. The service and our server was great. This place definitely needs to expand, the seating is tight but overall I definitely enjoyed myself. I will definitely be going back."
5/8/2016,20160508,2,4.11,"The food is good, but NOT worth the wait. My party of 3 arrived 5 minutes after opening. We were told that the wait was 1.5 hours. We drove from quite a distance so we decided to stay. An hour and FORTY minutes later, we were told that we would be seated ""shortly"". Two hours after arriving, we were finally seated. Unacceptable and absolutely ridiculous. I will not go back. Note to owner, your restaurant management system is severely flawed."
5/9/2016,20160509,4,4.11,The food was absolutely delicious!! The French toast flight melted in my mouth. The vegetable omelet was good but that green sauce that came with the meal made it taste fantastic. The only thing that I didn't like was the wait but it was a very small place so I guess that could be expected since the food was so good. I will go back and I recommend it to others just be prepared to wait.
5/10/2016,20160510,4,4.11,"The food is unique and good. I have been here several times. My favorite dish is the lamb chops. I don't like that this item is seasonal. The lamb chops are so tender and flavorful. I think they should make this particular item a regular.My most recent visit, I tried another seasonal item; The lobster omelet. It was okay. I like that I got a lot of lobster pieces. I didn't like the amount of onions that it came with. The flight french toast is delicious! The wait time is not really good, but for the service and the good food I don't mind at all!"
5/10/2016,20160510,5,4.11,"Batter & Berries makes the best French Toast I have EVER had!We made the mistake of going on Mother's Day and were told it was an hour and a half wait for two of us. They took our number and they texted us 15 minutes later saying our table was ready. We were a bit confused, but glad to have the opportunity to eat here while visiting the city.Their flight has half a slice of each flavour, and all of them were delicious. The service was great and the food came out incredibly fast. The place is obviously popular and was packed, so the noise was a bit much, but the food was well worth it."
5/10/2016,20160510,4,4.11,"Oh my gosh....the lemon french toast was to die for. And the crab eggs benedict, also incredible. I pretty much wanted to try every single dish on the menu. This is the third time I've attempted to come here, and the first time I've actually eaten. The first two attempts were thwarted by the hoards of others on the wait list ahead of me (1.5 hour wait? no thanks). The successful visit was on a Tuesday morning. Don't even think about going on the weekend unless you're willing to wait. And wait. Annnd wait (they don't take reservations). But if you're patient, the wait is worthwhile - fabulous food."
5/12/2016,20160512,5,4.12,"I absolutely loved my French toast platter! I forgot what it's called exactly but I got the plate where it gave you all their signature flavors: caramel, strawberry, blueberry, maple, nutter butter, etc! It was wonderful and the service was very kind and cozy. I went with my cousin and a good friend and we had a delightful time. Definitely coming back for their blueberry waffle next time. Oh! Their butter is also super fresh and home-made!Also, its packed and for a good reason! I say expect the wait but totally worth it :)"
5/12/2016,20160512,5,4.12,"Batter and Berries is a small, owner run, Breakfast and Brunch spot in Lincoln park near the intersection of Lincoln and Diversey. My boyfriend and I tried coming in on a weekend, but the wait was too long and we were too hungry, but we just came in this past Tuesday and did not have a wait at all. We were greeted warmly at the door and shortly after sitting down our drink order was taken and our server explained all of the specials and her personal favorites. The service was fantastic, very informative, attentive, but not overbearing. She had great suggestions for what to order and even on how to eat what we ordered to get the most out of it.I ordered the enchiladas omelet, OMG amazing. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and everything with it was to die for, the chicken was seasoned perfectly, the enchilada sauce was divine, and all of the veggies were nice and crisp.My BF ordered the Chicken and sweet potato waffle, wow, so perfect, it wasn't too sweet and all of the flavors of the waffle, chicken and the hot sauce perfectly complimented each other. It is very clear that the chef, owner, and staff are well connected and it shows in the food, service and atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"
5/14/2016,20160514,5,4.12,A remarkable restaurant. Original breakfast combinations. It will require many trips to exhaust the appetizing portions of their menu let alone the specials. I wish the place was bigger and opened earlier because it's going to be crowded for years.
5/15/2016,20160515,4,4.12,"I FINALLY made it! Wait time was about 30 minutes just as we were advised! Overall the place is lovely although small! Decor is nice and staff/service is very attentive! I LOVE our waitress! It's evident that she loves what she does and does it with a smile! She recommended items along with what she liked! I ordered the sweet potato chicken waffle! I have to admit all the flavors(nutmeg, Maple butter, hot sauce and syrup) at first was too much for my taste bugs.....but I enjoyed it, it was different! The chicken by itself was seasoned well! Not sure if chicken was actually stuff inside the waffle, if so I don't recall seeing any. My friend tried the steak omelet that he liked but he didn't care too much for the potatoes that came with it due to being bland! I'm planning on going back again for the infamous French toast!"
5/18/2016,20160518,5,4.12,"This place is amazing! I went here on a Wednesday at 12:30 with my mom and my sister for a little lunch break. We were greeted by the hostess who told us our wait would be 30 minutes, but it only ended up being 15 (yay!). We were seated by the window, which we really enjoyed. The waitress we had was awesome. She gave us great suggestions and told us her favorite dishes, along with the specials for the day. I ended up getting the french toast flight and I was not disappointed. For anyone with a sweet tooth, this is definitely the dish to get. I'm not a huge fan of lemon, but the lemon french toast ended up being my favorite of the 4 that came with the flight! I will definitely be coming back here! The service was great and the food was to die for. They are doing things right at Batter & Berries."
5/20/2016,20160520,4,4.12,"Many people have mentioned this restaurant so I added it to my list ""Things to visit in Chicago."" Ordered the ""Super Flight french toast"", which was one of the specials. It includes the French toast of the week. ATMOSPHERE:- It was Friday afternoon and it seemed busy but no line (only if you come on the weekends). I would say people kept coming in every 5 minutes. - Besides the outside sign, there is a yellow & purple theme inside. - Small in sizeTHE FOOD:- None of the Juices are fresh- As I mentioned above, I ordered the super flight french toast. I liked the blueberry toast the most, followed by strawberry. The white chocolate raspberry rum wasn't too bad. A little on the sweet side (I'm not a big sweet tooth) but I enjoyed the raspberries. The caramel toast was too sweet for me. The caramelized nuts add an interesting flavor though. Not sure I like it with french toast. The maple-flavored syrup tasted fake to me (I use real maple syrup and no high corn fructose syrup at home so there is a distinct difference). Barely used it. The butter has a nice flavor. SERVICE:- I was greeted by the hostesses right once I entered in and placed on the center table (came solo). The center table seems to be used to place a party of 1 to 3. - My waiter was nice. I noticed how he served others at the table. Followed up on everyone.- My meal was served by one of the part owners, Chef Rylon. - One of the owners was present helping to serve.- The wait for my meal was normal (estimated time: 15 mins)Would I return back? Nope, not for food. Props to great customer service and the culinary creativity on french toast."
5/22/2016,20160522,5,4.12,"Awesome flavorful food! Friendly attentive staff. Expect to wait or come early! The text you when your table is ready, hasn't worked 3 times for me. I just opt to stay close and watch the crowd to gage when I should be seated. The host gets overwhelmed with the crowd."
5/24/2016,20160524,5,4.12,All natural fresh ingredients. Great service. Food came out quickly! All the staff was friendly and accommodating for us and our 2 kids.
5/25/2016,20160525,5,4.12,"I was tricked into coming here. Well, trick me anytime, Danny W. Trick me anytime. When I was told I was going to the ""best breakfast in Chicago,"" I was skeptical to say the least. On top of my skepticism, I was tired, grumpy, but above all else, hungry!I was told that there is typically a long line for B&B so we were lucky to slide in with zero wait. We were quickly approached by our server, given the rundown and directed to check out the chalkboard for some specials, which may or may not be around too long. Chicken enchelada omelette? Sold! Omelette is a relative term for what was presented to me. It didn't look like an omelette but had all the necessary components. Who cares? It was so damn delicious! Danny had the catfish omelette... wouldn't be my first choice but that dude basically licked his plate clean.The best part about Batter & Berries? The service. It's prompt and the food comes out quickly. Props to both the front and back of the house for teaming up to get us in and out at a rapid pace and really well fed."
5/26/2016,20160526,4,4.12,"Found this place from yelp. Figure really can't go wrong when you saw bunch of good ratings(normally). When I walked in, the place was cozy, wasn't anything fancy but it feels welcoming. I am a big tea lover, normally brunch places only have a few options, but this place have over 9 flavors. From the basic green tea, mint, earl grey to something unique and fruity: flower teas, peach, roasted almond(which is highly recommend). For my main course, I had the lobster and shrimp Benny(highly recommend if you did stop by). Their pouch eggs are so buttery and fluffy, which goes perfectly with the lobster and shrimp pancakes base. Not to mention, their hashbrown on the side were super cheesy. Eventhough I was there by my self, I got carry away by their French toast options. After all, quote to quote, this place is ""home of the famous French toast fight"". So I ordered myself a lemon French toast in the kid size(super low key). It was just on point; very mild sweet with lightly tastes of lemon peels. I really wish I could go for 5 stars if the waitresses didnt't give me the wrong order of my drink and almost accidentally charge me extra for something I didn't order. But besides that, food and drink were right on the spot. Highly recommended for brunch."
5/26/2016,20160526,5,4.12,"They had me at ""French toast flights"". My friend and I spilt one to sample 5 of their French toast delicacies and split an order of eggs, cheesy hash browns, and bacon. More than enough food with just a taste or everything. The cheesy hash browns are no joke, better than when you find them in an Easter buffet! The place is small and quaint but the service was great and the toast, terrific!"
5/26/2016,20160526,2,4.12,"Two stars only because the food was good. The ladies at the front hostesses, the worst! can't manage the iPad! We had a one hour wait which was ok we knew what we signed up for. Once our time had passed we went to see how much longer we were a party of 3, she said 30minutes more. Ok...eventually all the people who came after is were seated. Come to find out their iPads were not talking to each other. After speaking to someone who appeared in charge, we were seated. Once inside we noticed that all the management is having fun, taking selfies with the customers, and acting crazy! While their money is standing outside! Thank God for the nice waitress and helper who was working with her. Won't go again, poor management and no professionalism"
5/28/2016,20160528,5,4.12,"Praise be to the Most High, the Most Oh Glorious God for giving the owner of this restaurant the tools and foresight to hire the head chef whose blessed and sanctified hands prepared my meal for which are PRIME reasons for canonization while air still flows through his lungs. Each morsel was a glorified and continuous Milly Rock of flavor into my mouth along every block of my taste buds, backed by the voracious voices of the Chicago Children's Choir. How truly great is our God indeed to have put such an establishment within reach of my doorstep during my most recent visit to Chicago AND to have staved off rain so I could shower myself in the delicious tastes of the French Toast Flight, Chicken and Waffles and Lamb Omelette."
5/29/2016,20160529,4,4.12,"The wait was VERY long. It was a good 2 hours. However, once our party was seated there was no waiting at all. As soon as our order was put in, someone coming out with our food. I don't know how they do it, and don't care because the food was fantastic. We also got the French toast flight which is a must try. I got the biscuits and gravy which was amazing. I don't like coleslaw - but that coleslaw was awesome. Overall if you like good breakfast food this is the place, but he warned the wait is very long."
5/30/2016,20160530,3,4.12,Great location reasonable price but not really impressive with taste or quality of food. Not worth a wait or the cramped space. May try again if in area but certainly not coming out for the food nor waiting to be seated.
5/30/2016,20160530,5,4.12,"This was definitely a breakfast worth remembering, and it wasn't just the super french toast flight or the best take on chicken and waffles I've experienced! Our server Tusiime was hilarious, energetic, and steered us to all the right items on the menu for a group of 6 to share family style. He took us from ""breakfast with friends"" to ""BREAKFAST WITH FRIENDS F* YA!"". I hope that makes sense haha."
5/30/2016,20160530,5,4.12,"Wow!!!! We pulled up on a Sat morning around 8:30 and the sidewalk was filled with people waiting. DO NOT let this stop you--we were told it was a 45 min wait but actually was only about 25 and they text you when they are just about easy for you. Then you go to the back to a cute little ""holding"" area-- nice that you aren't breathing down diners while you wait. Now the food. Unbelievable. We split two slices of the caramel french toast and hubby had the lobster shrimp spinach benny. I had the biscuits and gravy and we both had the cheese hash browns. It was all superb. The chef/owner was delightful and chatted with us for a few minutes. Service was meticulous. Hard to find anything lacking here! Only small negative was the price of the benny--19.00. That wasn't in the specials board (we should have asked so our bad). That said--it WAS excellent just prob wouldn't order it again for that price--a little steep for a breakfast item. But everything else was priced as you would expect. Just be sure to ask the price of the specials. Loved this place and will gladly make the 40 min drive in from the burbs!"
5/31/2016,20160531,3,4.12,"I read such good reviews from my Yelp friends for Batter & Berries but was disappointed in my meal. It is a possibilty I ordered the wrong entrée but I didn't think it was worth the hour wait. When we were finally seated, I ordered one of the specials which was the Jerk Crab Omelette and my friend had the Goof which was the chicken and sweet potato waffle. Our waitress was decent, not overly friendly but not the worst I've had. I guess I should have known my omelette would be ""deconstructed"" since the rest of the omelettes on the menu were but for some reason was taken aback when my dish came out. It looked like a sloppy mess of peppers, crab, and mushroom on top of a cheesy egg whites and did not look very appetizing. My omelette was a bit soggy and flavors were decent and had a nice kick afterwards. The Goof looked and tasted better than mine but I think they forgot to give syrup with the dish which made the waffle pretty dry. Overall this wasn't my best brunch experience and didn't live up to the hype."
6/1/2016,20160601,4,4.12,French toast is to die for. Didn't give five stars because I was unsure how the hostess seated people. She told me and my two friends it was a two-hour wait but parties who came in after us were seated first. I thought that was strange.
6/3/2016,20160603,4,4.12,"Definitely come here for the French toast. Also the cheesy potatoes are good. The chicken and waffles aren't bad, spicy and sweet. It gets pretty crowded and loud but what can ya do when you're known for great breakfast. I'll definitely come back again."
6/3/2016,20160603,5,4.12,"Crazy-good biscuit and gravy! We also got the super flight of French toast. Both were stellar. Even if you're not a French toast fan, try and get someone at the table to order it. It's awesome. Even though my flight came with several fun flavors, I think the berry ones are the best, especially the strawberry. Yum!! Great service too!!"
6/5/2016,20160605,5,4.12,"First of all, Tusiime was the server of a lifetime. He was friendly, knowledgable and extremely entertaining. Words in a Yelp review cannot do justice to convey the awesome service. He knew every special, had the most random jokes, and was on top of his game in every way. Great job, man. I'd give him 5 stars of his own!On to the food, which deserves 5 stars in itself. We got the French toast flight - great as a nice appetizer and it gives you a taste of their amazing, incomparable maple butter. I wouldn't recommend it as a meal though. Entree - I got the blueberry waffle which was truly amazing. It's crazy...there was no syrup and no need for syrup at all. Have you ever had a waffle where you didn't need syrup because everything about it was so damn good? No? Me neither - not until I tried this place. We also ordered one of the specials - it was some type of lamb, goat cheese, spinach, mushroom omelette - also amazing. It was a great savory balance to the sweetness of the waffle and earlier French toast. I travel often and make it a point to do my daily foodie runs. I came out here expecting to fall in love with the pizza or something more ""typical""...but this place takes the cake (or waffle? Lol) for the best of the 15 places I ate at over these past few days. I'd dare to say this beats any breakfast place I've eaten at in New York, LA, SF, Vegas, etc. I'm not exaggerating. I'm not kidding. I'm coming back just for this.Lastly, they've got the right balance of ""home feel"" but ""modern"". The setting is like a cool home-like cafe, but they are on top of technology. They text you when your table is ready, they use iPad mini's to take your order and payments. They're extremely efficient - the wait is worth it. Cheers to you guys. See you soon."
6/6/2016,20160606,4,4.12,"awesome brunch place! the food and service are both good, but the wait is just too long on the weekend, we were told to wait f or 1 hour and 45 mins upon arrival just prior to 12 on a sundaywe ordered the chicken on the sweet potato waffle, it is very good, the waffle had a strong cinnamon taste and the chicken is quite flavourful, we split it amongst 4 people, if i had to eat it all by myself, it would have been too richthe french toast flight is great, we get to taste 4 different flavours, they do not use syrup, but the toasts are sweet enough that you don't need extra syrup, i also liked the fresh fruit that comes with itwe also got the special of the day, crab scramble, i like how it is just egg white so it is healthier, they gave very generous portions of crab meat and the whole dish is very tasty"
6/6/2016,20160606,5,4.12,"My friends and I wanted to try a new spot for breakfast and one of the friend's sons recommended this spot. We came on a Monday and were seated immediately. The server was very thorough in explaining the multitude of choices. We ordered the French toast flight for the table which gave us 4 pieces (strawberry, blueberry, caramel, and lemon with fresh fruits and maple butter) so that all of us could sample. Ridiculously perfect. I also had the chicken fajita omelet and cheese hash browns. All came steaming hot and seasoned well. Roasted vegetables and chicken breast are served on top of the eggs rather than chopped and cooked into the eggs. I will definitely return to try more but will always include the flight."
6/7/2016,20160607,5,4.12,"I don't like breakfast. So in order to give a breakfast/brunch resturant more than 3 stars they have to blow my socks off. This place is so cute and has a cafe feel. We had to wait to be seated because they won't seat you until everyone in your party has arrived. That being said the wait wasn't that long or bad. It was a Monday morning and people were showing up like a Saturday morning. The food came really fast and the servers were very attentive. We got 3 French toast flights to share (there were 8 of us). I got the chicken and waffles (the waffles have chicken baked in them). Some of the things my family ordered were..lobster and shrimp omelet, jerk crab omelet, chicken parm omelet, and lamb omelet. I tried everyone's food and it was delicious!!! Their homemade butter is so good you don't need syrup! Their cheesy hash browns were to die for! Ask for the specials! The French toast flight and my chick n waffles were the only things that are regularly on the menu. I'm the obnoxious person that always takes photos of the food and won't let people eat...it was so good that I have no photos. Will be coming back here with my hubby who loves breakfast."
6/8/2016,20160608,5,4.12,"Went on a busy Sunday morning for brunch, the wait was almost an hour and half. As soon as we were seated the waiter came over and took our order and told us the specials for the day. Our food took about 5-10 minutes after our order was taken, very surprised. Their ""Super Flight French Toast"" was very tasty, and one of their best known food items to try. Will be visiting again soon!"
6/10/2016,20160610,5,4.12,"TO DIE FOR!! My favorite meal of the day is brunch and the best place to go is Batter and Berries. I have never eaten something as delicious as the strawberry french toast. Having a major sweet tooth when it comes to brunch, this is everything dreams are made of."
6/11/2016,20160611,5,4.12,I wish I had more than one stomach!!!! One of the best in terms of food and the service to match!!!!!!!
6/12/2016,20160612,5,4.12,"Absolutely delicious. I haven't had breakfast this good in a very long time. There's a catch. Patience. If it is the weekend, arrive before they open because there will be a line waiting on the doors to crack open. I'm not joking. It is worth the wake-up alarm and the wait. We ordered the French Toast flight and the lamb omelet. Both were so great. Will be back."
6/12/2016,20160612,5,4.13,"This place gets a rare 5-star rating. There are so many reasons why it's a great brunch place, but I'll cover the highlights:First, and most importantly, the food is outstanding. And it's the type of place where even their every-day non-special dishes are amazing. My boyfriend got the buckwheat pancakes and they were the best he's ever had. I got the Lobster Shrimp Spinach Benny which was not only flavorful but had huge pieces of shrimp and lobster.Secondly, the service was fast and attentive. Coffee cups and water never got close to being empty the entire time.Lastly, the menu offered a good variety. I was afraid it would be focused on pancakes and other batter-based items, but it had plenty of other innovative meals.I've read other reviews that complain about the wait, but if you get there between 8-9am, you'll walk right in. It's worth waking up for."
6/13/2016,20160613,4,4.13,"Who: me plus oneWhat: (Deets) Sweet potato waffles with chicken cutlet cubes in the batter & chicken breast & Super French toast flight (the carrot cake French toast was perfect). An extra sphere of house made whipped maple butter is worth the $.50 surcharge!When: Sunday breakfast 9am-ishJune 12, 2016Where: dine-in center aisle table next to the waiting area benches Why: Black Owned How: car. We found parking directly in front of the restaurant!Bathroom: Didn't use it Service: Fantastic. My meal companion had his ice water glass refilled 7 times, and I had a bottomless cup of coffee refilled twice, unsolicted. The waitress checked on us at least 3 times. The manager even helped me to locate the correct song ""Hey Hey"" that was playing during the meal, to add to my playlist on iTunes. (No small feat when the music is quite than the moderate noise level during the bustle of Sunday breakfast).Bottom line: Go! Go! Go to this restaurant."
6/13/2016,20160613,5,4.13,Batter and Berries!!! There was a wait but that wasn't much of an issue. We were able to do some shopping. Once a table was ready they texted and called us. The food was awesome and the staff was super friendly. This place is definitely a gem!
6/14/2016,20160614,5,4.13,"Omg, omg, omg!! I think if heaven had a breakfast place, this would be it. When I say that this was the best breakfast I have every had, that is not an over exaggeration. This food was so good I almost cried.That chicken sausage was amazing and the French toast flight was killer. I can not stress enough how good this food was.On top of this amazing food they had the nerve to have a super awesome server. This man knew his stuff! hit every question out of the park like babe Ruth hitting a softball and he even gave us suggestions on places to visit in the city.Because I am a yelper I have to give a critique. YOU WILL WAIT TO GET IN. Do not go to this place thinking you are going to walk in and sit down. It isn't going to happen. you can hang it up BUT the wait is worth it for amazing food and great service. My only suggestion to them is that they should allow people to call ahead. The place is small I don't want to pay for that extra 45 mins of parking, this is Chicago people! That's expensive.Overall this place was wonderful! I will definitely be back."
6/14/2016,20160614,1,4.12,(FYI: 0 STARS) I can't even rate the food because I didn't get seated. The line was going out the door and people filling the place must have gone past the standard seating limit. I barely was greeted by the hostess (who was very frustrated by the crowd). I figured I would make my own french toast at home and have a better experience. Never will I consider this place in the future despite reviews I have heard of good food.
6/15/2016,20160615,2,4.12,"Hate to say that I was disappointed in my experience here because I seem to be in the minority but I'll give you a quick run-through of my time at Batter & Berries so you can judge for yourself. I went on a Wednesday morning around 10am. I have visited the restaurant other times but never felt like waiting the 45-90 minutes to get a table and decided to go elsewhere. As expected, there was no wait. The restaurant was loud and busy but not crowded. Unfortunately, when I walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. Several servers and busboys walked by but no one greeted us or offered to help. Everyone just looked at us and turned away. Finally, one hostess pointed to an empty table and told us to sit there. Surely not the best service to begin our dining experience but also not unforgivable. When our server finally came to the table, she explained what the specials of the week were. It was nice that she had an iPad to show us pictures of the entrees not listed on the menu. This was really enticing and effective method as both my mother and I ordered items based on the photos presented to us. Unfortunately, that's not what arrived to the table. My jerk crab omelet was incredibly flavorful but swimming in oil. The carrot cake french toast arrived to our table barely lukewarm and with few fixings. The hash browns that came with our meals were cheesy but overcooked. None of the items were as pictured. My mother also ordered a pulled pork sandwich to eat later in the day and was also underwhelmed with that selection. We spent $70 and aren't likely to return. This place came highly recommended but if the quality of the service and food is subpar on a Wednesday morning then I certainly can't imagine waiting for an hour or more for a similar or worse experience."
6/17/2016,20160617,5,4.12,A great place for breakfast or a brunch. Busy even at 10:30am on a Thursday. I recommend their spinach omelette and buckwheat pancakes.
6/18/2016,20160618,5,4.12,"This is a great restaurant and I'm proud it is black owned! I wish they would open another location in the south and west suburbs. It was my pre-birthday breakfast and my girl knew I always wanted to try B&B. This is loud and crowded place but it's worth it. The waitress was nice, she explained anything we asked on the menu, recommended what first time customers should choose and showed us Instagram photos of items that weren't listed on the menu. My lady had the Jerk Omelette, I had the Chicken Parmesan Omelette and we shared their famous french toast. I highly recommend this B&B but bring your money because this isn't cheap"
6/20/2016,20160620,5,4.12,"From the moment you walk in everything was amazing! The server was quick, nice and knowledgeable of all the amazing food items. The food came out super fast. Coffee was kept up on. We ordered the french toast super flight which included the chef special which was a peach cobbler and the traditional breakfast and shared both. Every bite was more perfect them the last. I highly recommend coming here. You will not be disappointed!"
6/27/2016,20160627,3,4.12,This place is located in the heart of Lincoln park. The wait was about 30 minutes on the day I came- not too long. It's a small locations but on a Monday afternoon it was surprisingly crowded. The server was friendly and knowledgeable offering images for all food. I found this very helpful. I ordered the buffalo wrap. It was drenched in sauce and came with sweet potato fries. The fries were good. My niece had chocolate chip pancakes which they loved. They were very accommodating of children. It was a big sugar rush for them. My sister got the fish and chips. It comes with a load of fries and 3 pieces of thickly battered fish. The restrooms were clean but you walk out and your right next to the kitchen.... Not sure about that. The owner is present and walks around. The volume was loud!
6/28/2016,20160628,5,4.12,"Very cute local brunch spot. We went on a Monday morning and had to wait around 5 minutes for seats at the communal table which was just a large table in the middle of the restaurant shared by multiple groups of customers. There were very interesting specials, like the Deconstructed Lamb Omelette that my boyfriend got, but I got the Banana-Nut Belgigue which was a waffle topped with caramelized bananas and a maple butter syrup. Very delicious but also very very sweet. The potatoes/hashbrown that Mike got with his omelette were fantastic as was there homemade hot sauce!"
6/29/2016,20160629,4,4.12,"Love love this place! It is sooo delicious! :) There is definitely always a wait!! I went here at least 3 times until I was given a wait time that was reasonable. Luckily, we were seated sooner than the actual wait time quoted. The place is small, quite crowded but cute and comfortable. I got the French toast flight - yummmm! It was delicious :) :) The B&B maple butter is a must! I loved it!! My boyfriend got the chicken & waffles; there were chicken pieces in the waffle and he was in love with the dish!! Definitely a must try. They also have cheesy hash brown that we thoroughly enjoyed! The food came out quite fast, was delicious and very satisfying! I would recommend going during though week (although there are also large wait times during the week, so I can't imagine the weekend)."
7/4/2016,20160704,4,4.12,"I'm not quite sure how this was my first time at Batter & Berries, but I assure you, it won't be my last! When it's a holiday and there's no people on the streets except for those waiting to get in here....you KNOW there must be something special going on. The hubs and I waited for 35 mins for this byob'd gem and it was well worth the wait!Everything sounded great so out took me awhile to decide on what to order. The regular menu looked incredible, but I do try to order what's on special whenever I eat out. Those selections tend to be the freshest. I tried the crab Benedict daily special and we split the kid sized special French toast of the day.....apple pie. Let me start by saying that I hate runny eggs and white sauces. But that crab Benedict was the real deal! The crab was ALL blue crab. Being an east coast girl, I was ready to harshly judge, but was super pumped that I didn't have to! The French toast was ridiculous .... And that butter....good lord! You could eat that stuff by itself, and by the spoonful!The hubs got the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken from the regular menu. Another ridiculously amazing choice! The portions were plenty, so we both had leftovers for another full meal! Another thing I want to mention is the house made hot sauce. Holy cow. And I don't want to forget to mention the service, which was impeccably given by Tim.I will DEFINITELY return. What a delicious brunch spot!"
7/4/2016,20160704,5,4.13,"There always seems to be a wait- ours was 45 minutes, but it was nice that they were able to text us when they had a table ready so we didn't have to wait outside the whole time. Our server was great - she explained the menu/specials to us and was prompt with bringing out the food, filling up our waters, to bringing out the check. The french toast super flight was delicious -- I like the strawberry, blueberry, and caramel.. The lemon and apple were a bit too sweet for me. Do not need any syrup! Good on its own.Noise Level: In the description it says average, but it was pretty loud the whole time we were there. It is a small space, but didn't feel too stuffed."
7/5/2016,20160705,5,4.13,We arrived at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning and there was so wait. Tried the super flight that included the apple pie French toast and it was amazing. I think it may have actually changed my life.
7/5/2016,20160705,5,4.13,"Used to live half a block away from this lovely breakfast joint, and I miss it everyday!! Seriously, it's all about 'The Flight' french toast; a sample of their strawberry, blueberry, lemon & caramel french toast served with maple butter. Each one tastes delicious and all 4 flavors go together so well. I think you can pay an extra couple bucks for an extra slice of their french toast of the day...those are hit or miss though. I had an oreo one that was AMAZING once, but then had a blood orange one that wasn't that great.. but besides that, their french toast is hands down the best. I order a side of hashbrowns with cheese on the side and those are super good as well. They have decent coffee, and if you're a fan of tea they have a really great selection. I think the ONLY con of this place is the wait- you're almost always going to have to wait anywhere from 10-40 minutes, depending on the day/time you go (morning weekends being busiest, but it is well worth the wait. Overall, this place is great and I recommend it to everyone!"
7/10/2016,20160710,5,4.13,"I have had my eye on this place for a couple months now, waiting for the opportunity until i would fly out to Chicago. The restaurant definitely did not disappoint. The food was phenomenal! I ordered the super french toast flight which included the apple pie, lemon, caramel, strawberry, and blueberry french toast. I've never been a fan of french toast but I literally devoured all of them. From the freshness of the fruit and the sweetness of the caramel, I was very pleased. The bread wasn't soggy at all even though there were plenty of toppings on each piece. My other item was the jerk lobster omelette(no mushrooms or broccoli and used regular eggs instead of egg whites)! This was by far the best omelet that i have ever had. It was topped with a nice portion of real lobster and all of the seasonings and ingredients worked extremely well together (i didn't even have to add any salt or pepper which is a big deal for me). Just thinking about it makes me want to plan my next trip to Chicago (yes it's that serious,lol). Also the side of hash browns were delicious! Other items at the table were the fish& chips (great) and the crab cake benedict which was my other favorite! The customer service was superb. The General Manager, Don, was very personable and went around to every table to ensure that all the customers were having a good experience while also recommending items from the menu. He also took the time out to take a pic with me when I told him that I had a food blog. Our waitress was also very pleasant and went over the items with us and answered all of our questions. I will definitely return every time that I am in Chicago. Not to mention that the establishment is black owned and is also BYOB. Great food, great service, great restaurant. OAN, be prepared to wait. We did a little sight seeing around the area to pass time but they text you when they're almost ready to seat you so it worked out perfectly."
7/10/2016,20160710,5,4.13,"More often than not, you hear about a popular place well before you come across it, and more times than not, it's HYPE! I heard about this place while in KOREA. Folks were excited about it. It was EXTRA! EXTRA! on the front page of Food Times. It's fabulous, it's fabulous! Eat Eat! It's black owned, you gotta try it! FINE, DAYUM, get up off me! BACK UP! BACK UP! MIND YO BIDNESS! THAT'S ALL, JUST MIND YO BIDNESS! #namethatreferenceThis place is sublime from walking into the door until you get your check, pay and walk back out the door. They considered this menu. They made sure it made sense! They gave something for everyone. OH DAYUM, I can't choose, order the french toast flight that allows you to try all of the french toast because YOU HAVE TO TRY ALL OF THE FRENCH TOAST! The biscuits and gravy...CHICKEN SAUSAGE! When does that happen??v Those hash browns...cheesy goodness! I want to take these hash browns on my honeymoon with me! BYOB! Umm, sloshy breakfast anyone?? I haven't had anything here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The service. Crazy enough, I've had the same server both times I went. He's amazing. He knows the full menu by heart, this man basically knows what you're going to order, before you do! I'm promise, I'm not lying. The sitting, the arrangement, the kitchen placement, they thought about this restaurant. And it shows in every aspect. The wait can get RIDICULOUS. So, I highly recommend going during a time that's not typically really busy, early in the morning. It's delicious."
7/13/2016,20160713,5,4.13,Awesome food I went over the weekend.. Expect to have a long wait... The food was worth it.. I had the spinach and mushroom omelette with the cheesy potatoes. You can taste that it's quality food. It was so good. I can't wait to go again.
7/13/2016,20160713,5,4.13,"Absolutely hands down the best breakfast fare I've ever eaten!! The staff was attentive and helpful,the owner was informative and engaging with the customers about the specials and variety offered. I had a chicken Alfredo omelet with hash browns , my brothers had the Salmon executive ,and a jerk lobster omelet that were both excellent!!! The table shared French toast flights that were delicious with a maple butter that tasted like ice cream! This was an awesome experience, they're BYOB too for my mimosa and belini drankin' folks! A1 top to bottom , I look forward to another trip there in the not to distant future!! Bon Appétit"

7/13/2016,20160713,3,4.13,"I wish it could've been everything I heard it was. I went with a group and got there when it opened just for it to already have a line down the block! So, didn't get to experience it then since the wait was over 2 hours. Second time I took my mom and the wait was fairly shorter since it was during a week day. The place is very cramped and small. It would be nice if they would expand so your not neck in neck with the next person. Staff is nice and very efficient, but when I ordered my food, it was cold. The concept of the items I ordered (french toast sampler) with eggs would've been better if it was hotter but the different french toast they offered were interesting. Strawberry, Pina Colada, Caramel Crunch, and regular. Seems like they are a bit overwhelmed since its always boomin in there. My mom ordered an omelete with bacon, bacon was burnt. But for some reason I am compelled to maybe try again and hopefully they'll get it right. Maybe third times a charm?"

7/15/2016,20160715,5,4.13,"For a VERY warm, welcoming experience for brunch, Batter & Berries is hands down my favorite Lincoln Park choice! I was blown away from over the multiple selections of omelets/French Toast availble to choose(Even alligator meat is an option). The most popular is the ""Flight of French Toast"" sampler which consists of four flavors of (Lemon Strawberry,Blueberry & Carmel). Delicious!!I also had the ""Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof)"" which is a chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle With a lightly batter chicken breast drizzled in nutmeg hot sauce and maple butter...Best chicken and waffle combo I have tasted thus far! No syrup was needed, the sweetness of the fresh fruits was more than enough. Everthing was freshly made. All chicken/pork sausage made in house.Our server was above excellent and took care of all my family's needs. We had so much food on our table we needed help arranging our drinks to fit. Prices were very reasonable $10.00 -$12.00 on average. There is only street parking only (meter) but parking is not expensive. Hours are 8AM-3PM. I visited on a weekday morning, so I can only imagine the weekend crowds. Thank You, Chef Derek Rylon for a fantastic breakfast experience :)"
7/15/2016,20160715,5,4.13,"What a gem. This spot has the rare combination of amazing food & a warm, homey feel. My only suggestion- bring your friends so you can order & try it all: Spot-on breakfast staples (those cheesy potatoes tho!), creative twists like crabcakes benedict & a lamb omelette. Sweet potato waffle with fried chicken was amazing, and the cantaloupe french toast was a darkhorse favorite - and I don't even LIKE cantaloupe! Service was warm and wonderful, and our table cozied up against the window was the perfect spot to watch passersby while still admiring the place's brightly colored walls and funky paintings. We'll be back!"

This go round, I took my best friend for her birthday...we shared the French Toast sampler (Lemon; Strawberry; Caramel; Blueberry; & Cantaloupe ((yes, Cantaloupe)). All were super delicious, moist and tasty. My best friend ordered the lobster omelet and I ordered the crab cake Benedict. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our bellies. I decided to forego the hashbrowns in favor of my crab cake Benedict, which was again super delicious. I had a small bite of my friends lobster omelet and it was very tasty as well. So yes, just as good as the 1st time."

For your first time plan on a wait time, try one of the chef's special and they will even keep your champagne cold for your mimosas. I love this place!!"
7/16/2016,20160716,5,4.14,"So good! I'm normally not a sweet breakfast person but the French toast was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I both got the apple pie French toast topped with their signature maple butter and split a side of the cheesy hash browns - everything was great! Beyond the delicious meal, the service was excellent. We sat at the community table and were served right away. The waitress had an iPad for sending orders to the kitchen and was able to give us a lot of extra attention. Definitely plan to come back again!"
7/16/2016,20160716,4,4.14,"Overall experience a 9. The food was def AMAZING but the wait can be a bit long and not managed that well. However, I can't see anyone ordering something that they wouldn't be extremely satisfied with. We had the Spinach and Crab cake Benedict which was cooked to perfection,The Flight (sampler of all their French toasts) which included a Lemon, Strawberry, Blueberry, and Caramel as well as their cheesy hash browns, and lay but not least the Jerk chicken and shrimp omelet. It really was all great. Just depends on what your palette is in the mood for."

Our waiter was awesome - Wonderful service, VERY fast getting our food out and most importantly the food was amazing. I got the daily special which was a lobster omelet with hash browns and a side of chicken sausage. Next time I am in Chicago I will 100% be back!!!"
7/17/2016,20160717,4,4.14,"I visited from Charlotte NC and really enjoyed the food. We ate here twice. The strawberry French toast is the best. I gave it only four stars because I didn't think the hostess looked professional, wasn't friendly and didn't smile. She is the first person you see when you come in and she doesn't give you a warm welcoming."
7/17/2016,20160717,5,4.14,"This place was just reeeaaaaalllllly good. Welcoming hostess, very apparently attentive management, good service, and, most importantly, the food is an absolute homerun.I'm a savory breakfast guy, and generally don't go for waffles, French toast, pancakes etc. I'm frankly thankful that B&B's egg dishes were somewhat uninspiring, otherwise I may not have ordered the absolutely killer Apple waffle I got. One of the best breakfasts I've had in Chicago, hands down.I'd add one or two caveats here. FIRST, if you can be honest with yourself and know that you are a high maintenance eater that wishes to customize their order - this isn't the place. They reccomended how to eat their food, and strongly discourage substitution or customization. Second, if you absolutely 100% are not down for a (amazing) bready breakfast, there are probably better options out there.If you DO want the best French toast, pancakes, or waffles in the city - go here."
7/18/2016,20160718,3,4.14,"Come for the French toast flight and maple butter, and steak omelette, which my husband called ""ridiculous."" Noise was really loud and as I get older, I don't have much tolerance for it. Service was great although hurried with the crowds. Turnover happened quickly so waits didn't seemtoo long."
7/19/2016,20160719,5,4.14,"A+ all the way! This place is amazing. The menu is so diverse and popping with flavor. Lots of good choices, I don't think you could go wrong. Even if you're a really picky eater. We had the flight super, jerk lobster omelette and the chicken Cesar wrap. All was amazing! However, if you're picky it can't have certain ingredients, be sure to ask what's in your meal. I had to send my meal back because there was cheese in the omelette and on the hash browns. The atmosphere is really welcoming and not intimidating at all. My bro and I say at the community table and had great conversations with others. You're also allowed to BYOB--champagne, wine or beer. This is really awesome especially if you hate paying for overpriced drinks. I would definitely recommend this place. Super great food and really nice area."
7/20/2016,20160720,1,4.14,"The two of us came in just as they had opened. The hostess sat us at a high-top community table. When we asked if we could be moved to a traditional table she gave a disgusted look, grabbed our menus, walked over and whisked them onto a different table, then walked away, all without saying a word! She was very rude and had extremely negative energy. Our server did her job, but never once smiled and, in fact, seemed to be very unhappy. The other servers stood around tackily on ""gossip mode"". There was an obvious commonality of negativity amongst the entire staff. Most managers give a pre-shift pep-talk, but it seemed like these employees were given a death-talk instead... Our food came out lukewarm, which I didn't understand since they weren't very busy. If our food were hot, at least one thing would have gone right. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Overall, it was an uncomfortable experience."
7/21/2016,20160721,5,4.14,"I have never in my life had: a lamb omelet, a lobster omelet, a sweet potato waffle. But the warmth and hominess of this establishment made me feel like I had been eating this holy trinity of breakfast foods my whole life. The combination of flavors felt -- just right! As someone who has grown up on thick lamb stews, the lamb omelet offered some strong competition in terms of flavors, while also flaunting' its breakfast abilities through a pairing of cheesy hash browns.Our party also sampled the flight of french toasts, and most impressive was the incredible flavor of the melon toast. Melons are known for being that ""extra"" fruit used to stuff CVS fruit bowls. Never have I known them as the stuff of incredible flavor. If a restaurant can take a ridiculed fruit and make it its special, then sign me up! We also had the chicken and waffles, with waffles made of sweet potato batter. The chicken was perfectly crisp with skin so flavorful you could still taste it during the next bite. What really hit this out of the park for us was the service -- both our server as well as the manager made us feel so incredibly at home, and this is the reason why we will make sure to tell all our family and friends about this restaurant. Treat your clientele like family and we will come back. This is what hospitality looks like."
7/22/2016,20160722,5,4.14,"I've been wanting to come here for quite a while now. I pass by it all the time on my way to work. I've decided to finally give batter and berries a try while catching up with one of my best friends from high school Terence (it was his first time as well). I have to say this. BEST. FRENCH TOAST. EVER. I order the super flight with a side of pork sausage and bacon, it was phenomenal. Our waiter was awesome as well, providing excellent service. If you're looking for an awesome breakfast spot with great quality food, batter and berries is the way to go!"
7/22/2016,20160722,5,4.14,"OMG!! Awesome food, but get there early or you will be waiting outside - it is very cozy. We had the French Toast sampler as an app (so good). I had the crab & spinach benedict with hash browns - weird combo but it worked beautifully. From other plates, I sampled the jerk lobster omelette and the lamb omelette. They have something for everyone and you will not be disappointed in your choice. I suggest everyone ordering something different and sharing - trust me, you will want to.Our waiter was warm, friendly and funny - he asked riddles to pass the time. He was very attentive, but not overbearing. Wished we knew it was BYOB, but that did not take away from the meal. We rolled up out of there stuff and happy."
7/22/2016,20160722,5,4.14,"Food was well worth the hype. The wait is long and they don't have that many tables, but the staff is very friendly."
7/22/2016,20160722,5,4.14,"Exceptional server, Tim, made great recommendations. French Toast Super flight is a must have!! Biscuits and gravy delish"
7/25/2016,20160725,5,4.14,"I've eaten at a number of good eateries. However, this was the best omelet ever! Jerk lobster egg white omelet and four variations of French toast. Jessica was an awesome server!"
7/26/2016,20160726,5,4.14,"So many friends told me about this spot. I keep saying sure, one day. Well that day came 2day. I was greeted by 2 nice ladies who were hosts. I got a 2 seater table by myself and this overly nice server, Tusiime. I told him I was dining alone and he sat down and went over the entire menu and was funny and cool like we have known each other forever. I decided on the jerk lobster omelette which was tasty and on point. The coffee was delish. The decor was vibrant, inviting. The music was good. The noise was average. The server kept coming to my table to check on me as well as the bus boys took my trash, refilled my coffee & water without me asking.  I can't wait to get back to try more of what they have. I was overly impressed."
7/26/2016,20160726,5,4.14,"WORTH THE WAIT. My boyfriend and I were craving some brunch and we decided to take a chance with this place. We went during the week just a little after noon and there was a wait. The hostess mentioned the wait was about 35 minutes so we put our name on the list and waited for our text. Surprisingly we only waited about 20 minutes (which was great because we expected an hour with the amount of people before us). This place has daily specials that they write on a board and the waiters always suggest great dishes. Our waitress was exceptionally phenomenal I wish I remembered her name because she made the experience above all. She suggested my boyfriend try the chicken and waffles and I tried the total flight. When our food came out extremely fast and she made sure our food was prepared properly/ She even went back to the kitchen for some more hot sauce for the chicken and waffles so he could get the FULL experience. GREAT taste when putting the chicken, waffle, hot sauce in one bite. My total flight which included all of the different flavors of french toast was a PERFECT amount of food with a different taste in every toast. Overall, we didn't spend too long there because there really was no need. The wait for table was quick, our food wait was short, our portions were perfect and our waitress was always on top of things. Definitely coming back again soon!"
7/26/2016,20160726,3,4.14,It was my first time there. The Strawberry French toast was great and the chicken sausage was ok. the food was not as hot temperature wise. the hash browns were too soft and my food wasn't served at the same time. I received my eggs close to the end of my meal. Maybe I'll give it another try but not soon.
7/31/2016,20160731,5,4.14,I love breakfast and seafood - put them together and you've changed my life! You will not find a place with a more delicious or eclectic breakfast menu. Everything here is good and the chef will continue to amaze you with life-altering combinations. If the wait times weren't so long I'd move to Lincoln Park just to dine here daily.
8/2/2016,20160802,3,4.14,"3 stars....The Good:The food is very tasty. And I very much enjoyed the salmon executive; perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect balance between the egg whites and hash browns. Well executed mean. The waffles were a little heavy but the maple butter was legendary. The Bad:Service is really not good. Let's start with hostesses; poor communication. It's an electronic list and both have iPads that are managing the seat roster. There's a preference for large groups so if you're 2 people and all other 2 tops are full, they will make you wait until a 2 top opens, even if there's a 4 top available. One hostess (blonde) had no idea what the other hostess (African-American) was seating. Not well organized. Furthermore, the hostesses just throw the menus down at the table after your seated; not just for us but we noticed it for EVERY table. We also noticed this with the food servers (not the waitress); he would come to your table and lifelessly ask what you order and plop down your food. My server was personable but when she noticed I didn't have sugar for coffee she came back and stuffed like 15 packets of Stevia in my hand with a ""here ya go.""Overall The food was good enough to almost overcome the frustrating seating. However, it wasn't enough to overcome the service. People rave about this place and I thought it was just OK as someone who considers themselves a breakfast/brunch fanatic in Chicago. Prices are comparable to what you'd pay at other establishments in Chicago; two entrees (egg dishes), 2 coffees and pancakes and french toast will run you an easy $60 not including tip. I encourage you to explore other options if you haven't been already given there usually is a very long wait (we waited 90 minutes for our table) and the line is usually VERY long. No reservations. The hassle of waiting and getting a table doesn't beat out the food experience unless there's something on the menu that you absolutely love or can't get a close facsimile somewhere else."
8/2/2016,20160802,5,4.14,"It was AMAZING!!!! The dining area was rather small. So small I was bumping up against the people that was already sitting down eating as I was lead to our table. food is great though I will definitely be back! Our waiter was very nice & helpful, she even told me that if I didn't like my dish she would get me something else, seeing that I had never had the crab & spinach Benedict but it was good after all. Overall it's a very nice place you definitely won't be disappointed!"
8/3/2016,20160803,5,4.14,"Excellent food every time, and fast friendly service. Chef Rylon really has a gem in Lincoln Park. I don't usually write reviews but after the 2nd time of going, I realized that there aren't many brunch places as creative and delicious as Batter & Berries. The cluck-n-chuck is especially excellent (creative take on chicken n waffles), and this is coming from someone who never chooses to eat waffles!"
8/4/2016,20160804,4,4.14,"Our family (7 members) went on Sunday, July 31, 2016, around 11AM. We braced ourselves for the wait, and it was as daunting as we expected (2 hours). Yes, 2 hours! We were seated around1PM. We managed to get good street parking (that's all avail), and sort of played on our phones, chatted, and people-watched. The inside of the restaurant was chaotic, loud, and energetic but the food was devine. I had the jerk lobster over egg whites with hash browns. Hash browns not so good, greasy and soggy, and kind of tasteless. My party had lots of waffles, and there was one pork chop. I sampled the waffles, and they were exceptional, and the maple butter melted in my mouth. I didn't need the syrup. All in all, it's a good restaurant, a 'work still in progress'...really, they just need to find larger quarters and do wall hangings to absorb the noise. Our waitress managed to be a little personable, but she was spread pretty thin between tables. If you want to 'sleep' at breakfast, I'd suggest going elsewhere. The best time to go is before 9AM any day, especially on Sundays. But the manager recommended coming very early on weekdays. I'll certainly return."
8/5/2016,20160805,5,4.14,"I am a big breakfast person. This place is amazing! Small cozy place with the nicest staff and nice decor. They even have a small waiting area inside with stone benches. What to order? Everything. I had the French toast flight supreme. That's one thick half slices of five different flavors of French toast, blueberry, strawberry, lemon, nut and banana nut with this delicious spread you just can't get enough of. Mom had three buttermilk pancakes that were the size of the plate covered in berries. My husband had an apple waffle that was also the size of the plate and my son had a sweet potato and chicken stuffed waffle with fried chicken. Yikes was that delicious. Coffee was great and tea is leaves that they steep for you. Service was fast to. Great choice if you decide to go there. You won't be sorry!"
8/6/2016,20160806,4,4.14,"We reached B&B at 7:30am - you heard it right - that early, for hubby's birthday breakfast & it was all worth it !! Portions are quite huge so we shared and ordered a super flight of French toast which had strawberry, caramel, blueberry, walnut French toast with a homemade banana bread and maple butter; and we also had a deconstructed spinach omelette along with a kid's strawberry French toast for our little one.Food was scrumptious, every bit of it - we had completely cleaned the food off the plate for sure!Service was excellent, super duper fast but not rushed so that's good. Highly recommend to go there early. By 7:30am there were more than 15 people and the place itself can hold 25-30 people ...Try it !"
8/7/2016,20160807,5,4.14,"Service: Hostesses were neutral - 2.5 stars. But we had a great waiter! It was all moving so fast I forgot to get his name. He was friendly and all smiles, swiftly input our order into the iPad, tasked us with a couple of fun riddles and then BOOM our food started coming out - FAST, like fast food fast.FOOD: French toast flight!!! Chicago has SO much good food. This is right in there. We went with the super flight which included all the regulars (caramel, lemon, blueberry, strawberry) + the flavor of the day (on this day it was banana bread). Pretty amazing!The Executive (rib eye, sautéed mushrooms & red wine sauce with 2 eggs & cheesy hash browns - really good - the hash browns could have used a little more flavor.Overall, great food - can't wait to come back!"
8/7/2016,20160807,5,4.15,"My friend took me here after both of us got turned down by the dmv and we had a delicious time! We shared 2 special - one was crab and lobster omelette and the other was scallions on English muffin , like eggs Benedict - and they were fantastic!! Will be back with hubby"
8/7/2016,20160807,1,4.14,"The worst service ever here and the food wasn't good. The worst part about the service was the OWNER of the restaurant! Wait time is soooo not with it! You'll wait around 1-2 HOURS MINIMUM.I would give it ZERO stars if I could.Food was NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL!! So many other good places. Not worth the wait time. There was hardly anyone in front of us and still we waited more than 1.5 hrs! We received terrible service. I wish we would have just went to the BONGO ROOM! They would seat you quicker and give you a much higher quality of food and service.Got here extraordinarily early in the morning, hardly any line and I still didn't get seated until around 1.5-2 hrs later after getting an estimate of 36-50 minutes. Then when they said our table was ready, we had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they GAVE the table that they said was ours to someone else! I saw them do it with my own eyes. When I went to the host she said I would only be a couple of minutes... But it wasn't, she had to wait until another group of people decided to leave. When I explained to the owner how long our wait was and I tried to say that our table was given away he was extraordinarily condescending. I politely said ""I'm surprised at the service given to us this far, and the wait time. Even when they said our table was ready, we still had to wait another 20 min"" He didn't apologize and said ""you have no idea how many people were really before you so you don't know that your table was given away. Also we quoted you a number that was just an estimate. You only had to wait a few minutes longer."" I'm sorry but the time the women quoted us versus how long it actually took was ridiculous! He was EXTRAORDINARILY RUDE and condescending. I've never been talked down too like that from someone who was supposed to be a manager or owner before. I don't know how they are still in business I will NEVER BE BACK, nor would I support a kind of business that only cares about money rather than satisfying their customers.Once we got seated the owner left such a bad taste in my mouth I couldn't even order food or eat. So, it was kind of a waste for us."
8/9/2016,20160809,5,4.14,"Batter & Berries is worth every second that you have to wait in their line.I am not a huge breakfast fan but Batter & Berries blew me away. Definitely my new favorite breakfast/brunch place probably because their menu is geared more towards brunch meals than your traditional breakfast menu.My friend and I didn't have time to stay for the 1 and 1/2 hour wait so we decided to order carry out at their take-out counter inside the restaurant (You can't called your order in ahead). We ordered the Chicken and Sweet Potato waffle, a half order of Blueberry french toast and an Egg-white omelette with shrimp. Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of those meals. My favorite was the Chicken and waffle which is served with a melted butter and maple syrup combined sauce. The Sweet Potato waffle was cooked to perfection. It was a great texture, had great flavors and even had little pieces of chicken made into the waffle. The chicken that came with the waffle was a light piece of boneless chicken that was not overly seasoned or fried which paired deliciously with the waffle.I also enjoyed the egg-white omelette with shrimp. The shrimp were huge and had a great rich flavor. The shrimp were served on top of the omelette and then the whole dish was covered in a very rich and flavorful sauce. However I could do without the cheese-covered hash browns that come on the side of this dish.I also liked the Blueberry french toast but I am glad that I only ordered a half order because while it was great, the other two meals were much better. The french toast was thick and drizzled with the butter-maple syrup sauce and a ton of blueberries. Overall excellent brunch meal. Batter & Berries is my favorite breakfast/brunch restaurant in Chicago. Definitely worth waiting in line, or ordering a take-out order."
8/13/2016,20160813,5,4.14,"Fantastic. Excellent experience overall, great food, very nice service, really cute atmosphere."
8/14/2016,20160814,1,4.14,"I gave this restaurant 1 star because our waiter was quite amusing and enthusiastic. Unfortunately for this restaurant my chair was facing the kitchen and there is no door on the kitchen so I was watching the final prep stage of the food. I saw the prep guy with his bare hand-no glove pick up handfuls of fresh fruit-as in pineapple, strawberries and melon, and throw it on a plate. You guessed it that was my fruit. I couldn't eat it I was so nauseous. My omelet was good but kept wondering how that was prepared. I also ordered ice tea and it tasted like the bottom dredges and had been sitting for weeks. It was not drinkable at all.We were so excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews, but for me it's 1 and done!"
8/16/2016,20160816,5,4.14,This is the place to be in the morning! Amazing menu and the food plus service goes beyond my standards. Our waitress was genuine and excited about the food and very hospitable. Highly recommend the cluck and gaufe- one of a kind combo right there. My boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy with cheesy hashbrowns. He said the gravy was lacking but overall he still devoured the whole thing!
8/24/2016,20160824,3,4.14,I had breakfast there 12-30-13 and I want to start out saying I don't really know if the food is really all that good. We were seated by the door and our coffee either was served cold or the wind gusts brought on by 8 degree weather made it become iced coffee. I couldn't really enjoy the food because my feet were cold inside of the restaurant.  I would like to think that the owner lives in Chicago and that he knew that we have winter months and he should have prepared for this in september instead of subjecting his customers to cold food and even colder coffee. But my other companions really enjoyed the French toast flights and would like to go back. I had the lobster benedict which even though it was lukewarm is was pretty good considering the wind gusts in the restaurant. We do plan on going back in the summer so we can see what it feels like having hot air coming into the restaurant.
8/25/2016,20160825,5,4.14,"You haven't eaten breakfast until you've eaten here. They haven't let me down yet, and I don't expect they ever will. Please try the homemade chicken sausage with anything, you won't be disappointed."
8/28/2016,20160828,5,4.14,"Visiting chitown from miami for the weekend and we had a great brunch!!!!! 3 things that Stand out.1) you can bring your own alcohol... Don't forget bc they don't even serve alcohol2) long wait - but it's a good thing bc lots of people come here bc they are doing something right.3) food is awesome! I had the executive breakfast with a ribeye, cheesy hash browns & 2 eggs. Our server was the best! Nice black man who told everyone little riddles during breakfast (forgot his name my bad)"
8/29/2016,20160829,4,4.14,"Loved this place. Pancakes with the maple butter was awesome. Homemade sausage is good, both pork and chicken. Staff was great. Definitely recommend to anyone visiting."
8/29/2016,20160829,4,4.14,"Such a fun delicious place! Went for brunch on a Friday. The wait was 45 min; which though long is apparently much shorter than it traditionally is on a weekend. For some reason it was cash only this day, signs were posted on the door upon entrance-though they say they take credit normally. I had the sweet potato and chicken waffle. Which is quite interesting not only is there a piece of chicken on the side with a really good hot sauce on it (though not terribly spicy) there are also bits of chicken baked into the waffle?! Needless to say I cleaned my plate. They had several other omelettes that looked great and I would have loved to try...reasons to return I suppose. Our server was a funny and engaging guy. Came over and quizzed us with riddles and the like...which I got 2 out of 3 right by the way (ijs). His personality certainly made up for the fact that we had waited almost an hour and were teased terribly when the cook came over to our table not once but TWICE with food that wasn't ours but looked amazing lol. All was forgiven!"
8/31/2016,20160831,4,4.14,"This is me and the Hubz go to place when we're both off and the kids are in school. I don't know where to start. The breakfast is some of the best I've ever had. And every time our waiter list off the specials of the week my Hubz falls in love. There is also a special flavored French toast every week. To make things easy we always order the ""Super Flight"" which is all the main French toast plus the ""special"". Overall this is the best breakfast place for a true foodie. I took a star away because they refuse to seat you even if someone is outside just paying the meter. Oh yea and don't not feed them because you will be enjoying the food so much you won't notice the meter maid writing the ticket."
8/31/2016,20160831,5,4.14,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday via stellar reviews and a blogger recommendation. I always go with a restaurant's speciality and in this case I'm glad I did! I went with the French toast which was amazing! You get to try all the Flavors they offer! My favorite was the caramel! The wait wasn't too long, maybe 40 mins. The venue isn't that big, but the food comes out extremely quick. The wait staff was also great as well. Definitely go there if you're in the mood for a tasty brunch!"
9/3/2016,20160903,1,4.14,"I've been here twice. First time had crab cakes and the chicken waffles plus the hashbrown and eggs. Everything including the services was great. That was a few months ago. I went again this past Wednesday, and the service was horrible. The girl serving me left me with the menus for nearly 29 minutes; the place was empty. I ordered the crab cakes again with eggs and my daughter had the fajita omelet. This was by far the worst resultant food I have ever had. The dos had absolutely no seasoning. I guess they have the sweets down but get a zero for savory."
9/4/2016,20160904,5,4.14,"When I absolutely amazing experience! The food was gourmet spectacular! We had the seafood omelette, platter of assorted French toast, and the executive omelette. A-freaking-mazing! You can not go wrong here. Definitely a lot of personality here and the environment is very lively!"
9/6/2016,20160906,2,4.14,"A friend and I went around 10:30 this afternoon. The ambiance was quite stressful. Very loud, thumping techno music. Not the soundtrack I would pick for a brunch spot. We ordered the Lobster Benedict and the French Toast Flight to split. For $18, I was disappointed to see that the Benedict did not come on an English muffin or any kind of bread (our server didn't specify that in her description of the special). I was also bummed to see that the poached eggs were already broken and the hollandaise had started to coagulate over the broken yolks. Being a server, I would never run a dish that looked so sloppy and poorly presented, especially since it was so pricey. Finally, the service was very subpar. Our server was quite frazzled and spilled half our bottle of champagne over myself and the table. When our food came, we had to wait a while to get her attention to ask for an extra plate and ketchup. I also asked her for a side of syrup and she said NO!!! She tried to explain that the butter on the French toast would make it so I didn't need syrup. Whatever her opinion may be, I still wanted syrup and I didn't think that was unreasonable to ask for it. I got uncomfortable after she denied my request so I just shut up and ate the French toast...syrup free. Overall the experience just wasn't very pleasant. I left with a headache from both our chaotic server and the overall atmosphere of this place."
9/6/2016,20160906,4,4.14,"I absolutely adore this place, so glad I found it! French toast is my go-to breakfast food and this place has THE BEST french toast I've ever had! I love their creative spins, twists, and turns on french toast, including their regular french toast options as well as their special limited time options. The French toast here is sooo good and sweet enough, they don't even really need syrup!The atmosphere is really nice and lively. I like the color combinations and the people who eat here tend to be so friendly, you may strike up conversations with strangers. It's always noisy and crowded, which I wish I could escape sometimes, but it seems like the place is like that everyday all day. The waiters are awesome! Always so friendly and energetic. Even the chef will walk around asking guests about their experience. Very nice man. Only complaints is that I wish it were closer to me, or else I'd visit a lot more (expand, maybe?) and if you're a party of one, you will be seated at this long table in the center of the restaurant, literally shoulder-to-shoulder with other guests. SO uncomfortable! I always have to be extra careful not to bump into anything or anyone when I'm eating my food. It would be nice if it was bigger gave solo guests comfortable seating. I understand their reasoning, but it's just uncomfortable."
9/7/2016,20160907,4,4.14,"Over an hour wait on a Friday morning but i thoroughly enjoyed my sweet potato waffle and chicken. Hardly needed any syrup and that nutmeg hot sauce or whatever it's called was delicious! The flight french toast was served kind of cold, but I just took it home and ate it the next day reheated. It was pretty good. I will say I'm not in a rush to return as the search for parking is a beast and I live over an hour away. That plus the wait means you can't come famished or you'd be irritated."
9/7/2016,20160907,5,4.14,"I'm currently sitting at my table right now, that's how much I enjoyed the food. I feel the need to write my review at this moment. I just finished eating the chicken & waffles and OMG. The combination of the sweet potato waffle, maple butter, and hot sauce & chicken is INCREDIBLE. I am beyond pleased with my meal. I also brought my own champagne & ordered flutes and a carafe of orange juice. Such a cute and little establishment!"
9/8/2016,20160908,5,4.14,"Seriously the most delicious breakfast ever and the service is amazing as well. Very friendly staff who know the menu well. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait, but it's well worth it. You won't leave disappointed!"
9/9/2016,20160909,5,4.14,This is an amazing breakfast place! Get the French toast flight!!! Or the deconstructed omelettes. The specials are amazing. Lobster Benedict and jerk scallop omelette. It does have a wait. Staff is wonderful!
9/9/2016,20160909,3,4.14,I used to go here more often but came back recently on a Thursday to find service has declined greatly and the magical french toast was so disappointing. Our food came out in literally 3 minutes as if it was pre-made and they skimped on the wonderful sauce. I don't think I'll go back as it was drive to get there and it was not worth the drive.
9/11/2016,20160911,4,4.14,"I saw this restaurant on a travel show and put it on my todo list for my visit this weekend. The pancakes are AMAZING, 5 stars. I had the steak and eggs with hashbrowns I rate it a 3.5. I asked for medium well it was burnt around the perimeter other than the burnt taste killing my taste vibe it would have been a 4 star. My friend had the veggie omelet, veggies were seasoned well, but they were not incorporated into the omelet they were all on top which we didn't prefer. Customer service was outstanding. Prepare to wait 1.5 hour. It's time for them to get a bigger space they clearly have the demand. Will visit again for the pancakes and to explore more menus items."
9/11/2016,20160911,4,4.14,"The food was good, wasn't what I expected based on the hype though. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the horrible coordination and wait times. They should definitely invest in a more efficient reservation and seating system. Tables were open yet the staff was joking and chatting to much to notice that the tables had been cleaned. BYOB was a plus of the establishment that I will take advantage of it we return. I would definitely try it for yourself if you are all about visiting the hottest spots. Please support black business as much as you can."
9/12/2016,20160912,5,4.14,"ATTENTION TO THE YELP TECH TEAM...PLEASE ALLOW TEN STAR RATINGS JUST FOR THIS PLACE! Y'all.. I'm honestly still on a food high from eating here yesterday. We have heard so much about this place & was so excited to try it especially since I personally LOVE brunch. When we found out it was BYOB, I could've cried. Like, not only are we about to eat good but I can also bring my own champagne for mimosas??? What! So we got there and the line was outrageous. The wait was 55 minutes. Normally I don't wait that long to eat bc my hangry attitude gets the best of me but I calmed my stomach with a banana and we waited....and waited...and waited. Luckily, they have a system where they'll text you when you're almost ready to be seated. So I thought that was considerate. Okay, fast forward. I ordered the French toast flight and at first I was in my feelings bc you couldn't substitute any of them and I didn't think I would like the lemon flavored one. My roommate got the salmon omelette and we agreed to split so we could try each. The food was out in under ten minutes, no lie. I wish I could describe to you guys how mind blown I am after eating here... Everything that touched my fork was designed baby 8lb 6pz Baby Jesus himself. It was THAT good. I lovedddddd the French toast. Especially the strawberry and blueberry one. OMG. The cheesy hash brown thing they have, get that! SoooooooooOOOOOOoooo good.I will definitely be back. DEFINITELY. Our server, Jessica, was amazing. The prices were reasonable. About 11-18 dollars depending on what you get. The carafes for the juice are $12 so make sure you put that aside in your budget if you plan to make your own mimosas."
9/13/2016,20160913,4,4.14,"Ordered: Blueberry French Toast, Jerk Scallop Omelette (limited time special), chicken sausageFOOD: Food was phenomenal. The Flavor of the jerk scallop omelette was full and thoughtfully put together. The cheese used for the omelette perfectly completed the seared scallops. I thought scallops and cheese might be odd together, but that's certainly not so. The hashbrowns are out of this world. They were honestly my favorite part. The chicken sausage is clearly made in-house, as there are delightful bits of apple incorporated throughout the patty. SERVICE: The Food came out fast, and the waitress bought glasses for our champagne.WAIT TIME: The wait time gets pretty ridiculous here. So I would suggest coming earlier or coming on a weekday, if you are looking to avoid the line. Our projected wait time was 90 minutes, and our actual wait time was true to it. It would have been closer to 70 minutes, but there was a technical difficulty. I dropped my parents off to check in while I parked the car down the street, and I suppose the hostess marked our party as incomplete. (They will not seat incomplete parties.) So I walked into the staging area past the hostess, and sat with my parents as several groups of 2 and 3 got seated before us. After about 20 mins, we asked what was going on, and she noted that our party was marked incomplete still. So if you are waiting on people, be sure to notify the hostess so when the entire party is present."
9/13/2016,20160913,4,4.14,"Food is great. I've been here many times and the food has always been great. Always fresh and fast. I feel like th bus boys do all the work while the servers make all the money. Being a server I always keep my eyes open to everything around me. The servers are okay at they're jobs but it's the bus boys who fill up my coffee and water and check to see how we are all doing. The host was very rude when we came in and I asked if my sister and I could sit while we waited bc I wanted to get something in my tummy. I'm 7 months pregnant and needed to get some juice or fruit bc I was hungry and yet I still needed to wait. She didn't even offer a juice in a to go cup or anything. I will say that set my mood to be very annoyed with everything after that. Our server made it all better bc he was very nice and answered all of our question. He got my back in a good mood but next time I go in I won't be so ""sweet"" to the host."
9/13/2016,20160913,5,4.14,First time at batter and berries sept 13 my bday waitress very sweet food delicious will definitely go back
9/13/2016,20160913,4,4.14,Man was there a wait! Service was great! They can text you when you're next which is very much appreciated. It's kind of all about the French toast here so I had the flight. The waitress asked us to try them without syrup which it was good but there's something about telling someone how to eat something that bothers me especially something as simple as French toast but still a nice experience.
9/15/2016,20160915,5,4.14,This place is a true gem in Chicago! Food was hot and quick! And a wait? Absolutely none! The size of the place isn't big. So I can see how there could be a wait on the weekends. But late breakfast time on a weekday was fine. Customer service was exceptional! Not sure what others have experienced. But I was pleasantly surprised! Did I mention how amazing the food was?
9/16/2016,20160916,5,4.14,"I love this place! I always go on a weekday because they aren't as busy. If you go on a weekend, I suggest getting there early or being prepared to wait.I always get the chicken & waffles or french toast flight. I won't order these anywhere else as I'm not a huge fan of the dishes, but this place makes me want to have them every single day for brunch! The food and service is always excellent. Only thing I could say they could do to improve is to build another location, or expand this one somehow because it is a bit cramped. Best breakfast place in Lincoln Park by FAR!"
9/16/2016,20160916,5,4.14,"The food was delicious, the options on the menu were impossible to decide between, and our server was so funny and great. Absolutely loved everything about it.  We'll be back"
9/20/2016,20160920,4,4.14,"The wait was absolutely ridiculous, but the food was AMAZING. They have the best chef specials. I had an egg white omelet with homemade jerk sauce and scallops and it was incredible. The french toast is a must with any meal you get. One of the best brunches I've had."
9/22/2016,20160922,5,4.14,"The food here is very, very, very good, the staff are wonderful, and a rotating menu of specials keep me coming back. Watch out for the long lines, however!"
9/23/2016,20160923,4,4.14,"The staff was amazing! Our waiter was such a delight. the food was delicious! Our waiter had suggested we do not need syrup for our french toast flight, because of their homemade maple butter. He was right. Location would be perfect if there were a parking lot. Some breakfast traditionalists may be disappointed they dont have the typical eggs/pancake/hashbrown dish but they definitely make up for it in creativity and flavor in their menu."
9/24/2016,20160924,5,4.14,"Fantastic breakfast / brunch place. Go on a weekday or go early on weekends but expect some waiting time from 15 mins to maybe even 45 mins as the day progresses. But the wait is definitely worth it. Ask for their specials or just hit the french toast options - you cannot go wrong over there. We had the Flight of the French toast with the day's specials and a veggie omlet.Couldn't tell which was more awesome! We just licked the plates clean.If you are confused what to order, just ask the servers - they are super friendly!P.s. Ignore the coffee; the only meh item on their menu."
9/27/2016,20160927,5,4.15,"5 stars. I'd do 10 if I could. Working at a breakfast restaurant I'm always very skeptical of new places. I am in love with Batter and Berries. Our server Elvira was so amazing I wish she could be my server at every restaurant! She took her time going over the specials and even showed us pictures. We had the biscuits and gravy and the chicken and waffles. Everything couldn't have been better. To top it off we had ""dessert"" of the rosé waffles and they were the best waffles I've ever had. I'm bringing all of my friends here asap!!!"
9/29/2016,20160929,5,4.15,Fantastic brunch spot but expect a wait even during the week. What makes this place really special is the service (and French toast)! Our waiter was the sweetest friendliest person ever. I'll definitel
10/2/2016,20161002,4,4.15,"Really enjoyed the food here! I came with a friend for brunch and we timed it well (arrived early on a Sunday) and were able to get a table quickly. Everything we tried; Chicken and Waffles, flight of French Toast and Eggs Benedict were delicious. The food is definitely made with skill and love!I took a star off because of the atmosphere. It is a very popular spot and the tables are close together (reminded me of dining in NYC) and we felt rushed, not necessarily by the staff, but from the other diners hangrily staring down everyone while waiting for their table. I get, food is outstanding and lines are long so it must be torture to wait but it makes for an uncomfortable dining experience."
10/2/2016,20161002,5,4.15,My boyfriend and I went there Friday for brunch. We got there at 1:47 and there wasn't a wait. I ordered the smoked sausage omelet that came with cheesy potatoes and a half order of pancakes. My boyfriend ordered the French toast flight with the traditional. My meal was absolutely delicious!! The pancakes tasted like lemon cake and the maple butter added to the flavor. We will definitely go back probably during the week and later in the day when we off days again.
10/3/2016,20161003,5,4.15,"OMG, chicken and waffles! That's a must! This place is on the radar, so often there's a line. I would recommend going on an off day or time. Call ahead too, so you don't waste your time waiting. We went on a Monday and got right in. The staff is lively and entertaining. With the way they described the chicken and waffles, that was a must to get. My hubby got that and I got their scallop omelette. Secretly, I wish I just would have gotten what he got. The omelette was delicious, but his meal was out of this world! A waiter came up when we first got them to make sure that my hubby eats them in the proper way with a little bit of everything in the bite and then just stood there waiting for his reaction. And, there was quite a reaction! I would highly recommend going here. They have a full menu of breakfast goodies. The portions are HUGE, so you might want to consider sharing."
10/3/2016,20161003,4,4.15,"Fun selections on the menu. Excellent service. I am not a fan of their deconstructed omelet - I'd rather have my omelet assembled - but all the yummy flavors and textures were in the crab special. The buckwheat pancakes were light, eggy, and fluffy - but the buckwheat flavor was not pronounced. The house hot sauce packs a flavorful punch. Portions are generous. Disappointed they don't offer pure maple syrup or house made whipped cream."
10/4/2016,20161004,4,4.15,"Good: My friends and I went on a Tuesday morning and it was packed! like who would have expected that. But anyway, we were seated fairly quickly and only because half my party was there already. I wish I had pictures to take of my food but I was too hungry and the food was too good to wait. i got the sweet potato waffles with fried chicken and it was delightful! A perfect balance of sweet, spicy and crunchy. I enjoyed it alot and it also cost me $13.50 but worth it for a once in a while experience. 4/5 for food. Bad: The minute we sat down it felt like we were being rushed by our waitress. She came to our table and mumbled the specials while clumsily flipping through the photos on the iPad. Then she basically rushed us into ordering, which we thought was super unnecessary. I also had a friend show up at the last minute and the host refused to give us an extra chair for her. He said that we couldn't add a chair. I noticed another table that was about to leave and it was clearly easier to fit a chair there and he refused to do it. In the end, my friend decided to leave and she left. I felt terrible and this place definitely lost a customer that day. Besides the good food, the service needs a little work. No one wants to walk in a restaurant and feel rushed and like they're being chased out. Service 2/5."
10/4/2016,20161004,5,4.15,"Eat here. Please. Came on a weekday around lunchtime and the wait was minimal. They text you when they're almost ready and then have you sit in the waiting area in the middle of the restaurant while they set up the table. Pretty warm and welcoming place. Also BYOB.We had the French Toast Flight to share (with the special add-on of the day, which was Honey Jack), and I got the Biscuits and Gravy. Worth it. Everything. The gravy was mouthwatering and delicious. My friends got other things, I don't even know because I was lost in my gravy. I'd want to come again to try the chicken and waffles because.. chicken and waffles, but I wouldn't mind another order of the Biscuits and Gravy. Serving sizes are really good and the prices are affordable. I wish I lived in the area, but this would be a great place to have in any neighborhood."
10/5/2016,20161005,4,4.15,"There will undoubtedly be a wait but it is worth it! For a party of two Sunday at 9am, there was a 30 minute wait. Luckily they will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around and explore.The space is pretty bustling and cozy, not a place for intimate conversation but who is interested in that when there is delicious breakfast to consume. The French Toast Flight was amazing and each flavor was different but delicious. The stand out is the Chicken and Waffles. Great combination of sweet, spicy, and savory. They certainly know they they're doing here. A new local favorite that I really look forward to trying out more."
10/7/2016,20161007,4,4.15,Wait time to get in on a Friday at 1030 AM -25 min. Small dinning area. Food wast very tasty and quickNose level very high can't have a conversation in here.
10/8/2016,20161008,4,4.15,"If you're looking for comfort food for breakfast, this is definitely the place. Their menu selection is pretty impressive, and the service is very attentive. The crab omelet was very tasty and I'm crazy about the maple butter than comes with the pancakes. I would have loved for the buckwheat pancakes to be more ""wheaty"", and for the whipped cream to taste less canned, but those were minor issues and I would definitely go back again."
10/9/2016,20161009,1,4.14,"The reviewers that gave this place anything above 2 stars must like their food cold and burnt. They must like paying $40 for unappetizing food that you have to send back, because who wants to eat cold French toast with dollops of syrupy sweet butter that never melts? Breakfast is the easiest thing to make and this place mucks it up.. It's overrated and we don't recommend, and will not return."
10/9/2016,20161009,1,4.14,"Ordered through postmates. Delivered over 45 minutes after original ETA (could track driver's location and she was waiting at the restaurant for 30 minutes for the order to be finished). Once delivered, the burger had no cheese, lettuce, tomato or onion -- plain patty, despite original order including all."
10/10/2016,20161010,3,4.14,"Batter & Berries is just decent to me. The sweet potato waffle was very sweet and (unfortunately) very dry. I did however love the fried chicken and the bits hidden inside the waffle. I went alone so as to not have as long of a wait. They seated me in the middle of the restaurant. Would I run back here first chance I got? Not really. But I can see why suburbia loves a restaurant like this. No tea, no shade."
10/10/2016,20161010,5,4.14,"Waffles and Seafood Specials are best.Service is friendly, informative, and lightning fast.Place is almost always packed.Go here."
10/11/2016,20161011,2,4.14,"My mother wanted to go here after church and it gave me an opportunity to try something new.Negatives: Half an hour wait. Very small place. Very noisy. Portions are too small (look @ the amount of hash browns in the pic below). Food is not hot enough (luke warm).Positives: Tasty hash browns, cole slaw and bacon.Am I going back? Not unless my mother wants to go back. I won't go back on my own."
10/11/2016,20161011,4,4.14,"Just last week, someone was telling me about this place not knowing I was going to soon discover it myself. I went with my soon to be in laws and we enjoyed it tremendously. We went for brunch on a Thursday morning and it was quite busy for a thruday. The wait time wasn't long at all. Will recommend their French toast. Simply amazing. The waitress Jennifer was awesome. I had seen the lobster omelette on yelp and wanted to order it but found out that it was a seasonal dish... That was quite disappointing and cost then a . Otherwise, great spot and will def be returning soon."
10/12/2016,20161012,5,4.14,"While visiting my best friend in Chicago, I was treated to this gem!! It was 11am on a Wednesday so there was no wait. Our server came promptly and told us the specials. He was so attentive to us and made us laugh several times. Now on to the main attraction, the food! My oh my was it amazing! I had the garlic shrimp omelet and I've been craving it every day since I had it. The cheesy home fries were okay, Ib my opinion it's not a must have. What is though, is the French toast super flight!! The additional flavor of the month was jack Daniels and while it was sweet but you definitely got a kick of whisky. My friend had the sausage omelette and also raved on how great it tasted."
10/13/2016,20161013,3,4.14,"Was visiting Chicago for a weekend and found Batter & Berries on Yelp and decided to check it out. My friend had mentioned that normally they have a loooong line, luckily we got there early (930 on a Saturday morning) and originally they had said it would only be 15 min. My 3rd friend wasn't arriving for at least 30-40 min and it makes sense that they wont seat you until your entire party is present, so we waited. The service was good, food was good, I got their French toast which sadly was cold, but had it been warmer it would have been amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of their cheesy hash browns (just didn't seem like something I couldn't make myself at home), but overall it was good and its cozy( pretty small) considering how popular they are. Not a bad brunch!"
10/14/2016,20161014,5,4.14,"Black owned, BYOB, and Bomb food...I'm In! Surprised to see a place like this in Lincoln Park, very unexpected. The menu options are great and the food itself is phenomenal! I've tried the french toast and it was great also they switch it up each week by adding a special french toast which is pretty cool. My favorite is the chicken and waffles and I've had alot of these in my days. Here their chicken and waffle is perfect AND the bonus is there is actual chicken pieces inside the waffle too. Anytime a place is BYOB I am sold because that cuts the bill down. My only downfall is that they do not take reservations in advance and it is always packed therefore prepare to wait outside as there isnt a waiting space inside. Each time I've been has been on Friday mornings while people should be at work(me too probably) but it was still packed. Overall, I recommend this restaurant to everyone! Staff makes you feel at home."
10/18/2016,20161018,5,4.14,"Hands down the best brunch in the city. I've made it my mission to hit the highest rated spots both by users via sources like Yelp, and critics via food blogs etc., and I can honestly say that Batter & Berries stands up to the best of them. The wait is absolutely brutal (2 hours for a party of 5 on Saturday around noon), but it is honestly worth every minute. The service is incredible and so are the prices."
10/21/2016,20161021,5,4.14,"This is literally one of my favorite places to go in ALL of Chicago. There's usually a long wait on weekends, but if you come right at 8 AM on weekends or on a weekday there's almost no wait at all. We always get the super flight of french toast, and usually one of the omelettes or benedicts. They rotate omelette/benedict specials amongst crab, lobster, and garlic shrimp, but whichever one you get, it's always AH-MAY-ZING! The belgiques and cluck and gravy are also delicious. Coffee is pretty decent too.The last time we went, our server, Mr. Jackson (I'm sorry! I Can't remember his first name :P), was very entertaining with riddles! We even had to combine our knowledge with the tables next to us to figure some of them out. So friendly and so fun! Thanks for the great experience!"
10/22/2016,20161022,5,4.14,"I'm from Atlanta but my wife is from Chicago.  She had visited this location before and warned me the next time we came to visit, I must go to Batter and Berries. I must say, the hour wait was well worth it. The food and service was beyond amazing.  Will definitely recommend to everyone visiting Chicago."
10/23/2016,20161023,5,4.14,"Added the final star because the last time I visited alone, I was given my own table. Nice to know that I have the option and that I'm not confined to certain seating areas because I'm dining alone. Thank you!"
10/25/2016,20161025,5,4.14,Amazing food. Great service. Cool vibe and atmosphere. Best french toast I've ever had!!
10/30/2016,20161030,5,4.14,"Just five stars, all should be five stars, service, food, selection, staff, friendliness. Our favorite Chicago breakfast!!!"
10/31/2016,20161031,4,4.14,"After hearing about this place for almost two years, I finally visited today. Amazing amazing AMAZING experience. So, for starters... it's BYOB. So, BYOB, people. Got there this morning (a Monday) around maybe 1pm. Klumps, party of 3, (and we hongry too ). They said 20 minutes for a table and were calling us in 10. I struggle with patience, so they were already off on a good foot. So... Friend 1 ordered the lamb chop trio. Friend two ordered the (ummmm... something. I forgot.)... And I had The Arthur (photo 1). For the table, we ordered a French toast flight (photo 2). MY. NIGGA. This food... Okay. 1. My the Arthur was delicious. I was hesitant to order food that wasn't breakfast, but it was delicious. And their herbs and garlic fries clearly are on heaven's menu. Then, I tasted my friend's lamb chops. They weren't hot, BUT they tasted amazing. He thought they were good but could have been seasoned more. I disagreed. I thought they were good. And the French toast flight? BRUH. The one with the caramel? sauce and nuts - 6/10. The lemon French toast 9/10. The strawberry French toast 8.5/10. The blueberry composte French toast 8/10. The French toast was probably some of the best I've had. Their coffee was awesome also. My ONLY qualm was service. Our particular server was quite dry, never really smiled, and really lacked personality. We did, however, interact with other servers and they were awesome. So, frankly, that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. Service was lacking. Anyway, this is too long already, so... Check out my pictures and check out this awesome breakfast/lunch/brunch spot!!!!!!"
10/31/2016,20161031,5,4.15,most innovative brunch place in lakeview lincoln park area... tried their super french toast flight and u can't go wrong with this one ... most delicious french toast ever .. best to share with a friend ... also their coffee is super awesome
11/1/2016,20161101,4,4.15,"The French Toast flight was very tasty, the special home made butter is a must have and was very good, the slices were thinner with good flavor. But I still have to say the best French Toast in Chicago is Victorys Banner hands down. I also ordered the chicken and waffle, the chicken was cooked perfect! And the waffle had nice crunchy consistency but i wasnt a fan of the sweet potato. Then I ordered chicken sausage, biscuits and gravy... the biscuits and gravy were proof that God exists, wow, LOL. There was plenty of paid parking on Lincoln Ave. I dinged the service for one star, as it was below average. Great place will be back."
11/1/2016,20161101,5,4.15,"Lived in the area near the lake for a couple years and yelped a breakfast spot a little further west down Diversey. Batter and Berries is delightful, not just because of the food, but the wait staff was very attentive and humorous:).  Hope you all have the pleasure of hearing Tusimee's riddles while you eat! Had the chicken and waffles that were great.  We will be back!  I'm sure there's a wait, because on Tuesday morning it was full."
11/2/2016,20161102,5,4.15,"Always a favorite. I would want a bigger location but I get it. Food awesome, great choices for all types of eaters. I am not sure about lunch bc I can never seem to get past the brunch menu! French toast flight is one of my favs Please never take that away!. I love the specialty omelets as well that they offer them with seafood. (I don't eat meat).If there is a long wait (which is almost always) it is worth it. You may be mad at first but the food and the service will send all those negative emotions around!BYOB"
11/2/2016,20161102,5,4.15,"This place was phenomenal. I had ordered the Strawberry French Toast and my boo ordered the Broccoli Cheddar Omelet with the specialty hash browns and a side of bacon.. and my gosh! We both picked at each others plates and every bite was heavenly (I am not exaggerating). The Strawberry French Toast was the perfect amount of sweetness that I didn't need syrup which is a plus for me. Will definitely be back to explore the menu. Wish I took photos but was too quick to eat, dang it!"
11/2/2016,20161102,4,4.15,"Discovered this place on Instagram. Was in town working with an artist and decided to stop in and check them out. Good food. Nice atmosphere... and the fine brother up front greeting people as they walk in, nice touch. . Will def make my way back the next time I'm in town."
11/4/2016,20161104,4,4.15,"This was our last meal in Chicago, and it was a good choice. The place is small so expect a wait.30-minutes later, we were seated. The menu had a good size selection, such as pancakes, and eggs. What sets them apart is the different flavors of pancakes. Now as I say that, I will admit that we did not have pancakes. I was craving for waffles. So I choose the 'Cluck-N-Gaufre (goof) which was Chicken stuffed sweet potato waffle topped with fried chicken and drizzled with nutmeg hot sauce and b&b maple butter. The description said 'stuffed' but I only had one piece of chicken in the waffle. The rest was just waffle, but I was good with that. The dressing tasted like buffalo wing sauce with a sweetness. My husband had the executive and it looked great, ask for the sauce on the side as they lather that thing pretty good. My husband at it all. Overall our experience was great, employees were nice and attentive. The place is noisy so don't expect to have a quiet breakfast."
11/4/2016,20161104,2,4.15,"i don't understand the hype. menu was ""inventive"" but results didn't work out. shrimp omelet was a good idea, but cheddar cheese and swimming in a salty garlic sauce was not. same with sausage omelet...cheesy hash browns ok, but you can get those at any roadside Cracker Barrel.sweet potato waffle was doughy and cake like, not to mention served somewhat cold. waffles are supposed to be fluffy and crisp on the outside. this one was basically carrot cake with a cold chicken breast drenched in hot sauce. i wanted to like this place and actually eat something, so ordered the blueberry french toast. very very sweet goopy sauce. pure sugar. the actual french toast was ok, but nothing to get excited about. also cold by the time it was served. all in all this bad experiment cost over $70 with tax and tip. owner was very nice but his food was not good.i traveled from nyc and then all the way from Near South to try this place. made me wish i stuck to my fave, Yolk. keep your money."
11/7/2016,20161107,2,4.14,"Well this is my second visit here and like the first nothing spectacular! This place is highly overrated. I had the Buttermilk pancakes they were extremely gummy and not fluffy at all. The Sweet Potatoe Waffle and chicken another disaster. Waffle had no flavor, chicken was perfect. The waiter was very friendly, the buser was an ASSHOLE! I hate for them to asking am I done, if you need the plate just say we're short on dishes, but if I still eating holding the fork in my hand stop asking that, and this happened 3x is 20mins. That's probably my last time coming here for this food. My rating is based on both food and service!! 2.5"
11/7/2016,20161107,5,4.14,This is a great local find. Nice ambience excellent service wonderful food if your in Chicago and want to get away from the downtown this place is a perfect choice
11/10/2016,20161110,4,4.14,"Let me start off by saying the food was amazing.... there was a bit of a mix-up where we were seated right away but other patrons came in after us and their orders were taken before my party and myself. The issue was quickly recognized and we were apologized to by Frederick which is the manager and given a free order of their ""Flight"" which is different kinds of french toast. Our waitress Nadine was so sweet and attentive. Overall this was a great experience and the food was worth the mix up. I will be returning. I believe in second chances everyone is entitled to a mistake."
11/14/2016,20161114,4,4.14,"Attended this establishment at about brunchtime. It was a bit crowded but the waiter found my friend and me a seat straightaway. I received my coffee immediately (must have had that need coffee look on my face). My friend ordered the caramel/candied walnut french toast with hash browns and thick cut bacon. I ordered the smothered pork chop with gravy and onion that came with scrambled eggs (any style offered) and hash browns topped with cheese. Both dishes were yummy and delicious as I tasted some of her french toast. I wondered if the caramel was homemade as it tasted like it was. My pork chop was so huge that I had to take half of it home where it could get my special tasting treatment. Couldn't wait to warm it up and give it a go! Yaaasss, still tasted the same only much better because I was home. I'm sure that we'll be back. Maybe, I'll even order the french toast... but those chops though... scrumptious!"
11/15/2016,20161115,4,4.14,"I love this place! I've gone a couple times with family or friends. The food is always amazing. There are always new specials. I have to go more frequently just to try the things on the regular menu, everything sounds great! The wait staff is always friendly. The wait to be seated is always long but honestly, I expect it now and just plan to do something in the area for an hour after leaving my name at the front. Also, it's black-owned and I'm proud to give them my business ."
11/16/2016,20161116,5,4.14,"This place is always packed, and it's easy to see why! They have such a wide array of unique and tasty-sounding food items-- it's almost overwhelming! They have yet to disappoint me and seem to be constantly offering up new items to their menu. The staff are friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful. If i had a friend coming into town, I would definitely suggest this place for brunch. I will say that it's probably not ideal for large groups because it is usually so busy. I will also point out that it is BYOB, but they do ask that you buy a drink as a sort of corkage fee, something my friend and I didn't realize one visit, which our waiter graciously excused.Definitely a breakfast and brunch spot that is a cut above the rest!"
11/17/2016,20161117,2,4.14,It's ahight... nothing to write home about. I could've stayed at home and cooked. Friendly service tho.
11/19/2016,20161119,5,4.14,"I don't know that I'll provide any new insight, rather a reinforcement of all the other reviews. Batter and Berries is hands down the best breakfast place in Lincoln Park and somewhere I beg my sister to take me every time I'm in town. Each time I'm there I want to try something new, but I just can't convince myself to get anything other than the Chicken & Goof. The light, cornbready waffle with its bits of chicken inside is the perfect pair to the chicken, homemade hot sauce and light dusting of powdered sugar. If I could eat this every morning for breakfast I would a) die a happy woman, and b) gain 90 lbs, most likely not in that order."
11/20/2016,20161120,5,4.14,"I waited over an hour to have brunch here with my friend. And I gotta say, it was worth every. Single. Minute. First off, the waiting concept, to me, is weird. I got a text our table was almost ready. When I checked in, rather than seating me, I was directed to a ""waiting area"" in the middle of the restaurant..I didn't mind, but it was already busy with other people and I definitely felt in the way. I think it makes more sense to put in more tables, but that's just me. When we were seated, our service was great throughout. Waitress was easy to talk to, joking with us when her iPad (which they use to take orders) was being slow. Very attentive and great overall. The food. Oh my god. This might be my new favorite spot. Seriously. And I really like brunch and I'm really a hard sell but ITS. THAT. GOOD. I ordered the Cluck n Gaufe (chicken and waffles basically), and it was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I'm usually adverse to hot sauce, but the sauce they use combined with their syrup wasn't anything unbearable and gave the chicken amazing flavor. The waffle had almost a taste of cinnamon that went perfectly with the butter and hot sauce. I honestly can't say enough good things about my meal. It was absolutely divine. We also split the French toast flight: all of them, again, amazing. But their sweet butter is what really makes each bite so savory. My favorites were: strawberry, blueberry, caramel, and pecan pieces. My friend also ordered the biscuits and gravy, and the gravy actually had a sweetness to it that was unique, but really great. He also subbed cheesy hashbrowns for slaw and they were melty with cheese and crispy and absolutely perfect. My new favorite brunch spot. Not much more I can say. It's amazing."
11/20/2016,20161120,5,4.15,"Come here on a weekend, be prepared to wait (possibly outside). But it is worth it. I ordered the special- pineapple upside down french toast and it was delicious. I wish they'd make it a permanent menu item. Staff is very friendly. I'll definitely be back."
11/24/2016,20161124,4,4.15,"We decided to visit this spot since it had such a great reputation and so many Yelp photos I couldn't even get through them all. It is a very popular place and we had an hour wait, wall to wall people. But I was not disappointed. The guy that showed us to our table looked and acted like he could care less, but our waitress was very nice. Everyone loved the hot chocolate and they have quality orange juice, not watered down. Not everyone in my party of 6 was thrilled with their orders (pancakes and apple waffles) but I was very pleased with mine, Super Flight of French Toast. It was a sample of different flavored French toast. Each more delicious than the next. They didn't even need syrup. I added bacon, scrambled eggs and cheese hash browns (The Traditional). The hash browns were so cheesy you could hardly separate them. Prices range from $8-$14 per meal. I can hardly wait to return and try one of the deconstructed omelets."
11/26/2016,20161126,4,4.14,"Love this place, but it needs a little fine tuning. 3.5 stars but 4 because they are mostly pleasant. I came here super excited after a visit last summer. My kids and a friend joined me. We had the lobster spinach omelet, which is egg whites with Gouda, spinach and HUGE pieces of lobster and hash browns. The hash browns were not good at all. The omelet was pretty tasty and the lobster pieces were HUGE. I thought that could have been cooked a different way, but I still enjoyed that portion of my meal. We also shared cinnamon French toast. It came with a flavored butter that was simply delicious. The crab cakes we ordered, as a side, were not very flavorful and had to be covered in hot sauce, like the hash browns, in order to be palatable. Boooooo!Our waitress was a little scatter brained, but good natured. I'm still waiting for my tea. My friend is still waiting for her water, but otherwise it's been a pleasant ay to start the day. Beware, they only seat full parties so be prepared to wait if you are not all together. Enjoy!"
11/27/2016,20161127,1,4.14,"We won't be back. Rude manager, bad table, a complete lack of customer service. Much better breakfast places in the area - no need to deal with rude staff and mediocre food. Really disappointing experience. 1 - My husband walked ahead while we parked. We parked directly in front of the restaurant and he pointed to us getting out of the car and checking the parking machine, but the hostess would not seat us unit all 5 of us were standing on the door mat in front of her. Ridiculous.2 - We had five people. The restaurant had no table for parties larger than 4 - so anyone with  5 or 6 has to squeeze into a 4-top. When we asked for a larger table they said, this is it. We were seated at the table in the back corner next to the kitchen and it was loud and cramped. When my dad moved his chair around to the end to have enough room, the waitress told us he could not sit there. He's 77 and had bad knees, so it was not good to have him squeezed into the table of 5 behind us, which we explained. The waitress went away and got the manager or owner, who very rudely told my dad he could not sit on the end as the staff had to get around him (there was at least 5 feet of space behind him, so we were amazed the manager even asked a customer at a bad table to squeeze in further!). My husband had even pushed his chair all the way to the wall to move the table in closer, which we explained. The manager was really rude - definitely lacking in any form of customer service.3 - Our food was unremarkable. Lemon french toast was really the only stand-out of 5 entrees. Pancakes were very average and we had to ask for syrup. Banana waffles had a very off taste to the bananas and came with no vanilla syrup, which was listed on the menu description (the waitress said they ran out, but was not at all pleasant and seemed put off that we even asked about it). Blueberry waffles were nothing remarkable and expensive for one waffle."
11/27/2016,20161127,2,4.14,We were very excited to try this restaurant after reading the reviews but we were not overly impressed with the food. I had the French toast flight and found the French toast was bland and the toppings were boring. My daughter had the special crab cakes Benedict and her food was not hot and the cakes were rather fishy. The service was very fast and our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.
11/29/2016,20161129,5,4.14,"Good fricken lord. This place. I went here on my last day before heading to MPLS and boy was it an experience. We got there at 10 and put our names in. After grabbing coffee at a nearby stop our 45 minute wait was only 20 and we were seated right away. None of us had been there before so we got the french toast platter to share and then the salmon Benedict and lobster omelet (both their specials of the day). Every single one of the french toasts were delicious but my favorite by far was the maple pecan french toast. With maple butter and toasted pecans it also had lemon zest and a light dusting of powdered sugar. It was soooo sooooo good. OMG. No maple syrup needed.The best french toast ever. I'm going to dream about this french toast until I go back.The Eggs Benedict I ordered was also delicious but lacking a bit on salt and pepper. Maybe they purposefully don't put a lot on but after the explosion of toasty goodness I expected more. They also have cheesy hash browns which were yummy, but again I had to add salt and pepper to them to bring out more flavor.Service was great. I was impressed by how fast they turn tables over and there are a lot of coffee shops nearby if you want something to nibble on while you wait. The waiter was super energetic and had hilarious riddles for us before we left. This is also one of the few if not only black owned business in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Go support them and eat french toast. Let me live through you and your taste buds."
12/1/2016,20161201,4,4.14,"I finally made it here!!! After 4 failed attempts, I finally suffered through the wait and had my first Batter & Berries experience. It definitely lived up to the hype!The food was fantastic! Customer service was exemplary! The owner was kind, hospitable, and thanked me by my name as I exited the restaurant. If you're a newbie, be sure to ask what the weekly specials are. When I went, they had a delicious pork chop entree as their special of the week. When my food was brought out, the table next to me asked what I was eating and said they didn't see it on me the menu. When I told them it was a specialty dish, they were a little upset that they didn't know about the specials. They still enjoyed their meal though. The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the wait time. Hopefully they'll expand sometime soon. Can't wait to visit again!"
12/4/2016,20161204,5,4.14,"Fantastic for breakfast - been curious since it always looks jam packed and there's people constantly on the street waiting to get inTotally worth it - Freddie and team absolutely crush it - French toast flight, chefs special was country fried chicken and eggs - all great stuffWill definitely go back. Thanks Freddie! It's apparently BYOB too - mix up your own bloody's"
12/5/2016,20161205,5,4.14,"I came here upon the invitation from a group of friends and knowing my love for breakfast, I had to see what the hype was about and they did not disappoint. I love how this place is family owned and makes your experience so personal when you're there. I ordered the pork special and the eggs were some of the best that I've ever had. We had to wait about 30mins to get seated but it was surely worth the wait. The flights are great things to have at the table especially when eating with a group of people! I will definitely grab a meal here next time I'm in Chicago."
12/10/2016,20161210,5,4.14,"Ladies and Gentleman this here has to be Chicago's best breakfast/brunch spot. The food is amazing and well worth the ridiculous 1hr average wait you should expect on weekends. The french toast flight is out of this world and any other special they might be having is guaranteed to make your weekend go soooo much better. Like everyone has said Great Food, Great service and just an all round 5 star experience from Batter and Berries. Service here is really good and you can tell that everyone that work here enjoys their job. Because of the wait time just plan to have other things to do after you make your in person reservation. My only complain is if someone wants to order for pick up you should be able to place your order through the phone that come out and wait an additional 15-20 minutes."
12/14/2016,20161214,5,4.14,"I feel bad for not taking pictures. Presentation of the French toast flight was beautiful. I was hungry so I did not delay! I went off menu to complete my meal with a single scrambled egg, and bacon. That was 4 strips of meat, moreso overdone for my liking but I didn't ask for anything special up front so I'll eat that one. The hearty bacon paired well with the sweet toast. The scrambled egg was literally an egg, stirred and cooked (no milk added for the light and fluffy effect) but as I said this was my off-menu request so I picked around the lesser cooked parts of the yolk. No shade to the business.Let me back up a bit and say the friendly gentleman host boasted a huge smile as our party of 2 entered at ~2:15p on a frigid Tuesday. Our waitress was absolutely inaudible when going over the menu. She did have an iPad so as she scrolled through blocks of text she would settle on pictures of dishes they offer. This actually lasted a long while considering we couldn't hear a single word, at all. When placing our order we didn't have any issues with her understanding us and she spoke up when repeating our orders back to us or asking questions, so I'd guess she was just not loving having to repeat that (memorized) opening statement.My partner got the chicken and waffles. He in general is not a fan of 'the sauce' at many places so he tried the waitress's suggestion to have the chicken, waffle, syrup, and hot sauce all in one bite but ultimately left the sauce on the side. I thought the fact there were chicken pieces inside the waffle, along with the accompanying perfectly golden brown chicken breast was impressive. I'll have to order that next time.The best part in my opinion about this spot is the fact my friend told me it is BLACK OWNED. That's literally why I went (plus craving breakfast/brunch). BO businesses absolutely do not get enough recognition on Yelp (or other review forums) and mostly all are popular by word of mouth until the food network puts them on. I don't know the background on Batter & Berries in that regard but I absolutely don't regret this visit and I would definitely go again."
12/14/2016,20161214,4,4.14,"I had two visits here and had very mixed experiences. Both times the food was really good and the French Toast Flight is not to be missed. Each piece stood on it's own and did not need the assistance of additional sweetness.  They mix cheese into the hash browns which is a welcome addition, however on my first visit the potatoes were slightly under-cooked.Also on my first visit which was on a weekday, they seated me near the door on a cold winter day in an empty restaurant even though I requested to be seated near the back. Otherwise, it was a good experience and I would return."
12/16/2016,20161216,4,4.14,Best place or breakfastVery tasty waffles and pancakesFriendly staff
12/18/2016,20161218,5,4.14,I absolutely loved this restaurant! The service was fantastic and quick and the food was AH-mazing! We went on a Sunday morning and expected the line to be outrageous but we were seated immediately. So sad I'm from the area to be back again!
12/19/2016,20161219,5,4.15,Had an hour wait for a table but they take your number and text when you should head back. Ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffle which was insane. The hot sauce on the chicken was so damn good and the entire dish doesn't need syrup at all. It's BYOB and there is a 7/11 right down the street that you can walk to in 2 minutes. We grabbed champagne for our own mimosas. The cheese crusted hash browns were all right a little too bland but everything else made up for it. A friend ordered the super flight of French toast and loved it. He had house made pork sausage that was very tasty. And that's all I have to say about that. Jackée
12/19/2016,20161219,3,4.14,"Here's what I'm going to say about Batter & Berries- it was A-OK and I will probably try to return to see if my experience was typical. Here's the low-down, this place is straight up famous for its french toast. Tons of reputable yelpers have more or less suggested that Batter & Berries will be more important to you than your current SO. I think I had a fluke experience and I should have communicated with my waitress better, rather than trying to avoid being rude.My Cluck-n-Gaufre(chicken & waffles), which I have heard from multiple people is life-changing, was crazy dry and partly burnt. Part of me wondered if I just didn't know what to expect with sweet potato waffles. Were they supposed to taste like that? I have no idea. It's hard when you order something you're unfamiliar with and then try to compare it to an anticipated taste or texture. If you look at the picture that I posted, it's pretty clear that my waffle was a good bit darker than the other waffles pictured, especially on the edges. I didn't know if that was normal/not normal/etc. at the time and, ultimately, I was worried about being rude and annoying so I didn't say anything to our insanely nice waitress about the issue. Other than the food, the venue was so great. I loved that we could bring our own bottle of champagne and I enjoyed the bites of food I had from my companions. We came in at 10 AM on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately, which I'm also a huge fan of because I was prepared to compete in the Hunger Games for food/mimosas. Luckily, this spot is only a couple blocks away from me so I hope to come back and try the French Toast flight that everyone is going insane over. I'll be sure to update this if I do because I think my meal last weekend was just kind of a fluke (have I said that word enough?). Sh* happens."
12/21/2016,20161221,5,4.14,"Finally had a week day off to go back to Batter & Berries! Yes!!The waits are crazy here over the weekend so I highly recommend coming during the week sometime if you can. My gf and I got a table in about 15 minutes. Our waitress showed me a picture of their current french toast special, which was Godiva, and I was SOLD. Girlfriend got the strawberry french toast and we split some cheesy hash browns.Everything was amazing. B&B's french toast is really light, so you won't feel stuffed after eating it. Or at least I didn't. I have been described as a garbage disposal though... Prices are also quite reasonable.If you're serious about your Chicago brunching, you have to make a stop at Batter and Berries!"
12/21/2016,20161221,2,4.14,"For a place with just shy of 1.5k reviews on yelp and 4 solid stars, my experience did NOT live up to the expectations, unfortunately. Went here with a friend after she got out of work, so about 9am-ish. We got seated pretty quickly, since it wasn't as busy yet. Then, we were greeted by this waitress...with the most emotionless affect and flat voice. Whatever came out of her mouth was so monotone, we couldn't even get excited about the special dishes as she was describing them because 1/ she needed to speak up 2/ am I listening to a robot?. She showed us some pics, and they all looked amazing. So, I went with the porkchop & eggs, my friend chose the lobster cake benedict. I asked my waitress to not have cheese in my hashbrown, and of course she forgot to tell the kitchen...when I signaled her to our table, she gave me the most uninterested apology before rushing away like she's got somewhere to be! Food-wise, it wasn't as flavorful as I would like. The portion is huge, though, which is a big bonus, especially when the dishes range from $16-18. When we got ready to pay, the waitress stopped by and started swiping our cards on her iPad. She, then, mumbled something (like she always does), and left our table, my friend and I were so confused..as we couldn't hear what she was saying and thought our cards didn't go through but we never seemed to be able to get her attention. Turned out she just went back to get the printed receipts. It was all an awkward situation, and I guess all I'm saying is we would really appreciate a more inviting and warm service from our waitress, who didn't smile even once...and oddly enough, her name is Yessica (her face says No! though). I would only come back to try the French Toast! Otherwise, gonna look for other brunch options."
12/21/2016,20161221,4,4.14,"More like 4.5 but this is one of my fav spots for French toast! It is simply amazing. Try the strawberry one, it will not let u down. The skillets are also pretty good."
12/22/2016,20161222,3,4.14,"I understand not seating us right away since 2 individuals weren't there when I entered the place, but after they sat us and served us drinks the service went bad... I believe it's the host/hostess job to recognize that for a good 15 mins we haven't ordered;either that or waitresses usually have assigned table sections...Our waitress was nice and got our orders after we got the attention of another waitress. Food came pretty quick after we ordered so I feel it may be just reheated. We enjoyed The executive, and Deconstructed steak omelet(the steak is abit tough though for medium)! Peppermint schnapps french toast was interesting! I didn't like the Jerk salmon omelet for it lacked flavor... Avoid the Banana-nut belgique waffle and I'm not a fan of the Deconstructed spinach omelet. Super flight is good but the portion is not worth the price even if it allows you to try the french toast special of the day."
12/26/2016,20161226,5,4.14,"Arrived early on a snowy day, so the wait was about 15mins, which was great. Our waitress came by and reviewed the specials for the day--she showed us what the meals looked like on her iPad, which we appreciated. It was effective to see what she was actually discussing with us. The food we ordered came within 10-15minutes. I ordered the French Toast Super Flight. Staff was very friendly and service and food were great.I'd definitely come again to try some of the other items on the menu."
12/26/2016,20161226,4,4.14,"This place is gooooood. Clearly, popular considering the 2 hour wait today. Once seated, the service was *excellent*. This place is packed. But at no point did we feel rushed to order, eat and scurry like a lot of places. Our waitress and the busboys ect were on point too ( Shout out to Elvira! ). Considering the pace of this place, at No point did we feel ignored.  I had the porkchop special: grilled porkchop smothered in onions and gravy, their B & B hashbrowns and 2 eggs over medium. We brought our own prosecco and had mimosas. ( fyi it's BYOB ). I'll be back again for sure."
12/28/2016,20161228,3,4.14,"To me, Batter and Berries is overrated. My wife and I came first thing early in the morning to avoid any lines, and we were seated right away. So...let's start with the positives: the service was good and the coffee was strong and my cup constantly topped off. The place has a cozy neighborhood vibe to it but the decor could use a bit of love. Unfortunately, for me, the food that I ordered wasn't that great. Admittedly, I didn't order any french toast which is what they are known for.I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my chicken was cold and tasted like it was reheated, because it was tough and dry. It should have been moist and juicy inside with a nice crunchy exterior, but alas, it tasted like it was reheated from the night before. The sweet potato waffles that accompanied the chicken were interesting. They had the same dry pieces of chicken inside and had a slightly strange texture to it. I'm not sure what word to use, but it tasted almost gritty. The butter that came on top of the waffle, on the other world, was absolutely delicious. No syrup was provided to go alongside the waffles though.We also ordered their jerk salmon special and the buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes had also cooled a bit, and had a kind of rubbery texture to it, so it gets a B for me. The jerk salmon was okay, but tasted a bit under-seasoned. And I didn't really get what made it a jerk special. All in all, I'm glad that I went, but it didn't seem quite worthy of the hype."
12/28/2016,20161228,5,4.14,As good as advertised! French Toast Super Flight was amazing. Side dishes (chik sausage & cheesy hashbrowns) were amazing too. Glad to have experienced this breakfast establishment.
12/30/2016,20161230,4,4.14,"I've been dying to get into this place but the wait times are just ridiculous. Once I was told that it would be a 2 and a half hour wait... so I went somewhere else. I finally went this week, and only had to wait an hour ! Even on a Monday morning. But with that being said, the food came out in like 10 minutes!! I was shocked, but I mean it might as well with the astronomical wait times right? We had a great waiter and the food was delishhhhhhhhh, it was absolutely soooo good. I got the French toast flight and a side of scrambled eggs. No problems there. Definitely recommend but be aware that you'll be waiting !"
12/30/2016,20161230,4,4.14,"Worth the wait! The lemon french toast is so good. Food could have been warmer but it was still good. Once we sat down, we were in and out in less than 45 minutes."
12/31/2016,20161231,4,4.14,"Heard great things about this place and my cousin wanted to go here for breakfast; needless to say, I was excited to come her However I wasn't looking forward to having to get here so early since the place is small and gets packed quick. I'm eating healthier so I ordered 2 egg whites scrambled with provolone cheese, bacon, and a plain waffle. Everything is homemade so the specials change often. They don't have any turkey products, which was a bummer, so pork bacon is the only option. I recommend asking for your scramble eggs well done because they traditionally make them running. It's also BYOB. Everyone is carded at the table regardless if you are drinking or not. Our waiter was hospitable. Definitely would come back again."
12/31/2016,20161231,5,4.14,"Amazing brunch, fresh specials and efficient service times."
1/2/2017,20170102,2,4.14,The food was okay. The owner however leaves a lot to be desired. He was rude and not helpful. Paid 22 dollars for breakfast and a rude experience. This after waiting for 2 hours.
1/3/2017,20170103,1,4.14,"The food is great the wait time is ridiculous. The place is very small, and it's always crowded. I waited for 45 minutes, received a text, only to wait an additional 30 minutes. Absolutely terrible."
1/4/2017,20170104,5,4.14,"The most amazing french toast I had ever had. I am usually a pancake person and do not order french toast. But that was what our waitress said was the best. So i got the super flight and my husband got chicken dish with biscuit which I have completely forgotten as the french toast was simply awesome and that's what we both wanted to eat.The wait was 1 and half hour, we had tried having brunch twice before everytime the wait was for more than 2 hr so we just left, this time we came prepared to wait. The service was good and she kept checking on us. Will definitely go again."
1/5/2017,20170105,2,4.14,"I was super super excited to try this place because of all the great reviews that it has! I had also gotten my wisdom teeth removed a week before so this was my first real meal in a week and I was ready for it to be delicious and wonderful.We got in and of course there was a wait. We were quoted half an hour but it took closer to one hour - boo. But oh well.I ordered the strawberry french toast because I love strawberries and they're supposed to be famous for their french toast. It disappointed. Like seriously disappointed. It was dry but mushy? Which honestly sounds weird and impossible but there it was. My boyfriend ordered the scrambled eggs and cheesy hash browns and he said they were very meh. Just average, nothing special.This place definitely does not warrant a repeat visit!"
1/5/2017,20170105,1,4.14,I assume they're only known for waffles and french toast. The wait time was too long. There are better breakfast spots in the city with less wait time.
1/5/2017,20170105,5,4.14,"One of the best restaurants in the city. There may be a wait but it is well worth it. The overall service is fantastic. Staff is friendly, food arrives at the table very quick and the food never disappoints."
1/6/2017,20170106,5,4.14,"They do great things with seafood for breakfast. I have had omelettes with salmon, crawfish, shrimp, crab and more. Good menu but every time I go I order from the specials board. You will wait if you go on the weekend."
1/6/2017,20170106,5,4.14,"What a great and FAST breakfast we couldn't even take a sip of our drinks before our food came! Our waiter, tusiime, was beyond PHENOMENAL very fun and energetic! Be sure to as for him!"
1/6/2017,20170106,5,4.14,"First time eating here and the chicken with hot sauce and sweet potatoes waffles was off the chain, great service and we wasn't waiting long for our food, reasonable prices. I highly recommend to my friends."
1/7/2017,20170107,3,4.14,"They have a really nice french toast flight that they are known for. They also have a nice selection of seafood breakfast options. However, I had higher expectations and was a little let down with the food. Plan ahead when attempting to eat here on a weekend for brunch. They don't take reservations and there is ALWAYS a wait. I usually wait about an hour on average and its small so there isn't a place to wait inside. The food is good but sometimes the waiters almost make you feel rushed which I assume is because its so busy."
1/15/2017,20170115,5,4.14,Great BYOB spot with very very delicious breakfast. I usually ditch the place because of the wait but if you have the time wait it out. I ordered the salmon jerk omelet and it was beyond fulfilling. Everything tied well together with spinach and mushrooms. I added a side of pancakes and they were so tasty. GO here if you want great breakfast with a good spin.
1/16/2017,20170116,5,4.14,"Came here on a Monday at 9AM and didn't have to wait at all. The food is seriously so good, I would have waited. The staff are all very well rehearsed and know their stuff well. It does get very loud in here and you will have to speak up and listen attentively to your table mates.We ordered the house special Jerk Salmon Omelette, Chicken Fajita Omelette, and a half order of the Lemon French Toast. The Jerk Salmon was $19.50 (not listed on the black board) This is a very expensive dish, but I think it was worth every penny! The portion is huge and the quality is very good! There was a generous amount of salmon, spinach, tomatoes, mushroom, and everything just worked so well together! The Omelette seemed to have more egg whites so I guess it's a little more healthy too! I highly recommend this dish!The Chicken Fajita Omelette was just as flavorful and the chicken pieces were tender and abundant! The red and green peppers were flavorful and not overly cooked. The hash browns were cheesy and crunchy on some parts, which was amazing! The Lemon French Toast was just absolutely perfect and opened up our sweet appetites even more! We could have eaten an entire order along with our other entrees, that's how good it was. The Maple Butter is house made and just amazing, no syrup was even needed! There was just so much sweet lemon flavor and it was not overly sweetened either!We will definitely be back!"
1/16/2017,20170116,4,4.14,"I came here with my family while I was visiting Chicago on a Sunday. They had a full house and we had a short wait. The service was friendly and the wait for the food wasn't long. We ordered a few different things. I tried the chicken and waffles. I wasn't a fan, but I did enjoy the dishes my family members ordered. The French toast was particularly good. Definitely recommend if you're in the city."
1/17/2017,20170117,5,4.14,"YUM YUM YUM!! Looking for a brunch spot? This is the place to go to. Get the Chicken & Goof, you're welcome.Funny thing is that I didn't even get the Chicken & Waffles, I got the pork chop, which was very tender and tasty, but once I tried the waffle, all bets were off. It's a sweet potato waffle and the chicken is cooked into the waffle! I know, mind blowing right? lol We also shared french toasts, if you have a sweet tooth, I suggest them.This place is BYOB! Perfect for a hot summer day. Just make sure you get all the mimosa flavors.We made sure we got there right after they opened and about an hour and a half, we were in. Any one know when it's NOT crowded? The place is small and in the summer, the AC doesn't seem to keep up, but their food makes up for it. I'll be back for sure!"
1/20/2017,20170120,5,4.14,"Everything was amazing. I would have a picture, but I couldn't wait to eat. The French toast flight was remarkable. The homemade sausage was so so good."
1/21/2017,20170121,5,4.14,"If you can stand to wait about an hour to be seated during brunch hours then Batters And Berries is the place to go! It's byob, the food is seasoned to perfection & the customer service is great. You may also run into a celeb or 2 in this spot. Only complaint is the 50 plates they give you lol & the fact this place is so small!"
1/24/2017,20170124,5,4.14,"This spot is a must go for a BYOB breakfast/brunch. The food is delicious, the staff are delightful and the experience is dynamite. Came here on a Saturday morning with an empty stomach and was not in the slightest disappointed. The wait for two was about 40 mins but this was no big deal considering you can stock up on booze right down the street at 7/11. I've got a big sweet tooth so deciding between the deliciously enticing French toast, waffles or pancakes was no easy task. However, the waiter (full of energy I might add) soon convinced me to get the French toast super flight (a slice of blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel and the French toast flavor of the week)!! The food came out within 10 minutes and the platters looked awesome. The challenge was to finish all 5 pieces of French toast. Psh no problem, they were so tasty. Challenge accepted. Will definitely be back! What a bonhomie of good cheer!"
1/25/2017,20170125,3,4.14,"Everything was good except the host! He was so rude! And as he was our initial impression, it set everything else up for failure. We had the lobster Benedict and pecan French toast, they were good, but not spectacular. Our waiter was very kind and I formative, but that host! Ouch"
1/26/2017,20170126,5,4.14,Havent had a breakfast Wow me in years. It was great!! Must try the French Toast Super Flight and the cheesy hash browns!
1/28/2017,20170128,5,4.14,"I absolutely love coming here. I love the cheese hash browns along with the deconstructed omelettes. The super flight is not a bad option either. It's always some special features, so it's not like you have to order from the same old boring menu (their menu is far from boring). The place is tight but definitely worth coming to. Small place, big flavors."
1/29/2017,20170129,1,4.14,"Walked in with my wife, infant child in tow.Was asked if we were on the list. Wait, what? But you don't take reservations and this isn't a nightclub. I assume they meant a reservation. Ha. You have loud music, and yet this isn't a place to chill. It's a place - one would assume, to come eat. ""Batter & Berries"", not ""Berries & Beats.""""It will be an HOUR & FORTY-FIVE MINUTES to be seated. Names please."" Ummm....NO. You close in an hour. How does that work?Seriously, it's great to be busy, so kudos to ownership however, you need a new hostess, and somewhere to sit, or something for patrons to do if you plan to have them wait that long in a vestibule door when it's snowing outside, with a little one!Class-less.You're serving breakfast, not saving the world.Also, your branding is off the wall tacky.Rant over."
1/29/2017,20170129,1,4.14,"After reading so many amazing reviews about the food, my husband, eight month old daughter, and I came to check it out.We called ahead of time and the voice recording specified that they did not take reservations.As we pulled up to the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised to see a few parking spots right in front and a few open tables; with what seemed to be no one else waiting to be seated (unless they have a hidden back area).As soon as we walk into the semi-full restaurant, we were immediately asked if we were on ""the list."" The list? What is this...a night club? Regardless, we say ""no"" and mention it is two adults & an infant. Again, there were several tables open, and no one else waiting. The hostess informs us that there is an hour and forty five minute wait!It feels like they're boasting an artificial demand.It's a breakfast place, and there are empty tables. It was 1:45pm, and they close at 3:00pm so what she was saying is they'd sit us 3:30pm? Makes no sense. She seemed annoyed that we said to forget it. What parent with an infant would wait almost 2 hours to have pancakes with nowhere to stand or sit?I'm sure the food is great, but my time is definitely more valuable than a plate of pancakes."
1/29/2017,20170129,5,4.14,"Nice place for a lazy Sunday brunch. You ll get a table in 15-20 minutes max. The French toast flight is their special and it tastes awesome :) They have some daily specials too. I had a pineapple upside down French toast as special. They are quick in service. Little pricey , but the food is worth the price."
1/29/2017,20170129,5,4.14,"Food is so good! I couldn't choose so i ordered two meals. Prices are reasonable and staff is nice. Place is always busy so be prepared to wait. but it's all worth the wait! You can tell that the owner values his fraternity as the purple and gold colors are everywhere. Such a great, black owned establishment!"
1/31/2017,20170131,4,4.14,"Tasty food. Lamb Chop special was delicious, great quality meat and cooked very well... It was a bit on the salty side and I'm not sensitive to salt... French Toast Flight was excellent. Cheesy hash browns were perfect."
2/2/2017,20170202,5,4.14,"This is some goooooooodddd olll southern food. Expect a wait, We waited for about an hour but it was well worth it. It was also On a Saturday at 1 pm. I expect them to be busy at this hour. We ordered: // Super Flight of French Toast - 14 - This comes with this amazing maple butter that tastes almost like ice cream. Definitely put it on your French toast. To be honest, I dont even like FT, but this place does it amazingly. I prefer the caramel one the best. The special for that day was graham cracker. They change it every week. // Lamb Trio - 19 - Three lamb chops, cheesy hash browns and all these other goodies. A special, and absolutely delicious. // Crab Cake Benedict - 17.50 - REAL CRABBB MEAT. that's right. wow, this plate was great. I LOVED it. I am partial to crab meat tho. Maybe not for everyone. I literally wiped the plate clean. I felt awful afterwards.... too... much... food. so beware. The staff here is super knowledgable, very friendly and caring. Definitely a place you should wait for. Happy eating!"
2/5/2017,20170205,3,4.14,"I came here because I was in the area and starving. I picked this particular brunch restaurant because of pictures. And then I learned not to do that anymore because I wish I had ordered something else.There's a host in the front-center of the small restaurant - if you have a group, make sure everyone is there or else you ain't sitting. I ordered the Goof because literally EVERY YELP PERSON recommended it except for my server which should have been a sign, but I ignored it and listened to the Yelp fambam. I wish I would have read the description because the picture blinded me - sort of like my experience with Alex Pettyfer. Like, he's hawt AF and I was like ""omg, marry me! Can I be your number four, but really you're number one? Oouu, you Beastly, you Beastly AF. You da real Magic Mike!"" -- but he's a huge lard of douche in real life says my magazine resources, lulz. Anyways, I wish I had read the description because SWEET POTATO WAFFLES and SPICY BUFF FRIED CHICKEN? Wth has the world come to? That is the weirdest effing combo.. and for breakfast?! It was also the weirdest thing to eat. I did not like the combination at all. The chicken was too dry and the waffle - where do I begin? While it was perfectly toasted, was I supposed to put syrup on it? Butter? Use spicy buff sauce?? Ew-no. What is a sweet potato doing as my waffle? It tasted like a sweet potato (kudos?), so if you're into tasting it in the form of a waffle and being confused and regretful at the same time... do it. Order it, but I wish I never did. It didn't work for me. I am genuinely surprised by how popular it is. Like wh-what? Wh-why?I also tried the popular french toast sampler, and PASS. Way too sweet and it's basically tons of food flavoring (blueberry, lemon, etc) in a french toast. Weird, so weird. This place is weird. Why are there so many reviews -- sketch. But, I averaged 3 stars because of the amazing, very informative and super friendly service."
2/5/2017,20170205,2,4.14,"You will never be disappointed eating here. I just would never go on a weekend. I treat myself during the week. There is a aging star make server who works the entire room even if he isn't waiting on you- he makes sure the house is in order! The manager was there thoroughly explaining dishes to two diners who I suspect don't get out much; he was patient and pleasant with them. But in the kitchen (where the door is open) I heard the F-bomb!!! geez dude - it's only 8:07 a.m. NO ONE WANTS TO START THE DAY LIKE THAT- NOT A CUSTOMER, nor A WORKER. No one deserves to be talked to like that- no matter what they have done. Very, very unprofessional- as I read other reviews, this is a theme. I guess until someone calls him on it- it will continue. No bueño. I would like to be the one to have that discussion with him on a Saturday when all the tables are filled and I'm waiting my hour to be seated."
2/5/2017,20170205,4,4.14,"I had the super flight French toast, which was very tasty, and the staff was so friendly from the hostess to our server to the manager/owner. They were all very accommodating and friendly to our 5 month old baby we had in our car seat at the table. We went at 9 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 10-15 minutes but it appeared to get very crowded with more of a wait shortly after that. We will definitely be going back soon!"
2/8/2017,20170208,4,4.14,"Wow. Simply said, this food is just wow. Came here on a Wednesday morning with one of my best friends and it wasn't packed. As time went on people started showering up. The waitress was so nice and the place was clean. We ordered the cluck and goof with a side of cheesy hash, and Carmel French toast with a side of chicken sausage. Everything was amazing. It really was great. I do not have a big of a sweet tooth so some times the food got a little too sweet for my taste. Overall great experience and will be back."
2/9/2017,20170209,1,4.13,"It was a Wednesday around 10am. The host attempted to seat my daughter and I at a long shared table with bar stools. Clearly this older host hasn't learned that most people of a certain age will not and more importantly cannot sit on wooden bar stools and be comfortable. We declined that and he directed us to a ridiculous waiting area with cement benches smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. We stood there looking at one another for a while. Then two other ladies walked in, a younger woman and an older woman. He tried to get them to sit at the long table and they too refused. Again older people cannot sit on wooden bar stools. We all looked at each other and we all came to the same conclusion. WHY are you not seating us at a table when there are six or seven empty tables in the restaurant????? Your restaurant may have great food but I will never know as we LEFT. It is insulting to do that to your customers. I have worked in restaurants my whole life and I have never ever seen this complete disrespect for patrons. You were trying to maximize the people in your restaurant and make more money good luck. You are not getting mine!"
2/11/2017,20170211,5,4.13,"Wonderful restaurant for brunch! My friend and I ordered the chicken and waffles and the crab cake Benedict. Both were delicious, although my personal favorite was the Benedict - I'd recommend getting both and sharing! The portions are very large - my friend and I could easily share one entree and maybe a side. As others have mentioned, the line is very long. I arrived at 10:20 am on a Saturday, and the wait was already 90 minutes. My friend and I went to Snaggletooth nearby (highly recommend!), enjoyed some coffee/tea, and came back to eat brunch at 12, which was perfect. I definitely recommend doing the same."
2/11/2017,20170211,5,4.13,"INCREDIBLE. Today was our fist time here and will not be the last. B&B was recommended by a total stranger in a store one day and since it was only blocks away we had to try it. The experience stared with a very polite greeting and total explanation of the menu and specials. The coffee was piping hot and never ending not to mention very good. We were very impressed with the service from both the waitress and busboys who made sure our coffee was always full. I had the steak omlete with a side of fruit and my wife had the spinach and mushroom omelet. Let me start with the steak omlete. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium) on top of the omelet with the cheese folded in it and all covered with onions, mushrooms and a red wine sauce. OMG. The spinach omlete was made just as good with sautéed spinach and mushrooms on top of the omlete with cheese folded inside. The hash browns with my wifes omlete were also very good and my side of fruit was plentiful and very fresh. Can't wait for our next visit."
2/13/2017,20170213,1,4.13,"Wish I could leave negative stars!! For the half cocked service,drab canned vegetables. And overly berry filled dry ass pancakes. The management knows this and condones the behavior. Keep your money, you'll get better service at IHOP."
2/14/2017,20170214,5,4.13,I had such an amazing experience!!! I loved the atmosphere and I loved the service!!! The hostess was so entertaining!! Me and my boyfriend recommend this place to everyone!!! Everything was made home made base and everything was so unique!! Thank you for the amazing experience!!!
2/15/2017,20170215,5,4.13,"Quick seating. Fast and polite service. Our server Leslie was excellent. We ordered the french toast flight, cluck-n-gaufre and she recommended the cheesy hashbrowns as a side. All were amazing dishes. She even asked us if we had any allergies which we appreciated. This place may be Chicago's best kept secret and I almost don't want to share this review because I want to keep this hidden gem all to myself. Will return real soon to try their Crabcake Benedict!"
2/18/2017,20170218,5,4.13,"Came here based off a recommendation from a friend. They are a big fan of the restaurant. When you get there make sure to check in at the front for a table and it's a waiting area towards the back. It's a small entrance so it's advised not to block the door while you wait.. if you have a party over 4 people it might take 50 minutes to 1.5 hours to get a table. Our wait was only 20 minutes for 2 people.Everything sounded really scrumptious on the menu, but I went with my gut craving. I ordered the flight of French Toast which came with a speciality French Toast of the day- pineapple upside down French Toast. It included strawberry, blueberry, lemon and caramel. This was so good, you will make sounds as you are eating it lol.... guaranteed.. I also ordered the veggie omelet with smoked Gouda and cheesy hash-browns. This was succulent as well. Make sure to ask for the Chef Special of the day before you make your order. My friend ordered the main staple called the Cluck N Gaufre or chicken and waffles which is a sweet potato waffle topped with fried chicken breast drizzled in a nutmeg hot sauce and their own maple butter. I tried it and I was sold!!!!! Absolutely lived up to the hype. It does have a little spiciness to it but the flavor combination of sweet and spicy are perfectly balanced. It's so good, you won't actually need syrup or anything like that. I am definitely a fan of B&B; it reminded me of my relatives ambiance in New Orleans, and to me NOLA has the best food on earth. This place reminded me that good food is all around us to make you feel at home"
2/18/2017,20170218,5,4.13,"Really great breakfast food, creative menu selections and excellent service. Every time I'm in Chicago I have to go here!"
2/19/2017,20170219,5,4.14,Amazing atmosphere and phenomenal food. Worth the 30 minute wait! I've been twice now and the food is consistent. Thanks for proving me right.
2/21/2017,20170221,5,4.14,"I went into this adventure hoping to not like it. There's a lot of hype, its far from where I live, parking is tricky, the hour wait that everyone tells me to expect...I was just hoping that it would stink.But alas it was amazing in every way! The trick is to get there before/right when it opens at 8. Parking is a little easier and you're seated right away. The staff here is super friendly and very helpful. Our waitress made some awesome suggestions that we, of course, took. The food is a little on the pricy side but so so delicious. My dad was all in for the caramel french toast per the review in the Tribune. My stepmom got the french toast flight with the added toast-of-the-day flavor. I didn't get a bite of any of it probably because it was so delicious that they forgot to share. My boyfriend got the pancakes which is unusual because he's not a huge pancake fan. At first it seemed pretentious that they didn't serve it with syrup but they were right! They're so good that it doesn't need any syrup!I had to have the biscuits with chicken sausage gravy because its so rare to have that option. Usually its with pork sausage. It was delicious! The biscuits were dense and had cheese inside. The gravy was a little sweet but they provide a side of their own hot sauce. I subbed the coleslaw for cheesy hash browns. Why not?For me this is going to have to be a special occasion breakfast place. It lives up to the hype and is worth all of the effort!"
2/21/2017,20170221,5,4.14,"I come to Batter and Berries every time I visit Chicago for their chicken and sweet potato waffles (Cluck-and-Gaufre). Their service is fantastic. My server's name was Tusiime (for a couple of my trips). He is extremely knowledgeable and fun. He is full of energy and our order was in and the food was out very quickly (*the others servers are great, too, but Tusiime really stands out). Your coffee (which is great) stays full in your mug. They are very efficient in how they get people in and out, so if you see a line, the wait won't be long. I have also tasted their different benedicts and french toasts and they are good. If I can't make it up to the restaurant, I will have my chicken and sweet potato waffles delivered! One of my favorite breakfast places in the city!"
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.14,"First timer, definitely not a last timer. The blueberry french toast and chicken and waffles were delectable! Ordered a few other things also, all satisfying.They have some sort of maple butter for their french toasts... and I can say I can't get enough of them.Sadly they don't do phone orders and most the time they have a wait.However I do firmly believe that it's worth it!The service was good."
2/22/2017,20170222,5,4.14,"I ordered the sweet potato waffle with chicken inside along with chicken. My wife tried the French toast sampler with sausage & eggs. The food was very good, especially the caramel French toast. Customer service was very good as well. You should definitely check this spot out."
2/23/2017,20170223,3,4.14,Decided to go here after reading some reviews. I ordered the fried chicken and sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken because it was a mix of all the things I love. Turned out to be pretty underwhelming. The sweet potato waffle was kind of dry and flavor was kind of off. The fried chicken was pretty good. Everything tasted better covered in maple syrup and butter with the hot sauce. I would probably go back since they have some other plates that look really good but I wouldn't order the fried chicken and waffles again.
2/23/2017,20170223,4,4.14,"I have been dining at Batter & Berries for years now, and it is one of my favorite restaurants. Batter & Berries has the most diverse, creative breakfast that I have ever eaten in my life. Although the food is great, the wait is horrible. Imagine everyone trying to get a seat in a 1000 square foot place, that is only open from 8am to 3pm. They really should consider extending the restaurant, because it is always so cramped.You might wait at least two hours, but once you are seated, the food is out before you know it. The waitresses are very entertaining and welcoming. They even have riddles for you to solve in order to spare time. The menu is everlasting with a new special every week, which keeps you excited every time you visit. They have over a hundred french toast flavors! I highly recommend the upside-down pineapple french toast. The con is, once the week is over, it is a long time before you see it on the menu again. Despite the small space and long wait, I will give Batter & Berries four stars out of five. The food is so awesome, once you take your first bite, the wait no longer matters."
2/24/2017,20170224,5,4.14,"This is my go to spot for chicken and waffles.  They have Chicken infused sweet potato waffle topped with fried chicken!!! I mean what more can you ask for? The service here is pretty good considering they can get busy.  The biggest challenge is just deciding what to order, everything here is delicious!!"
2/25/2017,20170225,5,4.14,"I came on a Saturday with my wife at around 10am. Don't be intimidated by the amount of people or the proposed wait time. We were given a 1 hour wait time, but seated within 35 minutes. The space is small, but the staff is efficient, so you really feel taken care of.My wife and I feel especially passionate about supporting this business because it is black owned, and owner/chef Rylon is just a great guy (and very involved in the day to day of his business). But make no mistake, this places food stands on its own.We ordered the lamb trio, a deconstructed broccoli and cheese omelette, and some CarmelFrench toast. Everything was amazing! The lamb was Delicious, the Carmel French toast is the best French toast I've had in my life, and we were happy to be able to bring our champagne for byob service.All in all, a great experience!"
2/25/2017,20170225,5,4.14,"OK I so I'm really into breakfast foods and cute spaces ( spending 4 years In DC will make you a serial cruncher). I was specifically looking to support black owned businesses while in Chicago and Google led me here. Let me tell you I'm so glad it did. First of all, YOU WILL WAIT. They'll tell you 30 minutes but be prepared for an hour. That said, it's a small space with very tasty food so it's to be expected. The foooooood! I got the French toast flight AND the crawfish omelette because I'm greedy and indecisive and honestly the wait didn't even matter after they set my food down. Great experience, service was excellent. I'm coming back in a week, probably won't wait until the joint is about to close. :)"
2/27/2017,20170227,5,4.14,"Imagine missing your early-morning flight, while you're standing at the gate. Imagine having to rebook with another airline, only to find out that your next flight isn't for another 10hours. Now, imagine ONE bite of food making it all worth it. Batter and Berries was my boyfriend's ingenious idea for killing time before our flight. Man, I love that guy. We thought there would be a long wait be a long wait because the place itself is kind of tiny. There is a community table in the middle and a few 2 to 4 seat tables that leave a pretty narrow space for everyone to walk through. We sat down and were greeted pretty quickly. Our waitress had an ipad with pictures of the specials, which was pretty helpful. We both chose a different special-he got the scallop omelette, I got the crab cakes Benedict. Both were AMAZING. The scallops were cooked perfectly, there were served with mushrooms and asparagus in a mushroom sauce. The Benedict had house-made hollandaise and the best crabcakes I've ever had. In the middle of our meal, someone (I think the owner) yelled out to everyone that the parking attendants were walking down the street ticketing cars. Who doesn't want a heads up if they can avoid paying a parking ticket?! We were in and out with enough time left on our parking to take a walk (in an attempt to undo the damage we'd just done at the table)."
2/28/2017,20170228,1,4.14,"We came in today to get breakfast (Tuesday) and the whole back of the restaurant was empty. Our group (we had 5) had to be somewhere at 11 and it was 9:40 - but the 5th person was running late. We explained that we had their order and they would be here soon, but we had to leave by 10:40 anyway. The man at the front said they wouldn't seat an incomplete group. I explained the situation to him and he then laughed in my face and refused to seat us. Dude, when your restaurant is only 50% full, you're acting entirely out of pride and not logic. Really bad experience, really bad service, really bad vibes."
2/28/2017,20170228,5,4.14,"Prior to getting in town I knew I wanted to visit this restaurant, but my plan was reinforced once someone I met suggested I go here before leaving. So one Saturday morning I did just that and I'm glad I did.Foremost, service was remarkable and that definitely matters when the wait time exceeds 30 minutes on weekends. I ordered the crawfish omelet which was jay-dropping because it was bold, spicy, and flavorful. The omelet was served alongside hash browns that were pan fried to a golden crisp (yum). My friend ordered the crab cake benedict and she too enjoyed her meal. Also, the plating presentation technique was on point. I'll without a doubt return in the near future."
3/1/2017,20170301,5,4.14,I do a lot of traveling and I have never been to a place like this before. I did have to wait 45 minutes but it's because this is the best breakfast spot I have ever been to in my entire life. My boyfriend has been talking about the super flight forever. We were so sure that we would order it but after seeing the daily special menu we had to pass. I ordered the crab cake Benedict. I love hollandaise sauce and this was the best hollandaise sauce I have ever tasted. It was so rich and creamy. The crab cake was so light on breading and fluffy! My boyfriend ordered the crawfish omelette. I'm not a fan of crawfish but I had to try it. It was so good. We both got a side of their cheesy hash browns with out order. I cannot wait to come back to Chicago to try the super flight. If you're looking for breakfast in Chicago don't bother going anywhere else.
3/2/2017,20170302,5,4.14,"My husband and I have been meaning to come here for over a year, but it's always PACKED on the weekends. We both took a Thursday off for some appointments and finally made our way over here. Even at 10:00 on a Thursday, the place is poppin', but we only had to wait a couple minutes.My test at any breakfast place is a very basic order of hash browns, scrambled eggs, and bacon. This place has exactly that available on their menu (The Traditional). They have the BEST cheesy hash browns and my new favorite hot sauce! They make the hot sauce here from scratch and it has lots of garlic and great flavor without being too spicy. I also loved the thick, crispy bacon.We also got the super flight of French toast which included a slice of each of their current flavors: blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel, and red velvet. My hubby really enjoyed their coffee as well, though I don't recall what brand it is. This is our new go-to breakfast place, and I can definitely see us taking a weekday off work again for ""appointments"" so we can come back!"
3/3/2017,20170303,4,4.14,"Everything they say about Batter & Berries is true. The food is delicious, the wait is long, and the place is packed nonstop. I've wanting to visit Batter & Berries for so long but I'd heard about how long people had to wait when they visited. My friend visited Chicago for the first time so it was the prefect excuse to visit. We got to the restaurant within one hour of it opening on Saturday and we still had about a 30 to 45 minute wait on out hands. They took my phone number and directed us to check out the 7-eleven next to the restaurant because Batter & Berries if BYOB and we could pick up drinks. Luckily it wasn't too cold outside because we decided to walk around to kill time. We didn't realize it because it was packed when we got there but they have a small waiting area in the middle of the restaurant. We ended up only having to wait about 30 minutes. The restaurant is very tiny in comparison to how many people they try to squeeze into the place. We were seated at the large table that's near the front door. Originally the waitress tried to put all three of us on one side of the table so we'd be sitting across from people that we didn't know. It was an odd thing so we spoke to the receptionist and we let us sit at the end of the table so we could all be facing each other and not awkwardly across from strangers. The food was delicious! Surprisingly the food came out very quickly and the waiter was very attentive. You can tell that they are used to being busy because the wait staff is great at managing all the tables that they have while still being keeping their cool. I would recommend visiting when it's warmer outside because you're guaranteed a wait and it's easier to wait outside when you don't have to risk turning into an ice cube!"
3/3/2017,20170303,2,4.14,"I would definitely never eat here again. If you're not into French toast, don't bother coming here. I ordered scrambled eggs and spinach (as my meal) and they brought it to me on a teeny side dish plate- and they were the worst eggs I've ever had on my life. The spinach was pretty awful as well- watery and loose and not mixed into the eggs. Our waitress gave us attitude frequently. They wouldn't seat us until our party was all there so they made us stand in the back of the restaurant with 10 open tables surrounding us. It was bizarre. If you go, just order the French toast and don't venture into trying anything else."
3/3/2017,20170303,1,4.14,To go order for one item took 40 minutes and didn't get what I ordered. Workers were very disrespectful.
3/4/2017,20170304,5,4.14,"This is probably my favorite place for brunch in Chicago. Best specials, waiters who tell riddles, fresh soulful food and a diverse crowd. This is my go-to place when people from out of town visit and they are also never disappointed."
3/4/2017,20170304,5,4.14,"This place was nothing short of amazing. Granted we went during prime time on a Saturday morning with a wait of 2 hours but it was worth every minute of waiting. We walked around the neighborhood to see this pretty houses and finally the time had past. We got seated as soon as we got back from receiving a text message. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and we placed our orders immediately. The food cameOut pretty quick and again it was nothing short of amazing! I ordered the crawfish omelet and when I say they loaded it up with 40+ peeled crawfish! I also ordered a half order of strawberry french toast and it was delicious!! Just perfect! Oh they also allow you to bring your own champagne in and will provide juice for a charge which is neat so we purchased some from a nearby store after finding that out. Again, this place won't disappoint and don't get discouraged when you hear about the wait times! Or go early :-)"
3/5/2017,20170305,4,4.14,"I have been hearing about this place for over a year now. I finally made my way there with a friend for her birthday. The place is cute and clean, staff attentive, but as good as the food was I am of the opinion that no meal is worth a 2 hour wait unless it is free, which this meal was far from at about $50. I had the crab cake benedicts and she had the short ribs, we shared a flight of french toast. Again, I would have given it 5 stars but the wait is ridiculous. You must have a plan when going such as going for your mani/pedi and coming back or doing some shopping in the area after checking in."
3/5/2017,20170305,5,4.14,"Okay, so I was at the barbershop one Saturday afternoon and my barber swears by this place. And so I decide to go check them out on a vacation day. When I tell you I was extremely pleasantly surprised, that is an understatement. You have to try the French Toast Flight. In my personal opinion, Batter & Berries has the best French Toast in the Chicagoland area!I will definitely be going back as well as making Batter & Berries a frequent spot."

3/5/2017,20170305,5,4.14,"Okay, so I was at the barbershop one Saturday afternoon and my barber swears by this place. And so I decide to go check them out on a vacation day. When I tell you I was extremely pleasantly surprised, that is an understatement. You have to try the French Toast Flight. In my personal opinion, Batter & Berries has the best French Toast in the Chicagoland area!I will definitely be going back as well as making Batter & Berries a frequent spot."
3/6/2017,20170306,5,4.14,"Prepare to wait and wait and wait. Then prepare to eat and immediately nap!This place is great! I was discourage when I first arrived because the wait was 2 hours. So we put our name on the list and came back. The place is tiny, but has a waiting area.Once we sat down we were greeted by a friendly waitress. She showed us the specials on her phone. She used photos from the restaurant's Instagram page. I thought it was a neat way to explain the food. The waitress was very knowledge and gave good suggestions. We decide to order the salmon omelette, side of bacon and French toast sampler. Yum! It was all yummy.The French toast doesn't require any syrup. It is just made to melt in your mouth. The salmon omelette has the perfect touch of lemon in the sauce. It was over egg whites which were a nice touch as well. Our bill was $30 which was very inexpensive for the amount of food. Honestly, think this place could raise their prices. It seemed awfully inexperience for the great experience. I'll be back next time I'm in town!"

We did go during the week tho and it was still busy busy so I can only imagine what the weekends must be like...1.5-2 hour waits is what they told us. So if you can do a weekday prob better."

The service was excellent, the waitress, not to mention the staff in the kitchen were all very attentive to my wife and I needs. The food....smh...was excellent..my wife ordered the French toast and i ordered the chicken and waffles....great decision...the flavor was perfect, not to mention i didn't even need syrup, it was obviously prepared with love....I'm not a friend of the owner or staff-I'm just being extremely honest and believe in giving credit where credit is due. It's not located on my side of town (south suburbs)....but believe me the drive is well worth it."

3/15/2017,20170315,4,4.14,"Visited for brunch and the wait was 30 minutes. The food was quick and delicious. I give this place 4 out of 5 because it was extremely packed and we could barely leave the place after. Additionally, I wish I had known the eggs benedict I ordered were 18$ and not $13 like the others on the menu. Either way the food was amazing, so the wait and price was understandable. I had crab cakes eggs benedict, boyfriend had a chicken fajita omlette, and we share French toast flight. All the food was cooked quickly and perfectly. Truly enjoyed our experience here and will try to come back on a possibly less hectic day if there is one."

Thankfully, it took no time to order and get our food. We ordered the French toast flight and the lobster Benedict along with sausage. The restaurant is fairly small, and kind of loud but the service was decent. You really don't feel like you can take your time to eat in this place. But the food was excellent. I literally haven't tried better French toast yet. Idk if the anticipation and waiting to finally eat made the food that much better, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. It will be awhile before I wait that long for brunch again, but I'm glad we went and experienced the awesome food."

Thx French toast is a must. By far the best I've ever had. Staff is friendly but you will be waiting for a LONG time.

Dont pass this place up because of the wait time, it really small inside so its understandable because not many sitting space but the food will ok it!!! Luv luv luv"

I got the special they were offering which was the Crab Cake Benedict(fried egg instead of a poached egg)! The way the waitress decribed it i couldn't resist and it tasted as good as it was described. I also got a half order of carmel french toast which was sooo good! All in all my experience there was good! Just a heads up we sat at the community table which was kind of weird at first, we soon got over it!"

3/24/2017,20170324,5,4.15,Awesome! While we waited we went for popcorn! The food was simply delicious and satisfying without the over stuffed feeling. I had the new salmon with cheesy potatoes and split a french toast flight with the maple butter. The best thing is I ate before my flight and was not hungry the whole day because of the protein filled meal. Will def go back in a couple weeks

I had the limited mango french toast with house made pork sausage. The mango french toast with the pork sausage had a great balance of sweet and salty. No reservation, it's first come first serve...however it's all worth it. As busy as they are, our waitress Leslie was very attentive. Again she's awesome."
3/25/2017,20170325,4,4.15,"I really like this place, and love the French toast flight! Can't give 5 stars because one of the hostesses is really rude--or at least she was to me-- and the bacon wasn't very good either time I've ordered it. But I love supporting black-owned businesses and will continue to go to B&B for my French toast cravings!"

3/26/2017,20170326,2,4.14,"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. All of the time we try to go there is a really long wait so we go somewhere else. Today we went a little early after I got off work around 8 am. We were able to get a table right away but I had to wait till my husband came in. He had dropped me off because it was raining and I am pregnant. I was feeling kind of bad and tired. I asked the hostess if I could sit down at the table for this reason. She would not let me and said I had to wait for my husband even though I needed to sit down. I have to say this place is way too hyped up. We tried the crab cake Benedict and flight of waffles. The crab cake tasted funny. The hash browns were ok. The waffles were a little better but NOTHING at all to write home about. The hot sauce they say they make taste like nothing but vinegar. The place gets super crowded and noisy. I gave them 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible and our server was really nice. Other than that, spending $50 on an over hyped hipster spot is just too much. Save your money and go down the street to S&G. Much better food, good service and half the price."

3/28/2017,20170328,5,4.14,"Amazing! Just amazing! Me and my fiancé tried the surf and turf, the French toast flight, chicken and waffles, and the cheese hash browns. Everything was so well crafted and you did not need any syrup. The water and orange juice were also refreshing. We couldn't pick which one was a better dish. It's the type of food to put you to sleep once you get full. Only thing we regret is not having more space to try more dishes."
3/31/2017,20170331,4,4.14,Wonderful Restaurant and amazing food. The wait can be hectic sometimes but overall this place is great. The food is yummy!!!
4/4/2017,20170404,5,4.14,Not a long wait during the weekdays even though it's still busy. It just shows how popular it is! Also food was served really quickly and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend going! We did the French toast flight and chicken and waffles.
4/5/2017,20170405,5,4.14,"Worth the wait but be prepared to literally wait for two hours on a Saturday morning! We were a group of seven and arrived a little past 11am, so I understand this is ""peak brunch hours"" but it was still such a long wait that we ended up getting a beer at the brewery across the street and waiting inside there until our table was ready.As soon as we were inside though, the coffee started flowing and our awesome server stopped by to give us the first of many riddles he asked us throughout our time there. He was super personable and didn't seem annoyed at all by how packed the place must've been all day, he definitely brightened our spirits after the wait and made it a fun brunch out. I got the french toast flight and while only one of the flavors was outstanding (the lemon was so delicious), it was tasty to try them all (especially with the maple butter they have) and it was a good portion size.The food came quickly, and paying the bill was super easy with their tablet system which allowed the server to split the check however we wanted to group different items without an extra cost for splitting checks. Overall a great experience and great food!"
4/5/2017,20170405,1,4.14,OMG!!!!!! I am so upset I blew $23.15 on this place and the food was not good at all.... I ordered cluck & gravy and I got nasty tasting crap with biscuits. I also got an apple belgique and I just have no comment it was ugly tasting. Never again will I order from this place... This is just a yuppified place with outrageous prices and a horrible food!!!
4/5/2017,20170405,5,4.14,"I absolutely love this place. The food and service is always great. The only thing I would say could be a downfall is the wait, but outside of that the place has a good vibe. I love the togetherness of all the different cultures."
4/8/2017,20170408,4,4.14,"Batter and Berries is a must visit brunch place in Chicago. The wait is so long, but well worth it. My girlfriend and I came here and we were quoted a one hour wait. Fortunately, the restaurant sends you a text message when your table is ready (you have 10 minutes to come claim your table) and there are some really nice shops nearby to help pass your time. I definitely recommend checking out Rotofugi! They have really cute keychains, plushes, and anime figures. Once we received our text, the waitress immediately seated us at a nice table close to the window. The waitress was extremely attentive, refilled our beverages, and even gave us suggestions about what the most popular dishes were. My girlfriend and I decided to order two dishes. We ordered the french toast flight and the Cluck-N-Gaufre. The french toast flight was a sampler that had one piece of each flavor of french toast, this included strawberry, blueberry, lemon, and caramel. The sampler was heavenly and came with a generous portion of french toast and syrup. My girlfriend and I both agree that the caramel one tasted the best because it was topped with a generous amount of candied walnuts and it was both sweet and salty. The french toast sampler came to our table extremely warm and the french toast was so flavorful that you don't even need to add any syrup or butter! Lastly, the Cluck-N-Gaufre is basically a complicated phrase for chicken and waffles. There is a fried chicken breast that is soaked in hot sauce and this is placed on top of the sweet potato waffle. This dish also comes topped with the signature batter and berries maple butter. The waffle was cooked perfectly, it was not burnt and pretty much melted in your mouth. Personally, I am not a fan of sweet potato, but this dish changed my perspective. In addition, the large portion of spicy fried chicken was cooked well because the grease from the chicken did not leak onto the waffle and it was extremely tender. Whenever you order and eat this dish, make sure to eat both the waffle and chicken at the same time and add a little bit of syrup to the dish because the syrup allows for the dish to pop with flavor. Overall, if you are in Chicago and are craving a fantastic brunch, you must come visit the legendary Batter and Berries!"
4/9/2017,20170409,5,4.14,Long wait but well organized where they contacted us by cell when table was ready. We had a few drinks nearby while we waited patiently. Food came out amazing fast and was everything we thought it would be!!!
4/10/2017,20170410,4,4.14,Food and service was great! The only reason I'm giving them for stars and not five is that the wait is ridiculous... Every time I've gone I've had to wait for a table over an hour and a half. They can't really help it that they're so good in people want to eat there...LOL. But I would love it if they would implement some type of reservation or extend their space. The only reason I don't go every week is because I think it's ridiculous that I should have to wait almost 2 hours for a table...
4/13/2017,20170413,5,4.14,"We went around 930am on a Thursday 3 weeks ago and it was great. No wait. Banana pudding French toast was amazing, I was hungry though so I should have ordered something on the side as well."
4/13/2017,20170413,5,4.14,"My group of 3 only had to wait about ten minutes on a Wednesday morning for brunch. This is now my new favorite brunch place in all of Chicago. That is a big deal trust me. We all split the French toast flight, the salmon omelette and the crab cake benedict. All were sooo good that we could not decide which dish was best. My only complaint would be that the omelette was 19 dollars but it was so good that we didn't think long on that one. I definitely recommend splitting entrees because all of the food was so good that you will not be able to decide if you want your food or your companion's. It was pretty loud inside but our server was great too."
4/15/2017,20170415,3,4.14,"I was finally able to get up early and head over to Batter & Berries. Just an FYI...It's true when someone tells you to get there early.I made it around 7:30AM and people were already standing in line waiting on the doors to open. You would think that they were giving away prizes. Also, make sure you be there early to not only wait in a long line but get there to find yourself a park. Pay Meters are waiting on you to feed themThe line moves pretty fast. So, I was able to be seated and a the nice waiter was waiting to pour me a Hot Cup Of Java.My waitress Nadine was Superb. Make sure to be seated in her section. Since it was my first visit. Nadine explained the menu to me. There is a item selection for the day that you can add on to your plate.Since I heard so much about the french toast flight. I took my chance and ordered the french toast flight along with some pork sausages.M2y food came quick and the lemon, strawberry & blueberry french toast was 1amazing.I didn't care too much about the pork sausages. The taste didn't agree with my taste buds. Nadine was such a sweetie pie to exchange my sausage for some bacon. I was a happy camper. Overrall, I wasn't disappointed with this cafe.

I split the super flight of French Toast (that's a regular flight of French Toast + the special French Toast flavor of the week) and the Crab Cakes Benedict with my friend. Our waiter, Tim is quite possibly the happiest person in the world and he made the experience so joyful for us! He recommended the super flight so we could try the special flavor (which was Butter Cookie btw...to die for) and he recommended their hot sauce to go along with our eggs. I don't usually ask for hot sauce but I'm so glad Tim recommended it because it was delicious! The food was already delicious on its own but the hot sauce took it to another level. Oh, and did I mention the French Toast comes with maple butter instead of syrup? I really could go on and on about the food but what makes this place truly special is the service. Tim took such good care of us, our glasses were constantly refilled be it water or coffee, and one of the chefs came out and shook our hands and introduced himself as we were leaving. He wanted to make sure we enjoyed everything. You simply do not get service like this everywhere! If I'm ever back in Chicago I will definitely come back to Batter and Berries!"

4/17/2017,20170417,5,4.15,This place is amazing! 830 on a Monday and no wait! Only negative thing is it's incredibly hot in here. They need some air

4/19/2017,20170419,4,4.15,"Wish I had known this place was BYOB - they do not serve alcohol. Despite that, we still enjoyed our brunch. The wait is pretty long for a Saturday, about 80 minutes if you arrive around 10:30a. Ordered the french toast flight special which included the traditional set plus a snickers french toast. A lot of interesting flavors spanning blueberry, strawberry, pecan, snickers, lemon. My favorite was the strawberry and it's true what they say about their butter - it tastes like ice cream! The toast itself was hit or miss based on the flavor, pecan/lemon being a bit drier than the strawberry/blueberry ones. Coffee was strong and delicious, with lots of refills. Also ordered a savory special of crabs eggs benedict (real crabmeat and lots of it)- so good! Worth the wait."

4/23/2017,20170423,5,4.15,"Pro-tip: come on a weekday at an off-time.My mom and I both had a day off work so we came in here on a Tuesday around 12:45. We sat at the communal table, which was actually a great way to figure out what we wanted to eat. Everything on the menu sounds so amazing that it's hard to choose. But being the traditionalist that I am, I had to go with the sweet potato chicken and waffles.This chicken and waffles dish is not messing around. There is chicken BAKED INTO the waffle batter. This is no regular waffle, this is a sweet potato waffle. This is a sweet potato waffle, with chicken baked in the batter, with a hot sauce glaze, and a huge chunk of butter. The chicken is perfectly fried and just the size you want it to be.This is the dish. It has to be. I know you all rave about the french toast flight, but for real you are missing out if you haven't tried these chicken and waffles.My mom got the pulled pork, which looks like candy. On the menu it says it's smoky and sticky, and oh man, is it smoky and sticky. Good flavor. Great fries.(But seriously, get the chicken and waffles)."
4/23/2017,20170423,3,4.15,"I came here on a Saturday at 12 PM with friends and we were quoted one hour wait time, but waited more like two hours for our table. This is one of the biggest issues I saw at the restaurant- management had trouble distinguishing which party came first and how to seat them. Though they had a text system set up, we were one of ten people standing in the waiting area while we saw two or three empty tables waiting to be filled. The food was tasty, we split the French toast flight $14 (white chocolate raspberry was the changing flavor), ordered the chicken and waffles $13.5, my friend had the salmon omelette special $19, and my other friend had the buttermilk pancakes $8.50. I enjoyed my chicken and waffle but admitted the hot sauce on the chicken was a bit of an acquired taste with the sweet potato waffle. I took another star off because I dislike restaurants that nickel and dime you for the bare necessities- Batter and Berries charges 50 cents extra for more hot sauce or pats of butter. I would come back and be willing to try more of their food, which was generously portioned, but the higher than usual brunch prices are indicative that the portions should be large as well."
4/24/2017,20170424,5,4.15,"I'm not quite sure how this was my first time at Batter & Berries, but I assure you, it won't be my last! When it's a holiday and there's no people on the streets except for those waiting to get in here....you KNOW there must be something special going on. The hubs and I waited for 35 mins for this byob'd gem and it was well worth the wait!Everything sounded great so out took me awhile to decide on what to order. The regular menu looked incredible, but I do try to order what's on special whenever I eat out. Those selections tend to be the freshest. I tried the crab Benedict daily special and we split the kid sized special French toast of the day.....apple pie. Let me start by saying that I hate runny eggs and white sauces. But that crab Benedict was the real deal! The crab was ALL blue crab. Being an east coast girl, I was ready to harshly judge, but was super pumped that I didn't have to! The French toast was ridiculous .... And that butter....good lord! You could eat that stuff by itself, and by the spoonful!The hubs got the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken from the regular menu. Another ridiculously amazing choice! The portions were plenty, so we both had leftovers for another full meal! Another thing I want to mention is the house made hot sauce. Holy cow. And I don't want to forget to mention the service, which was impeccably given by Tim.I will DEFINITELY return. What a delicious brunch spot!"
4/25/2017,20170425,1,4.14,"Wow, I'm so disappointed. I have been waiting to go to Batter and Berries for YEARS! People have been raving about how good this place is and how good the chicken and waffles is. I ate the dish as instructed (one bite that consisted of all components) and it was very underwhelming. I'm upset I wasted $13.50 on food that in my opinion was trash. The waffle had large chunks of black pepper that were very overpowering. My boyfriend got the deconstructed broccoli and cheese omelette. The broccoli was under cooked. His side of sautéed spinach was floating in oil. Overall, a pretty terrible experience. The only plus was that it was not busy and our waitress was very nice and attentive.Also, if each piece of waffle should be accompanied by a piece of chicken then put two pieces (especially considering the price too)! I have a whole half of waffle left with no chicken.Update: my boyfriend ended up puking his food up when he got home. He has a cast-iron stomach..."
4/27/2017,20170427,5,4.14,First time here and will be back! Best French toast ever. Little loud but other than that was great experience.
4/27/2017,20170427,5,4.15,I will leave it at this: Best Brunch in Chicago...don't challenge me on this! ;)
4/27/2017,20170427,4,4.15,We went there on a Saturday morning. We had about an hour and a half wait. That was to be expected though and was fine with me. We had a great waiter who told jokes and riddles. They are very effiicent in getting food out. We had chocolate panakes as an appetizer. That was my favorite. I had the crabcake eggs benedict and it was pretty good. Baby Mama had the salmon omelette which was on special that day. She loved it. All in all this is a can't miss place.
4/28/2017,20170428,5,4.15,"Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  Friendly staff, cozy environment.  Love this place"
4/29/2017,20170429,5,4.15,"I drive by here everyday and I always see a line. It wasn't until last week that I was finally able to try it and I'm just soooooo happy that I did, I haven't stop talking about it!!I went with a friend and the hostess sat us at the IG table with other people. That was actually nice as you get to see all the food up close and talk to other people. SERVICE was so good, the waitress showed us pictures of the specials on a phone and her recommendations were fantastic. FOOD, was 5 stars!!!! I order buckweat pancakes and they're by far the best I've had. My friend ordered the waffles and they were just as good. The couple next to us had lamb chops and they were literally moaning because they were so good!We were asked if we wanted coffee to go, and that was just the cherry on the cake."
4/30/2017,20170430,5,4.15,"If I could give them more than 5 starts I would! My husband was leery about going but we took the 40 minute drive. We went on a Sunday morning, the place was packed but we were seated right away. Our waiter ""come see me Jackson"" gave great service along with a side of corny but entertaining riddles . Small place but packed with flavor and taste! We had the French toast flight(including the grand mariner) , Apple waffle, chicken Florentine omelette and veggie omelette. Talk about service the food was at our table within 5 mins! No exaggeration! And as soon as a plate was empty someone was there to clear it from the table. The maple butter was beyond ""like butter baby""! And no syrup was needed for the waffles or French toast. My only complaint... That I didn't try the Salmon omelette and the steak omelette they looked delicious!!!! But don't worry WE WILL BE BACK! Oh and I think my husband enjoyed his food more than me"
4/30/2017,20170430,5,4.15,The good was amazing and worth the 5 stars. But the check in process is slow and flow on seating and serving is 2 stars. I was with a large group so I expected a wait but 2 hours? Then the waitress takes an order of only 2 people in the group and not the rest of the group???
5/1/2017,20170501,5,4.15,I must say im beyond please with this place there food is amazing there staff are very polite and pleasant the wait was a little long but well worth the wait I has the chicken fajita omelets the flavoring was amazing on the chicken perfect on there seasoning and we has the there French vanilla French toast with caramel the favoring is mouth watering
5/2/2017,20170502,4,4.15,"We came here on a Sunday for brunch around 10:30 am and the wait for two was about 40 minutes. Food was good but a bit pricey. Overall, a good place to eat if you're willing to wait."
5/4/2017,20170504,5,4.15,"Absolutely loved this place. Very cute and homey. The waiters/waitresses are very entertaining and sweet. I got the French Toast Flight which was delicious, each flavor very unique and savory. My friend got the Deconstructed Chicken Fajita Omelet which was very flavorful and yummy as well."
5/4/2017,20170504,5,4.15,Fye as hell. I had the crab Benedict fye. Caramel French toast fye! Make that mf bring you here.
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.15,Amazing amazing food!!!!!! I'm dying to go back! Highly suggest getting there within the first 3 hours they open to have a lower wait time.
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.15,"I've heard so many great things about this place and now I'm finally experiencing THE EXPERIENCE! I love this place and if you haven't gone here, then you're missing out! The customer service is A1 and they're helpful in choosing a menu selection. I had the sweet potato chicken and waffles, definitely will be trying this again. Plus it's byob!"
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.15,Mmmmmmmm had the French Toast Flight. Sooo good. My daughter had salmon cheese omelette with cheesecake hashbrowns. Nice place very friendly staff.clean fast service. Lots of customers so it's popular.
5/6/2017,20170506,5,4.15,I have been traveling for years. This was easily Top 5 greatest places I have ever been in my life. Our waiter was amazing !!! It was an hour wait but I promise it's worth it.
5/7/2017,20170507,5,4.15,"tldr: Get the French toast flight - either on your own or as an appetizer for the table. Service was amazing - our waiter Tusiime provided the best service we could ask for. This brunch place had fantastic food and service! Warning, it is very loud in here and the wait when I went (granted, for Sunday brunch) was almost 2 hours! However, they take your number so you can walk around the area while you wait. It is very much worth it!My table shared the Super French Toast Flight (sampler of blueberry, strawberry, caramel, lemon and flavor of the week!). It was the most delicious French toast I've ever had! Perfectly done and topped with their signature maple butter. DEFINITELY get this, it was my favorite thing we ate. I ordered their take on chicken and waffles! The chicken was perfectly done - moist and doused with exactly the right amount of hot sauce. The waffle is a sweet potato waffle with chicken in the batter. It was not super sweet and had a spice taste, so it wasn't my favorite. Despite this the chicken made it worth. Another person at my table ordered the Executive. Steak was delicious!"
5/7/2017,20170507,5,4.15,Best french toast ive ever had. Service is amazing. Other menu items are awesome too.
5/8/2017,20170508,5,4.15,"This place was so cute I loved it! Let me just say first the staff was so nice and friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. The manager went around to everyone during busy brunch hours and made sure everyone was having a great time. We waited about an hour on a Sunday morning at 11 which is to be expected at a popular place like this for brunch. We parked around the corner in a neighborhood and bought champagne at the 7-11 next door to bring for the mimosas. A friend and I shared the half carafe of orange pineapple juice and we each got about 3 mimosas out of it. We also shared the French toast super flight which had peach bourbon, lemon, caramel, strawberry and blueberry French toast. It was all really great unique flavors and we only paid about $20 (not including the champagne from 7-11 which was $10) for both of us. Definitely recommend this place if you have time to wait a little bit and have a great brunch!"
5/12/2017,20170512,5,4.15,"Girlfriends Weekend in Chicago! The food was delicious. It was eleven of us. So, we were able to taste a good bit of the menu. I most definitely will be ordering two plates the next go around. Go there hungry, the portions are huge."
5/12/2017,20170512,5,4.15,"Delicious!! My 10 yr old daughter and I popped in for lunch before an appt. Friday afternoon- busy- bustling but quick!! Our server, Jessica, was super helpful. So many choices! I had the French Toast Flight snd my daughter had choc chip pancakes for kids. Amazing French toast and quick great service!"
5/13/2017,20170513,5,4.16,Favorite breakfast hands down! Omelettes to die for and French toast BYOB... What more do you need
5/15/2017,20170515,3,4.15,"It was okay. I don't get why people would wait for an hour plus for this place nor do I understand when people say things like this is the best brunch place in Chicago. It makes me wonder where have they eaten brunch, a dumpster? 7 eleven? The grocery store's crappy hot bar? McDonald's? Or are they that shitty of a cook? Luckily we only waited for 30 minutes. First off, it's a small cramped place. The waiting area is right in front of the restrooms and lucky us, our table was right by it too so you have people waiting hovering over you watching you and your meal as well as people coming in and out of the restrooms. Fantastic. My friend who insisted we go here loves this place- I don't think I'd go out of my way for this. I had the French toast flight which was okay and a side of scrambled eggs. My friend had the chicken and waffles and the veggie omelette that came with cheesy hash browns. The hash browns were pretty good. Overall, you're not missing out if you haven't been, the wait isn't worth it and there's better brunch places in the city."
5/18/2017,20170518,5,4.16,"This was the best French toast I have EVER tasted!! I have been to many ""famous"" breakfast restaurants and this is right at the top. The ""French toast flight"" is a must. It's a sample of carmel, blueberry, strawberry and yes lemon. Lemon was the favorite of all 3 in out party. The other favors were a close second. The ham and thick, tender and delicious. If you like tea, they have a great selection of loose teas. The place is small, crowded and loud but well worth it! If your in Chicago, you must visit. The server was funny and hospitable."
5/18/2017,20170518,5,4.16,"I still remember the first time I was introduced to this place. I remember each and every dish we ordered. I went with a veteran that grew up here and knew exactly what to order. We had the biscuits and gravy, French toast flight, Salisbury steak, and chicken and waffles. The dish that stood out the most was the chicken and waffles. Unique waffle batter with chicken infused into it. Some spices. I believe I tasted nutmeg and cinnamon. No syrup needed. That butter cream they provided was amazing and complimented the waffle very well. Chicken was crispy and not very oily like other fried chicken. And the bits and pieces of chicken inside the waffle gave nice texture. You get the slight crunch of the crust of the waffle. Then it gets soft and then you're hit with a lil crunch and chewiness from the chicken bits. It was awesome. I like some spice with my dishes so I asked for some hot sauce and they had their own house hot sauce that was perfect. Although that dish stood out the most, I must say that the one dish I can see myself ordering over and over again would be the biscuits and gravy. It is SOOOO good haha. I don't even want to try and describe the creamy doughy delicacy. You'll just have to order it and try it for yourself. I even went and smothered some of the gravy over the chicken and waffles. Sublime. The Salisbury steak was good but I don't think it's a dish that would make me want to come back over and over again. However, I did smother the gravy from the ""B&G"" over some steak and again, sublime. I can imagine that gravy going well with almost everything.Except maybe the French toast flight. These little slices of heaven are perfectly fine all on their own. No syrup please. Not needed. Just a little bit of that house butter cream and you're set. Fresh fruit toppings, I enjoyed the blueberry the most. Second would be strawberry. Then pecan. They also have special ones that come out every so often. Like the last time I went with my girl, they had a pink mimosa French toast that was interesting. We both agreed we'd still stick with the blueberry one. Always seems to be busy. Don't be surprised if you have to wait for an hour. But I'll let you know it's worth the wait. Service is on point. Very friendly staff. Have had great service both times there. Expect nothing less the third and there after. I do wish they were able to take reservations, but it's understandable. An establishment such afters theirs is always packed regardless and with the disregard for punctuality nowadays, they'd be giving up a table for ""x"" amount of people that would be filled regardless with just walk ins. Maybe a deposit system? Put a down non refundable deposit? If you show up, it gets used towards your tab. If you don't after 10 minutes, table is given up and you lose the deposit. That would be so awesome because I am totally not a morning person but if I can get there at 1 and be sat at 1, I would totally be there more often. Anyway. I will see you again soon!"
5/18/2017,20170518,4,4.16,We had a great time. Not a long wait. My by had chicken and waffles. He really did not like that he could not choose the flavor of waffle which he was given sweet potato waffle and he didn't care for it. The chicken was good though. I had strawberry French toast that had fresh strawberries and my bf even dug in because it look good and was yummy.
5/19/2017,20170519,5,4.16,"Less than 24 hours in Chicago and heavy with jet lag my husband and I wanted a satisfying breakfast. We walked to Batter&Berries arriving after 11 am to find a 45 minute wait. Our disappointmrnt showed but the host encouraged us not to miss this eating experience. We walked the neighborhood, shopped a bit and returned for a knock-out, great meal with with absolutely attentive staff. The French Toast Flight was well prepared and perfectly portioned. Each piece was unique with the taste of fresh ingredients. My eggs were perfectly cooked and the hash browns with cheese were very tasty. Our server Tim was very attentive. We loved it and begged the owner to consider Tucson for another location."
5/19/2017,20170519,5,4.16,"I knew about the line when I came here, so my friend and I aimed for a weekday with the hope that it wouldn't be too bad. It was still out the door and down the street, but when we were seated there wasn't any pressure to move us along, the service was great and the food was tasty. I ordered a waffle and steak and eggs because I couldn't decide on savory or sweet. Next time I'll get the French toast."
5/21/2017,20170521,4,4.16,"Solid breakfast. I've heard of beer flights - did not know of french toast flights prior to this dining experience. I ate the super french toast flight which included french toast slices of: strawberry; blueberry; caramel-nut; lemon; the special of the week (blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry). The special of the week slice was my favorite. I hope they add it to the menu permanently. The strawberry and blueberry slices were both excellent. The lemon slice tasted as good as the caramel but I doubt I'd enjoy a full plate of it. The lemon slice reminded me of a lemon meringue pie; tasted great but too much sweetness could be overwhelming. As expected, the wait for this well-revered restaurant was pretty long (2 hrs). I think the food was worth the wait. Please note that we had gone there around noon on a Sunday - primetime for brunchgoers. I suggest having a little snack if you are not going very early in the morning."
5/21/2017,20170521,2,4.16,"The food is the best part of this place IF YOU EVER GET TO EAT IT!!! They put us on the 120 minute waiting list, closed and never called us!! Terrible customer service. They don't have the room to accommodate more than 50 people and it's terrible!!"
5/21/2017,20170521,1,4.15,We were very unimpressed with Batter & Berries even though we can see by the constant lines this is a very popular place. If your goal is to eat a cup of sugar in the form of French toast so sweet that the wait staff recommend not adding syrup then this is your place. However I am an egg eater I ordered the deconstructed steak and eggs. The plate was covered in some sort of gravy the egg part was buried in this brown sauce. On the plate was a mound of mushy potato hash Browns. The steak was cooked perfectly and we ate it all the rest was left on the plate. We approached the platter of French toast as desert. The coffee was superb. If you want to chat to your table mates this is not the place it was very loud.
5/22/2017,20170522,4,4.15,"The wait was a little long, but the menu was versatile and full of fun delicious options. I ordered the frenchtoast flight and the lobster eggs benedeict. Both were great. Arrived starving, left full of delicious breakfast foods."
5/22/2017,20170522,4,4.15,"Awesome food and fair prices. Our dishes came out super fast. The french toast flight was amazing. The flavors were spot on: caramel, lemon, blueberry, and I forgot the other one but wow they were good. The breakfast wrap with chicken sausage was flavorful and filling and not greasy at all. This place is LOUD- so don't expect to have a nice intimate conversation across the table. You're going to have to yell to talk to each other, but its worth it."
5/23/2017,20170523,4,4.15,The wait is kind of long for a weekday but the French twist is pretty good I ordered the super flight French twist that gives you all the different type of French toast. I really loved the salted Carmel and lemon very tasty.
5/23/2017,20170523,5,4.15,Great breakfast! Service was fast and the waffle flight was bomb. Always a long wait on weekends so get there early.
5/24/2017,20170524,5,4.15,"This place was a random find on Yelp. Highly recommend, friendly service and amazing food. Their rendition of Chicken and Waffles was so good! A great savory dish. My boyfriend got the Super Flight French Toast and it was delicious - no syrup needed. Wish we could buy tubs of their maple syrup butter!"
5/24/2017,20170524,5,4.15,I love waffles and these blueberry belgium waffles are so good! The whipped cream topping is delicious. the waffles are perfectly cooked to a crisp golden brown with a soft inside. they also have an amazing selection of loose leaf tea that i love. on my second visit here they were under staffed so service was a little slow but very friendly. i love this spot for brunch but even on a friday morning they were busy so be aware you will probably experience lines...because food this good is worth waiting for!
5/24/2017,20170524,5,4.15,"Amazing! The place , the food and the service were excellent! Was recommended this place by the staff at the hotel I stayed at and they were right! My server Tussimee was beyond exceptional!"
5/28/2017,20170528,5,4.16,Had the blackened salmon and it was incredible. Sampled the flight of French toast and it was also crazy good. Will be here monthly lol
5/29/2017,20170529,5,4.16,"We always make sure to stop by and eat here when we're in Chicago. Food is always delicious, staff is pleasant and our server, Timothy is the best. The wait can be a little long and if you're coming with kids, just make sure you've taken your extra dose of patience with you as the space can get a little tight and crowded. Otherwise, great place!"
6/2/2017,20170602,5,4.16,"Tip: GET THERE EARLY TO AVOID LONG WAITS!!! My family and I have been coming here since they opened 5 years ago!! Time flies when you're eating good food lol! There was a point in my life where I came here at least once a month whenever I was home for breaks. French toast is always a good choice! Omelettes are always bomb. My mom always gets the chicken and waffle, and loves it. I have also had their pork chop executive and it's bomb! This last visit we had the blackened salmon executive, the veggie omelette, shrimp scampi omelette, and French roast flight to share. Everything was to die for! The blackened salmon was definitely the superstar of the entire meal! A smoked Gouda and dill sauce??? Frigging genius! Food came out in 5 minutes, no joke. Service is great! As always I'll be back."
6/6/2017,20170606,5,4.16,"If breakfast is your favorite meal of the day too, then you will never go wrong here!The staff is extremely knowledgeable when it comes to specials, making the experience all the more exciting.Now the wait for seating can be a bit long, because it is just that good, however, once you order, your food arrives in little to no time.Not only is the food AMAZING, but the presentation makes your eyes get even bigger!The quality and one of a kind flavor combinations are top notch!Meeting with owner and understanding how they came to create such an establishment was the icing on the cake, and I look forward to going back next week."
6/7/2017,20170607,1,4.16,I'm not sure how the food here is because I didn't get to eat. We sat there for 25 minutes not existing. Table after table was seated while they didn't even make eye contact. We got up and left after 30 minutes and my mother dropped her glasses case. They noticed that. When I said we were leaving because after 30 minutes no one took our order the coffee guy just nodded his head and didn't even apologize. The hostess heard me and gave zero shits. I wish I could give zero stars.
6/7/2017,20170607,3,4.15,It is a bit overrated in my opinion! I order the pulled pork and herb fries! Pulled pork was good but didn't like the fries!
6/7/2017,20170607,3,4.15,Host was dishonest about the fact that there was quite a long wait. Waitress was friendly but struggled to communicate due to the noise level. Very noisy place. Strand of hair found in the food. Overall the food was good and the service/experience was ok but definitely not worth the wait.
6/8/2017,20170608,5,4.15,"This place was absolutely delicious. We did have a bit of a wait, but turned out to be well worth it! I had the French toast flight, MOUTHWATERING! My fiancé ordered the lamb special. He was too greedy to share but he said it was phenomenal. I will definitely be back."
6/9/2017,20170609,5,4.15,"I love this place! It has quickly become my favorite brunch place. I always enjoy their French toast flight. Their chicken and waffles are also really delicious, but I recommend asking for extra syrup to put on top because it can get dry sometimes (so just in case!). Other than that, I've had their omelets and several other specials. I have never been disappointed! The service is so friendly and quick and efficient. It is well worth the wait (and there is usually a wait--so plan ahead!)"
6/9/2017,20170609,3,4.15,"This review is overdue. We were back in Chicago from out of town the Memorial Day weekend. We came here Memorial Day morning. We got here just about when they first opened. So, we were waited on immediately. My daughters joined us. So, we waited until they arrived shortly after. The French Toast Flight was great. They featured a champagne toast that day which was superb. The French Toast Flight is why I am giving it 3 stars. However, my wife and I ordered the (I believe its called the Cluck and Goof) chicken and sweet potato waffles. Our meals were the first to arrive just about as soon as we sat down. I guess that's the first signal that went off. The waffle and the chicken were overcooked. As I stated, when we lived in Chicago, I had come to this place several times before. So, I was aware of the inconsistency in the way they prepared the chicken and you can get it overcooked at times, but this was first for me with the waffle prepared soooo poorly. I took the initiative to order my chicken cooked ""lightly"" and I emphasized to our waitress I didn't want my chicken overcooked. My wife stated the same. Well, that didn't come across well. I could barely cut through my chicken with a ""knife"". Our server was quite friendly and accommodating. She took my chicken back and said she would have chicken prepared the way I wanted. It came back in 2 minutes. That piece tasted as though it had been sitting up and it was still overcooked. This piece wasn't even hot! I didn't mentioned it to our server. I guess they did me a favor because for the first time I didn't complete the meal. This is supposedly a gourmet breakfast and brunch. The food coming back so fast doesn't indicate that to a reasonable person. I met the owner, He probably wouldn't remember me. I asked about us being overlooked for table once before and having to be placed back into order to reserve a new table. Needless to say, he obviously by his attitude, he has experienced some success, but if his success is compromised by the quality of his food, it won't last long. My wife really liked this restaurant based on my recommendation from seeing it on ""Check Please"" when we lived in Chicago. I loved it too at one time, but after my last experience, I don't know if I'd come back again or recommend it again to anyone visiting Chicago. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, RAYLON!"
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.15,Straight up best brunch spot in Chicago. Nothing can top it. Always been super consistent with their great tasting food. The wait can be long but let me tell you it's 100% worth it. I like how the menu slightly changes and the rotating French toast flight is fun and delicious. Thank you for existing and making my brunch dreams come true.
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.16,Amazing doesn't even begin to describe the Rasberry Svedka french toast with fresh raspberries sprinkled on top. So so so so yummy!
6/10/2017,20170610,5,4.16,"Met my cousins for a Saturday brunch here. 45 min wait but went fast, has a seating area and immensely friendly entertaining waitstaff. Our waiter was Tuissime (sp?), had has doubled over with trivia questions and also wow'd us with the specials descriptions. Good was beyond amazing. I had the blackened salmon executive, and it was good, i had to share with all my cousins. Husband had the crawfish cakes, disappeared fast. We had the french toast super flight, delicious, the maple butter was outstanding, like ice cream. Thanks Batter and Berries for an amazing brunch to kick off our Chicago cousins weekend!"
6/11/2017,20170611,5,4.16,"I still dream about the French toast flight. I wish I could bathe in that maple butter. Ok got weird. Live in NY but went to Chicago for a weekend and everyone and their mother was telling us we had to go here and that the wait was totally worth it! And it definitely lived up to the hype! My fave was the table French toast flight we got to share (next time I'm getting one allll for myself) and our waiter! He was charismatic, funny and made the whole experience even more enjoyable. The whole staff is great. Make a trip there if you're around!"
6/11/2017,20170611,4,4.16,"Stopped by for brunch on Sunday at around 12:30 and were seated after an 80 min wait. We ordered the french toast flight with sides of 2 eggs scrambled and sweet potato hash. Everything was very tasty and filling. Very boisterous atmosphere, great place to stop on the way to the park and zoo."
6/12/2017,20170612,5,4.16,"I visited only once, but the French Toast Super Flight was one of the best thing I've ever had for breakfast. The rest of the menu looked tasty and creative, too. Staff were amazing and very helpful. Come early; this place gets busy after 9am or so."
6/13/2017,20170613,5,4.16,"I love breakfast food and when looking for a place to brunch a Chicago native suggested my boyfriend and I try Batter & Berries. I live in NY but visit Chicago often and finally had time to get to eat here.I went late Monday morning at around 10:30 and the place was packed! There was a 40 minute wait for 2. The restaurant sends a text message when the table is almost ready. There are lots of stores in the area, so I was able to walk around until the table became ready.My boyfriend and I ordered 2 of the specials of the day - the Key Lime French Toast and the Crawfish Benedict. The Crawfish Benedict is served with cheese hash. It was near perfection! I had no need or desire to add any additional seasoning or condiments.I'm assuming the Key Lime French Toast was amazing as well because my boyfriend had 1 piece left by the time the waitress came over to ask how everything was - less than 10 minutes.This is not the place for a quiet meal, at least not during busy hours. The waitress and bus staff were very attentive and we didn't wait long to be served. The total was about $30.Street parking is available and was easy to find.If you love breakfast food and enjoy well seasoned and scrumptious food, Batter & Berries is the place to go. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll have to make it a point to get to Batter & Berries. It was worh the wait.It's Black-Owned which my boyfriend and I really appreciate as we prefer to support Black-Owned and other small and local businesses."
6/14/2017,20170614,5,4.16,"Great restaurant with a great vibe. Let me tell you, the food is amazing. First off, I ordered the breakfast wrap with chicken sausage and it was to die for. Their homemade hot sauce with garlic was wonderful. It was truly one of the best breakfast burritos/wraps I have ever had. Next, I tried the French toast flight and they were all miraculous. The maple butter tastes good with each different type of French toast. The service was good and the food came out fast. Great place. 10/10 would recommend."
6/18/2017,20170618,5,4.16,"One of the best brunch places I've ever been to in Chicago. From the cheesy crispy hash browns to the perfectly cooked sweet potato fries, everything was amazing! We had hot chicken and waffles as well as biscuits and homemade chicken gravy"
6/18/2017,20170618,5,4.16,"The Crawfish Benedict was phenomenal, topped with their housemade Cajun hollandaise sauce. My favorite (savory) part of the whole meal had to be the cheese-crusted hash browns. Wow. Highly recommend trying the caramel French toast before you leave. You will not regret it. Service went above and beyond and the owner swung by to check in on us - 5/5 stars for sure."
6/21/2017,20170621,4,4.16,Been there twice looking forward to my next visit. The food was good and the server was a comedian and attentive which made for a great time. Far from home but worth the trip.
6/23/2017,20170623,4,4.16,So I've been before but I had to come right a review because this is by far the best breakfast option I have had thus far. On this visit I got the Shrimp Alfredo Omelette and a half order of the Preach Cobbler French Toast (special of the week). This was by far the BEST French toast that I have had from them. My Omelette was great but the French toast stole the show!
6/23/2017,20170623,5,4.16,"I just cannot get enough of B&B. I'm a native Chicagoan who lives in NY, and returns home often. EVERY time I come home I MUST stop at B&B. I stay recommending this greatness to folks who visit Chicago! I always get the French toast flight, either a kid's version or super flight depending on the special flavor. Every single original flavor is so delicious. Today the special is peach cobbler French toast. My favorite omelettes are the jerk crab and blackened salmon omelettes. The hash browns - GREAT!! Chicken sausage - GREAT!! Chicken and waffles - GREAT! Speed at which you get your hot meal - QUICK AS SHIT!!! Customer service - ON POINT!!The wait.....well an entirely different story. Either go as a party of 1 or extra early in the AM. I've had to wait 2 hours and 15 minutes before and can't believe I did it.I love this place. Five kisses from me."
6/23/2017,20170623,5,4.16,A fairly typical diner with long wait times on the weekends. The skillets are good and the waffles are great!
6/24/2017,20170624,5,4.16,"This place is addictive good! We live walking distance from here so sometimes I'll even make breakfast but come by and pick up the Carmel French toast. Carmel is the BEST flavor hands down- but get the flight if you have to confirm it yourself. My other favorites are the chicken + waffles & the crab cake Benedict. All of their breakfast items are made quickly and I've never had anything but wonderful service as well. Only complaint is that there are no reservations and you have to physically be there to make a to-go order (no calling in then picking it up). Honestly though, I understand the no reservation thing since this place is so small & ppl never show up on time."
6/25/2017,20170625,3,4.16,Wanted to love it but wasn't blown away by their food. Tried the chicken and waffles and it was a little too dry for my preference. Good service and nice ambience though.
6/28/2017,20170628,4,4.16,"Definitely recommend this spot to those with a morning sweet tooth (like myself). I've heard the waits can be extremely long on weekends (because, who wouldn't want french toast and waffles?), so we went in around 9 am on a Tuesday and got seated right away. They are known for their French Toast, and even offer french toast flights, where you get 1 of each of their flavors (caramelized, blueberry, strawberry and lemon). They were all delicious and I love the real fruit on top of each. They also do a weekly special french toast each week - this week was a mojito flavor, which didn't sound that appetizing to me, honestly. We also tried the blueberry waffle, which seemed to b the most popular. The batter itself is very sweet, and the maple butter is delicious. You almost don't need the syrup, unless you like it super sweet. Prices are reasonable, and service was good. Glad we got to check this place out - I Know they've won some breakfast awards in the Chicago area!"
6/28/2017,20170628,5,4.16,"Foodgasm!Best French toast I have ever had in my entire life. I got the French toast super flight and am so glad I did. I got their regular options (blueberry, strawberry, lemon, caramel) plus the daily one (mojito). Every single bite was infused with the most amazing flavor. I also got their cheesy hash browns which were also salty deliciousness."
6/29/2017,20170629,5,4.16,"Great food, great atmosphere! Love supporting black owned businesses and they did not disappoint."
7/2/2017,20170702,4,4.16,"It was really hard writing this review because I wanted to make sure that I brought out the best of my experience while also mentioning my not so good experience. That being said, let's do this. This was my BFF from college birthday [uh-hm, THE University of Alabama ROLL TIDE] and I gave her her choice of brunch spots for us to chill at in Chicago - she chose Batter & Berries so there we were. I must say that the time that she chose was not the greatest [wanted to go at 11am], but it was her B'day so I went along and I'm glad it did.Pros: Excellent and quick service, fab-u-lous and phenomenal food, friendly owner.Cons: LONG wait, no benches to sit on during the wait outside [like a familiar joint on Taylor Street that starts with Sweet], take-out service.The service and my Crawfish Cake Benedict won me over, and the hash browns were to die for - I would only add a little diced onion to the mix to make it ultra special. BFF's waffle was just ""eh"" for her sweet potato waffle and chicken combo [hence, ""Chicken and Waffles""]. The chicken was nicely seasoned, but the real surprise was the ""hot sauce"" that came with the dish. Mind you, bits of chicken were mixed into the waffle batter in addition to the fried breast that accompanied it. The hot sauce was a winner and I took it from her to drizzle over my Benedict AND hash browns, WOO-HOO!The only real disappointment that I had [other than my BFF's waffle overly seasoned with what I think was nutmeg and cinnamon] was the take out service. Usually when you order in and state that you want a take out order as well, they put the order in at the end of your sit down meal. Not here. The brought us our meal and the takeout at the same time. Big turnoff. Despite this, it was all good. Ok so here we go . . . . . VERDICT: Ye'ah [or YES for those of you not from Chicago], , , , , I got the ITIS Y'all!!! Despite the minor hiccups this is the spot, but go before 10am on the weekend if you don't want a 2 hour wait. Trust and believe, I only did this for my BFF!"
7/2/2017,20170702,4,4.16,Fantastic! Had the chicken gravy over biscuits. Next time need to try the French toast which looks fantastic
7/2/2017,20170702,1,4.16,"Was told that My guess and I couldn't sit at a regular size table because they where anticipating more people, well because it was my first try I decided to stay, only to notice that the next couple got a table that I just requested, and another 10 to 12 tables where available in the back of the restaurant , we respectfully eat without mentioning a word, only to notice in the 45mins we where there that the tables never got completely occupied, so my suggestion to all you business owner treat your customers with a lil more consideration and be consistent how you seat your customers because even tho the food was good I will not be going back there ever again, almost forgot my guess did mention to that sorry host that we where food critics and that the review wasn't going to be good"
7/3/2017,20170703,4,4.16,"Came here on Black Friday at 11 AM and it was around a twenty minute wait. It was a crowded and loud restaurant with a waiting area toward the back. I read reviews before I came and I was super excited by the Cluck n' Goof, a sweet potato waffle with fried chicken. The waffle came with tiny chicken pieces inside and did not taste like sweet potatoes. Instead, it was heavily seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon that overpowered its flavor. It came with maple butter that most people opted out of. The chicken was tough and the sauce tasted like buffalo sauce. I would've preferred the chicken without the sauce. My mom got The Executive, which comes with steak in a red wine sauce, eggs, and hashbrowns. I would love to come back and try the French Toast Flight, which is their most popular dish! The price was reasonable and the service was great."
7/3/2017,20170703,3,4.16,This is a really cool spot and so glad it exist. They have a very unique spin on traditional dishes. I am giving a 3 or a 4 only because it is pricey for what you get. The French toast is really good. There were 4 of us and our bill came up to $90 and we only had water to drink.
7/4/2017,20170704,4,4.16,The food was pretty and service was as well! First time trying it and I was super impressed. I will be back for the French Toast- best thing on the menu!
7/4/2017,20170704,5,4.16,"Amazing! Loved everything about our meal. My friend and I came here waited about 45 min (spot on wait time from the host). Had some coffee while we waited outside. They text you when your table is ready. I'm a savory brunch fan and the crawfish Benedict and chicken and sweet potato waffle with their signature maple butter and sweet and spicy sauce was delicious! Fastest service ever from our order to our table. Entertaining and knowledge waitstaff. Boisterous atmosphere. Can't wait to come back! We have to try their famous French toast flight still. So if you've not eaten here yet, put it on your list of must visit spots. Happy brunching!"
7/4/2017,20170704,5,4.16,"I went in thinking I was going to get pancakes but my waitress, Jessica, persuaded me otherwise and man was she right! This was my first time at this establishment and it sure won't be the last. Not only was the food amazing but so was the customer focus Jessica provided along with the amazing vibes and recommendations! Made for a very personable experience that you can't get most other places!"
7/5/2017,20170705,5,4.16,"Ordered for takeout.As per their policy, they do not take carry-out orders over the phone, which is a bit of an inconvenience but understandable. On arrival, the owner and staff were quite helpful and friendly. I had a relatively large order (+6 dishes) and received my order in approximately 10 minutes. Now to the food... The food here is amazing!!! The sweet potato waffle+ Chicken was and experience delicious. I must not forget the house-made sausage which was excellently seasoned.My family members remarked that flight of French toast, busciut+gravey, and shrimp scampi omelet wee really good as well. This is my new breakfast spot whenever I visit Chicago!"
7/5/2017,20170705,5,4.16,This place is AMAZING!!! The wait is always at least an hour or two so you have to get there super early. Or a little bit later. Their French toast flight is always a must!! Their maple butter will be the death of me. I could literally drink that stuff!! Everything on their menu is amazing! I've been here more times than I'd be proud to admit.
7/5/2017,20170705,5,4.16,"Immediately greeted and sat. Offered coffee and water within seconds. Our server was very friendly, and gave us a run down on the specials, and personal favorites on the menu. I ordered the sweet potato waffle with chicken. It was hands down the best chicken and waffle I've ever had. Chicken was literally cooked into the waffle, and homemade butter was placed on top. The spicy sauce was the right amount of spicy. Definitely a great experience."
7/7/2017,20170707,3,4.16,"Paid Street Parking outside.Usually there's a line especially on the weekends. Even some weekdays can be busy. The service is a bit slow. It took forever for our server to come and take our order but once we put our order in, the food came out so fast!-Super French Toast Flight: Includes all the French Toast options and the special of the day which was Godiva when I went. It was okay. Seemed like French Toast with different topping on each. Nothing too special.-Chicken & Waffle: Tasted okay too. I've had better chicken. Not too much breading & it wasn't dry but there wasn't anything really special about it. My husband did wish there was more hot sauce on the chicken.-Cheesey Hashbrowns: This was my favorite thing we ordered!  Hashbrowns held together by cheese! So good!It was also very loud here. So don't expect to have a cozy breakfast with friends. You will barely hear each other or you'll be yelling across the table. But I guess you'll have plenty of time to talk as you wait for a table."
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.16,"Oh my gosh - I can't say enough good things about this place! Be sure to get there early, because it gets crowded even on weekday mornings. After eating here, I can certainly understand why. We rolled in around ~8am on a Tuesday and were able to be seated immediately. As it seemed to be their specialty, I had to get the french toast! What better way to experience their french toast than with the flight?? I got blueberry, strawberry, caramel, lemon, and mojito (the flavor of the day) french toast slices. They make their french toast with flavored batters, and as such, I think the lemon was my favorite. Unlike the rest, it didn't have a sauce, so it allowed the quality of their batter to shine the brightest. I honestly did enjoy all of the options, though. Everyone else I ate with also absolutely loved their meals! My brother got the Chicken and waffles, which he said was fantastic. (He did say that the biscuits and gravy are even better, though!) All in all, fantastic experience! I highly recommend this place!"
7/8/2017,20170708,5,4.16,Amazing. Super hard to get into because of its popularity but well worth the wait! Try the French toast flight and the cluck and goof for sure. Good coffee and friendly service makes it an all around wonderful experience.

7/9/2017,20170709,3,4.16,Be prepared to wait! Our wait was 1.5 hours. We had 5 in our party and paid $112. I thought that was a little expensive for breakfast. The food was good but not worth the wait and expense.

7/11/2017,20170711,2,4.16,"I was not a fan of this place. The hostess told us the wait was 1 hour and ended up being 1.7 hour wait. our meal was very average. I got the special crawfish Benedict and the poached egg was very over cooked and more like a hard boiled egg. The coffee was also burned. The food on the bright-side does come out very quick but this food and atmosphere was definitely not worth the wait or the price. My mom ordered the shrimp scampi omelette and it only came with three shrimp for $20. Way over priced for it tasting average. The best part of the meal was the hot sauce and the cheesy hash browns. So in sum if you want to wait an average of and hour and a half for over priced average food with people screaming over one another, come here."

7/12/2017,20170712,3,4.16,"This was my second time going to Batter and Berries. It's hard to give his place 3 stars but I think I'm being generous. First the wait. We arrived a little after 10am and were back in our car right as our meter was running out at 1:10pm. We were told the wait was going to be 1 hour and 15 mins. At 90 mins I stopped looking at my watch and was getting frustrated. This restaurant is really small so there is no where to wait inside. It was a nice Saturday morning so waiting outside wasn't a big deal but if it was too hot or too cold this wait would have been miserable! Once we were told are table would be ready shortly, some other party was sat at the table we were promised! We were sat about 5 mins after that but it was still frustrating. Second the noise level. It was about 12pm on a Saturday and I could have sworn I was at a night club at about 1am. The table was small, I was sitting with three other people and at one point just gave up on the convo. I couldn't hear a word of what was being said from a person who was about 2 feet away from me!! Third the food. The menu is pretty standard breakfast food but they have a rotating special menu in chalk at the back of the restaurant. When we heard those specials we immediately got excited and changed our orders. My fiancé and I got the shrimp scampi with eggs and the flight. One friend got the crawfish cakes and the other got the pork-chop special. Based on the orders I expected another wait for the food however, literally within about 7 mins are food was at our table. Now I get it it's a busy Saturday you're a busy restaurant. But the idea that my meal was probably mass produced and possibly reheated makes it a little questionable, especially since we ordered seafood and not to mention the price of the meal. Everything we ordered was between $15-$20 a plate. My complaint is not with cost but the overall quality. If you are going to charge that much after a wait that long, please make sure my food is FRESH!! I want right out the oven, food steamin!! Overall I'm giving this place some credit because the service was great. The hostess and our waiter were amazing and the establishment is visually appealing. The food was OK but not hot. I would still go there possibly as soon as they open and after having had a first breakfast. If you're visiting Chicago I would suggest a weekday early morning."
7/12/2017,20170712,3,4.16,"This was my second time going to Batter and Berries. It's hard to give his place 3 stars but I think I'm being generous. First the wait. We arrived a little after 10am and were back in our car right as our meter was running out at 1:10pm. We were told the wait was going to be 1 hour and 15 mins. At 90 mins I stopped looking at my watch and was getting frustrated. This restaurant is really small so there is no where to wait inside. It was a nice Saturday morning so waiting outside wasn't a big deal but if it was too hot or too cold this wait would have been miserable! Once we were told are table would be ready shortly, some other party was sat at the table we were promised! We were sat about 5 mins after that but it was still frustrating. Second the noise level. It was about 12pm on a Saturday and I could have sworn I was at a night club at about 1am. The table was small, I was sitting with three other people and at one point just gave up on the convo. I couldn't hear a word of what was being said from a person who was about 2 feet away from me!! Third the food. The menu is pretty standard breakfast food but they have a rotating special menu in chalk at the back of the restaurant. When we heard those specials we immediately got excited and changed our orders. My fiancé and I got the shrimp scampi with eggs and the flight. One friend got the crawfish cakes and the other got the pork-chop special. Based on the orders I expected another wait for the food however, literally within about 7 mins are food was at our table. Now I get it it's a busy Saturday you're a busy restaurant. But the idea that my meal was probably mass produced and possibly reheated makes it a little questionable, especially since we ordered seafood and not to mention the price of the meal. Everything we ordered was between $15-$20 a plate. My complaint is not with cost but the overall quality. If you are going to charge that much after a wait that long, please make sure my food is FRESH!! I want right out the oven, food steamin!! Overall I'm giving this place some credit because the service was great. The hostess and our waiter were amazing and the establishment is visually appealing. The food was OK but not hot. I would still go there possibly as soon as they open and after having had a first breakfast. If you're visiting Chicago I would suggest a weekday early morning."
7/13/2017,20170713,5,4.16,"Batter and Berries is one of the best breakfast spots in Chicago. The food is consistently delicious, and the service is always fast and courteous. The place runs like a well oiled machine. The french toast platter is excellent - it combines a sampling of lemon, caramel, strawberry and blueberry french toast with an option to add the flavor of the week. On my recent visit the weekly special was peach cobbler french toast and they nailed it. Two thumbs up, highly recommend."
7/13/2017,20170713,5,4.16,"The best breakfast food ever. Really, ever. Definitely a unique layout, the community type table is a bit out of my comfort zone but who notices the stranger next to you once you get the food?! Just pleeease move to a bigger space! I always recommend Batter & Berries"

7/15/2017,20170715,5,4.16,The best breakfast and brunch I have tried in Chicago. We waited for about 45minutes in avery hot Saturday morning---but it turns out that it was worth the wait. A little advice: it may not be very enjoyable if you don't have sweet teeth!
7/15/2017,20170715,5,4.16,Every now and then a place lives up to the hype..and this place #aHit. Excellent fast service and gourmet level food..with the best housemade hot sauce ever that had real garlic in it...who told you how to make that Harpo???
7/16/2017,20170716,5,4.16,The shrimp scampi omelette was the best omelette I've ever had in my life! I've been recommending this place to everyone that goes to Chicago
7/19/2017,20170719,4,4.16,"I went with my sister. I had the lemon French toast which was excellent and she had the chicken and waffles which were not. She ended up getting the strawberry French toast which she thought was better. We had about an hour wait. Our waiter was great! Overall it was a good experience, for me at least. Lol"
7/21/2017,20170721,5,4.16,"Wow. This was my first time at Batter & Berries and it was great. I shared a flight of French toast and the traditional breakfast with my friend and it my amazing. I loved all the different flavors of French toast & the hash browns were great! I loved both meals, but if I had to choose one it'd be the French toast. The service was great, the price was on point & the food was amazing. I highly recommend."
7/23/2017,20170723,5,4.16,"I tried their French toast and steak omelet; both were delicious as expected. A couple helpful tips, If you arrive and come in with a friends, make sure everyone is present or they will not seat you otherwise. Towards mid morning the line gets long so getting here around 8am when they open is best."
7/26/2017,20170726,5,4.16,This spot is a real GEM ‼ Absolutely the best brunch spot I e probably ever been too. The food is st8 ‼ you don't even need syrup for the waffle or French Toast. Customer service is amazing and made us feel very welcome. They have 41 flavored of French toast ‼ . Parking can be a bit crucial but it's work the drive & wait ‼ we will definitely be back.
7/27/2017,20170727,5,4.17,"Honestly my favorite brunch place in Chicago, and brunch is my favorite - so I've been to quite a few places. Although I am not usually a fan of pancakes, French toast and such, I would recommend trying out their Flight of French Toast - their specialty b&b maple butter is amazing! I also recommend their Deconstructed Spinach Omelette. The spinach-mushroom sauce is to die-for!"
7/29/2017,20170729,4,4.17,Except the French toast flight .. nothing is outstanding . Ambience is a big let down . Our waitress was great and friendly . I felt like we were rushed through the order since there was a huge line behind us A must try is the French toast flight Enjoyed every bit of it .
7/29/2017,20170729,5,4.17,We enjoyed our breakfast. Our hostess Cena was excellent and professional. The wait was long but it was expected on a Saturday. Once we sat down our server immediately took our order and our food was brought out very soon afterwards. I enjoyed the salmon and my sorority sister enjoyed her caramel French toast. The maple butter is a hit. The next time I visit from Virginia I am coming back.
7/29/2017,20170729,5,4.17,"If you live in Chicago and haven't been here yet, stop depriving yourself. Great food the people are nice as well. The only down side is that thousands of others know about the awesomeness. So it can be a bit of a wait but it's worth it."
8/1/2017,20170801,5,4.17,"Can I give a place 10 stars? Literally the BEST breakfast I've had. We went on a Thursday and our wait was about 20 minutes, but honestly, I would wait hours for this food. The staff is INCREDIBLE and I hope to see them expand and have more locations. My first stop when I'm back in Chi!"
8/2/2017,20170802,5,4.17,Great food with many distinctive dishes. Highly recommend the Carmel French Toast and Chicken and Goufe. Delicious! Service was fast and very friendly. I can see why there are hours long waits on the weekends.
8/3/2017,20170803,5,4.17,"I just left minutes ago for the first time, and I had an amazing experience. The food was great and the service was Top Notch!!!The ambiance was warm and the mixture of culture was a Loving Feeling. This is a genuine review and I have no ties to the restaurant or any of its owners. This is just an honest review from my heart and I definitely advise you to go check it out yourself."
8/4/2017,20170804,5,4.17,"You know a restaurant must be good when there's always a wait... The waiting area is toward the back of the restaurant, which doesn't make sense and caused congestion... but that doesn't take away from how delicious the food was! I highly recommend the cheesy hash browns and French toast flight (one of each flavor). The bacon was great too. They have homemade butter and hot sauce - thumbs up in my book!"
8/6/2017,20170806,5,4.17,"Service was great, our food was at our table 10 minutes after ordering. Waitress was attentive and gave great menu advice. Some of the best french toast I have ever had!"
8/8/2017,20170808,3,4.17,"Batter & Berries is probably one of the most desired breakfast place for brunch enthusiasts. While the popularity speaks for the food, the reservation system has got to change for the sake of your patrons. The scheduling managers should upgrade their system online or even over the phone so people can make reservations and have some sort of forecasting rather than being forced to wait aimlessly outside for 1:40 minutes. That's just unreasonable, ain't nobody got that much time just for some french toast and omelette."
8/8/2017,20170808,5,4.17,Can't say anything that hasn't already been said. I just want to contribute to their 5 star reviews. Make sure you get the french toast flight. Absolutely delicious. Also be advised that plenty of people feel like an 1-2 hour wait is worth it so be prepared. One of the few restaurants that I would say is definitely worth the wait.
8/11/2017,20170811,4,4.17,The sweet potato chicken and waffles was very good! The hot sauce with the chicken complimented the cinnamon nutmeg butter and sweet potato waffle amazing. Also chunks of chicken in the waffle which was great
8/11/2017,20170811,5,4.17,You will not be disappointed!!! I ordered the sweet potatoe waffles with chicken. YES YES YES
8/12/2017,20170812,4,4.17,"This was one of the better breakfast spots I've visited in Chicago. I went around 7:50am on a Friday morning thinking that I would be late as I took notice of the mentioning of long lines. To my surprise there was not a line at all. Be forewarned: stick to the menu. Do not order anything that isn't regularly ordered. My table ordered pineapple juice which appeared to be more spoiled than fresh. Upon asking for another drink we waited quite a while for a replacement drink. As to the food, the array of French toast was superb. While they suggest the accompaniments are enough, we asked for syrup out of tradition and were glad we did."
8/12/2017,20170812,5,4.17,"We did our Annual Family Time in Chicago this year. This was the best place we went to as a family. The food was great, but the atmosphere and the service was OUTSTANDING Our entire family totally recommend when in Chicago you must visit this brunch spot. They deserve 10+++ stars"

8/13/2017,20170813,5,4.17,WOW! The wait can be a little lengthy because this place is PACKED BUTTTTTTTTTTTTT!! The food is well worth the wait! Price is decent and the amount of food you get is HUGE! Definitely come with a big appetite. Pancakes are good but the skillets are what really steal the show. Can't remember the name of the one I got but it was the one with all the meats. SUPER GOOD! The hash brown was perfectly crispy and not soggy at all. Everything about it was great. I only wish I had the stomach to finish the whole thing myself!
8/16/2017,20170816,5,4.17,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Unique variety of food, delicious and interesting. A slight wait due to popularity, but well worth the wait. I had the absolute most delectable caramel pecan French toast OMG!!!!!!!!! FABULOUS you just have to check it out. Also while you're in the area make your way over to Wrigley Field which is very close by. Enjoy your breakfast in Chicago"
8/16/2017,20170816,1,4.17,"I have never written a Yelp review in my life. However, after my first, and last, experience here, I literally felt compelled to write to this. I used to be a waitress for 7 years so I understand that stuff happens, but what happened during my visit was disgusting and so utterly unprofessional. I went with 2 others here on a Friday around noon. When we got there we were told it would be about an hour wait. No big deal. We put our name in and said it would be for 3 people. The restaurant text us in exactly one hour and we went back and were able to be seated for our table (which was a 4-person table). Upon arrival, my friend got a text that his girlfriend was getting off of work early and said she would be able to come meet us for brunch. We sent her a picture of the menu and she gave us her order. In the meantime, we all ordered coffee, orange juice, and an appetizer of the ""French Toast Flight"". By the time our appetizer got to the table, which took about 15 min., my friend's girlfriend was already there and she sat at the 4th seat of our 4-person table. Halfway into eating this a person came up to our table and said that we had to leave. We literally thought this person was joking and we were really confused. He said that we had a reservation for 3 people and not 4 and that our 4th guest would have to leave. Our 4th guest....at a 4-person table....would have to leave. We literally thought this guy, who we found out was in fact the manager of the restaurant, was messing with us because it caught us so off guard as we were sitting there eating. We explained to him that we waited an hour for a table here and that it wasn't like she pulled up an extra chair to a small table, it was a table for 4. Additionally, we already had her order ready to give with the rest of ours (which at this point still hadn't been taken because the waitress seemed super busy that she only had a chance to ask us if we wanted to put in an appetizer, which was fine and we didn't mind waiting). It's not as if we were sitting at the table for 30 min. with waters waiting for this 4th guest to arrive before we ordered. Honestly the audacity for a manager to come up and ask a guest to leave while we were all eating blows my mind. We told him that we were planning to spend over $100 for brunch and he didn't care in the slightest. He told us either she leaves or we all leave. If this sounds like a joke or an exaggeration, I assure you that this is exactly what happened. In all my years that I was a waitress, I've never seen a manager EVER treat a guest like this even when it PAINED them to give a customer what they wanted in the most ridiculous of circumstances. At this point I became particularly annoyed and asked him if this policy is posted up front somewhere or on the back of the menu and he said no, that it's his policy and it doesn't need to be posted and that she had to leave. Well obviously we're not going to make our friend go sit outside and wait for us so we all got up and left. We paid for what we got, and even tipped our waitress 20% seeing as none of this was her fault. Unfortunately she and the restaurant lost out on money that day because our bill would have been much higher. It was so unprofessional and disgusting. When we were leaving I noticed several open tables throughout the restaurant and I should have gone back to the hostess and put my name down for a reservation for 4 just to show the manager what a literal idiot he is and that it was ridiculous to ask us to leave despite there being open tables, but at that point I didn't want them to have our business. After coming here and reading the other bad reviews, I can see that other people have experienced his unprofessionalism and that his ""policy"" he's enforcing because of his pride is more important than retaining customers. I'll definitely never be back and I encourage others to choose a better brunch spot."
8/18/2017,20170818,4,4.17,"So it was my first time going with my daughter and she absolutely love it so this review will be based of me and my daught meal Daughter ""So I first walk there with my hopes very high since its black owned and I am supporting small business. So I would say that although this place is great the size could be better . I mean the line was out the door so they we obviously doing great and they didn't expand . I mean we were elbow to elbow we had to sit in the community table . Which wasn't bad but one of our tablemates were a little loud .  So that's size. Now to the food ,the was great I had the French toast flight . I choose strawberry ,caramel,and lemon . The strawberry and caramel were tasty but the lemon took the cake it was just heavenly it melted in your mouth simple wonderful. Now the service the was amazing she was fast, answered all our questions and gave great suggestions , and was just overall helpful .""Mother's foodMy dish I went with the chef special which was a garlic shrimp omelet been included hash browns this dish was very large it was more like something that you will order for dinner it was very rich the shrimp and vegetables and garlic had like a gravy type sauce and then you had a full order eggs and hash brown actually split this with my daughter again very rich a little more than what I was looking for far as breakfast but it was good it was very filling you're able to split it. The shrimps for very large the sauce gravy component to it what's good I just wasn't expecting it to be so heavy and Rich since it was shrimp but I also had the chicken and waffle with just some type of cluck special where the waffle is a sweet potato batter and the chicken is fried of course and they serve it with hot sauce instead of syrup I remember asking for some syrup and the waitress said that the chef said you shouldn't use syrup just use the hot sauce but I still want it syrup so the team wasn't instructed to give Chef recommendations I guess""  """
8/18/2017,20170818,4,4.17,Everyone recommended the French toast flight. It was definitely a good choice. I particularly loved the lemon and caramel flavors. It is BYOB but you have to buy a juice or pay for flutes so be prepared for that. And if you're going on the weekend be prepared to wait!
8/19/2017,20170819,5,4.17,"Solid example of how chicken and waffles should taste. I never had chicken infused sweet potato waffles before. (they are amazing). Our service was spectacular and the overall Black Owned ambience was beautiful! 10/10 would suggest. Theres a broad selection of their specially flavored french toasts ( blueberry, almond, strawberry, cherry, etc.)"
8/20/2017,20170820,5,4.17,"I think this is my favorite brunch spot in the city. Everything is delicious. The specials are always worth checking out. Really a delightful spot in Lincoln park - I hadn't read anything about it and went and was delightfully surprised at the diverse mixing of people and life giving vibe. Recommend it to any and everyone. Reasonable prices - amazing quality, beyond amazing food, fantastic service 10/10"
8/21/2017,20170821,5,4.17,Great place to eat! One of my favorite in the city. Quick kitchen and the waiting staff was very prompt and helpful. I ordered the strawberry waffles and steak and eggs. Some of the best food in my life. I recommend to anyone
8/23/2017,20170823,3,4.17,"Simply put, the food is not worth the wait.  If there wasn't a huge wait... I would have perhaps added a star but we must include the entire experience, not just the food. When it comes to the waiting game it's like every minute that passes the higher the expectation gets and quite frankly it just didn't add up. I wasn't blown away and I actually was upset that I waited because as an avid brunch enthusiast I know of a few places that I could have walked into with no wait and had better food with no wait. Don't get it twisted the food was very good the reason why they were three stars instead of nine but the experience could be enhanced. Service was good, average. Maybe it's time to consider a better reservation system (is there one?). If you're going to make someone wait three hours... Yes I actually waited three hours... you better be serving something to make me forget."
8/25/2017,20170825,4,4.17,"Over 1600 reviews, no wonder the line was out the door. They were just about to close at 2 but they were able to give us a table. The place was packed, pretty congested. The Menu looked amazing, I mean a ""French Toast Flight"" come on!  I ended up getting the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) chicken n waffles. The waffle was a chicken infused sweet potato waffle. Its not like any waffle I have ever had, takes some getting used to but its not bad. The chicken was moist a bit under seasoned. The Goof is not really sweet, or really savory, but I fixed that by asking for extra hot sauce and extra syrup. I will deff come back to try the french toast flight next time!"
8/25/2017,20170825,5,4.17,Worth the wait (about 45 minutes on a Friday morning). Amazing food and service. Get the French Toast Flight as an appetizer for the table!Best part of my meal believe it or not was the homemade hot sauce!! I swear I would put that ish on EVERYTHING
8/25/2017,20170825,2,4.17,Overhyped. Not worth the wait. Generic food. Long waiting time! Uninterested staff. Reasonable though.
8/25/2017,20170825,1,4.17,"This is probably one of the worst brunch spots I've ever been to. We had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to finally be served sub par food. We always hear about this place and figured we must try, but bleh. I would rather go to a breakfast chain you can find in any mall or off any highway, be seated right away, and pay a fraction of the price. (And honestly probably get just as good as, if not, better food.) Not impressed at all. Maybe my expectations were too high from all the ""hype"". The manager also walked around and checked on all of the tables that he seemed to know the customers at (friends? Family?) but never once stopped by our table to ask us how it was or if he could do anything for us. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. After reading more closely of some of the other reviews I am definitely seeing what some other Yelpers saw in this place. Overpriced. Overrated."
8/27/2017,20170827,1,4.16,"Not sure what all the hype is about. I waited 2 hours, got a dirty glass for my water, my omelette was so salty, I asked to order another item, and was still charged for the salty one I took 2 bites of. My waitress was bland, and didn't really seem to care about customer service. Will not be coming here again..."
8/28/2017,20170828,4,4.16,"Okay I tried this place again, and it was still chaotic, however, the food was much better prepared than my first visit. I'll go again soon just to try other menu items."
8/29/2017,20170829,3,4.16,"So a bulletpoint review to get to the gist.* It's Very Noisy!! so if you want to hear what your frienda are saying go someplace else* I felt rushed. The price of popularity?* If French toast is your jam, try the flight.* Loved the cheddar hashbrowns* Its expensive! We ordered an omellete, a benedict and split a toast flight plus coffee and side of biscuits. Our bill was 68...plus tip it was 80 total. Portions were good but these are dinner prices!Upshot, I probably wont go again. I like breakfast to be more chill and felt a little cranked for the price. Early Weekday morning is the best time to go for the curious."
8/29/2017,20170829,5,4.16,"Food was delicious per normal!! Just be prepared to wait anywhere between 45-1.5 hours or more for a table. Best thing it's BYOB and there's lots of cool spots nearby to pass the time (they will text you when your table ia almost ready so you can head back). My favorites are the cheesy hasbrowns, omelet specials, french toast flights and one of the girls got the steak omelet (which is a regular on the menu) and it was phenomenal!). Another got the banana waffle and it too is a regular and was SO good! You won't be disappointed, just be prepared for that wait. Lol"
8/30/2017,20170830,3,4.16,"I've been wanting to try this place forever but unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype for me. We went on a Tuesday around 1:30pm so we didn't have to wait at all, which is awesome considering the wait can be around 2 hours at times!My sisters and I split the French Toast flight and the shrimp scampi omelette - sweet and savory! The omelette was fluffy and made of just egg whites with melted cheese in the middle, topped with three jumbo shrimp, scampi sauce and some veggies on the side. It was good, but I would never pay $19 for that again. After all, it's an egg that's maybe $2/crate and three pieces of shrimp. I know you should never expect prices to be comparable to you making it yourself..that's what you pay for the whole restaurant experience, but this just wasn't worth it. The French Toast flight was good. I loved that it's offered so you get to try one of each of their flavors. However, I've had fluffier, bigger French Toast so this actually didn't compare. It was good, but not where I'd go for French Toast."
9/2/2017,20170902,4,4.16,"This was my first time visiting Batter & Berries and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. My cousin took me there for a birthday breakfast so I wasn't too sure of what to expect. The place is fairly small and does get really busy. There was a 50 min wait on a Saturday morning at 9am. I was told it gets crowded really fast. I like their reservation system. It's really easy! Our server came over and was really friendly. She told us about the specials on their menu which we both ordered from. The Shrimp Scampi Omelette was our choice & The French Toast Flight. The Shrimp Scampi Omelette was really good. The sauce that it was marinated in had such a delicious flavor. The only thing I would have omitted was the gouda cheese. The French Toast Flight was delightful as well. It came with Blueberry, Strawberry, Lemon, Carmel & Butter Cookie French Toast. My favorite was Strawberry & Carmel. The Butter Cookie didn't really do anything for me. All in all my experience at Batter & Berries was really pleasant. Only thing I couldn't stand is they had the music blasting in there. It was just so loud. You couldn't barely hear the person you're dining with."
9/3/2017,20170903,1,4.16,I was very disappointed with this restaurant because we waited an 1 hour and 40 min. Just to be seated and once we received the call that a table was ready they directed us to another seating area just to wait again. At this point we walked out.
9/3/2017,20170903,5,4.16,The chicken and waffles here would get 12 stars if I could give it! All around awesome restaurant and amazing food! I highly recommend!
9/4/2017,20170904,5,4.16,"I've been wanting to come here for some time....can't believe I waited this long!We got there and there were people waiting outside. We went in and put our phone number down and went back home. The wait was supposed to be 1 hr 10 min, but it was actually 45 minsWe ordered:- $3.25 bottomless coffee- $18 Cajun salmon Benedict (part of their monthly special)- $14 French toast Super Flight (this is their regular flight + monthly special toast)The staff was super friendly and our waiter was upbeat and a breath of fresh air!  Let's get into the food a bit more...- Super Flight: DELICIOUS!!! The lemon was my favorite. The apple pie was part of the monthly special and it was indeed SPECIAL. Each toast was so flavorful that syrup was not needed. They also put this butter on each toast and idk what it was but i wish I had an unlimited supply of this to use on every single breakfast meal - Cajun salmon Benedict: AMAZING. The salmon was tender but crisp on the outside and I can't even describe the cheese crusted hash browns..... OH and please get their home made hot sauce, it made the meal 5x more delicious Definitely coming back"
9/4/2017,20170904,4,4.16,"Lemon french toast was my fave. Definitely worth doing the French toast flight. Cute little place that's locally owned and super nice staff. We went on labor day Monday so wait time was only 25 min, but they had the check in system down smooth, and our food came out in less than 10 min. Liked all of the French toast, but the lemon was a must have!"
9/5/2017,20170905,4,4.16,"I was in Chicago for the first time this past Labor Day weekend and a coworker recommended we stop here! It was insanely packed and it's a pretty small restaurant. We were bummed to hear it would be a 2hr wait and we didn't have the time to wait around. Soo. We decided to order to go! I wished I would of had a sit down experience, but I still experienced some of the best French toast I have ever had! Lol! I ordered the flight(assortment of strawberry, lemon, blueberry, and caramel French toast) and sweet potato hash browns! The hash browns were okay, but I will be back to have the French toast!! I devoured the entire thing in about 7 mins lol. My favs were definitely the lemon and caramel! The menu was amazing, a little something for any mood you're in."
9/10/2017,20170910,4,4.16,"This was our 2nd visit to Batter & Berries and yes it was just as good as I recall! We were concerned about having enough time to enjoy ourselves as we were driving down from the suburbs and sitting in Cubs/ Bears traffic unsure if we would make it before the 3pm closing time.We arrived at 2pm and after a 25 min wait in the cutest/smallest waiting area ever...... We were seated! We were immediately greeted by Nadine who whispered her name to us because she was a little horse this afternoon. She knelt down and spoke to us explaining the specials of the day. I truly appreciated her attention to detail but had already decided on the Strawberry French Toast with a side of ham! My husband decided to try the blackened catfish with scrambled egg whites n veggies.... I know right ( we were out of control!) ok I was out of control but can I just tell you..........I mean, I don't think you can imagine the flavor, the luv, the homemade maple butter OH and if that's not enough, they have something called the ""French Toast Flight"" a sample of all the French toast flavors on one plate! Ok enough said check it out for yourselfDequria"
9/11/2017,20170911,1,4.16,"I was in town from LA and this place came highly recommended and I was excited to try it out. The French toast appetizer was excellent. My party asked from some aioli for our meal and they didn't have it, so we asked for mayo, and the waiter refused to provide it while subsequently making us feel like we were making a outlandish request (i.e. Asking what the mayo was for and saying that mayo does not go with that). This whole experience made my party feel very uncomfortable and judged. The attitude and behavior was unnecessary."
9/12/2017,20170912,3,4.16,"I went there because of all the hype surrounding the breakfast being super top shelf. The reason for the basic three star rating is because the pancakes were just average. Had I gone there for a menu item that wasn't a traditionally breakfast item I am certain I would have rated this place at least four stars. What would keep it from being a five star rating are a couple of things. First, this place should accept reservations only. It is a very tiny place that if you just show up, and I was alone, they are so packed that that they will take your info down and tell you to come back in 20 or more minutes. That is a problem since the only available parking is on the street and that is not free. Second, the place is very loud. I do want to give a shout out to my waitress Terrica, she was excellent in all the chaos that was this restaurant."
9/13/2017,20170913,5,4.16,"A friend and her children were in town and we were driving around looking for a place that would accommodate her ""not adventurous eaters."" I saw the awning and a nearby parking spot, so took a chance. We all enjoyed our meals, which even the 10-year-old recognized came out of the kitchen amazingly fast (the place was pretty busy with the lunch rush.) A special shout-out to server Tusiime, who was helpful, attentive, charming, and full of jokes and riddles that kept the kids engaged."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.16,"Everything that you have heard about this place is true:- Long wait times?: CHECK- Friendly staff?: CHECK- Cozy restaurant size?: CHECK- Great food?: CHECK- A ""Must Eat"" while in the Windy City?: CHECKI was visiting Chicago over Labor Day weekend and met a friend here for breakfast on that Friday morning: Still waited 30 minutes for a table. But, the staff were very welcoming and polite. The menu selection is varied enough to please many types of taste buds. (FYI: They're known for their French toast and the many different flavors they come up with.) And, our food cane out so quickly, you would've thought they knew what we were going to order BEFORE we ordered it and already had it prepared. It was worth the wait and was an enjoyable experience. Will definitely be on my ""Must Eat"" list each time I come to Chicago."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.16,"The wait is pretty worth it. For starters....the lady hostess was super sweet. She had me smiling, laughing, feeling good to walk in there and accept the 1hr wait. lol -They have a mini waiting area, where most people only used to wait for bathroom. They have 2 bathrooms both family (unisex). -Although busy they keep things running pretty smooth. Picking up un used plates from table. Re-filling coffee and waters. -They use a tablet to take down names, in which they ask for your number to txt you table is ready. It makes it very convenient with wait time they have, people can leave and come back. -Parking wasn't terrible. We were able to find parking fairly close and easy. -FOODI really appreciated the waiter asking if we had visited before. When I said no, she was pretty thorough with explaining the menu. Which was impressive to remember all she said with details. French toast flight - The best part of this is enjoying the different flavors all in one. Toppings is what makes the french toast. I had some pieces that were on the drier side while others were extremely soaked in batter which made them soggy and flat. None of this takes away the overall taste. ($11.50)Chuck-N-Goufre - This was my favorite of the 3. The sweet potatoe waffle had the perfect crunch. It had a favorable amount of all spice flavor. I was expecting a much more potato flavor and texture, however it wasn't really the case. But i'm not mad at the flavor lol. I thought it was extremely delicious nonetheless. The chicken piece also seemed to have one side not as crunchy or with much crust. Still tasted amazing! The drizzle pulled everything together. ($13.50)Omelette - The omelette we went with was part of their daily special omelette. ""shrimp scampi"". Very delicious as well. The scampi was great. I feel many scampi's tend to be on the saltier side which i'm personally not a huge fan of. The eggs were nice and fluffy (egg whites). The hash browns were also great. They added some of the scampi sauce as they cooked them so they had the crunch but not as dry as hash browns tend to be. ($18)Coffee ($3)"
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.16,"This place is all about yummy comfort food. They are friendly and it's so nice to see a diverse crowd gathered on one place, especially in Lincoln Park. I had the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle which is served with a hearty price of fried chicken. Their homemade butter is to die for and their cheesy hashbrowns are good.My friend had the Lemon French toast, which she enjoyed. I tasted it and while it was yummy, it was very sweet. It tasted like cake. The service is great and friendly. Our waiter, an actor who performs for children, was a hoot. He would come by every so often with a riddle."
9/16/2017,20170916,5,4.16,"Every single time I've come here the food and service has been incredible. I'm a sweet over savory type of girl, so I usually opt for the Super Flight of French Toast, which is totally to die for, and the surprise Special flavor French toast is always a great added bonus! But on the off chance that I opt for a savory brunch, that deconstructed steak omelet with the red wine sauce is my go to. Soooo delicious! Ive learned my lesson and avoid weekends. But this place is totally worth the wait!"
9/17/2017,20170917,5,4.16,"There's always a super long wait here and the place is a little small with tables packed in everywhere, but the food is amazing! I always end up coming back and loving everything I try. Recommend the deconstructed steak omelette!"
9/18/2017,20170918,5,4.16,"This place is great! I've only been once because the hours are a bit hard for me to make it to though. The environment is cozy! We got sat and served pretty quickly, and the food was totally delicious! I've been wanting to go back ....I follow the FB page and they post the yummiest photos."
9/24/2017,20170924,5,4.16,"Excellent food! Loved the waffles and chicken. French toast was excellent. If you want a mimosa with brunch, bring your champagne. They don't sell liquor but will provide a setup. Service was excellent too. Definitely a must, if you are visiting Chicago."
9/25/2017,20170925,5,4.16,"This is one of my favorite breakfast places! I just ate here with my boyfriend (it is brunch time on a Monday) and although it is the weekday they were still busy, but we got seated immediately. And once we placed our order, we got our food in literally 5 mins. It was as fast as ordering from McDonalds. We ordered the infamous chicken and waffles (the cluck and gaufre) their waffles aren't a traditional batter, it's sweet potato waffles - which yes sounds kinda crazy but it goes so well with their chicken that is drizzled with a specialty hot sauce they concocted.We also ordered their French toast flight which they are mostly known for and it features all their traditional toasts with their special of the month which was a chocolate amaretto. It looks overwhelming at first but once you start eating you will notice it is pretty light, not too heavy on the stomach.And then to even out all the sweetness we ordered cheesy hash browns.Delicious!! Highly suggest going here!"
9/26/2017,20170926,5,4.16,"I have had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. The staff is incredible; they feel like family. I have ordered several different things off their menu and enjoyed them all. My favorite was the lamb chop over hashbrowns. I definitely try to go during the week rather than the weekend because there is a wait, but that's expected when your food is delicious."
9/28/2017,20170928,3,4.16,"First time at this place and the food did not disappoint, however the customer service did. We could barely hear each other talk, let alone our waitress. Didn't even give us a minute to look over the menu and was already asking if we knew what we wanted. She did not smile once and her attitude was very poor. Wasn't for the food, I wouldn't consider going back for that reason alone."
9/29/2017,20170929,2,4.16,"Let me start by saying that I have recommended this place to anyone who will listen. I'm a server at a breakfast spot and B&B is by far my favorite and I am very passionate about breakfast. For a couple months I was taking a new person every weekend just to try it. I went there this week to meet up with friends after one of them got married. Neither of them had been here before so i was excited to bring them into the B&B family. The server was sweet, the food was quick and mostly delicious but unfortunately the lasting impression I had was how rushed we felt. I know it's a small place that usually gets on a wait every day of the week. As soon as we were done almost everything was cleared from our table including the water we were drinking. The bus boy just grabbed our glasses and put them on a tray next to our table so we grabbed them back and he just looked at us shaking his head like we were doing something wrong. He then came around again a little later to grab our glasses and I had to tell them we weren't done as he was reaching for them. I heard him talking to the other bus boys because I speak Spanish and it was just really disappointing. The 2 hosts kept looking over at us and the bus boys were at the stand looking over at us as well so it just became an uncomfortable situation where we didnt have a choice but hurry and get out. There was not a wait and there were empty tables around us, I wouldn't have tried holding up a table on a weekend, I know better. We brought champagne and ordered 6 meals for the 3 of us (I know) so between finishing all of that and talking, it did take us longer to leave. I checked when I got my text that our table was ready and when we left and it was about an hour and a half, so it's not like it was so crazy. It was unfortunate that when I saw my friends again this week, they only thing they talked to me about was how they wouldn't take anyone there because of how rushed they felt which is so sad because they didn't even remember how delicious the food was!! Anyway, there's my sad rant, food is amazing, don't go here though unless you're just in and out. There's a lot of breakfast spots I've ignored staying loyal to this one, so definitely time to start making my rounds elsewhere"
9/30/2017,20170930,5,4.16,The food was fabulous. Our server Nadine was extremely pleasant and helpful as we attempted to decide what to eat since there were so many enticing items to choose from.  I suggest that you get there early as the line formed promptly at 7:45 a.m. waiting on the doors to open at 8:00 a.m. today which is Saturday.Be sure to go and enjoy.
10/1/2017,20171001,3,4.16,"Sooo, the food is truly amazing. The service is also great. The wait? The wait makes this place overrated. They have been here for a long time & they have a hell of a following so I just can't understand why they haven't moved or expanded to accommodate their customer base. Once when dining there, I asked the owner that exact question. I was disappointed to find that he was a bit snarky, although I was actually paying him a compliment. Today, we waited almost 2 hours to be seated although they said it was a 30 minute wait. Once seated, the food came amazingly fast and it was delish. But the wait is obnoxious."
10/3/2017,20171003,5,4.16,"This place is amazing!!!!!From the moment I walked in I felt the love. The hostess was lovely and the manager was even better. This restaurant is BYOB which makes brunch even better. I went in by myself and quickly made friends with the staff and patrons around me, I even got half a bottle of wine from the group sitting next to me.My meal was amazing!! I would fly back to Chicago just to have brunch there one more time."
10/4/2017,20171004,2,4.16,"Not impressed. There was a wait for a 2 seat table, but it was super short, like 10 minutes. I had the French toast flight, and she had the vegetarian omelette. The food was decent, but the pricing, the seating/space, the service weren't up to the hype."
10/7/2017,20171007,5,4.16,"Batter & Berries is one of my favorite brunch spots! Pricing runs you around $11-30 for a meal, drink + tip. There is a few spots for street parking and always public transit. Always be prepared to wait at least 1.5-3 hours during prime breakfast/brunch times. Bringing a snack, looking at the menu and catching up family/friends always helps. There's a convenience store a block down the street, just in case you or someone in your party needs something to hold you over. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Food/Drinks: Everything I've had has been AMAZING. The French toast (crispy on the edges, soft in the center, melts in your mouth) is a restaurant staple and the lemon zest option has been my favorite choice, along side the homemade chicken sausage (savory + sweet) and the cheesy hash browns. It's BYOB, so don't be shy. They also provide orange juice.Service: The hostesses are extremely efficient, and the wait staff is quick and knowledgeable."
10/10/2017,20171010,4,4.16,I met a cousin there to eat. The food was sooo good. The wait to be seated was out the door .. at least 45 minute wait. It was worth it. I hope to go back soon.
10/12/2017,20171012,5,4.16,"EVERY time I'm in Chicago, this is my first stop straight from the airport! I've never been disappointed! I make it my business to take early flights, and bring my appetite! The homemade butter is THE BEST! No syrup is needed on your pancakes or waffles, JUST the butter. And I always walk for extra. Lmao. My hotel was almost an hour away from here, but I did not care! So..if you ever take a trip to Chicago, be sure to get your breakfast from here! You will not be disappointed!"
10/12/2017,20171012,5,4.16,Great place!! The food is amazing!! Took my girlfriend here last Sunday and I couldn't believe how flavorful everything is even the waffles. I'm impressed. The place was packed when we came! Good sign. Keep up the good work fellas!
10/14/2017,20171014,5,4.16,"Caramel French toast is ridic! Saturday is crowded and the wait is at least an hour. But, there isn't a better breakfast restaurant in Chicago."
10/15/2017,20171015,5,4.16,I've had nothing but excellent experiences here. The Arthur sandwich is amazing. There's usually a wait to be seated but it's definitely worth the wait.
10/16/2017,20171016,5,4.16,"This is one of the greatest breakfasts I have ever had. We went at 9:30 on a Friday and didn't have any trouble getting in, although Weekends I'm told can be VERY busy! First off, the service was impeccable. Our waiter charmed us with funny riddles, which I would usually find very annoying, but somehow found charming in this atmosphere. I had the buttermilk pancakes, which were only upstaged by the fresh berries and the maple butter. How do I begin to talk about the maple butter? It is phenomenal. It has the consistency of ice cream, and you will want to eat it out of a bowl! The location is great, and it's surrounded by a lot of other neat restaurants and shops. After your breakfast, I recommend checking out the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory."
10/16/2017,20171016,1,4.16,"This is what happens when you support BLACK OWNED business their employees treat you like sh*t.....On 10-15-2017 we visited again My 14 yr. old daughter loves this place but me on the other hand can not stand the rude hostesses that greet you when you first enter. So we visited yesterday arriving at 11:40 am. The rude hostess with the glasses on was on her cell phone and when we walked up she set the phone down hard and said rudely ""its a hour in a half wait."" as if my daughter and I interrupted her social media time on her cell phone. I said okay, she took my number for a ready text message with an attitude. The place was not even that crowded because they had 5 tables clean and available. So we went over to the waiting area and sat down. well i sat there until 12:15 pm when I asked the other hostess CeCe(i think about the 5 tables that were still empty. She said those were people before me. So again at 12:30 I am noticing now she is starting to sit customers even those who came in after us and checked in. I pay attention to everyone who enters an establishment due to recent events of shootings.at 12:43 pm I asked Cece and she said give her a minute. Cece came back about 1:00pm and said I have a table for you even though your full 90 minutes were not up...REALLY? I NEVER received a ready text message either after I just watched her sit others of a different races before me and my child especially since we had been waiting since 11:40 am. Then CeCe had the nerve to tell me ""for future reference you should wait outside even though its cold because you might get upset when people are seated before you( keep in my mind she never told the other people of other races this when she escorted them to the waiting area) maybe she was just rude to me because I am African American...I told her so you want me to wait outside in the cold with a child? AT that point I almost lost it. However, I had to keep my composure due to my daughter was hungry and really wanted the french toast. (CeCe really should be fired, I hate to see anyone loose their job but when you tell a Mother with a child they should wait outside in the cold, she lacks compassion and empathy for anyone.) I was seated at table #14 and the server was really nice and I asked for the manager who was George at the time. Well George never came to address my complaint about the hostesses. I have been to B&B on several occasions hoping that the owner Derek would get better hostesses in place but I guess this establishment only caters to certain other races besides African Americans and its owned by an African American...YEP, I SAID IT.....that's what I get for trying to support Black owned businesses. What is weird this incident happen exactly two years to the date of my last review on 11-15-15 and nothing has changed with this business and I will not be back."
10/17/2017,20171017,5,4.16,"Excited to say I was finally able to have brunch here without an extremely long wait. I've attempted numerous times and my impatience got the best of me.....I must say that those previous times the wait would have been worth it! From the service to the menu options, all of it was impeccable. It was busy for a weekday but the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I ordered the French Toast Flight and my oh my....was it a delight. I am extremely picky when it comes to French Toast since it's one of my favorite plates and this one made sure to give you a taste of 3 different kinds. Syrup isn't served but the butter that is provided is so good you could eat it by itself. Can't wait to go back here!"
10/22/2017,20171022,5,4.16,"The best chicken sausage I have ever had!!! They give big portions of the food, and that's a plus with me being from Texas we like everything big lolThe french toast sampler with all flavors is a must have. The Carmel and lemon where my fave so good and flavorful. I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Chicago again..."
10/23/2017,20171023,4,4.16,"My first time in Chicago and as soon as I got off the plane, I was taken to this place. They raved about the good, the people, the ambiance and indeed, it was true. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The music had me motivated and energized, mind you, it was 7:30am on a Saturday. And the food was delicious. I had a taste of their homemade sausage and it was pretty good. I ordered a sweet potato waffle and didn't realize it had nutmeg, so the taste was a bit overwhelming so early in the morning. I ate half of it, because it was very tasty with the chicken, hot sauce and berry butter. Nice combination. This is a great place to go out with friends for early morning fun."
10/27/2017,20171027,5,4.16,Phenomenal food matched only by the friendliness and hospitality of the staff. Really wonderful experience. Highly recommend. One of the best parts of my visit to Chicago. The riddles are also very fun. I got the Cajun salmon eggs Benedict and was very pleased.
10/28/2017,20171028,5,4.16,"Decided I needed to add this to my list of places on my Chicago vacation after seeing an IG post from a Hamilton cast member.I ordered the Cluck & Gravy - which was homemade biscuits w/ chicken sausage gravy and came with a side of eggs and coleslaw. I was NOT disappointed, my food was delicious. The chicken sausage was the best I've ever had.Service was great from hostess to runner and super friendly waitress."
10/28/2017,20171028,5,4.17,Love this place went here with my husband the other day. I actually found him here on yelp and decided to try them out. we will certainly be going back. I got the steak with eggs and hashbrowns. everything was amazing. my husband even stole some of my food lol. everyone that worked there was also amazing. our server also explained everything to us as well. you must try this place they have a great menu
10/29/2017,20171029,4,4.17,Great service. Nice vibe. BYOB approved. I had the jerk pork chop. It was very tasty. My friends ordered the crab benedict and the catfish. Both were underwhelmed but I think would try it again.
10/29/2017,20171029,4,4.16,Got the French toast flight. Did not care for the lemon or caramel. In fact the blueberry tasted more lemony.
10/29/2017,20171029,5,4.17,The French toast flight is a delight in the morning. Worth the wait and definitely worth the search for a parking spot. My fellow brunch mate and I had a good time with the busy atmosphere in there. The staff was warm. I'd visit again when I'm in Chicago
10/30/2017,20171030,5,4.17,The wait was excruciating but the food was well worth it. Byob is an awesome touch. The executive steak with Carmel French toast was delightful. The flavors did not overwhelm each at all and my Mimosa did not bland the flavor. I'll be back 4sure on a week day only
10/31/2017,20171031,5,4.17,"Ordered the executive since the table next to ours all ordered it: I figured it must be that good since they all had the same and I was right. My steak was cooked perfectly which was seasoned well and had a nice mushroom deduction on top. It came with eggs and cheesy hash browns which I got extra crispy (you will thank me later). Everything was Delish and I killed all of it. The hubby got the ""goof"" aka chicken and waffles, which is a batter chicken breast on top of a sweet potato waffle served with maple butter and hot sauce. He enjoyed it order so much he didn't even want to share. A friend of mine got the salmon cake Benedict which had a generous amount to salmon. Oh and it's BYOB so remember to bring ur favorite alcoholic beverage to accompany that Delish food you without a corkage fee..."
11/2/2017,20171102,5,4.17,"I really really like Batter & Berries. People complain about it small but I don't mind. You don't want it to get so big and watered down. I like the decor. Hate the location because it's a far ride from the burbs and it's ALWAYS crowded but the food is so good. Every time I go, no matter with whom, we get the French toast flight...always yummy. The last time I went, I tried the shrimp scampi deconstructed omelette. O-M-G...It was delicious. The omelette was huge! With Gouda cheese and was topped with asparagus, jumbo shrimp, and a scampi sauce. I got the cheesy hash browns to accompany. AMAZING. Of course it was so big that I couldn't finish it. My friend tried their The Arthur, chicken sandwich. That was great as well. We couldn't finish any of our food because the portions were big. The prices were decent so you really got a good amount of food for what you pay. The service is always good. I hate that they don't take reservations but I get It. Holding tables for late people will hold up the wait times...which are already long enough. Anyway, besides that, the service is great. The wait staff is always polite and the owners are never shy about coming to speak to their patrons. I'll continue to visit because this place is genuinely good. The menu is always changing, outside of their staple dishes. Definite must try if you haven't. Just get a small snack before you go so you don't starve. I've never waited less than 45 minutes and have had longer times for people that came in after me. Don't forget it's BYOB! So stop and get that bottle of champagne for mimosas...they'll provide the juice."
11/3/2017,20171103,5,4.17,"I recommend this place for anyone that is seeking a GREAT brunch/breakfast spot. I've been to a variety of brunch spots around the Lakeview/Lincoln Park area, and this one is by far my favorite. The staff are extremely friendly, attentive, and outgoing! The food is absolutely amazing - I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.Cons: It is a VERY popular brunch spot (for reasons listed above), so it is PACKED. It's also small, so it gets packed fast. However, I only had to wait 15 minutes for getting a table when I arrived a little before 10am on a Sunday with party of 4. If you get there around noon on a weekend, it's probably going to be a 2+ hour wait. During the week, obviously never crowded in the early AM - again, servers are super fast.I highly recommend the French Toast Flight to share in a group (or get by yourself - no judgement). I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but that flight is mouthwatering. They usually have good specials that vary! For example, I've gotten a crab egg-white omelette on the specials list before that was unique and also very, very good. It's a big portion too - definitely get it with the cheesy hash browns wowow. They do a good job of branching out from their (already awesome) menu.Will definitely be coming back here in the future, this place is just a genuinely good, wholesome brunch spot that everyone should have the chance to go to. One of my favorites for sure!"
11/3/2017,20171103,5,4.17,"Every thing I've ever eaten here from the French toast (all flavors) to the jerk shrimp omelette, to the cheesy hash browns to the salmon or crab Benedict to the hot sauce oooooohhhhh the hot sauce... everything I've ever eaten here has given me a mouthgasm. I've been here at least 10 times and am always satisfied with the service and food. Well worth the wait! If you go on week day or in the second half of the day there is much less of a wait."
11/3/2017,20171103,3,4.17,We got a super flight and chicken and gravy. The French toast was good and the maple butter is definitely sweet! The staff was GREAT! Reminded me of home in New Orleans. The food was good and came out FAST (like less than 5 minutes after we ordered) but ultimately it was too sweet and left us feeling gross and a little sick the rest of the day. But if you are craving a sweet breakfast and don't mind it-- this is your place. I would order something savory to go with your meal. Also the regular coffee was okay. Not worth the price.
11/4/2017,20171104,4,4.17,"Batter & Berries was highly recommend and it did not disappoint! There was a hour and 45min wait but the food was well worth it and came out quickly and hot ! We ordered the crab cake omelette with cheesy hash-browns, and pancakes ! So YUM!! The staff was also nice and friendly. If your looking for some good brunch come here !"
11/4/2017,20171104,1,4.17,Bad service and cold food. Need I say more. Will not be back. There are much better choices in Chicago for breakfast
11/4/2017,20171104,4,4.17,"This restaurant has some of the best waffles and pancakes I have ever had. They take simple food and make it special...even eating a breakfast sandwich there is a delightful dining experience. It's crowded so time your visit. It is also a small storefront shop so when it's cold out and you're sitting too close to the door, you feel the drafts. That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. If not for this one flaw, I would have given it 7 if I could."
11/4/2017,20171104,5,4.17,One of the best breakfast places in the city! They have a very unique menu and everything looked delicious! My husband and I went there last month and can't wait to go back again.
11/5/2017,20171105,5,4.17,"I've been here many times however, this is my first review. The food is always good, make sure you try the Superflight. It's French toast in a variety of flavors. My favorite is the lemon and the caramel toast. Don't be late because the wait could be 2 hours or more. Sitting is tight and place is small but well worth it. Will be back soon."
11/5/2017,20171105,5,4.17,"This place is incredible!!!! So we arrived at this cozy restaurant tucked away on a busy street. They told us the wait would be around 1 hr and 45 minutes. But they take your number so they can text you when your table is ready. We went to get our nails done while we waited. The phone rang and texted when our table was ready. We were immediately seated. The service was great!! Soon as we ordered the food was ready in about 10 minutes. The food was soooo good. I had the flight of French toast which included one of each: blueberry, strawberry, lemon, and caramel. I am usually not a fan of blueberry so I started there. Every single one was better than the last. I was absolutely amazed about how luxurious every bite tasted. I was so mad by the end of the meal because it was over. The food was incredible. I also tried the hash browns because I was being gluttonous and they were great. Make sure you try the hot sauce! I don't even like hot sauce, but I enjoyed the flavor! Highly recommended! Worth the wait!!!"
11/6/2017,20171106,1,4.16,"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and had the day off and made the trek. When I walked in I was told it would be a 10-15 min wait for a table for two. Not a problem, as my friend hadn't arrived yet. Sat down in their waiting area. Lots of empty tables in the restaurant. A couple walked in 4 min after me and were told it was a 10-15 min wait also. They sat down in the waiting area also. 1 minute later the hostess came over and told them that a table was now available. It was a table that was empty since I walked in. I inquired as to why they got the table when I came in first, and was told it is policy that my whole party had to be here. Again, at least 10 open tables were available. I asked to speak to the manager. He reiterated the policy. I told him that I'd happily pay for 2 meals if my friend didn't show up. He refused and went to explain that they don't even allow ""add-on's"", meaning if a party of 2 is sitting at a four person table, a 3rd person can't join them. Seems silly because it's another person buying a meal in a seat that's empty. He was pretentious and lacked the customer service skills you would expect from this establishment. I could of easily been appeased by just apologizing for the policy and perhaps offering me a cup of coffee while I waited??? But instead he behaved like I should thank him for allowing me to be in the presence of such breakfast food. I walked out. Again, there were plenty of empty tables."
11/6/2017,20171106,5,4.17,This place is AWESOME. Try the egg white Crab Omelet and flight french toast. It's BYOB so you can't mess this up!  The homemade hot sauce is to die for.
11/6/2017,20171106,4,4.17,"I had the chicken and waffle it was pretty good . The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. I did however find the place to be overly crowded, loud and a little on the expensive side. Overall I enjoyed myself and I would recommend everyone try the place out."
11/7/2017,20171107,3,4.16,"I thought this place was pretty average. I had high hopes after reading a ton of the reviews and always noticing an extensive wait time. I had their flight French toast with cheesy hash and came away saying ""meh.""Hashbrowns didn't have any kind of original flavor to me at all. French toast was solid but kinda tasted like it had just been warmed up in a microwave. Will probably give this place another try, but won't go out of my way for it again"
11/7/2017,20171107,5,4.17,"Batter and Berries is a cute neighborhood shop with enthusiastic and overly helpful staff. After seated, I was greeted by nearly every member of the staff and one even opened with a cute riddle. I ordered a double espresso and the chicken and waffles. The espresso was made well and the chicken and sweet and savory waffles and the spicy chicken provided perfect comfort on a chilly fall morning. I would definitely recommend this place for anybody looking to eat a hearty breakfast in a small neighborhood setting."
11/7/2017,20171107,4,4.16,This is a good spot! They have a nice variety of items on the menu and the waitstaff was madd cool. I had the sweet potato waffle and chicken dish and my shawty had the buttermilk pancakes and chicken sausage. My dish was a lil too sweet for me but I can see why folks dig it. The pancakes were on point and the chicken sausage was bangin too. I'd definitely come back here while in the Chi. I was surprised to see it as crowded(45 min wait) as it was on a non holiday Friday but that is testament to the good food and good vibes in the place. Go check it out!
11/7/2017,20171107,4,4.16,"In Chicago on a quick weekend trip, and was looking for a place to brunch, came across this gem! I agree with the rave reviews! Food was delicious, service was super friendly, and swift. It gets packs, but they seat guests pretty quickly. I will definitely return next time I'm in town."
11/7/2017,20171107,5,4.17,"I been eyeing this breakfast spot on IG months before we went to Chicago. Once I had the opportunity to go, I knew this was going to be the first place I touch once we land. On Saturdays the wait time can be pretty long but it's worth it! We waited an hour & 45 minutes before we were finally texted that our table was ready. I had the French toast flight with chicken sausage, eggs and the cheesy hashbrowns. My husband had the same and my daughter had the kids pancakes. We all agreed that it was well worth the wait!! Nice atmosphere and our waiter was amazing! So friendly and happy to be of service! We will definitely visit this establishment again when we go back to Chicago after the weather breaks! If you like mimosas, you're more than welcome to bring your own bottle. The restaurant will provide the orange juice."
11/8/2017,20171108,1,4.16,"I was super excited to eat at this place, but the hostess was horrible! We were three people in total and the 4th was about 5-7 minutes from arriving. There was no wait, no lines, no crowd as it was a weekday. We were three and would have been easily accommodated at a table for 4, and the hostess made us wait, right in front of an empty table for 15 minutes for nothing. We were super hungry and were ready to order as well for 4 people as well but were turned down after asking multiple times for a table. I can totally understand wanting to have the whole party at the restaurant if it's crowded or there are people waiting. This was very unnecessary and the hostess was not courteous at all. Not coming again, even though the food is good and our waitress was awesome too."
11/9/2017,20171109,5,4.16,BYOB with no corkage fee! Delicious French toast! What more could you ask for. Food:Flight of French Toast: 5/5. Delicious! The homemade butter that comes with it was amazing. Cluck N Gayfre: 5/5. Such juicy fried chicken on top of sweet potato waffle. Get the cranberry OJ to pair with your prosecco :)Ambiance: We arrived at 8am prior to opening on a Monday. Come 8:30am... the place was almost packed!!! Crazy! I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend. Service: Very attentive and so pleasant!Great place for a byob brunch.Edit:// been here post night shift 3x in a month. Highly recommend.
11/10/2017,20171110,5,4.16,"Delicious place for breakfast. I had the french toast flight because that's what they are known for. It was awesome. I liked the lemon french toast the best though and would probably just order that next time. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles. He LOVED it. It was one of the best that he has eaten. Great place. Small and loud though, but it is worth it."
11/14/2017,20171114,5,4.16,"I don't even know where to start. We arrived in Chicago at 9 on a Sunday. By 11 we pulled up to Batter and Berries. After an hour and 20 minute wait (spent at Starbucks), we were seated. Everything was fantastic. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating. The food was just as good as everyone says. We ordered the French toast flight; all the flavors were good, but the lemon and caramel were our favorites. We also ordered the chicken and waffle; the chicken was spectacularly seasoned and the house-made hot sauce was devine. The fries had fresh herbs, which was a nice touch. My bestie ordered a hot chocolate, which was almost too pretty to drink. Oh yea, and we got our food about 5 minutes after ordering it. All in all - we'll definitely be back every time we're in Chicago!"
11/14/2017,20171114,1,4.16,"This is the Worst restaurant I've ever been to.  I never write reviews but this restaurant has the worst host and Gross Food!  The host has some bi-polar issues going on.  When I first walked in the restaurant she greeted me with a smile and she treated me like I was her best friend.  An 1hr later when I went up to her to ask how much of a wait I had left on the list, she got all crazy and rude.  Never the less, my friend and I decided to stay and try the food.  But, I sure regret staying. Our server was awful.  He was touching us in the shoulders like  he knew us and then he dissappeared to socialize with the bigger tables.  My food arrived and I had no idea what was on my plate because he was no where to be found.  I had to ask another server for help.   Coffee was bitter, orange juice was too sour and the food was terrible.  We've ordered scrambled eggs and they were loaded with butter. The chicken and waffles was distasteful.  The maple syrup pancakes were loaded with sugar.  We left most of our food.  I will Not recomend anyone to eat here.  Food is terrible and unhealthy.  My server was awful. If you want to get a heart attack go ahead and eat here. But, if you want real food go anywhere else."
11/16/2017,20171116,4,4.16,"Cheers to finding a great breakfast spot!! My friend and I will always challenge ourselves to branch out and try new breakfast joints around the city, but most of them are mediocre, underwhelming, and/or unmemorable. BUT NOT BATTER & BERRIES!Be prepared to wait. We left our number with the hostess, and received a text when our table was ready. There isn't much of a waiting area (a couple benches awkwardly located in the middle of the cafe, but these are usually already taken up), but you could walk to the nearby 7-11 (there's 2 of them), and pick up a bottle of bubbly because there isn't a corkage fee, but you'd have to purchase the OJ from the cafe.Glancing at the menu, the cheesy hashbrowns automatically caught my eye. The french toast platters are clearly the best sellers, and heavily pushed by the waitstaff. I'm not a sweets person, so I opted for the spinach mushroom omelette. My friend got the lemon french toast. If you're indecisive, they do offer a french toast flight - a tasting of 4 different flavors. There's also a chicken and waffle plate that was featured on ""Check, Please"". My omelette was just ok. They're deconstructed, I'm assuming, because it's quicker for the kitchen to spit out the plain omelettes and then throw on the different toppings. Our dishes came out so quickly. My friend loved her french toast and rated it her favorite, ever. She even did a little dance to accompany her satisfaction with the first bite, and a waiter nearly laughed and pointed out that he sees that ""first bite dance"" a few times a day.I'd like to go when I'm in a sweets mood, and maybe even convince myself to try the chicken & waffle dish. I wish they'd up their game with their omelettes and savory dishes. Also, don't plan on lingering because it's a sit-eat-go type of place. It's waaaaay to busy to take it slow. Get there early and beat the church crowd on Sundays!"
11/17/2017,20171117,5,4.16,"The most amazing food but my server Tusiime was phenomenal. Well versed on the food served, and kept his entire section bought into him. This review could easily be more about him than the food. Definitely will return and highly recommended!"
11/19/2017,20171119,5,4.16,"Place was amazing! I'm visiting Chicago and a local recommended this place. It was so worth it! When I arrived I heard there was a 2-hour wait, but someone identified that I was alone and sat me down immediately (so thankful because I'm on a time crunch and have to go check out of my hotel). The wait staff was quick and very attentive. I ordered the super flight of French toast. It was amazing!!! I was in and out quickly. My water glass stayed full. I'm impressed all the way around. Was a great place to eat because of the food, atmosphere, and people. Glad I was able to experience it."
11/20/2017,20171120,4,4.16,"Whenever I'm craving French Toast, this place usually hits the spot. Flights are top-notch. Wish I could deliberate further on their menu, but that's pretty much all I come here for. Yes, there's usually a wait. But, if you have the time, this place is definitely worth checking out."
11/22/2017,20171122,5,4.16,"The staff was extremely welcoming as soon as we walked in and put our names on the list. They're a very busy popular restaurant so the wait was 45 minutes to an hour but boy was it worth it!! They had specials and are very informative on the menu, we even met the new chef as he was walking around talking to tables. We had an enjoyable experience and while waiting there's so many things to do around the area to make it not even feel like you're wait. It is BYOB, there is a 7 Eleven nearby."
11/24/2017,20171124,5,4.16,This place reminds me of home. In Northern CA there is a place called Bacon & Butter. They have the best hands down eclectic menu ever. Well Batter & Berries just got a new foodie. I love when chefs are allowed to create and share their food ideas. This place is a winner.
11/25/2017,20171125,5,4.17,I had a sweet potato waffle stuffed with fried chicken and a chicken breast on the side with their homemade hot sauce designed to go with the dish very good. My husband had a scallop omelet which was ridiculously delicious. They made special hash brown potatoes encrusted with the Assagio cheese to go along with it and their homemade chicken sausage gravy and three large scallops. The flavors were undeniably incredible. Their flavors are very close if not better than New Orleans. A must go and experience!
11/25/2017,20171125,4,4.17,"They don't take reservations so my friend and I took a chance and went there on a Tuesday around noon. It was packed but the wait was less than 5 minutes for us. I was originally going to order the Blueberry French Toast but when the server mentioned they had a flight, I decided to order that so that I could try all of them and order my favorite for next time! And I'm glad that I did that because the Blueberry French Toast was my least favorite. I really liked the Caramel French Toast and Strawberry French Toast...if I had to choose between the two, I'd most likely order the Strawberry French Toast on my second visit here. The chicken sausage was just ok, I wouldn't order it again.Our server was entertaining, giving us riddles to figure out throughout the meal. That stood out to me since it's unusual. And the riddles were tricky too. The only complaint I have is the noise level; a bit too loud but it was bearable for the meal. I look forward to my second visit to Batter and Berries!"
11/25/2017,20171125,1,4.16,I don't recommend this place . I was looking for a place to eat and saw that the food looked really good and saw that the reviews were good . When I got there was totally mind blowed how rude the sitting hosts was to me . Every time I asked her a question she would give me an attitude. At first I thought like maybe it was me . But no it was every time . We didn't even eat there after already waiting 30 mins . I was very upset of how the host was being so rude I understand you might be overwhelmed but I think she should be more nice even more so if your the first person that people interact when you come into the restaurant.
11/26/2017,20171126,5,4.16,"Their french toast is the best I have ever had, and it is not even close. They also have good savory options like their deconstructed omelettes, along with their homemade hot sauce. Their staff is also attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and have very good throughput, keeping wait times to a minimum. I'd still advise getting there before 9, because so many people come to have their food. I have been there a couple times now, and only regret not going sooner."
11/26/2017,20171126,5,4.16,Where do I start? Well let me start with the best part the food. My son had the caramel French toast with the chicken sausage and the hash browns with cheese. It was mouth watering good. I had the sweet potato waffle and chicken. I'm going to say that I did not like my Waffle at all. I am not a waffle guy. But that French toast that my son had was so delicious. The chicken sausages were so good that we ordered another order. They were actually made in-house into patties. We had to wait about 75 minutes to get in because the place was just crowded all the time. The people there were very nice and they brought their own bottle. I'm going to say definitely go here. The worst part of the day what's the wait time.
11/26/2017,20171126,3,4.16,"Sooo, 2 years ago I would have given this place 4.5 stars but my visit today was disappointing. I ordered lemon French toast and a fried chicken breast. My friend ordered the caramel French toast and a fried chicken breast. We also ordered the crab omelet with cheesy hashbrowns. Welp, none of it was hot when served. None. Of. It. The lemon French toast was flavorful dotted with fresh lemon shavings, candied pecans, maple butter, and powdered sugar. Crisp outside and moist on the inside. The fried chicken breast was almost crisp ans flavored with too much poultry seasoning. The crab omelet eas all egg whites, spinach, tomatoes and confetti peppers. It was topped with a crab that was better than canned but added no excitement to the dish. The peppers were crunchy and the omelet was wet. Nor sure I will be back. Too many other choices wirh consistent service to be disappointed. The staff are GREAT!"
11/27/2017,20171127,5,4.16,"Exceptional food, great service, funny servers and hella long lines, i mean without the long wait which cause more starvation, you wouldn't enjoy it and the places would be just normal. Being out of the ordinary is a key. I'm not from chicago but I visit often so I will deff will be back when I'm in the area."
11/29/2017,20171129,4,4.16,"I am a major brunch fan and it is always a pleasure to find one that I wouldn't mind becoming a regular :) Batter and Berries is an excellent stop for breakfast/brunch, especially if you are a French toast fan. My friend had the Flight and stated that it was THE best French toast that she has had in her life, which is huge for someone who loves French toast! I had the Salmon Benedict special, which was tasty, but I felt was a bit overpriced. However, I found the customer service and ambiance of the place the best part of the meal. I was not only entertained by the friendly waiters, but I also enjoyed the bright artwork splattered throughout the restaurant. I would recommend checking out this place on weekday mornings if you are not a fan of crowds. There was no wait when we arrived on a Tuesday morning :) If you are in the mood for a BERRY fabulous brunch, check this joint out!"
12/2/2017,20171202,5,4.16,Favorite bkfst place in Chicago. Love the Chicken & Waffles. Crab Spinach Omletter are superb. The staff is super friendly. Get there early it gets crowded. & you can get some sparkly at 7/11 on corner & make your own Mimosa
12/2/2017,20171202,5,4.17,"You walk in and out your name down, it's a little over an hour wait, but don't worry. You give them your phone number and they text you when they are ready for you. In the meantime, walk down the street to a bar and have ah beer or two. When you get that text it's an exciting time. Walk in and you get your table and order. It is byob so bring some champagne and they will provide the OJ. By the time you finish your first glass your French toast order is already coming to the table. Get the French toast flight, I swear you won't regret it. Take your time in between each piece of toast and really savor it. It is the best damn breakfast you will ever have. Not just table slapping good, it's take that table and throw it out the window good! Don't worry about eating the French toast too fast, they'll let you sit there a moment and finish that bottle of Andre you brought. You leave in a haze because you couldn't expect anything to taste so damn good. I would give this place a 10 stars out of 5 because there are no rules about how good this place is. mmmmmmMMMMMM!!!"
12/3/2017,20171203,4,4.16,"I really like the food in this place. They are very attentive and fast with the service. The wait time is about an hour sometimes longer, but it's worth it. I will highly recommend this place. I would have given it four and a half Stars."
12/9/2017,20171209,4,4.16,"The food is just normal and good, but the staff is exceptional. Everyone was friendly, from the hostess to the servers to the cleanup crew. Always kept our drinks full and the food was delivered quickly. We got the strawberry French toast with scrambled eggs and the green city omelette. The food was good, nothing extraordinary. If you are looking for a quiet meal this is not your place. Community seating and the volume level is extremely noisy. All in all a good experience."
12/9/2017,20171209,4,4.16,"The service is excellent, We had a French toast and green omelette. There is nothing special test for food. Everything is just simple. It is very loud inside the restaurant and there is community seating. A good experience overall."
12/10/2017,20171210,4,4.16,"It was my first time visiting here and it won't be my last. Very small restaurant and you can't be afraid of people, there's a chance you may have to sit with others! The service is great & the food was good. My only complaint is that the waffle was a tad dry. The hash browns and chicken were seasoned really well. My. Boyfriend had the steak and eggs and his steak was cooked just right. I wish they served cocktails during the brunch...."
12/10/2017,20171210,5,4.17,I decided to change the reading on this place. Although it's already very good I'm going to give it excellent. Every time I saw you come in here with me we have the best experience. The way staff is very attentive. Our experience is always so positive that we come here every week now on Sunday. I suggest you get out and try the best caramel French toast you've ever had. Oh yeah don't forget the chicken sausage. It's delicious. You're going to love the Ambiance as well. The only down to this review is that you have to wait at least 80 minutes or more.
12/10/2017,20171210,5,4.17,"During a quick stay in Chicago for a conference and then with my friends, I doubted how great this place must be. I mean, how many variations on French toast can you really offer, and how much better can it be than the standard. Man, was I wrong. I ordered the brisket hash and threw in a blueberry French toast for good measure. The hash was great, but that blueberry French toast... let's just say I'm still thinking about it.We got to Batter and Berries just ahead of the bigger crush of people (Saturday around 9:30) and waited 30 minutes. It was worth the wait.Finally, the best places are led and run by the best people. That can make or break a meal experience. Nadine took care of us. She was warm, funny, and thoughtful, impressively checking in with us here and there even in the midst of a packed house. More places should have people like her."
12/11/2017,20171211,5,4.17,"If there is any place that is worth the long lines and wait time, this would be it. Amazing spot for brunch- the French toast flight is something I can devour all day everyday. My friends have tried their crab cakes, Benedict, chicken and waffles- nothing anyone has eaten here has ever been short of just great. Also, cherry on top of the cake is that it is a black owned business!!! This chef has all of my tastebuds mesmerized and has my whole hearted support."
12/11/2017,20171211,1,4.16,"First time I dissatisfied with the food and the service. Hopefully I can create my own version of the lemon French toast...don't think my trip from Indiana was worth it today. When we entered we were assured that the owner was the same it's just a new cook. (That should've been my red flag). There was a slight difference in the food but no major except for my potatoes. Instead of a steamy, gooey, hot pile of hash browns; I received a cold over cooked glob of stiff potatoes. I alerted the manager he offered to have them recooked. By the time I received them my food was gone...they were better but I asked them to be removed because I wasn't going to eat them. The waitress said possibly not and shrugs her shoulder to return from speaking to the same manager who assured us everything was the same to say no...would you like a box. The manager never came to acknowledge the issue. I'll keep my lil $20 holla..."
12/12/2017,20171212,5,4.16,"Sooooo good. And that they are BYOB makes it so much more amazing. You just end up buying juice there and they will bring you glasses so you can make your own mimosas. It does get very packed in the morning but my expected wait of 25 mins at 10AM ended up being only 15mins. The one negative is that you can feel the freezing wind any time someone opens the front door during winter. If you can, ask to sit further in the back. For a busy and packed place, the service was pretty awesome which I always appreciate. My friend and I split the special that day, Scallop Gratin and the French Toast Flight. Both were delicious dishes that I would highly recommend."
12/12/2017,20171212,5,4.17,"Not only was the food sweet and savory as naturally I went for something of what seemed of their specialty and what sets them apart however, the service from start to finish mirrored the same quality. Hostess, server, and staff who fought our our food were the genuine that you hope to encounter everywhere. Thanks guys!"
12/14/2017,20171214,3,4.16,"I thought this place was good.This was listed as one of the most popular spots to visit for breakfast/brunch in Chicago...while I thought it was good, it wasn't so different from a typical breakfast spot one would go to anywhere. They are known for their french toast and I got their ""flight"", which includes three flavors. I also had scrambled eggs to go with it and I enjoyed the meal. The service was friendly and attentive. The ambiance is casual and perfect for families. I'd read that this place is so popular that there are long lines on a Saturday or Sunday...I was here on a Friday morning and while the place was busy, there was no line and I was immediately seated.I'd say this place is worth checking out if you're a fan of french toast and breakfast fare. Go during the week since I don't think it's worth a long wait in line."
12/14/2017,20171214,5,4.17,I loved everything about my experience here. We had the special crab omelette and the French toast flight. Both were delicious!! The staff was friendly and upbeat. The atmosphere was fun and lively. We were in and out quickly but not at all rushed. Would definitely recommend!
12/17/2017,20171217,5,4.17,"Crowded, but worth it because the food is really good. I had the apple cinnamon waffle with cheesy hash browns and it was very fresh and tasty. Great quality ingredients and that homemade hot sauce is amazing!I was solo so I got seated fairly fast, but possibly expect a small wait--especially on weekends--because this place is popular. It is also loud and lively, full of folks enjoying life and mimosas! Definitely check it out...you won't be disappointed!"
12/17/2017,20171217,1,4.16,"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place because of all the ""hype"" around it. We got seated right away and were greeted by our waitress, Terrica. She told us the specials (there were about 4.. way too many) and proceeded to read off 5-6 other items on the menu in great detail.. way too long of an intro. Couldn't even take the time to look over the menu. I ordered the breakfast wrap and a side of cheesy hash browns, and my boyfriend got the sweet potato waffle with chicken- as this was one of the waitress' suggestions.Food didn't take long. However, when my boyfriend asked for some syrup for his waffle, Terrica essentially told him no and said ""spread that maple butter alllll around and take a bite of everything together.. you won't need the syrup"" and pointed down at his food practically touching it! (Ew) She proceeded to stand there as if she wanted him to eat it in front of her. He said ""ok ... I'll try it"" upset that she wouldn't just get him the syrup he asked for. She came back a few moments later and asked if he still wanted syrup. He said yes ... of course he does. Why couldn't she have just gotten it in the first place? My wrap was bland- no flavor. Hash-browns (even though they had cheese) were flavorless and way too greasy. My boyfriends waffle and chicken was bland as well - nothing special.We were really confused as to why the hype was so big for this place. Service wasn't great and food was flavorless and overpriced for what it is. Highly disappointed :("
12/18/2017,20171218,1,4.16,"We went to this restaurant off of the recommendation of 2 people, however, I can't think of a single thing I liked about it. We ordered the chicken and waffles (a sweet potato waffle), and it just tasted bad. It was sort of gritty and chalky tasting. The chicken was just ok but definitely nothing to write home about. The service was good until the end when the man busing the table came to collect everything off the table (with our drinks slushing everywhere) and his arms were reaching past our faces, while we were still sitting there conversing while waiting to pay. Busing usually happens after people leave so that was very rude. I'm pretty disappointed after spending so much to uber there. This place is wack!"
12/18/2017,20171218,5,4.16,I am happy to say that the hour long wait on a Sunday afternoon was very worth! The flight of French Toast was more than delicious. Also their cheesy hash browns was something I have never had and they were super yummy! Batters and Berries has a mix of unique and traditional breakfast items. But what really made this please worth the wait was the great service! Thank you Mr. Tusiime for your great service and catchy riddles. I'll be back soon.
12/18/2017,20171218,4,4.16,"This is a super popular brunch spot, went here on a Saturday and the wait was an hour and twenty minutes which was a bit ridiculous, but it was all good. The wait might have been long, but once we were seated, we ordered right away and got our food 20 min later which was surprisingly quick. The food was good but don't know if I would try going back on a weekend. Would recommend the deconstructed chicken fajita though!"
12/19/2017,20171219,5,4.16,Wow! Amazing food and the best customer service ever! I highly recommend it! The cheesy hash browns are completely incredible!
12/21/2017,20171221,1,4.16,"Overrated to the fullest degree, not to be rude but they should change the name to ""Bubble Guts & BooBoo"". I have a pet peeve with my waiter telling me how I should eat my breakfast. Don't tell me I don't need syrup for your dry and undercooked pancakes. The bacon was saturated in Morton salt and the orange juice taste store bought. I would assume a place that prides itself on presentation would find a better solution to store bought Orange Juice. I literally wasted a 40 min drive for breakfast that was sub par compared to IHOP or Wild Berry..."
12/22/2017,20171222,3,4.16,"Ridiculously long wait times on the weekend! Stay close because I didn't receive a text message when it was almost time to be seated. Luckily we came back in time! The space is very small and there's really nowhere to wait inside. 8-10 people can sit in their designated waiting space comfortably. A lot of us were lined up against the wall where there's a lot of traffic back and forth to the kitchen. Very hectic and a little stressful since their coming back and forth hot plates, etc. Presentation was spot on. A little pricey for the portions. My friend and I wanted to try a little bit of everything so, we split the salmon benny and French toast flights. The pecan French toast was really good. We were a little disappointed to find that our egg was over cooked but overall, all of the flavors went together well. And the hash browns were amazing!"
12/22/2017,20171222,5,4.16,"I've been maybe three and the move is definitely to split dishes with friends and try a bit of everything. I've had on the menu is delicious--the french toast flight is a highlight. There will almost certainly be a wait because this place is so popular, but it's well worth it. The fact that there can be a 90-minute wait at 11am on a random Monday says something about this place."

12/23/2017,20171223,3,4.16,"We had the chicken and waffles on a Thursday morning. We were quickly seated and our server refilled our water frequently. The food was average, not as exceptional as advertised. The waffles were made with sweet potatoes and bites of left-over fried chicken--the result was a waffle that tasted like raisin bran cereal. The chicken, however, was cooked perfectly and seasoned with a nice buffalo-esque sauce with nutmeg. Everything was okay, but not exceptional."
12/23/2017,20171223,5,4.16,Their cajun salmon benedict and crab omelet were delicious. The spicy salmon had just the right amount of kick and eggs were perfectly cooked. Our lovely server brought their homemade hot sauce to sample. I loved pouring it over cheesy hash browns. Crab omelet portion was good. Their cheesy hash browns were terrific and portions were absolutely ridiculous! Gingerbread french toast was the special of the day with beautiful cinnamon seasoning without being overly sweet. Service was excellent -- their staff are very welcoming. The atmosphere is loud and crowded so be prepared for a one hour wait on weekends.

12/25/2017,20171225,5,4.16,"1. I like my ""French Toast"" a little more eggy but my daughters don't. They liked these as is. The varied flavors were divine and totally made up for the decreased egg & milk soaked bread that I am used to. 2. Portion size is generous. The traditional was split 3 ways. We did order an extra egg side dish. In addition, we had 2 super flights & 1 strawberry French toast. 3. The hot chocolate was cute to look at and it was demolished in no time. 4. We arrived at 7:45 and waited in the car until opening. By the time we left, all the tables were filled. 5. It is loud, the servers are good natured and humorous. I don't eat salt and they fixed my dishes without salt. Our bill was about 70$, All in all, we will be coming back. No complaints."

It was so delicious and worth the wait.The only issue I found was that even though we were some of the first people there in the morning, we still had to wait almost an hour to be seated. I can only imagine how busy it gets! Either way, make your way to Batter and Berries! IT'S WORTH IT."

12/31/2017,20171231,2,4.16,Trying too hard to make food that's not as good as it could be. Cheesy hash browns were pretty gross as they consisted of big lumps of cheese on top of overcooked hash browns. Fried chicken was decent at best. Place is loud as well. Avoid as there are many other gems in the neighborhood.

1/2/2018,20180102,5,4.16,Wonderful little spot in Lincoln park. An experience you will defiantly not forget. Service was absolutely fantastic. Our server would tell riddles throughout service which was a fun little tidbit. Food was fantastic as well. The chicken and waffles are the best around!!

1/3/2018,20180103,5,4.16,"OMG. This place .... so good !! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and they did not disappoint. I had heard a lot of hype about this place and they held up their reputation very well ! Altogether we ordered The Executive which is a spin on steak and eggs and comes with cheesy hash browns. We also ordered strawberry french toast and a sausage omelet which comes covered with chicken sausage gravy and huge sausage patties. Every single thing we had was delicious. Also, this place is awesome because it's BYOB... so you could literally take your own bottle of champagne and have mimosas with your meal !"
1/4/2018,20180104,5,4.16,"Holy French Toast!!! I knew I always loved anything citrusy, but lemon flavors French Toast so good. I had to try the famous Four flavored French Toast. I heard celebrities even pay a visit here, it's so popular and I can see why. This is the place to visit, it was so packed with cars waiting to enter before opening of business at 8am, I hardly made it in with the number of people waiting for seating. They have a new specialty item every week. The day I visited I ordered the scallop gratin, blew my mind. Seafood is my week spot, severed with cheesy potatoes with onions was a great combination. I even heard they have a new flavored French Toast,called champagne , perfect for the holidays. Keep up the good work."
1/4/2018,20180104,1,4.16,"Soooo, I've been here several times. Today was horrible. The usual hostessNicole was off I presume, the hostess there today (black girl with glasses) wasn't very friendly. Idk about you but when I walk into an establishment I expect a smile, not a look as if I'm bothering you. (I guess I'm just used to Nicole) Anyway, hostess says 25 mins wait. We get in within 10 mins, another girl is doing the seating. She offered the community table, I declined. We wait less than 20 and are seated by the door (). Upon sitting we get coffee from the bus boy but, he forgets to bring back the cream. We ask another bus boy for cream and he SMACKS his LIPS with a look . Our waitress she's this and tries to make up for it with her politeness. I can't say that worked, but she was nice. We order Lamb Exec. & Salmon Benedict. The portion for Salmon was minuscule (I always get the salmon or any seafood special they offer) the Lamb (2 chops) The bill 18$ for the Salmon & $18.50 for the Lamb. Neither were worth the price. The taste wasn't consistent and the portion was tiny with the salmon, although the Lamb was awesome. All in all, I won't be back. I've had better service and food there. I'm over the crowd, the cold and now the bad service, and inconsistent food, as well as the HIGHER PRICES. I'll stick to Lula Cafe."
1/6/2018,20180106,4,4.16,"Had brunch here with a couple of friends on a blustery January morning. The wait was still long, about 45min-1 hour for a party of 3, but the food and service more than made up for it. We ordered the famous French Toast flight to share, and we all absolutely loved the different flavors they had available (champagne was the current special they had). Wonderfully sweet and comforting, they tasted amazing, but were a little inconsistent in texture. Some were super custardy and soft (my personal preference) while others were a bit drier and chewier. I ordered a Green City Omelet to follow and asked for hot sauce and ketchup to accompany it (the hot sauce is great!). While perfectly decent, nothing about the omelet stood out flavor-wise, and it was slightly under-seasoned. Vegetables and eggs can only be so good though, so it might have been my fault for ordering something more mundane at such a fun restaurant with a huge variety of options. Still, it was a perfectly lovely meal with a decent portion size.The service was excellent; Tusciime (spelling?) was our waiter, and he was just so knowledgeable, kind, and personal. Super receptive to our questions and needs during our meal.This is a staple of Chicago brunches, and despite the wait, the restaurant is well run and a lovely place worth taking company no matter the weather outside :~)"
1/6/2018,20180106,4,4.16,"Tried Batter & Berries for the first time for brunch this morning. At around 11am, the wait was 45-60 min for three. We shared the Flight of French Toast, which is a sampler including all of their classic flavors as well as the special of the week. Maple butter on the side was delicious, and absolutely no need for syrup. I personally ordered the spinach omelet and thought it was great: mushrooms were cooked and seasoned perfectly and the sundried tomato paste was a great addition. They serve La Colombe coffee, which is a personal favorite. The staff was very friendly and we received our food very quickly, despite how busy the restaurant was. Portions are very large and filling! Overall, cozy atmosphere and a great place for a casual meal with friends."
1/6/2018,20180106,5,4.16,"Service: ExcellentFood: DeliciousWait Staff: EXTREMELY KIND and fabulous.My wife and I have been several times for brunch and always leave happy and full. There is usually a wait, but it is 100% worth it."
1/7/2018,20180107,5,4.16,"This is probably one of our new favorite brunch spots! The food is delicious. The place is small and depending on when you go there's likely to be a wait (worth it). I love the Benedicts, you have to get the cheesy hash browns and they make a killer hot sauce. They do not serve alcohol but you can bring your own champagne. They bring out a bucket of ice for the champagne and they sell you a pitcher of orange juice for you to mix."
1/12/2018,20180112,4,4.16,"I had been dying to finally try Batter & Berries after hearing so much hype about it. Apparently a lot of celebrities attend this restaurant as well. As soon as I landed in Chicago, it was my very first stop and I must say, I was highly satisfied! There were so many options, it was so tough to choose. So my cousin and I ordered 3 different plates and shared each of them! The waitress was so patient with us being that we were so indecisive, which definitely earned her brownie points with us. The owner came out to check on us and he was SO nice, friendly, and bubbly. He even showed us nice ways to pair some of our dishes. Their chicken and waffles were amazing!! The waffles are made out of sweet potatoes!!! Yuuum!! The gravy that went with the steak was mouth watering!! NOTHING was bad at all!! It's a smaller restaurant and due to how good it is, you may experience a long wait depending on the day of the week you attend. But it's worth it."
1/13/2018,20180113,4,4.16,Brunching with a friend on a Sunday. Street parking is free on Sunday in this part of town. We checked in and had to wait. We walked to a coffee shop a few blocks away and back. We still had to wait. It was worth the wait. You cannot go wrong with any of the choices. Bike parking on street.
1/14/2018,20180114,3,4.16,"I dined here during the week around 9:30am and was a little put off by how loud the music was. I was trying to conduct a business call and the other end thought I was at a party...yes, the music was that loud and slightly annoying. I love the music during the weekend as it's appropriate for brunch. At any rate, I was looking forward to the lobster benedict only to discover that it was a seasonal item. Their menu lists their daily staples, but they have chalkboard menus throughout the restaurant that feature their seasonal selections. I so wanted to try their infamous french toast, but the servings were way too much for me, so I went with the cajun salmon benedict and it was very good. The cheese hash browns that came with my order were also very good, however, the portion was enough to feed two-three people.Despite the music, I still plan on coming back with a friend, so I can try their french toast."
1/14/2018,20180114,4,4.16,We ordered three plates with a combitation french toast plate .the brisket that i had was delightful flavorful. the lamb chops that Vidal ordered was good but with small portions of it with so much bone in it . the crab omelet that jo ordered was fantastic with great flavors now the french toast was great but the carmel french toast was a little to sweet for my taste everything else was made with care . Over all great service and the waitress Nadine was the sweet and savory we needed that made the place say breakfast . $$ PRICEY but well worth it
1/15/2018,20180115,5,4.16,I've never been disappointed. From the seafood to the French toast. Mind you I don't like French toast unless it's from here! Get the variety platter of them to share. Amazing.
1/15/2018,20180115,5,4.16,"This was one of the best breakfasts I ever had. They have chicken and waffles (sweet potato waffle) , phenomenal French toast, and a line out the door always. I recommend getting there at open to avoid the crowd as much as you can."
1/15/2018,20180115,5,4.16,Loved the french toast flight! So amazing! The service was wonderful too. They were super busy but our server was very attentive & took time to help us understand the menu.
1/16/2018,20180116,4,4.16,"This place is ALWAYS poppin'. Went here on a Friday morning thinking, ""hey it's Friday, people are at work, it won't be busy!""- WRONG! My SIL and I got there around 11:30 and there was a thirty minute wait that turned into a fourty- five minute wait. I mean, this place is always crowded! First of all, I was really impressed by the host because although he wrote our names down and our party size, he seemed to remember everyone's name withour referencing his sheet (or ipad- can't recall). We requested for a high chair and although I didn't see the high chair being placed at our table prior to us sitting down, when I was walking over to our table, I stopped to ask the host, ""excuse me, the high chair?"" and he laughed and said, ""look it's already there!""- I was really impressed! Considering how busy this place is, it's always highly appreciated when hosts remember key details. Can't remember his name but he's an older gentlemen, kind of bald, about 5'8, dark hair, brown eyes and a medium build. I think he may have been a manager- not sure. As soon as we were seated, bus men came over to serve us water and almost immediately, our waitress came over. Not knowing that the bus men don't fill coffee orders, My SIL asked one of the bus boys for coffee and then I ordered a cappuccino but he wasn't 100% sure if they serve cappuccinos (perhaps educate all your employees on menu options). We took a minute to decide what we want to eat. I had originally ordered the sample of the four French toasts (not sure what it's called) first in hopes that the waitress would bring it out first as almost an appetizer but I don't think she got the drift because she came back almost immediately after she took the order for the French toast to ask us what we wanted. I had the Lacombe Brisket Hash- it has cheese, eggs, has browns and well-cooked brisket topped with gravy. To be absolutely honest, I didn't know what I ordered when I ordered so I didn't know what to expect. However, the only time I've had brisket was for dinner so to eat it for breakfast with eggs and hasbrowns was a pretty genius idea. I will note, I don't like too salty food and the gravy slightly overwhelmed my taste buds so I used a little ketchup to even out the flavors. The only reason it overwhelmed me is because it's not something I'm used to having for breakfast not because it wasn't tasty. The hash browns were baked to perfection- they weren't too well done but they weren't overcooked either. They had that crisp brown color to them and they tasted fresh- not frozen. As for the eggs, I asked for them to be cooked well and even though they were thoroughly cooked, I appreciated the fluffy texture and how lightly seasoned the eggs were. The brisket- well, it was really well cooked. From the moment I stuck my fork into the brisket, the brisket was falling apart. When a brisket isn't well cooked, it is hard and nearly impossible to cut through it. Not this brisket! The meat was seasoned to perfect, juicy and for the money, really good portion size. As for my SIL, she got the garden omelet which is basically all veggies. I didn't have a chance to ask her how it tasted but judging by the fact that she ate it all, she clearly enjoyed it. We also got the French toast sampler which unfortunately became cold by the time we actually ate it because our main course was ready for us. The waitress came around once to ask us if everything was okay and I'm glad she did because she just looked so sad that you became sad looking at her. Batter and Berries is a happy place- the food makes your stomach roar with happiness but then when you see your server dragging basically and super discouraged, you become discouraged too. The only complaint I have in regards to this entire experience is the kids menu. My nephew is a picky eater and his go to food is always mac and cheese or anything cheese. We ordered fries and grilled cheese for him and he ate both very poorly. Perhaps my suggestions would be expanding the kids menu"
1/16/2018,20180116,3,4.16,Food was good but service could be better. The venue had a private event that day so we all were being rushed out of the restaurant. Also my food came with barely any sauce and I had to pay for extra sauce.
1/17/2018,20180117,4,4.16,Cajun Salmon Benedict and asiago hash browns were delicious but the portions were too much of hash browns and too little salmon... maybe not worth $18
1/18/2018,20180118,5,4.16,"The only bad thing about this place, is that I see myself coming here way too much and spending a lot of money. Might need a second job to support myself now. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1/19/2018,20180119,5,4.16,"Ok.... My 1st time visiting B&B! Every other time it was too crowded.....This place is a winner: great food, prompt service and friendly employees.....Continue to make it happen!"
1/19/2018,20180119,5,4.16,Food was amazing during my visit to attend a wedding. Literally everything on the menu was delicious and the open bar makes it even better. Cant wait to go back
1/20/2018,20180120,2,4.16,"This place is very popular for their French toast however, me and my gf went to their to eat some good breakfast, they have very good food and menu looked are affordable 13-14$ entrees. I was looking to get one of those meals and waitress said if we are looking for something good and affordable get those specials . So we got it, and Bill came up 20$ for my food and 19$ for my gf, we got juice 4.50$ each. I paid 50$+ tips and taxes for regular brunch for just food no desserts no appetizers or anything. I don't mind paying for dinner 50-80$ but for brunch ? It is totall ripoff, I will never go there, regular basic place"
1/20/2018,20180120,5,4.16,Amazing and delicious. Sat at the community table for the first time and it was quite pleasant.
1/21/2018,20180121,5,4.16,"So decided on this place at the last minute. First time in a long time. Unfortunately the wait was long But it was worth it. As we say down at our table we were greeted by our waiter (Tuseme ) Im sure the name is spelled wrong but he was awesome with his riddles haha. He took our order and food was definitely out quickly. We ordered the French Toast Flight, The traditional breakfast and the banana waffle with a fried chicken breast. All we can say is that the food was amazing and delicious."
1/24/2018,20180124,5,4.16,"Worth the hype. This place is EVERYTHING. The food is unreal - hello french toast flight and pork chop/egg breakfast special. Never been for lunch but definitely want to explore that side of the menu.More than the food, the vibe is perfect. I love how it's unapologetic with its bright purple and yellow decor, and the staff is awesome. Like, they must audition for that role. I've been asked to solve a riddle in order to get hot sauce for my eggs. Love it. Oh...and the hot sauce might be the best I've ever had. Spicy and sweet, wish I could buy it by the bottle. Also, Spike Lee was eating there with us...so there's that."
1/24/2018,20180124,4,4.16,"I'm not sure what the hype is about. But food was delicious, coffee strong how I love it, server was the sweetest most attentive and informative I've had the pleasure of interacting with in a long time. Food was on point. But those two chics hosting today really need to remove the stick from their behinds and smile and realize they are the front of the house. They are the first people see when they come in. Instead you get cold shoulder and shitty attitudes. I seriously thought she was gonna bite my head off for asking her a question!"
1/28/2018,20180128,5,4.16,"Highly recommend going earlier than you actually want to eat due to wait time. However, definitely worth the wait. I had the omelette special, which was a crab omelette. Very good, would get it without tomatoes next time because those made it a little wet/soggy. The French toast flight...OH. MY. GOODNESS. Amazing. 10/10 would get every time. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles which is a sweet potato waffle. He's not normally a fan of sweet potatoes, however he said this was, ""the best breakfast he's ever had"". Needless to say, we cannot wait to come back when we are in town."
1/29/2018,20180129,4,4.16,"My 3rd attempt finally got me in. The first 2 attempts, the 2+ hour wait turned me away but this 3rd attempt, luckily I had the time and patience for it.If you can come here early enough or on an off time later in the day, just an hour or so before they close, you might not have to wait too long. Otherwise, this place is poppin and rightfully so. It's a popular black owned business which is awesome when people of color make it. My friend and I ordered:Cheesey hashbrowns as a sideThe french toast flightFried Chicken sandwichThe cheesy hasbrowns were rec'd by our waitress and I could see someone who likes cheese and not crispy hashbrowns really like this dish. But for me, I like my hashbrowns crispy so I wasn't too much of a fan.The french toast flight was delicious. Blueberry was my favorite, the blueberry sauce tasted so fresh and delicious. I'd get this again as a full dish on its own and I'm not even a fan of sweet breakfast items. The fried chicken burger was good as well and was definitely more of a lunch item than a breakfast item. All in all, I'd definitely come back but I don't know about waiting another 2 hours again. I'd come back at an off time to get my fix."
2/4/2018,20180204,5,4.16,"Going to Batter & Berries was a great experience because the customer service was good and the food was delicious. If you think the restaurant is for you, IT IS!!!"
2/4/2018,20180204,5,4.16,Excellent everytime!!! Gets very busy fast!! Spinach omelet and strawberry French toast are my favs!
2/6/2018,20180206,4,4.16,I've waited a long time to visit this place and the food was well worth the wait. The place is small - tiny even - but the wait wasn't unreasonable. Our waiter was attentive - even funny - and helped to add to our dining experience. The Maître D (sp) was also attentive so service is a definite plus. The food was very tasty. I had the pork brisket or something like that and my companions had some specialty French toast among other fares. Tasty and plenty of it. Add to your to try list!
2/7/2018,20180207,3,4.16,"It's been a few years since I have been here and it still taste as good as I remember. I'm a creature of habit when it comes to breakfast so I got the flight of French toast and the French toast of the week was creme brûlée and I should have just ordered that one, nothing against the other French toast, the the creme brûlée was just really really good. Please don't come here if you are hungry cause you will be waiting for two hours, mind you we got there at 10:30 and we were definitely seated at 12:30, but I guess that's how the near by bars make money because you'll need a place to park it for the wait."
2/7/2018,20180207,5,4.16,"The FIRST thing we ate when we touched down in Chicago. We were hungry out of our minds by the time we got here. I ordered the French Toast Flight w/ side of eggs & bacon & my bf ordered the current omelette special -- I think it was the Jambalaya omelette. SO good. The variation of French toast flavors kept my tastebuds interested and I wasn't tired of eating it after a few bites. The jambalaya omelette though.... sooo good. They use a sauce that goes on it & it pairs so well with eggs, that I had to ask for a side of it & pour on my eggs! It's also BYOB. How awesome. Such a cute place to have breakfast at."
2/8/2018,20180208,5,4.16,Hands down the best brunch spot in the whole city. Their French Toast Flight is amazing and you can't go wrong with the chicken and waffles made from sweet potatoes stuffed with chicken and a side of fried chicken. Plus their butter is made in house and tastes like ice cream.
2/9/2018,20180209,5,4.16,Le flame my guy. Simply le flame. & POC staff are great! Little bit of a wait but worth a whole lotta flavor.
2/10/2018,20180210,4,4.16,"This was our first time eating breakfast here and we were not disappointed. We were immediately offered coffee and tea, and to my surprise, they brought out a broad selection of teas for me to choose from. We ordered the chicken and sweet potatoes waffle, the jambalaya omelet which was a special of the day, and were encouraged to try the praline French toast of the day. The order came out quickly and the food was really great. Not something we could have easily made at home. The owner came by and asked us how everything was and seemed very involved in the restaurant which was nice to see. My only complaint was that the praline French toast was very sweet, and tasted more like a dessert, but I think that may be more of a personal preference. Over all, this is a great place to grab breakfast in Chicago!"
2/11/2018,20180211,4,4.16,@batterandberries have become a staple in Chicago with their French Toast. The fact that it does not require syrup and only needs maple butter proves that it has ever lasting flavor. Then you have to get a side of homemade chicken sausage stuffed with apples. The wait here maybe long but it is worth it because you will get amazing food in return. @officialchicagobrw Chicagos Black Owned Resturuant Week starts today and this is the perfect way to kick off your week. Please make sure that you come here to support their food as it is amazing and taste just as good as it looks. #blackchicagomonth #blackownedchicago #blackowned #frenchtoast #chicago #sausage #videooftheday #blackpeopleeats #insta_chicago #mychicagopix #Chicagogram #Chigram#chicagoeats#Chicagofestivals#ChicagoFoodAndDrink#eatalyseptemberfest#chicagofoodcoop#bestfoodfeed#bestfoodchicago#eaterchicago#chicagogrammers#rejoycelyfe#stampchicago#likefood@rollingout@chicagodefender #checkpleasepics#eaterchicago#yelpchicago#yelpchicagoburbs
2/14/2018,20180214,5,4.16,"Worth. The. Wait. I was visiting from out of town and my friend built this place up quite a bit. It was a Friday around 11 so I figured the breakfast rush would be over... we had a bit of a wait, but not bad. Put your name on the list and go about your business around the block. They'll text you when you should start to head back to claim your table. We enjoyed a few drinks at a nearby pub. The service is fantastic and they do a great job presenting their specials - even using their phones to show pictures as to entice you even further. Ordered the french toast flight as an appetizer... pat on the back for that move... so freaking good. Finished it off with some biscuits with chicken sausage gravy. If you like hot tea, you will appreciate the way they serve it with loose leaf tea rather than a bag. What a way to celebrate life and it's many splendid flavors!"
2/15/2018,20180215,5,4.16,I finally got to go to Batter and Berries Feb14!! And it was good. The server was nice and the food I tried was delicious.. I got the French toast flight and my friend got the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken. I enjoyed it and will be coming back!
2/15/2018,20180215,5,4.16,"Love, love, love the food. You should follow their social media because it will tell you the weekly specials they have. I've tried it all from the French toast to the omelets to the executives (you'll know what I'm talking about once you get there). This place is BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of champagne for mimosas. They are willing split checks and the food comes pretty fast. However, be prepared to have a decent wait time if you come on a weekend. Weekdays, they can seat you pretty quickly."
2/21/2018,20180221,5,4.16,Food was pretty good ! The lines are long so try to come early if you can . BYOB ! The staff here are very friendly & helpful. It was my first time here and the menu is pretty self explanatory. I had the French toast flight with eggs and pork sausage. The sausage was very spicy but my favorite . My friend had the sweet potato waffles and fried chicken . She did not like it ... it was wayyy to sweet and had a very strong taste . Will I come back here??? YES !
2/22/2018,20180222,5,4.16,"So many cool options to choose from, definitely try the French toast flight its what they're famous for and is simply amazing"
2/23/2018,20180223,5,4.16,This is not your average steak omelet. It's not what I expected when I ordered it and that's ok because I was pleasantly surprised! It was literally a rib eye steak on top of a mozzarella cheese omelet topped with mushroom marsala sauce. It was delicious! The egg soaked up the sauce so well for added flavor. And I'm such a sucker for fried potatoes that each bite of the cheese crusted hash browns was like a piece of heaven in my mouth!
2/24/2018,20180224,5,4.16,BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER! I recommend getting the French toast flight if you're a French toast lover like me. So many flavors and all of them are delicious!
2/25/2018,20180225,1,4.16,"I wish I could give this review less than one star due to the fact that I had an unpleasant breakfast and took up most of my Sunday. I had been excited to visit this place due to their fabulous ""French toast"" but instead received attitude and mediocre breakfast. The hostesses begin by telling you the wait will be an hour and thirty mins which is not a problem but the attitude that comes with that explanation is unacceptable not to mention the fact that they have preferences towards certain costumers and unfortunately we weren't on their preference list. Certain individuals got asked if they wanted coffee and if everything was ok but as we patiently waited an hour and forty five mins not once did they show us any type of customer service. Instead once I asked where we were on the list I received attitude and she read off that ""we only had waited 45 mins you need to wait the rest of the time"". It saddens me that the first impression you get from this place is that type of service because even though the food was eh the servers and cooking staff work very hard and they deserve recognition. I honestly will not be going back and recommend you save your time and money."
2/26/2018,20180226,5,4.16,"Y'all. This spot is so good and by far the best spot I've been to in Chicago to eat at. I got the fajita omelette and that was bomb. Friends got jambalaya omelette, cluck and gravy, and crab/crawfish Benedict. Everything was so delicious! New Orleans type of vibe to me. They have BYOB!! Yes, bring your champagne and they'll provide the juice. A++ to me!!"
2/28/2018,20180228,4,4.16,Long wait but it was well worth it! Great service and great food! The French toast were amazing....food came out quickly which is a plus!
2/28/2018,20180228,4,4.16,A little over hyped. The food is good but they seriously need a new location for better seating.
2/28/2018,20180228,5,4.16,They go above and beyond to give great service. We loved our breakfast this morning for my birthday! We left very full! My wife really enjoyed the French toast flight. I loved the brisket hash. Working the coffee into the recipe is great! The gluten free buckwheat pancakes were delicious.
3/1/2018,20180301,4,4.16,"This rating is for the delicious French toast and the Crabcake eggs Benedict that we ate during our first visit here. It's really a small and narrow place. Obviously it's popular, although it's not touristy. For perspective, our breakfast, including an order of Colombian coffee, set me back $42 ( I added 15% gratuity). So it's actually not your typical diner prices. Now, as much as it pains me to do this, I am compelled to rate our server's service a 2-star. I'll explain why.First, she gave us only one table setting (there were two of us eating). She didn't even notice it the second time she came to our table to inquire about what we have decided to order. When she told us about today's specials, she didn't mention the price of each. She didn't mention that the eggs Benedict that I ordered cost about $19. It so happened I enjoyed eating it. It just gets better from here on (I'm being facetious if you didn't notice). We weren't even done with our breakfast and here she comes delivering our check. She waited about five minutes to pick up the check, only to be disappointed that I hadn't acted like Speedy Gonzales to put my MasterCard down. I realize I'm merely being petty in saying this--but when we arrived and sat down at the table, she came over and in the midst of taking our order she had commented on how much she liked my nail polish I don't know about most people, but I do appreciate friendly service, as long as the level of friendliness never, ever crosses the line where it becomes too in-your-face. Ack! I suspect I created a few more enemies just by writing this. Demi Lovato said it right--sorry but not sorry. Just kidding! On the overall, I might return. As long as we don't get the same girl! Lol"
3/1/2018,20180301,2,4.16,"This will be my first review on yelp , one that made an impact. I have visited this private owned restaurant a few times. The service and food just keep going down a slippery slope. This was probably my final visit. The service was exceptionally horrible this afternoon. We arrived and they couldn't even give us one dollar in change for parking,no biggie I should be more prepared . It is byob so we decided to bring champagne for mimosas. Our glasses never arrived. After debating if we should just poor it in any glass after 20min we were told they had no more glasses and they would go purchase some at that moment. Slightly confused I didn't let it bother me. We had brunch ,food was normal. Waiter did not come even once to check on us. I've had better experiences before at this place but something is changing. Hence my 2 stars because all experiences weren't this bad."
3/2/2018,20180302,5,4.16,"If a breakfast place isn't bustling it can't be good! Well this place is bustling, fast paced and delicious. Not in downtown Chicago but in more of an area with an ""Uptown"" feel to it. Had a very tasty omelette that came with good pancakes, hash browns and got applewood smoked bacon on the side. We didn't have to eat again until dinner."
3/2/2018,20180302,5,4.16,Wish I had 10 stars to rate this place! Best breakfast/brunch spot in the universe and that is not just hyperbole. I have been here 3 times and the food has been off the charts every single time. The wait staff is exceptional and they get you in an out even though there is ALWAYS a line but that is to be expected with such a popular place. Highest recommendation!
3/2/2018,20180302,4,4.16,My wife and I had a very nice time breakfast delicious service was good. WARNING!! No Grits.
3/3/2018,20180303,5,4.16,"A+My cousin brought me here during the weekday so we did not have to wait and it was not crowded. So, one big thing that I am a stickler on is service. The waiter, Tusiime is someone that is well known in the restaurant and you're going to want to request him. He keeps your glass full and also keeps you thinking and laughing. I ordered Super Flight French Toast. At the time it was Pink Moscato battered French toast topped with vanilla sauce accompanied by a sample of their strawberry, blueberry, lemon, & caramel French toast. Each served with their famous Batter & Berries maple butter. Of course, bacon and scramble eggs with Gouda cheese on the side. This combo was one of the best combs that I have had. The french toast was not dry and I really wanted more. The prices are standard as if you were going to another small business for brunch. My ticket also included my cousins!There's so much to choose from on the menu also. I know I will be back when in the city."
3/3/2018,20180303,4,4.16,"Wonderful experience! The chicken and waffles was absolutely amazing. I had never had sweet potato with chicken mixed in waffles. The service was super friendly and the food came out in shockingly fast times. The only issue we had at the table was one of the dishes was just too over powering with spices. It was a chocolate sauce that tastes like over smoked Mole sauce. Other than that, everything was amazing!"
3/3/2018,20180303,5,4.16,To. Die. For!! Amazing food. French toast is a must- especially when it is Cream Brûlée season (Jan/Feb). Go early! If not you are subject to a little under 2hr wait. Worth it!
3/4/2018,20180304,5,4.16,"I visited for my birthday and it was pleasant. The wait for a table was very long even by myself. But I enjoyed the food and the other who came alone, we were all sat at the middle table. I'm definitely going back soon."
3/4/2018,20180304,1,4.16,"First time here, if you like fancy built dishes it's fine. But I'm a simple breakfast person, tried ordering plain French toast and was look at like I had 3 heads. Told me was not possible even though that's one of there main breakfast dishes. Guess this isn't Burger King can not get it your way. Ordered a Pepsi, everyone at the table got there drinks but me. After 15 mins food came was asked if we needed anything else and I said yes my drink I never got. Would not return."
3/5/2018,20180305,5,4.16,"My friend suggested we meet at this restaurant for brunch recently, I'd never heard of it but it sounded good enough. Wow! I live in Andersonville where we have some amazing breakfast places - but I would definitely make the trip down to Batter & Berries again! I can't even remember what I ordered - but I do remember that I told myself I wasn't going to eat much, because I wasn't all that hungry. Once I took a bite of my meal, that was out the window! I ate every bite! I loved the atmosphere and our server was so kind and patient with my friend and I as we caught up and took a bit to order. I will go back!"
3/7/2018,20180307,5,4.16,"This place is amazing!!!! Everything from the service to the food was perfection! Staff was very attentive with coffee refills and making sure everyone at the table had enough condiments etc. The cluck and Gouf? was out of this world. No maple syrup needed, the maple butter they give you was so flavorful! We also tried the French toast flight which was heavenly, and the cheesy hash browns were superb! We went on a weekday and there was no wait at 10:30, if your in Chicago you need to make your way over to Batter and Berries! It won't disappoint!"
3/10/2018,20180310,5,4.16,Shook. I love everything about this place I'm not exactly sure but I believe it was the owner who held my food for me while I went to the bathroom. The staff is so personable and the pricing is great. Just wish the space was a little bigger and that they had shrimp and grits.
3/12/2018,20180312,5,4.16,"First, I must say, I waited in the car for about an hour in -10 degree weather just to experience this! I saw a post on Instagram and wanted to check it out while in the Chi. It was worth braving the cold! The French Toast flight was unforgettably delicious!!! I love that it's BYOB, although I didn't know prior to going. I went by myself and thought that would cut down on the wait time but unfortunately it didn't. However, once seated, a server quickly comes to take your order and the food comes out quick. I'll definitely be returning, but when it's warmer."
3/13/2018,20180313,4,4.16,"Got there a little past 10am and put our # down for a 50 min wait. Walked down the street to Printer's Row for coffee and then it was just about time! We sat by the door so it was kind of cold. The hostess kept saying ""please close the door so our guests stay warm!"" they try to accommodate w heat lamps and space heaters around the front. It has a very homey, comfort food sort of feel. I think that's what they were going for so A+ on that. I thought the French toast sampler was overrated though. Wouldn't get it again. The jambalaya omelette special was good though!!"
3/13/2018,20180313,5,4.16,Everything about this place was AMAZING. I came in with a group of 10 people ten minutes before they closed and they treated us with the best service ever!!!! Our waiter came greeted us and answered every question we had. The food was THE BEST !!!!! To top it all off the cook came out and sang happy birthday to me with me and my friends ... (it was my birthday ) Next time I'm in town I will certainly be back !!! Thank you for showing us an amazing time !!!
3/15/2018,20180315,5,4.16,Sooooooooooo delicious!! I would go back more frequently but the location distance and the wait is what turns me off! I had the jambalaya omelet-----melts in your mouth! Everything was great.Customer service was great and the Chef is awesome! When I'm up for the ride and have the patience to with more than an hour then I'll be back!
3/16/2018,20180316,5,4.16,"I'm from out of town and my friends suggested we go here. Best breakfast I've ever had!! Our waitress, Leslie, was very busy and although we were initially slightly annoyed with her, she completely ignored our vibe and was as sweet as can be. That in itself turned the whole mood around. I had the traditional with pancakes, my friends had caramel French toast and lamb chops, EVERYTHING was a 10. Plus it's BYOB and black-owned! Every time I visit Chicago I will be sure to stop by!"
3/17/2018,20180317,5,4.17,I ordered the chicken and sweet potatoes waffle...AMAZING!!! It's a great thing I live out of town because Im sure I would be here everyday and that would not be good for my fitness goals lol. I went with a group of friends and the whole table was satisfied. I'll definitely make my way back next time I'm in The Chi.
3/18/2018,20180318,5,4.17,I loveeeee this place. This is only my second time coming here but it was in the same week so that speaks for itself ! I recommend this place but on Sunday be aware to be here when they open at 8 or you'll be waiting.
3/18/2018,20180318,4,4.17,"My first time at Batter & Berries! We were a group of 5 people, we arrived there at 11am and the estimated wait was for 2 hours. And it literally took two hours!! We went to Starbucks and waited until they sent us a message - so that was nice.It was an organized chaos since today is Sunday and yesterday was St Patrick's Day. Next time I'd go earlier or during the weekday.The food was delicious, everyone loved their order. So, there is no need of more pictures of the French toast (they were GOOD but not that warm).ATTENTION:1. The OJ was $4.50! You read that right: almost $5 for a glass of orange juice. Yikes!2. The kind of cheese you choose for your eggs will cost you different prices (makes sense, but at the moment the waiter is giving you the options you forget that). The Kraft American cheese was $0.65 when the Gouda cheese was $3! YIKES!"
3/18/2018,20180318,5,4.17,Best French toast! Chicken sausage also superb!!! 90 minutes for wait time but well worth it! Will definitely be coming back!!
3/19/2018,20180319,5,4.17,"Needed a place to get brunch in the Lincoln Park area and this place had good reviews, so we decided to try it. I think there's usually a pretty long wait (sometimes two hours), but we went on a Monday mid morning and only waited ten minutes. I can totally understand the long wait times though, because this was probably the best brunch restaurant we have been too. You have to get the French toast, we ate every bite of the strawberry toast. My boyfriend got the sausage omelette which was very good, topped with chicken gravy, and I had the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. The service was great, had several people refilling our drinks and coffee. The menu has a good variety, everything is made fresh, and they have brand new specials every couple of weeks. Definitely would recommend this place !!"
3/23/2018,20180323,4,4.17,"Always a great spot for brunch. Hard to get into on the weekend's but during the week, way easier to do and eat.The French Toast flight is my favorite but wasn't as hungry this time around. This is great place to share entrees and this time I did. The Cluck & Gravy with a side of sweet potato fries with rosemary hit the spot today to share with my Bestie. The staff is always helpful and knows the menu inside and out. Ask questions about it as they can help narrow down what you are looking for."
3/23/2018,20180323,5,4.17,"So I am a little behind on my review but it is definitely warranted. What a delightful place to enjoy delicious food. Of course if you do t know by now, Tussime is life in this restaurant! Overall everyone was pleasant but he made it worth the 1and 1/2 hour wait. The food came out fast which was great considering the wait. We shared and extra side if fried chicken because it was that good. I wanted red velvet waffles but that was a special a while ago and no longer on the menu. I think the menu changes to stay fresh which is cool. Our Uber driver testified that we woukd enjoy this place and he did not lie. Please check it out next time you are in Chicago!"
3/24/2018,20180324,5,4.17,"Amazing! Worth the wait! We've been here a handful of times and everything we've ordered had been incredible. We've had the sweet potato chicken and waffles, French toast flight, coffee, jambalaya omelet and the lemon blueberry waffle with chicken sausage. Everything was delicious. Also get some of their hot sauce for your omelette it is out of this world good!!!"
3/25/2018,20180325,4,4.17,"Very average, nothing to write home about. It's not bad, but I would not go out of my way to go there. Actually, bacon was very good, so four stars, not three"
3/25/2018,20180325,5,4.17,"Best breakfast around! Delicious and unique specials and delicious, vinegary homemade hot sauce. Loved their creole biscuits and gravy and crab cake Benedict. Their salmon croquettes was also very good."
3/26/2018,20180326,2,4.17,"I was excited to give this place a try considering all the great reviews it has. However.... against popular opinion, I'm not a fan. I ordered the Flight of French Toast and my friend ordered an egg dish. Both were unimpressive to us. The 'Flight of French Toast' came out with pretty soggy bread. Maybe I'm just used to french toast made from challah bread?"
3/28/2018,20180328,5,4.17,Everything was perfect so I wish Yelp didn't make you write a bunch of stuff. Reviews are generally lower on Yelp because they make you say a lot of stuff and usually when people who have a lot of stuff to say....it's negative. This restaurant should have five stars. It's perfect. Mmmmmmmm batter!
3/28/2018,20180328,3,4.17,"The chicken and waffles are not good, but the caramel french toast and cheesy hashbrowns are good. The seating is a turn-off. I hate being that close to people while I'm eating. The service is good though."
3/29/2018,20180329,5,4.17,"Rumor had it that Batter and Berries is one of the BEST Black owned eateries for brunch in the city. I am writing this review to confirm it's true NOT just a rumor. I went on a Sunday, which meant I should expect a long wait. The restaurant is small but it makes that up with a bright decor and the community dining table instead bar counter seating.I was impressed by the menus many options but thanks to my awesome server, Jessica L., who guided me through it, I went for the special omelet and an order of their signature dish. Every bite was delectable! This is going to be a MUST every time I am in the city."
3/30/2018,20180330,4,4.17,"Located on the Lincoln strip, this fun restaurant lived up to the hype. Parking was ample but I did get to the restaurant around 8:30am. Upon walking in, the line wasn't as long as I expected and I was immediately seated. Although I wasn't GREETED, everyone was respectful. The waiter gave a detailed speech on the specials which all sound delicious. I however order the French Toast Flight and the chicken fajita omelet. The presentation was awesome and it was definitely filling. My omelet was cheesy but delicious. I definitely recommend the French toast flight. It's a meal in itself but I'm greedy on the weekend. Check it out because it's an experience I think you would enjoy it."
3/31/2018,20180331,5,4.17,"So freaking goooood! Best waffles and hash browns I have ever had. Excellent service! Well worth the wait, if you're waiting longer than an hour stop by rotfugi or go buy a bottle of champagne bc it's BYOB!"
4/1/2018,20180401,3,4.17,"The Cluck & Gravy was surprisingly good. Never had chicken gravy. Scrambled eggs had a hint of sweet syrup. Plain hash browns were limp, but if you like them soft, that's a good thing."
4/3/2018,20180403,5,4.17,Great gourmet breakfast joint. Everything is fr shot made. They make their own chicken sausages. Fresh fresh fresh. They also play house music over the sound system.
4/3/2018,20180403,5,4.17,"Truly my favorite breakfast place in Chicago - which is saying a lot because I am a brunch connoisseur. My favorite meal at B&B had to be when my friend and I got our own dishes and also chose to share one. We both decided on the specials; I got crawfish cake benedict and she chose the shrimp scampi omelet both complete with a side of cheesy hash browns (AMAZING). Since we had so much savory going on, we ordered a super-flight of their french toast for an ""appetizer"" and Ghiradelli hot chocolate to wash it down.I had never been so full in my life. The ONLY downside to this place is the wait. Well worth it though!"
4/7/2018,20180407,5,4.17,"Great little diner vibe spot for breakfast and brunch. The French toast flight is awesome, it gives you the opportunity to try 4 French toast flavors from the menu. Pair it with a breakfast burrito for a nice balance of sweet and hardy. Very popular place even on weekday mornings. I would arrive early. Definitely worth a wait!!"
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.17,"Come early. It gets crowded pretty quickly. The crowd is a testament to how delicious their food is. There is a perfect ebb and flow to the small place. But be prepared to bump shoulders and make a new friend. My family and I come here often and we're never disappointed. The staff is friendly and the service is prompt. The french toast flight or the super flight are must haves. No syrup needed ~ the fresh fruit toppings and homemade maple butter have that covered. Their homemade chicken sausage is to die for (I don't eat pork but I'm told the homemade pork sausage is good too). They also serve gourmet tea. The ""Love"" flavor is perfect.Because I hate to leave any disparaging comments about this beloved breakfast spot it pains me to bring it up but I want to share: Don't try the chicken and waffle dish. Unless outrageously thick dry sweet potato flavored waffles is your thing. The accompanying piece of Fried chicken breast is rather amazing though.Highly recommended this place to others!"
4/8/2018,20180408,5,4.17,"The breakfast at batter and berries is amazing!!! I ordered the ""traditional"" which is eggs, hash brown with cheese, and bacon. It's simple but tasty! I would try out their French toast platter as well! The caramel French toast is my favorite! P.s. Make sure to arrive early because it gets really busy later on on the morning!"
4/9/2018,20180409,5,4.17,"The food was phenomenal. Their pineapple juice was off the charts. The service was great and quick! Their French Toast Flight was a great meal to experience. We had a larger group, so we had to wait a good 5 minutes yet that gave us extra time to figure out what we would like to eat. This food is really worth your time! Don't hesitate to come and see for yourself."
4/9/2018,20180409,5,4.17,"This is probably one of the best breakfast places I've been to in a while! The food was delicious and the waiters were so nice! Although the wait time was 45 minutes, the food greatly made up for it. I loved how fast the food came out. My family of 8 and I all ordered meals and they were all out within 20 minutes! The food was warm and the pineapple juice was very good! The environment overall was very comforting and warm. Would recommend this place to everyone!!"
4/9/2018,20180409,5,4.17,"First, this place is MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brunch place, ever. The last time I was here was on Easter Sunday- i know, a crazy time to pick brunch. But, seriously the staff was all amazing, the food came out hot and was delicious. My friend got a omelette while I had one of the specials which was the salmon croquettes. To die for. Soo good!! Our waiter was so nice, funny, and was patient with us when we had no idea what we wanted to order. Favorite things on the menu; 1) the French toast, the flight is a must if you're coming with a group of people and can share 2) the omelettes, you just can't go wrong and 3) any of their specials they have going on."
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.17,"Absolutely delicious... wait was long as usual but the food came out pretty quickly. Our waiter was outstanding.... We had to take food to go.I ordered the Issa Wrap delicious make sure you ask for the homemade hot sauce... my husband had the French toast super flight which came with 5 French toast this week special was the Amaretto Sour, my husband maxed it. He also got the Lemon Pepper lobster Omelette it had plenty lobster ( pictures attached)Note: the pictures were taken after we had already started eating so the plates looks like small portions but it's not."
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.17,"Okay, let me start by saying this...you will have to wait, so be prepared with a snack or if it's a nice day out, you may take a walk. Anyhoo, once we ordered our food, it took about 15 minutes for everything to come out. We ordered the roasted salmon benedict, French toast flight, and the lemon pepper lobster omelette. Everything was delicious and came out hot! We definitely recommend going here for breakfast or brunch. Lastly, just beware, the have two restrooms (gender neutral) but the one closest to the door doesn't close all the way. Other than that, enjoy!"
4/15/2018,20180415,5,4.17,"What a great place for breakfast or brunch. It's a small joint that doesn't take reservations, but you put your name in and they'll call you when it's your turn. Also they have a small waiting area in the back of the restaurant in case it's cold/rainy out. They turn tables quickly cause they make the food quickly. Great service. The menu is terrific and some choices change daily. The food is delicious and creative, with unique dishes and clever twists on old favorites. I had a sweet potato waffle and fried chicken and it was very flavorful and filling and I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. I tasted some of the eggs and brisket that my son ordered, and with the cheesy hash browns...MAN! I'm gonna get than next time. Their coffee is delicious and they keep it coming. If your up on the North Side, check it out. Friendly folks that make an awesome breakfast!"
4/16/2018,20180416,5,4.17,"I see a lot of bitching about the size of the place and the long line to get in. People... fucking wake up! Food is great= lots of people show up= long wait!!!  Dropped my girl off down the street for oral surgery and ran out for food...This place is a one of a kind. The owner is super friendly and talks to you like your and old friend, place is cute and clean with wonderful staff. Sat me in the single section and met a cool dude (ryan). We both loved the place and made for a fun breakfast I will be back"
4/17/2018,20180417,5,4.17,A friend took me here during my visit two years ago and I have not stopped thinking about this brunch since. We shared a French toast flight and I got some kind of omelette with salmon... I will go back anytime I'm in the city again. Blew me away.
4/18/2018,20180418,5,4.17,"My absolute favorite new brunch spot! I wish we lived closer, but will definitely make this a go to when we're in town! With a fun and creative menu, friendly and knowledgeable servers, cute and trendy atmosphere this place is for sure a 10! We sat at the community brunch table, which was so nice because we were able to connect with some other people and compare brunch options. I ordered the Special of the Day, Lemon Pepper Lobster and Asparagus omelette. It was just as fabulous as it sounds! My husband ordered the chicken fajita omelette. He has not stopped talking about it! We opted to share a kids order of Blueberry French Toast and wished we would've shared a French Toast flight! It's THAT good!! BYOB for Mimosas, etc. We will be back in May and cannot wait for brunch before the Cubs game!!"
4/21/2018,20180421,5,4.17,"Great food, the specials are amazing as well as the regular menu items. Never a terribly long wait for food and the staff is super friendly. One of my favorite breakfast spots."
4/22/2018,20180422,5,4.17,"This is a solid breakfast place in Chicago. We were fortunate enough to beat the crowd by getting there by 8:30 on a Sunday morning. We were seated within 10 min of walking in with our party (entire party must be present). We were greeted immediately with our drink orders. Coffee! They were great with refilling our coffee and waters. Our server made recommendations with the specials and did not disappoint. Everything was deliciois and filled with great flavor. We ordered the specials (lemon lobster omelette, salmon croquettes), biscuit and gravy, chicken and waffle, French toast flight, and a side of bacon. (Between the four of us) LOL. The fried chicken was juicy and moist. It also came with a great hot sauce. Yummy. The waffle also had chicken inside the waffle. Crazy! I've never seen that before! The lobster omelette was so tasty and came with a surprising amount of lobster. I would come back just for this!Overall, really enjoyed this place and would come back if I'm back in Chicago."
4/23/2018,20180423,5,4.17,"Wowwwwwwww. This was my favorite restaurant in Chicago by far. Go here for brunch. And get the French toast flight and the sweet potato waffle. Seriously delicious. If you're lucky, Nadine will be your waitress. She was so nice! Will be back for sure."
4/24/2018,20180424,5,4.18,This is a great spot. And it's byob. Perfect good. You won't have any issues with this place. I suggest the chicken and waffles.. THE WAFFLE HAS CHICKEN IN IT it's good man.
4/25/2018,20180425,3,4.17,"The restaurants vibe threw me off. First off, the restaurant is the size of a crackerjack box so you have to wait outside or in the ""waiting room"" as they call it. They're suppose to text you when they have your table available, which they did text me JUST to tell me to wait in the ""waiting room"" where I again had to wait another 15 minutes. I waited about 45 minutes -1 hour in total for a seat for two! The hostess, a black tall skinny lady, had the worst attitude. The seater, black male with dreads does not make the situation better. Man must think he is black Jesus or some. He finally sits my sister, nephew (2-year old), and I down. Cool... but then he proceeds to try and make fun with my nephew. Sir! Would you find some business?! Our waitress arrives and she is a blessing from god! Wish I could remember her name. She gave good suggestions from her personal opinion. I went with her $20 suggestion of ordering the jambalaya omelet and cheese hash browns. Meh. Meal was not even up to par. Seeing as how I've been to New Orleans the meal was a saddening. Overall, I would rate this place a 3-star and that's being nice."
4/25/2018,20180425,4,4.17,Holy moly!!!! This place was good. I came here for a weekday brunch with my friend. There was no wait time at all. The service was friendly and the food came out in proper time. I ordered the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken.l ($13.50). The waffle was authentic dare I say authentic Belgium waffles. The fried chicken was a bit soggy for my taste but acceptable.Definitely will be back.
4/27/2018,20180427,5,4.17,This place was fabulous and exceeded my expectations of French toast. The service was great and we really enjoyed our time. I rate this place five stars. There was no wait as we went on a Friday in the afternoon and there's usually a long wait on the weekends because it is so popular. The only negative feedback I have for this place is their choice in music. It was repetitive techno the entire time. ???? I'm not sure why they chose this music but overall this place is great.
4/28/2018,20180428,1,4.17,"I was excited to come to this breakfast place because of all the good recommendations my friends and co workers were saying. Very disappointed when i ordered the french toast. After ordering my meal it came out within minutes and i was very surprised to how quick it was. After taking a bite it was good, then mid way through my meal the bread started becoming hard. It remainded me of how stale bread gets after you put it the microwave. Makes sense to way the plate was too hot to touch. Havent been back since."
4/29/2018,20180429,1,4.17,This was my very first time at this breakfast joint first and foremost when being seated we had gotten 5 water refills on our cups before getting up ourselves to ask if we can get a menu to start our order. Then when getting our food the chicken tenders looked like fish sticks and was drenched in grease. First and last time coming worse experience ever.
4/30/2018,20180430,5,4.17,"Oh my!!! This spot is ahhh-mazing!!! It had been awhile since my last visit, but everything was absolutely delicious just like I remember! I will post pics of our delish food we had! The actual restaurant is small and they get very busy, so expect to wait.. but it's worth it!! Oh and a awesome perk, they are byob so don't forget the champagne!! Do yourself a favor and don't just go, but run to this little slice of heaven!!"
5/1/2018,20180501,5,4.17,"There's absolutely nothing I can say about Batter & Berries hat hasn't been said by others so I'll be brief. This was my second visit to Batter & Berries. I literally came from NYC to have this stuff. Be prepared for a wait. Nothing insane but a 20-45 minute wait on weekdays. Service is phenomenal. The waitstaff is beyond friendly and courteous. Their patience and thorough in their explanation of menu items. Also funny. Food. I think about the French Toast Flight every morning. Every. Single. Morning. Every fruit, every taste. Every delight was just right. I WANT IT IN MY MOUTH NOW!!!!If I had the money I'd give it to them so they could open an NYC location. It would literally have to be 24/7 because the place would stay packed. I wish I had more stars to give because wowowowowowowowow"
5/4/2018,20180504,5,4.17,"High energy place with fabulous food and great staff. I was alone, and made to feel very welcome. There was a big group nearby, and they were well taken care of as well.Cheery decor, very clean."
5/5/2018,20180505,5,4.17,Awesome spot for breakfast. Enjoyed the Blue Berry French toast and the lobster omelette. I will definitely visit Batter & Berries again. 2-Kappa Phi-2011
5/5/2018,20180505,5,4.17,I came here on a Saturday morning 2 weeks ago very busy but it was worth the wait time. I loved my breakfast I had the chicken and waffles and it was so delicious..
5/6/2018,20180506,5,4.17,"Cheesy hash browns?! My first time here today, with a friend. I had the brisket with hash browns. They substituted my eggs for fresh fruit. I'm in love. The food was well prepared, the service was good, and the manager was amazing! He informed me of the marination process of the brisket. I'm coming back soon!"
5/7/2018,20180507,5,4.17,"I go here so often, I'm surprised I've yet to write a review. I heard about B&B on FB and had to go and see what all the hype was about. Literally since our first visit, my family and I never want to go to any other breakfast/brunch spot LOL! I no longer live in Chicago, but going here is a MUST whenever I am in town. They have a standard menu, but they also have specials that change weekly. Because of this, I have been here countless times and have yet to repeat a meal. And everything I've tried thus far has been a HIT! The customer service is exceptional as well, I've never been here and felt that I was treated rude or wasn't listened to. One of the waiters even comes by and tells jokes/riddles every time we are there lol. Literally the only negative comment I have is that the wait is pretty long when we go, usually around an hour. However, the restaurant is pretty small and the fact that we usually go during their peak time on Sunday, our family expects to wait and they continuously prove to be worth the wait. Also, when we are seated, our food always comes very soon after we order so it makes up for the wait time. I say all this to say, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"
5/9/2018,20180509,5,4.17,"I love this place for brunch! Food is great, but the wait is really long. It is always worth the wait though"
5/9/2018,20180509,5,4.18,This place was amazing. We were a larger group but they accommodated us without issue! Everything we had was awesome. Highly recommend!
5/9/2018,20180509,4,4.18,"Waitress was knowledgeable and detailed. She was very passionate, it was quite charming. The order did not come out quite right, however, they fixed it within 5 minutes. Once the order was delivered, the chicken and waffle were extraordinarily unique and tasty. The entire staff and management was so gracious and friendly. I enjoyed my visit. This is a lively spot, loved the mix of Chicagoans. Not to be missed whether you live here or in for a visit."
5/11/2018,20180511,2,4.17,"Really don't get the hype. It was fine, not worth the wait, and after we left our credit card went missing and a $400 charge at Marshall's was posted. Super weird.I feel it has a cult following, there are plenty other yummy breakfast spots in the area.Staff was fine, it was super busy, you can BYOB."
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.17,"My husband and I stopped in early on a Friday and were told there'd be a 20-minute wait. It was surprisingly maybe 10 minutes. We had the sweetest waitress who welcomed us to the city and made great recommendations for the restaurant and the area.We split the French Toast Super Flight, which included a slice of the Amaretto on special. He also had the ribeye omelette and I had the sausage omelette. It was all amazing and we definitely left some on our plates.The flight, though, was the star of the menu. I'm not usually one to order French toast, but this was a game-changer. It was somehow light & fluffy, yet packed with flavor and the garnishes made each piece a new experience. My only negatives: A server spilled a good amount of coffee on the table while pouring into my cup and did not offer to clean it up. We were seated by a window, which was great except it was very hot with the heater running full blast nearly the entire time we were there.That said, the rest of our experience more than made up for the negatives and I would (and have) highly recommended this spot to people in the downtown Chicago area."
5/11/2018,20180511,5,4.17,Love the French Toast Flight and the Caramel Pecan French Toast. Overall worth the wait!!
5/14/2018,20180514,4,4.17,"This is a pretty good breakfast restaurant. The food tastes clean and fresh. The servers are super friendly and the coffee is flowing. If you don't want breakfast, the sandwich options are nice. Of course, I'm a fan of breakfast!Be advised of that the restaurant does not accept reservations, and they don't accept American Express cards."
5/14/2018,20180514,5,4.18,"I came on a Friday near 11 am - 12 am. Let's just say this place was packed, but it was a great spot for brunch. The place is BYOB so you can bring your own alcohol and purchase the juice there. Food portion was generous. I got the lobster omelet that was amazing and highly recommended by the servers. I would recommend getting their hot sauce on the side, if you need some spice in your life. I also got a side of strawberry French toast, it was delicious and wasn't too sweet."
5/15/2018,20180515,5,4.18,"I have waited a while to eat here and it was definitely worth the wait! Tried the Super flight which was a sample of each flavor of French Toast. So good! No syrup was needed. Also had the chicken fajita omelette, which was delicious. The hash browns were done so well, not dry and the eggs were made with cheese inside. Our server Tim was excellent! He is knowledgeable about the menu and specials and even brought over a special type of hot sauce to our table. It went so good with the hash and eggs. Just amazing! I will definitely be back. Oh, and the coffee. It was strong, just how I like it! 5 stars."
5/15/2018,20180515,3,4.18,"I have a mixed review for this obviously loved breakfast/brunch place. When you think of a Monday morning brunch with friends, you want to hang out and enjoy a great relaxing catch up. It's breakfast and a leisurely activity. So while the food was great. Our waitress so lovely. The management would not seat us in a very open restaurant until our stuck in traffic nearby friend arrived. And then when we were seated able to catch up, they cleared our table rudely pushing us out after our 20 minute meal. I'm sad as this place has great omelettes -- I had the Green City. It's just my expectation for brunch is relaxation and conversation. This was not a place for a relaxing meal with friends. Great food. Just not the vibe for relaxing breakfast. My opinion."
5/16/2018,20180516,5,4.18,"Batter & Berries is by far my favourite breakfast place in Lincoln Park. It's quick, reasonable and absolutely delicious. Last time I was there I ordered the French Toast Fleet and it was easily the best french toast I have ever had. It is busy from the moment it opens so I recommend getting their early or being prepared to wait a little bit but it is highly worth it. The wait-staff are very friendly, and even got me a To-Go cup of coffee before I left. Will definitely be back sooner than later!"
5/17/2018,20180517,4,4.18,"The food was great! I ordered the flight of French Toast which was good but you can get French toast anywhere. I feel like they have so many other great choices for brunch that are savory. If you are just looking for something sweet the French toast is the way to go but if you are hungry after the 2 hours wait would recommend getting something more filling. The space is pretty tight so you will be a little close to other people but it wasn't that big of a deal, especially when the service is great and the food came out pretty quickly."
5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.18,"Okaaay. After laying around for the better part of the day, my significant other and I realized that we were both starving and it was getting to be around noon. We decided on this place as it was pretty close to my place and was BYOB. We arrived with cold champagne in hand and were told the wait was going to be an hour and a half to two hours. About three and a half hours later we finnnnalllly got the call.Once we got back to the restaurant, we checked in and then were taken to a ""waiting area"" within the restaurant where we waited another 20 minutes.HOWEVER, when all was said and done, they put our champagne on ice, we ordered way too much food, and had one of the best brunches of my life. The food is insanely good, the service was even better, and now I know if I ever want to go again I just have to show up at daybreak and get in line."
5/19/2018,20180519,5,4.18,"Only open from 8a-3p so get there only. I arrived around 10am and the wait was approximately 30-45 min. I ordered the lemon pepper omelette and a half order of strawberry french toast. The omelette was well seasoned topped with mixed veggies and the sauce was superb. The french toast was amazing as well. It was covered in strawberries and a red sauce that was not too sweet. I also didn't know Batters and Berries was BYOB until I saw other people arriving with bottles of champagne. The food, customer service, and the overall ambiance was exceptional. Will return again!"
5/24/2018,20180524,4,4.18,"We came here for the first time yesterday afternoon. It was still very crowded but our wait was less than 5 mins for 2. Our server was wonderful. I didn't get to ask what her name was. Everything we ordered was amazing. Especially their homemade hot sauce made the meal much better. I couldn't help dipping my sweet potato fries in it. It was also very loud in there. Despite it being a small table, I still couldn't hear my partner without screaming. Overall I gave it a 4 stars because the waffles got tiring after a while."
5/24/2018,20180524,5,4.18,"This place is amazing for breakfast!!! The atmosphere and service were great - went on a weekday around lunchtime and though the place was crowded we were seated immediately! We ordered the click and gaufre, which was excellent. The chicken was perfectly spiced and the waffle, while seemingly slightly dry at first, was perfect when combined with the butter that was given. We also ordered the special french toast, champagne and passion fruit cream. This was phenomenal and really sealed the deal for us on this place. Definitely worth going here!"
5/26/2018,20180526,5,4.18,Excellent food and service. We had chicken and waffles and the French toast and they were both very good . Will definitely be back on our next trip to Chicago
5/27/2018,20180527,3,4.18,"First time at Batter and Berries and absolutely loved the Toast Flight! The toast of the day was Sangria and it was just perfect. I ordered the short rib hash glazed in some type of chocolate and bourbon sauce from a local brewery, and it was sweet..Not too sweet but sweet enough to tell that it wasn't a perfect combination for this particular plate. However, the ribs were cooked to where the meat just melts in your mouth. Service was nice and personable. The exec chef and GM do a very good job in making sure you feel at home. The Chef definitely has a sense of humor (he probably should do stand-up on the side). Jeffery was also great. I will be coming back and trying a different plate! Tip: Expect to wait 1-1.5hrs even during non peak hours. We left at closing time and there were still people dining in."
5/28/2018,20180528,5,4.18,The wait was insane and the food was 100% worth it! Service was excellent! The blueberry French Toast was so delicious I came back for it the next day on my Chicago visit. This place exceeded every expectation. I had the French Toast flight and the special which was a lobster omelet- crushed both of them with my smile on my face.
5/28/2018,20180528,2,4.18,"I usually don't write yelp reviews since I know what it's like to work in the service industry with so many different factors coming in to play and I'm VERY patient, but this was probably the worst dining experience I ever had.I was excited to try this place after reading all of the reviews during my visit in Chicago. I requested to be placed on the wait list for a party of 1 and my quote time was for 30-45 minutes. I thought, not bad considering that most brunch places have long wait times. I saw then that many were leaving and most people that came after me and before were already seated and gotten their food. I would've left by then but I was so far out from where I was staying already and have been waiting.. so I came to check in about my table three times after waiting over the quote at none of which a hostess tried to get me a seat as I saw that there were plenty of open ones at the communal table. Finally got sat down after almost an hour and a half and my food didn't come for another 25-30 minutes and the people around me who ordered after even already received their food. The salmon croquettes was a little too much and underwhelming. I think after that long of a wait, I definitely had lost my appetite and was disgusted overall. Don't come here if you want to waste almost two to three hours of your life."
5/29/2018,20180529,5,4.18,Always a good experience when I get out to Lincoln Parker . Phenomenal food as well as service . This time around on the super flight the sangria flavored French toast special was underwhelming but that is just not my preference of flavor.
5/29/2018,20180529,5,4.18,"Great place for breakfast, brunch. Good service too. If you are looking to try a new brunch spot and want pancakes or french toast and check this place out. Get the french toast flight!"
5/30/2018,20180530,5,4.18,This place was unique and very delicious. Overly sweet for my palate but this was definitely a place I'd like to bring my family when they come from out of town or when we would like to try something new and different. The food is truly unique and impressive and over all delicious. Just too sweet for me but my family loved it!
5/30/2018,20180530,5,4.18,"I generally don't write Yelp reviews but because I had an amazing experience here I decided to do one. I came here for brunch and everything was great. Great food and phenomenal customer service. It was about an hour wait, but once we ordered the food took about 15 mins to come out. Super quick! My only compliant (which is not really a compliant) is that it is byob but it does seem like they want to get you in and out so it doesn't leave much time to drink a whole bottle of champagne. I would definitely come back though."
5/30/2018,20180530,5,4.18,"We drive quite a ways to come to this place, but it was so worth it. The food and the service was unmatched. They make you feel so welcome here and the fooooood, don't get me started on the food. It was so flavorful and delicious and the brought it out so quick. It wasn't had to find parking either. Will definitely be returning soon!"
5/31/2018,20180531,5,4.18,"Awesome place! Literally a little goldmine, my wife son and I totally love this place my son even asked if we could have breakfast there everyday, I e tried so many of the French toast which I highly recommend! The service is awesome, there's a young gentleman always entertaining us with riddles it makes it a great time, not to mentioned the food comes out fairly quick! But be warned you will wait anywhere from an hour plus just to get a table."
6/2/2018,20180602,5,4.18,"My fiance and I came here for the first time today. The service was great, the meals came out promptly. Make sure to get the French toast flight. You won't be disappointed. The wait for to be seated was about 30 min. But well worth it. Our server was very personable with everyone he waited on. Also got a few riddles thrown at us. All in all a perfect visit."
6/2/2018,20180602,5,4.18,Special FlightExecutiveChicken SausageFood was out within minutes of ordering it seemed and everything was excellent. This is how french toast should be made.
6/3/2018,20180603,5,4.18,"I absolutely love this place! I have gone multiple times but I like to go alone so I can get seat quickly. When I eat alone, I'm usually seated at the big communal table in the middle of the restaurant. If I am not alone, I know I have to wait to eat. This is one of those places that is worth the wait. I love the french toast. The staff is friendly and knowledge about the food. I was shown pictures about the specials. Now that I've moved out of Chicago, I always come back when Im in town."
6/4/2018,20180604,4,4.18,"What a small world that when we arrived to this brunch spot, one of the wait staff employees used to be one of my mother's tenants! We would have loved that she was our wait staff; my daughter preferred a table not by the window. Our waitress was friendly, hoever her voice was soft spoken and would ask her to talk louder plenty of times.Place used the space well; in the middle of the room there are benches to wait inside for all the members of your party to arrive or wait for a table available. I would assume this spot is very popular to accommodate hungry eaters. I felt the tables were too close together...I ordered the french toast flight and for a few dollars more, the french toast sample of the day. Obviously all the fruit toppings and batter were too sweet that i could barely finish 2 slices out of 5 so great to have leftovers.Not the best Ive tried in terms of size, I did enjoy the unqiue taste! I also ordered one of the 5 breakfast specialities called the movin on up executive 7 oz Lintz Heritage angus ribeye steak with grilled unions, mushrooms, 2 eggs, hash brown and caberet sauce. I wasn't too fond of it and glad to have at least I tried this dish and wouldnt have to wonder with regret."
6/4/2018,20180604,5,4.18,Very fulfilling nice ambiance and great food.The Carmel French toast and Lemon pepper lobster omelets was outstanding. The owner is the great person to speak to make you feel right at home. Overall great experience and I will be returning. Thanx Batter & Berries Chicago
6/6/2018,20180606,5,4.18,Delicious food and quick service. Our server Tussemi was very informative and friendly. We can't wait to go back.
6/8/2018,20180608,1,4.18,"There was anything more frustrating than trying to eat here.Honestly I don't even think this restaurant deserves 1 star. I am ok to wait for 40 mins to get a table but never expecting to wait almost an hour and the food never comes out; as a result, we had to leave. All they need is to be honest with customers and at least tell us that we will probably have to wait 1 hr to get food so we know what to expect. Staff kept coming to our table and told us it will be for a few mins but we never see our food on the table. Waiting for almost 2 hrs for no food!! If you want to waste ur precious time, u can come here but there are probably a lot of better breakfast restaurants in Chicago!"
6/9/2018,20180609,4,4.18,"BEST BRUNCH PLACE EVER IN YOUR LIFE! But giving it 4stars as the past few times we have gone there, even early morning, there has been 1-1.5hr wait! so disappointing! PLEASE open another location!"
6/9/2018,20180609,4,4.18,"I came to this place roughly two years ago and decided to come back while visiting. I don't know what was going on this particular day but the food took FOREVER to come out! The manager was very proactive though and had the waitresses to give a 10% discount because if the extensive wait. Now...(dramatic pause)...on the food.... it was amazing!! I had the shrimp fajita omelette and hubby had the lobster omelette and an order of the strawberry french toast. We were both more than satisfied with our food choices. I saw a few plates of the chicken and waffle and I must say that it definitely looked appetizing. The restaurant has a cozy feel to it because there is not a lot of space in there. It can definitely have you feeling like you're sitting in a place that's on the verge of being cramped. Overall it was good so if you're in the area, I highly suggest checking this place out."
6/10/2018,20180610,5,4.18,"delicious, but you're probably going to wait, try going across the street to the bowling alley place, they do a mean bloody maryb&b is byob, so keep that in mindmy favorite is the chicken n waffles but ask for extra syrup, it doesn't come with any."
6/11/2018,20180611,3,4.18,"This place didn't totally live up to expectations.First of all, the food itself: As a professional pancake pundit, I am constantly looking for the best 'cakes. At Batter & Berries, they are clearly the red-headed stepchild behind their french toast and waffle offerings, crammed into a small corner of the menu. I went for the buckwheat cakes, which had a lovely spicy taste. Bizarrely, syrup was not brought with the cakes because the ""syrup is already cooked into the pancakes."" Huh?? While the flavor was quite delicious on its own, the syrup helped the slight bit of dryness (perfectly understandable given they are buckwheat).I had my lil nephew with me and got him a kids-size chocolate chip pancake offering, and you may ask, did I try it? Did I literally steal food from a baby? HELL YEAH. I found flat, dry, chewy/tough pancakes barely masked by enough chocolate to give a 300-lb man a sugar rush for 2 days, so at least my nephew was happy. But you could get better pancakes at IHOP.Secondly, the service was not great by any stretch. The servers all clustered in their serving area, chatting with each other with their backs to the room. As a result, even waving our hands over our heads (literally, several times) wouldn't get us service - we either had to wait, or get up and walk across the restaurant to grab something. Our food got delivered piecemeal and things were forgotten (side of fruit, syrup, and so on) but our waitress didn't come check on us as food was delivered, so again - wait, or aggressively flag down. She did show up halfway through our meal, and of course by then we'd managed to find what we needed.The big question: Worth the wait? DEFINITELY not. We got there at 8 am on a Sunday morning and were first in line, so I can't imagine waiting in the 1-2 hour line that often forms later in the day. Will I be back? If one of my friends really wants to go, and is willing to go when there isn't a wait...maybe."
6/11/2018,20180611,1,4.18,"Awful service, average food. I put my name in for a table for 4 at 10:55 a.m. and was told it would be about an hour wait. At 12 p.m. I went to check the status, as we had not been called or updated...I was told it would be anither 30 minutes. Finally at 12:35 we were called and taken to the ""waiting area"" where we waited for anitger 20 minutes. Finally at 1pm we were at a table. The menu looked good, and after waiting another 20 minutes our order was finally taken. We ordered a french toast flight for the table to share as a starter and asked if that could come out first, because we were starving at this point. Other customers who were seated after us recieved their food (including french toast flights) whe we waited. We waited 30 minutes for our order to start coming out. The food was warm, not hot and came out staggered...so we were not really abme to eat as a group. Even with two people orderimg the same dish...those dishes came out about 8 minutes apart. My biscuits and gray was missing the egg on top and the egg came out separately in a bowl about 10 minutes after my food. The biscuits were dry and none of the rest of the food was spectacular. Not the service or food I was expecting after the waiting half of the afternoon just to be seated.You can get better, warmer, faster food and a much shorter wait somewhere more convenient. Skip this place in my opinion."
6/11/2018,20180611,5,4.18,"Absolutely delicious and the customer service was awesome. Unless you get there early, you will have a pretty lengthy wait. Large parties (more than 4), you can expect at least an hour, if not longer. Oh, but once you sit down and partake in the delicious French Toast Flight, you will not even remember how long you waited. A ""must try"" when visiting Chicago. You will not be disappointed."
6/11/2018,20180611,5,4.18,This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city. The French toast flight is to die for. Since it was packed we had to wait a little bit for our food but it was worth it.
6/12/2018,20180612,5,4.18,"Always get the French Toast Flight! It features the top four, along with the weekly special. But don't be misguided, all of the food is delicious, the service is superior, and the ambience is super social. The staff is always very friendly and will make the experience all the better. Been multiples and never disappointed. It has become on of my top picks when friends are in town visiting. Also, bring your bottles; because this place is BYOB! The only thing I would change about this place is the wait time. It is not registered with the no wait app, and there is not true waiting area. So in the summer it's cool because there's plenty of storefronts you can browse while waiting for your text confirmation. In the winter, idk- you're on your own!"
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.18,"What can I say, this place is amazingly delicious. The wait is ridiculous though. Our wait this time around was 1:45. Last time it was 2:15 and guess what? We waited hahaha!Bring at least two bottles of champagne and order the large orange juice.They open the bottles for you.We always order the flight to share. Then we order off of the board. I have never ordered my actual meal from the menu because those specials always get me. I've had the salmon special, omelet special, pork chop special, and a few others. I generally spend close to $30, which is cool with me. Its a small local spot. I do wish they could increase the space just a little. On my last visit we sat next to Ty Young (WNBA player) and Deon Cole (Blackish) yes he took a picture with me (I asked for it after he was through with his meal)."
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.18,This was one of my best dining experiences in a long time. I got the Lemon Pepper Lobster Omelet and The French toast Super Flight. Can I just say OMFG. Terica was our server and she was a true delight. She was very informative about the product and they have ipads with pictures which is really cool. I will definitely be returning
6/14/2018,20180614,4,4.18,Delicious food and we always get a pitcher of the fresh grapefruit juice to go with our byob champagne! The service is awesome and friendly. Servers are willing to make recommendations and they know their stuff. Only complaint: the music can be a little too loud for brunch conversations.
6/14/2018,20180614,5,4.18,A nice little breakfast joint with French toast as their specialty. The waitress told me that had offered over 180 varieties and they kept coming up with new ones. I tried their special French Toast which was Pineapple upside down with Rum. OMG it was so delicious! Even the butter was sweet and tasty that I didn't need to add syrup to the French toasts. The pineapples gave them a refreshing sweet and sour taste which was just perfect. Too bad I am a tourist or I will come here every weekend to try their new special.
6/15/2018,20180615,5,4.18,My first time here and I must say it was hella tasty! I'm from Houston so when I make my next visit I'm stopping here first the Carmel French toast was to damn good! The service was awesome!
6/16/2018,20180616,1,4.18,Rude and cocky staff. Longest wait even when we got seated. Food is aight. Nothing toooooooo crazy. Seating is horrible. Banana waffle is 7/10. Not sure if I'd be willing to do the wait again.
6/17/2018,20180617,5,4.18,Came here on my birthday both the food and the customer service is amazing. Our server was very informative regarding the menu options and limited specials. I ordered the shrimp fajita omelette with a side order of the caramelized French toast. The French toast is the absolutely best I have ever had in the U.S hands down. The shrimp fajita was very flavorful with the perfect amount of seasonings. My friend ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffles the chicken was delicious. The waffle was a little grainy but when you combine the chicken the waffle and the butter and hot sauce in one bite it's delish. I will definitely come back before I leave.
6/17/2018,20180617,1,4.18,"Terrible service, too long of a wait we got here at 9 and didn't sit down til 12 and the wait on the food was 45 mins the food isn't the greatest overall bad experience and bad attitudes"
6/18/2018,20180618,5,4.18,CHEESY HASH BROWNS! Need I say more? Everything from service to food was great. High fives from Los Angeles.
6/20/2018,20180620,4,4.18,"Out the gate....This will be a repeat stop for sure! Like most places in the area parking is not the best you have to find street parking and pay the meter. Let's get into it when i arrived the place was packed!! With a very diverse crowd which was cool! Even with business popping the staff was very impressive and worked as a very well trained team. My food arrived surprisingly fast, hot and cooked perfect. I have been to restaurants considerably less busy and didn't get this tentative service. The ribeye omlette was amazing.... tender cuts of ribeye cooked medium exactly as i ordered. The omlette was fluffy and everything seasoned just right. My mushrooms were a little overcooked but not terribly. They also make a meaaan fluffy pancake with a hint of lemon flavor with fresh fruit.This place has really got it together i can't wait to explore the menu more!"
6/20/2018,20180620,4,4.18,"Came back to chi-town and finally made it to batter & berries. What a treat! I had the French toast sampler: lemon & butter pecan French toastWere my favs w/maple butter..syrup who?! I stuck my fork in my girlfriends Plate for the short rib omelette-delicious. I also ordered eggs with cheesy hash browns and chicken sausage. The sausage was A Little dry, ok to keep it real it was a mess and needed some salt. Everything elseWas scrumptious to say the least. TheStaff Was Friendly Especially the manager he wasSuper nice and took our pictures. We bought a bottle of champagne for mimosas...byob, nice!!! I'll be sure to stop in for some good grub on my next visit!!!"
6/21/2018,20180621,5,4.18,"Batter & Berries is pretty much the Ruby Slipper of the Midwest with less luxury. Notorious for long wait times and a small space, this was a place I had to try while visiting the area. I decided to try the French toast special with cheesecake bites. I am not sure what it is called but it was out of this world. I also ordered hash browns. The food took a while to get out due to the large crowds but I still enjoyed every bite. Early arrival is suggested due to the fact that they do not take reservations and parking in the area is limited. This is a brunch spot that is very popular in Chicago and a must to try out, especially if you are visiting."
6/22/2018,20180622,5,4.18,Literally one of the best brunch spots in Chicago. Their French toast is unreal! My favorite is the lemon but the super flight is a great way to try them all. The service is always great and fast. The wait is long during busy times so come on a weekday early in the morning if you want to get seated quickly. Great place for kids too!
6/24/2018,20180624,4,4.18,"Great food. We were visiting Chicago and picked this place for a Wednesday 11am brunch, not realizing how popular it was. We were lucky and apparently showed on a slow day. We would be sat with no wait, HOWEVER every member of your party has to be there!! We made that mistake. Once our third member arrived we were sat.The waitress was friendly and helpful. We ordered immediately but the food took a really long time to come out... and then it came out in shifts, with me sitting around waiting behind. But lord when the food came we forgot all our qualms because the food was ah-maz-ing. All of it. Especially the sweet potato fries. We didn't mind the wait anyways because we spent the time catching up... we were just starving. If we had known about BYOB I think we would have been just fine.Basically its worth the wait. Just bring booze and don't be starving. You will be rewarded."
6/25/2018,20180625,3,4.18,"I had been wanting to come here for a while. Was sat pretty quickly since it was only me. They have a communal table. The waitress was friendly, but she messed up my order. I had ordered the super flight and they sent the regular flight. A plate of bacon was brought to me and i didn't ask for that. They gave me the order from the lady in front of me. The food was filled with butter, it was really really greasy. The toasts were nothing special. Food took quite a while to come out. Nice presentation of the food, but that's about it."
6/25/2018,20180625,5,4.18,"WOW the food is good! It's definitely worth the wait! We ordered the french toast flight, and an order of eggs and bacon. The french toast was AMAZING! It came with a blueberry, strawberry, pecan, lemon and cap n'crunch (the special). I think the lemon was by far the best (the cap n'crunch was a little too sweet), but all of them had plenty of fresh fruit and was very decadent! The eggs and bacon were also good.The service was prompt and they're very efficient. Yes, the wait is long, but come early (or come on a weekday), put your name down, and then explore the nearby area for a while. Then you'll be hungry and ready for some french toast :)"
6/27/2018,20180627,5,4.18,"Over an hour wait but it was worth EVERY minute. The lemon pepper lobster omelette was life. The sauce was so good it made me want to slap my momma. My daughter's pancakes were perfection! They didn't even need syrup, it was like Jesus made them himself. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable of their menu. And last but not least, bring champagne, it's byob. This place was everything ."
6/30/2018,20180630,3,4.18,"I know this place has a crazy wait on the weekends, so I came on a Friday at about 8:30, and am I glad I did! I was the first person in my group of five that arrived, and was told we couldnt be seated until all of the guests had arrived. We were seated promptly once everyone was together. I ordered the regular french toast flight, with lemon, caramel, strawberry, and blueberry. All were good, but my favorites were the lemon and caramel! Given how popular the restaurant was, I was underwhelmed with the french toast flight unfortunately."
6/30/2018,20180630,1,4.18,"this place is over rated. Food was subpar based on all the hype but the worst was the hot as hell restaurant.... No air circulating. Oh yeah and there was an hour and half wait to get sitted. And once we got sitted it took over and hour to get the food. So this was a 3 hour meal for subpar food. I order the brisket hash, butter cookie French toast, 1 biscuit, and an order of chicken sausage. The French toast was great but the rest of the food was not good. The biscuit was cold, the hash brown and brisket was not seasoned. It was very basic. And the chicken sausage just didn't taste good.Overall ...this was a waste of town. I had wild berries the day before and the experience was totally different....food and service was great."
7/2/2018,20180702,5,4.18,This was an amazing experience. From the service to the food. It was the best breakfast I've had from a restaurant. The french toast is to DIE for.
7/3/2018,20180703,5,4.18,"When i say phenomenal thats is exactly what the food is. They give you large quantities of food where you will leave full and good for the rest of the day. You will enjoy every bite of food that the cook has made. The omelets are amazing, for the week that i went it was the Jambalaya omelet! It was so good i almost fell out my chair lol. The staff were swift as possible, our wait was 45minutes. Good thing about our wait was, we could leave and come back because they had sms text alerts when to come back 10 minutes before your seating. The menu was very understandable and the prices were cheap. Enjoy a good breakfast!"
7/5/2018,20180705,5,4.18,Absolutely DELICIOUS!! Staff is friendly. Hostess is great at turning tables! This place is very popular. Almost always at least a 30 minute wait. Well worth it!! I have to go here every time i visit Chicago. I love the French Toast Flight - no syrup needed! Just the most delicious breakfast ever.
7/5/2018,20180705,5,4.18,Food was absolutely AMAZING!!! BEST FRENCH TOAST I've EVER had!!!! Will definitely be going back next time I vist Chicago.
7/6/2018,20180706,5,4.18,Fast service excellent food. This was close enough to the hotel with many positives on Yelp. Did not disappoint!
7/7/2018,20180707,5,4.18,An amazing food experience! Very crowded and loud and a long wait but worth it. Creative menu with new twists on old favorites. Try the French toast flight. Staff is very attentive and friendly.
7/8/2018,20180708,5,4.18,"This is my favorite breakfast place. Not only is the food wonderful but the staff is pleasant and professional, and the chef takes pride in what is cooked. I asked for a steak medium and the chef came out to my table to see how someone new had cooked it to what I asked. I cut it, he saw it wasnt and cooked another himself. Great food, a menu that continues to have new items (like the lobster omelet), and a professional and pleasing staff. I LOVED IT!!!"
7/8/2018,20180708,3,4.18,"Ok. Yes, just Ok. Busy, packed weekend mornings (did not visit during the week but I am guessing busy as well)!!! Long wait times!! If you are lucky enough to get a table for you and your party, good. If not, be prepared to sit at the large group table with 6 - 10 of your newest friends and discuss what everyone has or is going to order. Also, limited waiting space so plan on a little window shopping in the area. Here is my quick recommendation:Get their ""special of the day"" french toast sampler. Why? Because like I said to start this off, everything about B&B is just that, ok. At least with the sampler you can say you tried one creation that no one else did.Before coming here, I read a few reviews. One that stuck out was written by Sarah D. Read her review as it covers a lot more. But I concur with her final paragraph. B&B not worth the wait. Am I going back? I will drive past and drop off my gf at the door. If she waves to come in, I will go park because that means we can get a table. If she comes back to the car, there is a wait.Again, let me reiterate... ""ok""."
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.18,Amazing the best French toast I have ever tasted. I ordered the Caramel French Toast the maple butter melted like ice cream!!!
7/10/2018,20180710,5,4.18,The food was delicious! All 4 of our kids (11-15) emptied their plates and loved their food! Our waiter entertained us with riddles and was very helpful.
7/11/2018,20180711,5,4.18,"I'm not sure I can tell you enough just how much I love this place. If it were much closer, I'd be here every weekend. There's a wait but I'm telling you, its worth it. Not enough street parking outside but hope and pray that u get one so you can wait in your car. There's not a lot of space for waiting inside either. Its a pretty loud place but the food and the coffee is just too good that I forgot about the noise. The french toast sampler was so worth it and that chicken and waffles remind us of home. Definitely one of the best breakfast places I've been to."
7/11/2018,20180711,3,4.18,"A brunch place worth trying, if you can even get in! I go to a hair salon down the street and every time I've tried to come here, the wait is over 40 min! Today was my lucky day, the wait was only 15 min for 2 people at 11 am on a Wednesday. I came with a vegetarian, which limited the menu for us. I'm sure their fried chicken sandwiches, lobster omlettes, and the other delicious sounding/smelling/looking things will be my order next time. However, I would not recommend the portabella hash - it was mushy, brown, oversauced, sour, and a little strange. We got a side of hash browns (since they looked so good on everyone else's plates) but it was pretty standard, nothing special. We ordered the French toast flight as well, and THAT was delicious! Served with real maple syrup and maple syrup butter, the French toasts were fluffy and delicious. Not nearly as overpriced as many of the other over hyped brunch spots in Chicago, and that French toast was... Dreamy. Fast service, relaxed casual atmosphere, and friendly staff. Would recommend trying the French toast for sure!"
7/11/2018,20180711,3,4.18,"I liked the concept, but I thought the food was just kind of average and the service was very slow. The atmosphere also bugged me. It was waaaay too loud in there-- I don't know if it's just too echoey of a space, but that, paired with the pretty bad, blasting loud music and the amount of customers who were in there made it impossible for me to hear anything my friend was saying to me or the waitress when she did happen to come over to our table. We didn't have to wait but maybe that's because we went at 2pm on a weekday. I wanted to like Batter & Berries, but it just didn't live up to my expectations unfortunately."
7/12/2018,20180712,5,4.18,"Great service, great people, OUTSTANDING food. When in the Chi be sure to come through!!!"
7/15/2018,20180715,5,4.18,"This is my first time in Chicago and I'm glad we did brunch here. My friend and I ordered a half order of the caramel French toast to share and it was delicious, no syrup needed. Just add the maple butter and enjoy! For my meal I ordered the salmon croquettes which was equally good. Seems like ordering something from the specials is the best decision since it seems a lot if the pictures from yelp are of the specials. The specials rotate monthly so what you see in pics may or may not be available. Our server was great too, I wish I remembered his name but he had tons of great riddles, I figured out all of them except one. Would definitely return."
7/16/2018,20180716,1,4.18,"Packed as usual ... I got a seat right away at the community table but had to wait almost 20min b4 some1 came to take my order. The server was extremely apologetic when she did finally come to take my order. She explained they had several call outs. I get it I'm in the business ... however the bus boys, hostess and others ( who I saw doing nothing at time) could have been more helpful and had better attitudes.At long last- 15 min after my order was placed-I received my over cooked poached eggs (see below). As i said, I'm in the business so I get and understand long wait time especially when you're short staffed ... but there is NO EXCUSE for the kitchen sending out over cooked food. My server has been great and I'll be tipping her accordingly for trying to make good of a very bad situation that was not her fault Think B& B has lost me as a customer."
7/16/2018,20180716,5,4.18,"Strap in. Cause it's about to get good. OH MY GOSH. Da bomb. The shizz nizz. El grand sabroso. Anything else you can come up with, throw it in there. I know I'm getting over hyped about a breakfast place that I've only been to once, but I gotta give credit where credit is due. There's always the ""IT"" factor that you always look for in a place, no matter what the occasion, and this place has IT. No, not Pennywise. The service is literally second to none, and if I do find one better, it'll only be a tie for first. This is cool version of what other restaurants have. Yep, the people are just cooler. Check it out for yourself. It's a cute location off a small busy chicago street, and the layout just allows you see outside no matter where you sit. There's also this high top seating right in the middle that is treated like a bar. And by like a bar, I mean if there's an open seat, you sit. Okay okay okay, let's talk food.The Traditional (4/5)--- Crispy hash browns, choice of meat, and super creamy scrambled eggs. It's nothing special, and as long as you don't mess it up, things are gonna be fine, however, these eggs were better than average, and it just went well with the other two items.Chocolate Chip Pancakes (5/5)--- Yes. Just yes. To this day 7/16/2018, these are the best pancakes I've ever had from a restaurant. Pancakes are not the world's trickiest operation, but they were light and thick at the same time, with a solid portion of chocolate chips evenly spread within the cake. Oh, and drizzled with some chocolate sauce. That's usually my biggest problem when it comes to ordering chocolate chip pancakes; there's never enough chocolate chips. Which doesn't make sense, and then I can't keep track of which restaurants I need to request for extra chocolate chips. Banana-Walnut Waffle (NA)Overall, I'll be coming back when I get the chance. I live in the suburbs so it doesn't make sense to drive all the way to the city just for breakfast, but if I do spend the night somewhere, I'll be stopping here first chance I get."
7/17/2018,20180717,5,4.18,"This restaurant was absolutely amazing!!!! I ordered the blueberry waffles and a side of fried chicken breast. The waffle had blueberry cream on the inside (when I bit into it I swear I died and went to food heaven) and the chicken was moist and delicious!! We had to wait for 45 minutes but it was worth it. The service was fantastic and we got to meet the owner. I tell everybody I meet to try this restaurant. If you're in Chicago, please go and make reservations!!"
7/17/2018,20180717,3,4.18,"My food was fine, not bad and not great, until I cut a piece off of my waffle that had some plastic wrap inside it. They didn't charge us for the waffle, and they remade it, which is nice. I understand making a mistake, stuff happens. What I have trouble excusing is bring our party of four's food out at different times. Don't come here if you want to eat with your friends and family, because you won't get your food at the same time. It was not a waitable amount of time, either. 15ish minutes. :("
7/18/2018,20180718,5,4.18,Let's me start off by saying that Batter and Berries was great and definitely worth the wait. We tried to go Friday around noon and it was an hour and 45 minute wait. So we left and came back the next day around 10am and it was a 45 minute wait. You are able to bring your own bottle to brunch which was great. Some couples were able to go up a few block while they waited on their table to grab a bottle. My boyfriend had the lobster omelette as it was sooooo good! I had the different French toast and they were delicious also. I didn't care for the hash browns but everything else was delicious. They also give you regular frosted glasses to drink out of or you can purchase a flute with their name for $6. The place is pretty small but service is fast. I would definitely revisit if back in town.
7/20/2018,20180720,4,4.18,"Highly recommend this place. It has an electric vibe with the constant chatter of couples and families enjoying a meal. And, speaking of a meal....don't get one unless you want to fight. Because this food is so good it'll make you smack your mama. The caramel French toast...omg amazing. The shrimp fajita omelette was also really good. They could cut down the on chili sauce but otherwise, really really good. The cheesy hash browns were good. My only negative impression here was the bathroom. It was pretty gross. Everything else, wonderful!!"
7/21/2018,20180721,5,4.18,One of the best omlettes I've ever had the sausage gravy and hash browns were amazing
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.18,"A must visit while in Chicago! My family of 5 visited for breakfast. They have an great menu and I had a hard time deciding! They have a ""Flight"" of French Toast which is a ""sample"" of all their traditional flavors and the flavor of the week. This week it was Pina Colada and it was fantastic! My family had the cheese hash browns and they were super cheesy! My daughter had the fruit pancakes and never used a drop of syrup! We also had the breakfast sandwich with Texas toast and loaded with bacon. Go early on the weekends or be prepared for a wait. The customer service was also top notch with very knowledgeable and kind waitress, and someone always around asking if we needed refills"
7/22/2018,20180722,5,4.18,Great customer service. Friendly staff. Great food! Highly recommend. I had the cluck and gaufre and it was delicious!
7/23/2018,20180723,4,4.18,I love that this is a BLACK OWNED BUSINESS okkkkkkkkk......... The Deluxe Flight is to die for Impeccable SERVICE everyone gives you a warm welcome. The wait time is worth it. I enjoyed everything about this place.
7/24/2018,20180724,4,4.18,"Came back to chi-town and finally made it to batter & berries. What a treat! I had the French toast sampler: lemon & butter pecan French toastWere my favs w/maple butter..syrup who?! I stuck my fork in my girlfriends Plate for the short rib omelette-delicious. I also ordered eggs with cheesy hash browns and chicken sausage. The sausage was A Little dry, ok to keep it real it was a mess and needed some salt. Everything elseWas scrumptious to say the least. TheStaff Was Friendly Especially the manager he wasSuper nice and took our pictures. We bought a bottle of champagne for mimosas...byob, nice!!! I'll be sure to stop in for some good grub on my next visit Chi-town"
7/24/2018,20180724,1,4.18,"We went on a very slow Tuesday morning, with empty tables throughout the restaurant. We were a party of 6, and 2 of our friends were about 5 minutes behind us. The extremely unfriendly hostess refused to seat us until our entire party was there - despite the 15 empty tables in the restaurant- and informed us we could wait outside. We decided to sit as a 4-top and add our 2 friends when they arrived so we could at least get some coffee and check out the menu. Our friends arrived, and we asked to be reseated (again, at one of the 15 empty tables in the restaurant). The incredibly rude hostess REFUSED to seat us together. She said they have a ""no join"" policy, so our friends would have to sit at a nearby table IN THE MOSTLY EMPTY RESTAURANT. Now, I understand this policy on a busy weekend morning and completely respect it. But on a Tuesday, with a restaurant of empty tables, it was simply appalling customer service. We won't be back. Instead, we went down the street to Left Coast, which was delicious and had actual customer service. Go there instead!"
7/26/2018,20180726,4,4.18,"Batter & Berries is one of the better breakfast, brunch and lunch restaurants in Chicago. Their food's very good. They have an interesting and unique menu."
7/27/2018,20180727,5,4.18,"This place was soooooo good. I had the French toast flight and my husband had their current special, the lemon pepper lobster omelette. The flight was good, but the omelette was incredible! Their homemade hot sauce was out of this world amazing. Our server, Jackson, was so friendly and gave us the best service. We may come by again during our short stay on Chicago!"
7/28/2018,20180728,1,4.18,"You can tell the same chef has left the building. The food sucks as well as the hostess. Upon entering the hostess had a bad attitude. I for the life of me can not understand why folks hire hostesses who attitude suck. Also she had on a workout outfit on. I sure hope she didn't work out prior to come to work. Just nasty. Then we waited an hour to sit down. One of the person had left to go to the store thought she would be back in time so they wouldn't sit us. Whatever it was 4 in a party you don't have 3 table seats so it shouldn't matter. Then we sit down the only highlight was the server. He was awesome, tall guy with locs. He offered suggestions and was just on point with service. The food sucked! I ordered the French toast flight like I always do. It was dry, no flavor. I have been here several times prior to the previous Chef leaving so I know the difference in the food. All the food was mediocre. I will not be going back the food sucks, the employees suck except 1 and the wait suck. I am good on ever going to this place again."
7/29/2018,20180729,4,4.18,Love it! The wait is terrible but the food especially their french toast is to die for. Definitely recommend.One star off for the more than hour and a half wait.
7/30/2018,20180730,4,4.18,"What a delicious spot! A great neighborhood gem and worth the wait. My friend and I put our name down, then walked down the street to sit in the park until we got the text. Once we were in, we had a great two top table on the side but the place is rather loud and our food took 45 minutes. They were packed so it was nice of them to give them a heads up but frustrating that the food took so long. I ordered waffles which were incredible so definitely lives up to the ""Batter"" name. My friend ordered the veggie scramble but it was soaking in butter/oil/grease so maybe ask if they can cut back on it when cooking for you.Overall, it was great and I would totally go back with friends but I wouldn't go with more than 4 so you can for sure get a table."
7/30/2018,20180730,5,4.18,Incredible breakfast! I had the lobster omelette which was amazing. Perfect flavors blended beautifully! The cheese hash browns are the best I've ever had!! I didn't want to finish them but couldn't help it. French toast was delicious and so was the coffee. I loved the iPads that the servers had with photos of the specials! Very smart  Excellent service and we weren't rushed at all. Went during the week about 10:00 and had a 10 minute wait. We will definitely be back. Bravo!!
8/1/2018,20180801,5,4.18,This place is a well oiled machine! Food is excellent! Each dish we ordered was unique and full of flavor. Wait staff was quick and friendly. Will definitely go back!
8/2/2018,20180802,5,4.18,"I have been wanting to check this place out for a while now! Pro tip come here during the week! The wait isn't as long - you can check in and they will text you when your table is ready! We decided to check in and have a drink down the block. Aside from the hostess being grumpy the experience, food, wait staff was a 5 Star! I ordered the sausage omelette and it was Devine! The homemade hot sauce also complimented every bite! I only wish they would bottle and sell it!I will surely be back & with a bottle of champagne since it is BYOB!"
8/3/2018,20180803,5,4.18,"First time here! It was recommended to a friend by an Uber driver, so we decided to check it out! It had a moderate wait time for Saturday brunch! Once seated the server offered us drinks and gave us reasonable amount of time to look over the menu! We decided to share and ordered the 'Goof', 'French Toast Fright' (both pictures attached) and cheesy hash browns! The food tasted really good and you can tell it was fresh! The cheesy hash brown was a little cold when served but still tasted good. Overall great experience here and would try it again!"
8/4/2018,20180804,5,4.18,"One of our favorite breakfast places in Chicago. Great food, great service and my husband adored our waiter's riddles. Expectations for the French toast flight were high -- and they delivered. We got the super flight. The maple butter is everything. Usually I get sick of a full plate of French toast bc it's just tooo much sticky sweetness. This was a brilliant combo of flavors. Then there were the cheesy hash browns, which somehow were subtly the best part of the meal. I love potatoes and these are my fave breakfast potatoes in Chicago."
8/5/2018,20180805,4,4.18,"Food and service are excellent!!! Would give it 5 stars, but it is PAINFULLY LOUD. Maybe turning music off would help"
8/6/2018,20180806,1,4.18,"Originally I gave my favorite breakfast place a 5-star rating. I thought nothing would be different today when I ate there with my son, but boy was I wrong. The server was great but the service or should I say food wasn't. The reason why I'm saying this is because I ordered one of their specials. It was the egg white with lobster and some kind of sauce that I just didn't agree with. Most restaurants when you go there and you don't like the food they take it back no questions asked and make sure that you get your new meal within moments. This was not the case. Again, the server was nice she was apologetic and she quickly took the food away and put in my new order. The kitchen took it upon themselves to make me wait 45 minutes before sending my food. My son had eaten his food already and was ready to go at that point and so was I. I had an appointment and I explained it to my server and she said she was waiting by the kitchen to make sure that they give her the food right away and she was. When the kitchen finally gave her my food 45 minutes later the chicken sausages that I ordered were so small that they should not have been plated. I pointed it out to the server and she agreed but I was still charged for them. I can't blame the server because she did her job. I gave her a nice tip but man was I angry. It's not many times that I would give food back to the kitchen but I thought that this place of all places would make an exception to the rule and still treat you fairly. All this time that I've been coming here and all the money I've spent with my son eating breakfast here and I get this kind of treatment. It makes me never want to go there again."
8/6/2018,20180806,4,4.18,"The food is a 5 but I had to rate them a 4 due to the unpleasant hostess. My husband & I try to get out there at least once a month and everything is usually great! This last visit (8/5) there were 2 young ladies in the front. One was very polite, but the other one (black shirt) was pretty rude to my husband. I'm not sure if she was overwhelmed and/or having a tough day but she was definitely unfriendly. Everyone else was great including our waitress Jessica. The lobster omelet & french toast flight are a fav!"
8/6/2018,20180806,5,4.18,"Finally tried this place because my other regular brunch spots are closed Mondays. So glad I tried it! Was told a 50 minute wait but got in around 30 minutes. My sister got the strawberry French toast and I got the flight (trying a piece of French toast in every flavor). I liked this flight idea so indecisive people like me can try them all and get my true favorite next time. I was also impressed by the freshness of ingredients. I used to stay away from pancakes and French toast at these breakfasts places because it's like a sugar overload and it's hard to finish. This, however, was perfect! The strawberries and blueberries were EXTREMELY fresh and there wasn't an overload of syrup or sugar and the portions were perfect- I actually finished something! We let our server know we were in a hurry so she graciously gave us the check before our food came out but still checked on us until we were done eating- in and out in 25 minutes (). My latte was nice and strong. My only issue is that clearly this place is a buzzing, busy place. They have upbeat EDM music playing that does not calm down the environment. I love EDM but would recommend more mellow music especially in such a busy, almost stressful, environment. It's brunch not Sound Bar."
8/7/2018,20180807,5,4.18,"Wonderful service, very good French toast with interesting flavors. Overall quality breakfast foods!"
8/8/2018,20180808,5,4.18,"Fantastic brunch spot. First time in Chicago and heard fantastic things about this place. The wait was surprisingly long for a Wednesday afternoon but it was worth it. The food came out quickly and definitely lived up to the hype. We ordered the French toast flight, Executive (Steak and eggs) and the lobster omelette. The portions are a great size, we were stuffed but so pleased by the end of the meal. The manager was very friendly and we also got a chance to meet the chef. I will definitely make sure I come back anytime I'm in Chicago again and recommend to anyone I know who's in town looking for a great meal and experience. I hope they franchise and bring this to the South!"
8/8/2018,20180808,5,4.18,"O B S E S S E DBatters & Berries is an absolute MUST! The menu is literally overflowing w/yummy flavorful dishes...And let me not get started on their scrumptious hash browns!& YES there's usually an insane wait, but it's so worth it!!"
8/11/2018,20180811,5,4.18,"So, I was visiting a friend in Chicago, Batter and Berries was our first stop. I'm a Yelper so when I'm looking for food, Yelp is my go to.. the pix looked AMAZING!!! My friends and I were really looking forward to what apparently are the specials like the lobster omelette etc. so initially we were a little disappointed that those items weren't on the regular menu, and weren't specials for the day. Our waitress was so helpful. She showed us pictures of all the specials and gave really good descriptions. We all got something different so we could taste as much as we could! lol.. Also this place is BYOB.. wish I had known that! But apparently lots of places in Chicago are.. in addition to our server being helpful, there was a gentleman name Fredrick ( if my memory serves me well) he was very nice and gave us several places to visit during our stay.."
8/11/2018,20180811,5,4.18,THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! I really would have ate here everyday if it wasn't my first time in Chicago. You have to try. There is a longggggg wait. I went to get my nails and feet done across the street and my table still wasn't ready. But the wait was well worth it !
8/12/2018,20180812,5,4.18,"Excellent waffles and chicken, French toast and homemade sausage patty. I do not like waffles and French toast.... this place is highly recommended."
8/13/2018,20180813,4,4.18,"Yes, the wait is long. Yes, there's no where to sit. Yes, it's crowded. But all that is worth it when you have the house hot sauce. Yeah yeah yeah the pancakes and french toast are good but have you had the HOT SAUCE?! I wish they would bottle it and sell it because it's that tasty. A great Chicago establishment that's worth trying!! (Seriously please bottle and sell the hot sauce)"
8/13/2018,20180813,5,4.18,"This quaint family friendly restaurant was heaven on earth! The gourmet twist on simple brunch selections was delectable!After eating my meal and tasting my friends meals, the wait did not matter to us! It was worth it! Keep up the good work! Anytime I take a trip to Chicago, Batter and Berries is officially on my list of ""must eats""!"
8/13/2018,20180813,3,4.18,"I would typically give this lovely place 5 stars. I come here twice month and always have a great experience with food and service, but today they must of been off! First we get a cup of coffee that has someone's lipstick stain on it. Second it took our server a whole cup of coffee before she came to take our order! The hostess had to come and apologize and say she would be right with us! We both ordered French toast when she finally came to our table (and mind you it wasn't busy) and one came out before the other and to top it off they were cold. Then our waitress finally comes to the table to say oh let me check on the second order of French toast! What the heck is going on here! I've never experienced anything like this here and disappointed that I had too. Do better!"
8/14/2018,20180814,4,4.18,"Let's start off the wait is incredibly long. Here's a tip, show up a little earlier than you want and place your name in the waiting line. You will be messaged once it's time. In the mean time, walk around and check out some other places. Second tip, the place is BYOB, they will provide you with juice if needed. Place is pretty compact and noisy but food was excellent. If you're a fan of French toast, try out their French toast flight. Their specials are pretty on point as well. You will have to wait some time for your food and service in general is pretty sporadic from the wait staff. If you're able to do the wait, try it out atleast once."
8/15/2018,20180815,5,4.18,"Sweet potato chicken waffle and lobster benedict with cheesy hash browns, sooooo good!"
8/15/2018,20180815,3,4.18,"I wasn't wowed but that's probably because I didn't know enough before I showed it. For starters this place is BYOB so I could've brought my own booze! Secondly, always order the French toast. I got the steak meal & it was just ok. Rib eye doesn't make for a good breakfast steak - dutifully noted! Barely tasted the onions and the mushrooms didn't wow me. Overall disappointed needless to say I expect better next time. Oh and really long waits.... I went alone and had a 60 min wait!"
8/18/2018,20180818,5,4.18,"I have to preface this review by stating that I am NOT a breakfast person, but this was damn good! I'd been hearing for years that I needed to try this place the next time I was in Chicago, but I kept putting it off. My mom and I decided to dine here after we ran the BIG10 5k race. By the time we arrived, the wait time was already 75 mins! However, because I'm not a Chicago resident, I didn't mind as it gave me time to explore the surrounding area. This place is BYOB so as soon as we were seated, the waitress brought us an ice bucket for my prosecco. While it's BYOB, you have to buy juice from the restaurant. For my meal, I ordered the caramel French toast, a side of pork sausage, and a side of hash browns, and my mom ordered the Cluck N Gaufe (chicken and waffles). This was probably the best French toast I've ever had! It wasn't eggy at ALL, and was perfectly sweet and light. The sausage was a *little* dry and could've benefited from a little more fat being used in the homemade sausage mix, but still edible-- not a dealbreaker. The hash browns were also good and cheesy. The chicken and waffles was unlike anything I've ever had before. The sweet potato waffle was very savory, and the chicken was fried perfectly and slathered in hot sauce. Dare I say I loved a breakfast food establishment?!"
8/21/2018,20180821,5,4.18,"It was my first time visiting batter & berries and I had heard so much about how great the food is. That being said I was very excited to visit and try the food. I had the lobster egg white omelette which was phenomenal with the hash browns which was also good as well. It definitely lived up to its expectations. The host said the wait would be 83 minutes and I had heard about the long wait times, however I was lucky and only had to wait for about 30-45min. Also it was after 10am yet before noon when I arrived. My waiter was funny and awesome and I tried to catch his name but he whit-fully said it was ""To See Me"". All in all the food was awesome and the staff was warm and nice."
8/22/2018,20180822,2,4.18,"Wednesday, 11:15..... party of 1!! I was seated rather quickly, ordered right away. Waited about 50 minutes for salty hash browns with very little cheese. Eggs were A little runny even though I ordered over medium. I didn't have time to send food back due to an expiring meter and an appointment. My previous visit was nothing like this. I hope it was just a fluke!"
8/26/2018,20180826,3,4.18,"I wanted to really like this place as I'd heard a lot about it. Overall I thought the food was decent. However, it wasn't extraordinary. It was good but nothing I'd make a trip to Lincoln Park just to have. Also, I thought the hostess was extremely rude. I walked up to make a reservation and she was on Facebook on her phone. Being on Facebook wasn't an issue but she treated me and my girlfriend like we were an inconvenience to her day. After being sat I watched her treat multiple other people the same way. Not a great first impression for the restaurant. I get it, you're busy, but that doesn't mean you need to treat people like crap."
8/27/2018,20180827,4,4.18,First off the wait is RIDICULOUS!! I understand that everyone wants the food because it is good...a little above average...but the 90 minute wait is not worth it..I'm not sure of what needs to be done..maybe more cooks...bigger venue..SOMETHING needs to be done ..Thats abuse to the customer! We are there to support the place but JESUS... Just as many customers that they seat is the same if not more that they turn away due to the wait...Work on a business plan people because you DEFINITELY have something there.. Oh yeah..the fair skinned pregnant host...retrain her on how to be pleasant. It's still a business!!!
8/27/2018,20180827,1,4.18,"I went there with a group of 8 a while ago. On this particular time was my second time the first time was a pleasant time. But this second time we arrived in the morning on a Saturday , it was very crowded and the host said it will be 2 hours. We walked around for 2 hours and returned and our table wasn't ready. At this point we have been waiting for 2 hours and 15 minutes and asked the host what's going on. She had a bad attitude, and couldn't accommodate us, we then asked for a manager. She brought the manager and the manager tried to sweet talk us and we found out the host was the manager daughter. I believe that's why the host had a bad attitude and talked to us so nasty because she wasn't worried about getting fired. In the end we waited a total of 30 minutes passed the 2 hours. I will not be returning because the host attitude and vibe was awful."
8/27/2018,20180827,2,4.18,"Review is for our visit on 8/27/18. Find somewhere else to go for breakfast. You'll thank me: 1) do your stomach the favor and bypass this restaurant 2) this is one of those spots that Yelp reviews have failed - big time!! 3) I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. We thought we'd give it at try due to its current 4 star rating... boy were we highly disappointed! We sat right away (thank the Yelp Gods we didn't have to wait or I would've downgraded my review to one star). We ordered the french toast flight (what a joke for a place known for their french toast). To say we were highly disappointed would be an understatement. We also ordered the sausage omelet (it's a very plain omelet with some sausage pieces placed on top and covered in some gravy). Side note... the employees stood huddled near the back, several on their phones. Very unprofessional! I was excited to give this place a try but it definitely did not live up to the Yelp reviews."
8/27/2018,20180827,2,4.17,"8/27/18: Not sure what all the fuss is about? Thought we'd give it at try due to the 4 star rating. Wow, were we disappointed! Big time!! We were seated right away (thankfully we didn't have to wait for this meal or I would've been pissed and probably downgraded my review to one star). We ordered the french toast flight because our waitress stressed that this is what they're known for. Super disappointing. There was nothing special about it, plus it was already getting soft and soggy by the time it arrived at the table. We asked for syrup and were told they don't recommend using syrup because it's in the batter and butter. What? Also ordered the sausage omelet. It was just ok. A plain omelet with some sausage sliced on the top and gravy. The cheesy potatoes were okay, but underwhelming. And the house made hot sauce was salty. Let me also not forget about the slamming door in the background every time anyone came in or left. And the noise levels rose to an irritating level by the time we left. It was relatively quiet when we got there but throughout the meal the chatter grew, which is expected BUT the freaking music kept being turned up louder and louder to cover it. All of the employees stood huddled near the back, several on their phones. Very unprofessional. I was super excited to give this place a try but it definitely did not live up to the Yelp hype. Find somewhere else to go for breakfast. You'll thank me."
8/28/2018,20180828,5,4.17,"Be forewarned y'all, the place is absolutely PACKED. You will end up having to wait a hot minute for a table, but the wait is sooo worth it! They quoted my party of 6 two hours for the next table- it wasn't a problem since we were visiting Chicago, so we got to walk around and explore some. They send you text messages to know when your table will be ready soon and give you a decent amount of heads up before you have to be back at the restaurant. Our server, Tim, sent out a french toast flight on the house after we told him of my engagement. My tastebuds were sent straight to heaven as soon as I had a bite of the key lime french toast! The other flavors (caramel, lemon, blueberry, & strawberry, though I think they might rotate some of their flavors) were fantastic. None of them tasted too much like eggs and we didn't have to add any syrup to them at all.Coincidentally, I ordered the lemon french toast. They were nice and light, though I did need to add syrup to the full order since they were slightly more dry than the flight. Oddly enough, we had to request syrup, but it wasn't too big of a deal. My feyonce had the biscuits and gravy- so good! Not too greasy/heavy and the gravy was nicely savory.Only part I didn't enjoy was the noise level. I could barely hear a word our server or anyone else at the table was saying.. The restaurant could benefit from some soundproofing for sure.. but the service and that darn key lime french toast kept it from dropping below 5 stars."
8/28/2018,20180828,5,4.17,Great service! Our waiter was a delight and would ask funny riddles. We were recommended to have the Flight of FRENCH toast and I'm so glad they told us about it. Worth every calorie. They're so flavorful- they recommend that you don't use syrup until after you give them a try because they taste so well by themselves and the maple butter.
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.18,"Don't even try to tell me there's a better breakfast spot in Chicago, because I LITERALLY may have to fight you after the meal I just had at Batter & Berries. We got lucky and were sat immediately (we opted to sit at a community-style table since there was no wait)Drinks:- Coffee = 5/5Not bitter, very smooth- Hot chocolate = 5/5Unlike other places, has a distinct chocolate taste and isn't just brown water with whipped creamFood:- We shared an order of ""world famous"" strawberry brioche french toast. When I first read ""world famous"" on the menu, I doubted it would taste any different from what I was used to and I was WRONG! Don't forget to eat the sweet cream butter with it! - 5/5- Caribbean Pork Chop (from the special's board)The BEST pork chop I've ever had! Well seasoned and topped with a mango salsa. Came with eggs and hashbrowns (which already have cheese in them) but would probably be good over rice and served as a lunch/dinner plate - 5/5- Chipotle shrimp omelette (from the special's board)Very savory, but in a good way! Gave me shrimp and grits vibes (in regards to the flavor). Paired with hashbrowns, which (as mentioned) are slightly cheesy.Overall, I have NOTHING negative to say about this restaurant and am happy I was able to support another black-owned restaurant!"
8/29/2018,20180829,5,4.18,I love this place ... great food every time you dine there ! This is a must on your list of places to visit .
8/29/2018,20180829,4,4.18,First off the wait is RIDICULOUS!! I understand that everyone wants the food because it is good...a little above average...but the 90 minute wait is not worth it..I'm not sure of what needs to be done..maybe more cooks...bigger venue..SOMETHING needs to be done ..Thats abuse to the customer! We are there to support the place but JESUS... Just as many customers that they seat is the same if not more that they turn away due to the wait...Work on a business plan people because you DEFINITELY have something there.. Oh yeah..the fair skinned pregnant host...retrain her on how to be pleasant. It's still a business..
8/31/2018,20180831,5,4.18,"This is absolutely the most delicious breakfast food I have ever had. The french toast sampler is always perfectly sweet and the flavors are so unique. I recently had their lobster omelette, and I literally cannot articulate how insanely delicious it was. This is breakfast food to the NEXT LEVEL!The servers have always been kind of awkward and I don't like how they show you things on the IPad, but the food is so insanely good that I don't care, and it really isn't a big deal. Everyone has always been perfectly nice to me and I don't need my ass kissed when I'm hungover on a Sunday morning just trying to get some tasty French toast. I can't recommend this place enough."
9/1/2018,20180901,4,4.18,"Came here around 9:45AM on a rainy Saturday morning. We thought the rain would deter people from coming outside but nope, the restaurant was packed when we got there! We were quoted 80 minutes for a party of 3, so we decided to walk around the neighborhood while we waited. After only 30 minutes, I got a text from the restaurant saying our table was ready. We hurried back and got seated towards the back of the restaurant, which was packed and very noisy.We decided to order the famous French toast flight ($11.5) for the table (which came with a sample of strawberry, blueberry, lemon and caramel), and I got the special (crab cake Benedict $18) while my boyfriend ordered the Cluck-N Gaufre ($13.5) which was a dense sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken and topped with fried chicken and hot sauce. The waffle was extremely filling and tasty; it was a nice spin on the traditional chicken and waffles. The crab cake Benedict was way too salty for my liking, and I wished the hash browns were a bit more crispy. The French toast flight definitely lived up to its hype; all flavors were good and the maple butter was exceptional."
9/2/2018,20180902,5,4.18,"I have driven four hours just to have brunch here. Literally the best French toast I've EVER had. The French Toast Flight is fun to share as a brunch appetizer. You get to try like five flavors on the French toast! My favorite is the lemon. Plus the butter is so delicious, you don't even need any syrup. Not to mention they have deconstructed omelette like chicken Alfredo and lobster lemon pepper! You HAVE to make time to go here any timeYou visit Chicagoz"
9/2/2018,20180902,2,4.18,"The food is decent. But after waiting almost two hours to be seated as a party, we were split up. When asked why, was told that they: just wanted to get us in. We were a party of 9 and visiting from two separate states. While waiting to order, the large table opened up. This is the same large table that my wife and I were seated at almost a year ago and then asked to move for a larger party. Unacceptable!We were regulars until we moved to Florida. Will consider other BOBs in the future. It was fun while it lasted."
9/2/2018,20180902,5,4.18,"Awesome food and service! Was visiting from out of town and this spot was recommended by several different friends, both local and from out of town. We tried the Super Flight (my favorite was the Caramel french toast) in addition to the Caribbean Pork Chop and Chipotle Shrimp Omelette which were the specials. Each dish was delicious and well seasoned. Best brunch I've had in a minute! Our waiter was Tusiime. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, welcoming and entertaining. Get ready to answer his riddles :-)!"
9/2/2018,20180902,4,4.18,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT! Usually you have to wait a good 30 minute, but it is totally worth the wait. Foods bomb!!! Anything you try here is so good! And service is pretty good! Good amazing brunch spot"
9/3/2018,20180903,5,4.18,"Outstanding!! Im sitting in the window of the House Music driven soul food breakfast spot. Leslie was our server and she was great. Very nice and made great recommendations. The chipotle shrimp omelette, chicken sausage omelette top with chicken gravy and the signature dish Cluck & Goff were so good. I cant describe how delicious this food tasted. We waited for one hour and I would have wanted 5 hours for the food and experience."
9/3/2018,20180903,5,4.18,Every single bite is phenomenally prepared! Just wait for the taste to blow your mind! I will definitely be back and back and back. Mmm...
9/4/2018,20180904,5,4.18,"Upon high recommendation from my friend we went to this restaurant while visiting Chicago. She raves about their food and said nothing there that she had was bad. I am gluten free so breakfast spots are usually safe because I can get the basic bacon (or sausage) eggs and hash browns and be okay. I reviewed the menu briefly before we went and didn't see gluten free versions of their French toast she raved about. However, I still was excited to try the place and I was not disappointed. I was elated to see they had gluten free pancakes and let me tell you, they were probably some of the best if not the best gluten free pancakes I have had. They had some other delectable specials that day like chipotle shrimp omelet but I just had traditional breakfast with chicken sausage, hash browns and gluten free pancakes. I highly recommend the place. There is risk of cross contamination of course but I was fine. I will return to this place next time I am in the city. I was missing the pancakes the day after."
9/5/2018,20180905,3,4.18,"I realize that my 3 star review goes against most of the reviews for Batter & Berries on here, but it's the only amount of stars I could see myself giving. I came to Batter & Berries on Sunday morning and of course we had a pretty long wait (not a problem at all). Once waiting I received a text asking to confirm that I still wanted my table, I responded with the number it told me to and then I checked in about 15 minutes later. When I asked about the text they told me I cancelled the table and was taken off the list, but when I showed them my text message they said I did It right and just sat us down, which was kind of confusing. The menu is pretty big and offers pretty much every kind of breakfast a person could possibly want. I ended up ordering the Cluck-N-Gaufre, which was a chicken stuffed sweet potato waffle with a piece of fried chicken on the side drizzled in sauce. Now, from the description this was a breakfast that seemed to be destined for greatness in my stomach, but that's just not something I felt. When the food came I first tried the chicken and it was really good, a medium sized boneless chunk that had a kick to it. The waffle was my big letdown of the meal. The giant waffle was not great, I don't know if it was the taste or the almost dry thickness that made it hard to swallow. I was super excited to get this meal and it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I would be writing a completely different review if I ordered something else, I really don't know. But I just wasn't feeling the experience. Overall, this place is always busy and always has a wait so clearly people are loving this place. I wasn't big on my meal and I also wasn't very big on the pushiness of our waitress. I'm not saying that if I found myself in Chicago again soon I wouldn't give this place one more shot because with this many reviews and this amount of positive feedback they are clearly doing something right. I definitely think this is a place that everyone needs to try for themselves."
9/5/2018,20180905,5,4.18,Black owned spot. A bit of a wait but worth it!
9/9/2018,20180909,4,4.18,"The first time I tried to eat here I was told that the wait would be an hour and a half to an hour and forty-five minutes! My friends and I went somewhere else. I decided to give it another try and was told it would be an 80 minute wait. This time I decided to wait even though I was starving! I'd heard so many good thing about this restaurant. The wait time was accurate, I kept hoping that it was worth the wait. IT WAS! My friend and I shared the French Toast Flight, Cajun Shrimp Omelette which was the day's special, and house made pork sausage. The food arrived piping hot! The French Toast was incredible! The lemon was my favorite, wow! I'd go back just for the flight! The pork sausage tasted like the breakfast sausage of my childhood, it was delicious bringing back good food memories! I guess it's a good idea to try the specials because the Cajun Shrimp Omelette was a winner and those cheesy hash browns were a great accompaniment! Make sure you try those, you can get it as a side. This restaurant totally lived up to the hype and will be a regular spot for my family and I. My only complaint was that that service was a bit slow...took awhile for the waitress to come for our order and then the kitchen was backed up and our food took an awful long time; it happens. Other than that, everything was amazing and all of the staff was beyond friendly. It's BYOB, next time I'll bring champagne for mimosas! Also, the prices were good....I highly recommend! PS-There's no room inside to wait for your table, Heritage Coffee shop is up the street, I suggest taking a stroll and having a cup of coffee there while waiting for your table."
9/10/2018,20180910,5,4.18,"Amazing!!!! We went here twice. The wait was a good 30 minutes each time, but it is worth the wait!!! All of their plates are scrumptious. Try the French Toast Flight and Cluck and Gaufre waffles. It is breakfast heaven. The service is strong, and waitstaff is the bomb! My favorite breakfast spot in Chicago!!"
9/12/2018,20180912,5,4.18,"Argh... this is one of my favorite brunch places!!! The frustration is that I don't live in Chicago, so it will be a long long time before I can visit this wonderful place again. I came here on a Tuesday and the restaurant was bustling. There was no wait, but it was full. The waiter had so much energy that it was contagious (I hadn't had coffee yet). Each time our waiter came to our table, he presented us with a riddle and it was pretty fun to get our brains thinking. Now on to the food... The lemon pepper lobster omelet was delicious. It was about $19 of pure heaven. There were big chunks of lobster, with asparagus, bell peppers, and creamy sauce. It also came with cheesy hash browns. The hash browns had potential, but it was stale and not fresh. My boyfriend got the rib eye steak omelet and I thought it was good, but something that other brunch places also had. We shared an order of their peaches and cream french toast, a rotating flavor. It was one of the best french toasts I've ever had. I didn't need any syrup and I wanted to have a second stomach in order to eat another order. This place is a high recommend."
9/12/2018,20180912,5,4.18,"I came here with a group of 6 on a Saturday. We had someone come in to put our name in since we knew the wait was long, it ended up being an hour and a half (11:30 am seating time). However, when we left at 1pm tables were open and there wasn't a line outside the door, so maybe try your luck at going at 1 or later since it is worth trying, especially if you don't want to wait or don't live nearby to put your name on the list. The French toast flight was a must try for me and it lived up to the hype. I would highly recommend, especially since their name is batter and berries! The flight is perfect to share between 2-3 people as an appetizer or for one as a meal. They also have a lot of seafood egg dishes as their specials, such as a lobster omelet. I like their unique special offerings! They seem to do it well based on what my friends have told me.I split the chicken fajita omelet with my husband. It was the perfect portion size for one with plenty of leftovers. The meat was cooked perfectly, there were strips of chicken, onions and peppers on top of a cheese omelet. The meat quality was great, I'm very picky when it comes to meat so I can confidently write this. Most of their dishes, including this one, comes with a side of their cheesy hash browns. I'm picky when it comes to my breakfast potatoes, as in they must be the shredded kind, so I was thrilled, that their side dish is a cheesy shredded hashbrowns. We also split the chicken and waffles, note these are sweet potato waffles which makes the dish unique! I liked the spin on the dish!Our server was super fun and full of energy. He did an excellent job explaining each dish he maid me want to try everything! They like to tell riddles while you are waiting for your meals which was funny!My only complaint was that although food was flying out of the kitchen it took over an hour since we ordered to receive our food. I appreciate that they make it fresh and I know they are busy but after waiting an hour and a half to get into the restaurant plus an hour after ordering the wait was killing me! Friendly service, unique offerings, great food quality! This restaurant is highly worth checking out! I would do a late lunch for faster service and shorter wait time!"
9/12/2018,20180912,3,4.18,"BE PREPARED TO WAIT. Even if they tell you an hour, that is likely a lie. We came here a Friday during the day, and they told us an hour wait. We decided to go get champagne for our mimosas since it's BYOB. They said we'd get a text when our table is ready but we still came back an hour later. When we got there the host told us 10-15 more minutes. Fine. It ended up being 50 minutes, and the hostess got irritated when we asked for updates. We were OBVIOUSLY very hungry when we sat down and it took an addition 10 minutes for anyone to even come acknowledge us. We ordered right when she got to us because with a two hour wait you have time to peruse the menu. The food was PHENOMENAL. We all got the shrimp omelette special and it was so so good I wish I had it right now. It came with cheesy potatoes that also were incredible. I've heard good things about the French toast but when breakfast becomes a 4 hour ordeal it's annoying.Service is the reason for the 3 stars. Food is incredibleeee, just make sure you don't have anything planned for the entire morning."
9/13/2018,20180913,5,4.18,"This place is like a better Clarkes, which is saying something. I didnt like the chicken gaufre. i liked tbe sweetness, but i dont think i liked the breaded chicken with it. Will go back many many times. just be early! and they need longer days too!"
9/14/2018,20180914,4,4.18,"Every time I have been here the wait is always insane. So if you are a brunch lover, be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends!! Since the place is small, putting your name down on the weekends will still give you about an hour of standing time (usually outside so be mindful during the winters). The food itself was pretty good! They have amazing waffles! The traditional bacon and eggs are good too. This place is BYOB, so if you are looking for a place to do bottomless mimosas, this is not the place for you. The service is great and the server comes by frequently.Also, parking may be a little rough if you're driving since only street parking is available. There are some free parking around if you are willing to drone around and walk a block over. The brown line is about a 7 minute walk so public transportation is easy!"
9/15/2018,20180915,5,4.18,LOVE BREAKFAST AND BRUNCH Came for brunch on Saturday. i am visiting Chicago on my own since my husband is working. Most have been friendly and helpful. Some professed foodies i met last night said this was a must try for brunch. i made my way there. it was crowded and loud. Cute little place cheery decor and everyone having great time .. chatting and laughing. its byob and a few brought champagne and oj. i didn't make reservations but they seated me immediately at the end of a table where several separate couples were seated. my husband would have hated being seated so close to strangers but being alone and more social... i was fine      they are known for their French Toast and several to choose from ... never fear you can choose to order THE FLIGHT OF FRENCH TOAST. so you get one piece of several ... but lady next to me clued me into The SUPER FLIGHT. you get an extra which is oreo. omg. it all was so good.     service was fast and efficient. when they saw i wasn't using my knife and spoon they swiped it off the table without a word ... huh never had that happen.
9/15/2018,20180915,5,4.18,"Batter and berries was everything I needed and more. I had an early morning flight into Chicago, which my cousin was super happy about because she said... we can go before it gets too crowded ! I'm glad we did. The service was superb & the food was tasty as well. I really don't have any complaints. When we got there we were told it would be a 15 min wait, which just turned out to be under 10 mins. We were greeted by our server (an older gentleman with dreads)can't remember his name but he was really thorough when explaining the menu, specials etc. (I need that, so I was super appreciative!)My cousin & I both went for the crab cake eggs Benedict. The crab cake was amazing, I want it now! The holindaze was just right, not too much & the cheesy hashbrowns were really good! Our server gave us some of their ""special"" hot sauce and it gave the perfect kick to the hashbrowns. I'm not that big on hot sauce but I took some of that stuff to go!!  My cousin also got the double stuffed Oreo French toast. I got the strawberry French toast. Both amazing as well. SN: the butter they put on the French toast- to die for. Our server said it's so good, some of his customers call it ice cream!Xo,EP"
9/15/2018,20180915,5,4.18,"Best French toast anywhere, hands down. Try the Blueberry if it's your first time. The omelets are also solid it's their in house hash and garlic salsa!"
9/17/2018,20180917,4,4.18,"The wait is long but if you are lucky enough to snag a seat GET THE FRENCH TOAST! My crew and I shared a sampler (lemon, strawberry, blueberry and caramel). We also had individual entrees, Poutine, chicken & biscuits, shrimp and grits and a vegetarian plate. The other entrees were decent but nothing could stand up to the french toast. I would rank them:CaramelLemonBlueberry Strawberry When I return, just load my plate with the caramel and lemon and you won't have to worry about me anymore!"
9/17/2018,20180917,5,4.18,If I were to choose a last meal it would be the chicken and waffles (cluck and goof) from batter and berries. Most amazing fried chicken and the sweet potato waffle is the perfect contrast in flavor. Make sure to get the hot sauce and maple butter too. Oh and they have the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Get them with cheese. Honestly favorite breakfast in Chicago.
9/17/2018,20180917,4,4.18,"Great place, great food, excellent customer service. Weekends can be a bit hectic and the wait may be an hour, during the week though you get in and out pretty quickly. Its a BYOB so keep that in mind."
9/19/2018,20180919,5,4.18,"My husband and I both agreed that we had the best breakfast of our lives here! We are both pretty picky but the food here was amazing!!!!The entire staff, including the owner and cook treated us like we were family.Even their tea and honey was spectacular! I have never ever liked the taste of honey. I honestly did not know it was honey! I thought it was a fruit syrup!Our waitress Nadine was so terrific and helpful as well. Really an amazing place, with the best staff imaginable!"
9/20/2018,20180920,5,4.18,"Oooh is this place busy! We had an hour+ wait on a Wednesday at 10 but it was worth itt. I would suggest the specials. I had the shrimp mexican omelette and my friend had the French toast, it was amazing!! Portions were big and super delicious. The ambience at the restaurant was really lively and welcoming. I think if we had planned ahead and werent on such a time crunch, we would have enjoyed it more. Cozy little spot."
9/20/2018,20180920,3,4.18,Service here is always great! The food on the other hand is just okay. Too heavy and rich to actually enjoy the meals. The first time I visited was better than the last couple of times. Worth trying at least once though.
9/23/2018,20180923,5,4.18,"This is my all time favorite place to go to. It's literally a ritual for me to go here every time I go to Chicago. In fact, I feel like I betrayed Chicago if I don't go there. This place is nothing less than awesome. It's worth every penny!There's a wait as far as getting a seat, but that's because it's ALWAYS packed. So you know their food is fresh. I had a Chicken Alfredo omelette, and it was amazing!!! I also ordered their French Toast Flight, and I love that too!I love food; I LOVE THIS PLACE! I wish I could give it eight stars!"
9/25/2018,20180925,5,4.18,"BEST FRENCH TOAST I've ever had. I've been to a lot of places and had french toast but nothing bests this place. It is sooooo worth the wait. If you want to beat the rush come early. We've been here at least a half a dozen times and every time I get the french toast super flight. It comes with strawberry, blueberry, lemon, caramel and seasonal french toast sample. All of them are amazing. It's the perfectly consistency of soft and custardy on the inside and a crunchy caramelized outside. The most unique one if the lemon one. It's like a lemon square in the form of a bread. It's heavenly. I've also had the crab cake Benedict here. The crab cakes are mostly crab with very little filler. Only suggestion would be to put more hollandaise sauce on the eggs. The crab cakes soaks up a lot of the sauce.Overall, amazing french toast, great service and soooo worth the wait!"
9/25/2018,20180925,3,4.18,"I was so excited to see the raving reviews and a menu that is right up my alley, but then I got my good and it was nothing special at all. It's good, but I don't get such raving reviews. Seeing how I was only there once, maybe I need to try it again and order something different, however with all the other restaurants in the area and not having a lot of time to try them, I doubt I'll go back."
9/25/2018,20180925,5,4.18,Love this place!!! My sister and I try to go every time she's in town (she lives in Los Angeles). I took her for the first time a few years ago and she loves it!!! We always get the French toast (the flight for her & the lemon for me) and we share the newest yummiest omelette! It's always something new and delicious! This place gets really crowded because it is so good!!! And Definitely lives up to the hype each and every time I go.
9/26/2018,20180926,3,4.18,I think it was good. My problem came with waiting for 2 hours just for them to call us and we have to wait in the back of the restaurant for another 20 minutes. I didn't like that they don't take American Express. Kinda weird to me. Nonetheless the food was good. I enjoyed it all. I don't think I will go back unless there is no line and I can just walk in and sit down. The line is too long. If you have to wait just skate and come back another time. It's not that good.
9/28/2018,20180928,5,4.18,"I went today around 8:30am (Friday) and was able to walk in and get a table for two. The host was very friendly and welcomed us by telling us a little about the menu. We had a very charming waiter who was extremely attentive and also gave us riddles to solve, which I enjoyed. We shared the la Colombe brisket and the super French toast flight, both recommendations by our waiter. They were both amazing and extremely delicious. Service and food were completely on point. I highly recommend coming here. By the time we left around 9:30, the place was full, so come early! I will definitely be back."
9/29/2018,20180929,5,4.18,So... I'm not really a waffle or French toast type of gal because I usually stick to pancakes. Well I ordered strawberry covered French toast and cheese crusted hash browns and I must say the five starts speaks for itself. It was WONDERFUL! The French toast were topped with strawberries and a drizzle that left you not having to use any syrup. It wasn't too sweet it was just right. The cheese crusted hash browns were different and tasted delicious. The place is rather small but whatever. My waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. The hostess seem as if she barely wanted to be at work and as loud as the place is she either needed to speak up so others can hear or they should provide her with a blow horn ..
9/30/2018,20180930,5,4.18,"Anyone who does not give 5 stars or more is seriously a questionable soul. This place was amazing , the food, ambience , and service was like no other. If your lucky you will be served by Tusimi. Greatest server ever, riddles and all. Crab cakes Benedict , chipotle shrimp omelet , and French toast flight is superb !!"
10/1/2018,20181001,5,4.18,Great!!! Food ~ the staff is amazingly friendly. The grapefruit juice is the bomb .... I'd recommend everyone to come to this establishment...
10/4/2018,20181004,4,4.18,"Delicious food, but that dam music gotta go!!!! Get a real radio with some decent music. Not an iphone sitting on the counter"
10/5/2018,20181005,5,4.18,"So this was a long time coming. A former coworker of mine told me about this spot about 4 years ago. Been meaning to try it since but since I don't currently live in the city (I'm in the burbs), I haven't had the ""excuse"" venture down here & try it. However this morning, en route to michigan for a weekend trip, figured let's do it!The wait wasn't long for us as many have had to experience because of it being a Friday morning but it was PACKED in the which was a good sign! Our waiter was friendly and suggestive and the food took a reasonable amount of time.Both my wife and I got seasonal dishes. She got the Chipotle Shrimp Omelet which she claims was really good & spicy and I got the Crab Cake Benedict. The Crab Cake Benedict was amazing. The eggs were cooked perfectly and seasoned well and the crab cake was fresh and moist. The hash browns were really good as well.I also got a half order of the reese's French toast. It tasted great and had rich flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed it but it was very rich in sweetness so I can't imagine having a full order of it, the half was perfect!"
10/5/2018,20181005,3,4.18,"Despite having to wait over an hour to be seated in an overly cramped space, the most disappointing aspect of this place was the food. I walked in expecting to be blown away based on the hype surrounding this place, and found it to be just ok. The french toast flight was very sweet and reminiscent of dense cake, while the hash browns were something nightmares are made of. I literally could not stomach them. My companion described the chicken and waffle dish as being ""bready"", although they were delighted by the waffle actually containing chicken."
10/5/2018,20181005,3,4.18,"So much hype around this place, we were very much looking forward to it for brunch. However, we left disappointed and will most likely not return or recommend it. For a breakfast joint, they should never screw up eggs. One dish with over easy eggs came with the yolks fully cooked. The other dish which was an omelette, was also well over cooked. The omelette had turned a dark color and was crusty on the edges. Hash browns were soggy even though we asked for extra crispy - yes, there was some crust but the inside was very soggy. We didn't mind the wait for a table and the long wait for our food, but the food wasn't worth it. It also seemed like our food sat for a while as our food was room temperature by the time we got it. We did enjoy the biscuits and gravy and the French toast flight, which is why I'm keeping the rating at 3*. Service and staff were gracious and the joint had a great busy vibe, but no one (not even our server) asked how our food was..."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.18,"Just get here. Amazing food, great staff and the atmosphere is exceptional. I can't wait to get back to Chicago and go back here."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.18,"Just get here. Amazing food, great staff and the atmosphere is exceptional. I can't wait to get back to Chicago and go back here."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.18,"Brunch is probably my favorite meal, so I'm always looking to try a new brunch spot. I was visiting a friend in the city and we came here on Sunday morning for brunch by recommendation of a few other people. We got here around 11 and waited over an hour for a table. Because I knew the restaurant was busy and Sunday brunch is a huge deal, I didn't mind waiting. After we were seated our server was personable, funny and entertained our section with riddles and corny jokes. The food was impeccable! Well worth the wait. I had the Brisket Hash which was slow cooked in a coffee rub. Food was so good I could cry. I also appreciated that the manager came by to talk with us and tell us more about the restaurant. This place has great service, good atmosphere and even better food. If you don't mind a wait, Batter & Berries is the place to go for brunch."
10/7/2018,20181007,5,4.18,The best French toast i ever had ever. The French toast flight was delicious no syrup needed once you spread the maple butter on it. The waiter was awesome aka the riddle man !
10/8/2018,20181008,4,4.18,I tried this place last week when I was in town for a concert. Tried the Chipotle Shrimp Omelette and it was amazing! The shrimp was juicy and flavorful and the egg was fluffy and complimented the dish perfectly! We also tried the French Toast flight and it was amazing. Super flavorful with the perfect touches.
10/8/2018,20181008,5,4.18,I finally made it back! It has been a while but the food has not changed! I'm sure everyone agrees that they need a bigger place and the wait times can be a bit much but other than that the food and services are amazing! I was a little disappointed because I was hoping they had my taffy Apple French toast but I had the crab cakes Benedict which is also my favorite. I literally ate ALLLL MY FOOD! Im sure my unborn was happy too!
10/9/2018,20181009,4,4.18,Of course the food was to die for! Left me more than stuffed. I don't think I actually finished eating. The service was good.
10/10/2018,20181010,3,4.18,"I'll start by saying that the food was excellent. The service on the other hand (which is what determines how often I visit a restaurant) is a whole other story. The hostess on the day we visited had zero personality, never smiled, and had on a hat which just gave us the wrong first impression. We tried to brighten her day but to no avail. Our advice: if she's talented, put her in the back and out of sight from your customers. Next, there were eight employees standing around chatting while at least four groups of customers were waiting to be served. There seemed to be more concern over whose station it was versus who should help the customers. Sad but true. Plus, why pay staff to stand around. Wasted resources. The next, and one of the more irritating things is that there's no Wi-Fi available to customers which MAKES NO SENSE in our time. If I'm in your establishment and I'm spending 45 minutes or more there, let me have the password to some Wi-Fi. I promise you, it'll only help - not harm you.On to the next and most important for me. There seems to be a push of preference on sugar choices and dairy options from the restaurant. Newsflash: a lot of people have a dairy allergy and have resorted to alternatives like almond milk, soy, or coconut milk. Make it available. Trust me, people will appreciate it. Splenda, Sweet and Low and simple syrup are good alternatives. And lastly, please consider more gluten free options. I have allergies and would love to experience your culinary take on gluten free. Others would too. My review isn't an attempt to slam but more to help. I want to see you thrive and have longevity for as long as you possible can. Make a few changes for the greater good...."
10/10/2018,20181010,3,4.18,"It pains me to give this establishment 3 stars. The server Jessica was awesome in both personality and service and the food was great. However, 1st impressions in the restaurant business, are the ones that resonate the most and last the longest. The hostess ( more than likely a relative of the owner), was on her phone most of the time, did not greet you and had a frozen, unwelcoming scowl on her face, in addition to having a hat on and looking unprofessional. It hurts me when I see black establishments lacking in service, awareness and business acumen. My wife both said, ""man, we wish we could help them out and double their business."". Outside of Jessica, we did not see one employee smiling. And this is a restaurant for gods sake! They had limited gluten free items( if you have gluten free pancakes, can't you have gluten free waffles??- common sense would say, yes!). No Splenda or sweet & low. The first improvement I would make is replacing the hostess, so the first experience you have when you walk into the restaurant is a positive, welcoming, professional one. The restaurant was clean, the food was awesome( my wife said the gluten free pancakes were the best she has tasted), add additional gluten free items and replace servers who don't want to show up with a smile. Smiling is contagious!"
10/14/2018,20181014,4,4.18,"I finally had a Sunday off and what do I do? I get up on my day off work to come here in hopes that no one else would have the same idea. When we arrived at 8:15am, the place was packed already with only two tables open, luckily we didn't have to wait long to be seated, but we had to wait a long time for our food - maybe 30+ minutes. Two women who sat down 20 minutes after us ordered and received their food before us, we were told it was because they ordered the flight and waffles. My five year old wasn't happy about that because he was getting hungry! Our order didn't seem too complicated to me (chocolate chip pancakes, scrambled eggs, cheesy hash browns and ham, and super flight) but what do I know? Anyways...I've been craving to take my five year old here since I went the first time with a friend. I couldn't believe how tasty all of the food was... both times and how attentive the service was! Did not order the same thing :). My son says his pancakes were really good. He even enjoyed my cheesy hash browns and scrambled eggs. I'm not a fan of hot sauce usually, but decided to dip my hash brown in it and wow! It's my new favorite pair. The restaurant is kind of small, can get crowded and it's very noisy - it's hard to have conversations or hear the server at times. When we were leaving, we noticed people standing outside, which tells me they were waiting to eat also so I'm guessing there is a wait at times. There's paid parking in front of the restaurant and there's also free parking on side streets. Very easy to find."
10/18/2018,20181018,5,4.18,"Holy Moly - check this place out ! We ordered 2 specials. First was Crabs Benedict. Our server Nadine said they use the crab to replace the English muffin. That didn't hit me till it came - it's just the crab cakes(with no fillers) and eggs. OMG, it's the most concentrated crab goodness I've had. I needed some of my omelette to cut the richness of the crabs.The omelette is amazing too. The shrimp infused chipotle sauce taste like shrimp in liquid form. The bits of melted Asiago give the eggs substance and takes it to the next level. The veggies were cooked to perfection and was the right offset.The caramel French Toast with maple butter is highly recommended. Even the fruit sides were generous. I'm coming back."
10/20/2018,20181020,4,4.18,"We stopped by on a Saturday morning and waited 40mins before we got seated. Once we ordered we waited another 20mins before we received our plates. My wife ordered the crab cake Benedict and I got the Cluck and Gaufre (hot chicken with sweet potato waffle). Flavors were excellent, however the crap cakes came out lukewarm and the sweet potato waffle was super dense. Staff was very friendly and seating was very intimate. Prices were a bit on the high side, but I think we'd definitely come back to try a couple more of their unique dishes."
10/20/2018,20181020,5,4.18,Classically awesome breakfast place of your dreams for an amazing breakfast. Had the French toast flight - 5 flavors: strawberry blueberry lemon Nutella and caramel. All were awesome. And the sausage gravy omelette. Wow. Amazing gravy. And Tusime was awesome server. Can't wait to come back.
10/21/2018,20181021,5,4.18,Fantastic! Transplant to Chicago and was recently told to check this place out. It was an hour wait (they take down your phone number and text you when your table is ready) so we walked around a little bit than waited in the car. It was well worth the wait! We had the nutella french toast to share. My husband had the drunken chicken omelette with cheesy hash browns and I had the Italian beef omelette special (only available that weekend). It was all good! Will not disappoint. Don't forget to bring your own booze!
10/24/2018,20181024,5,4.18,I love this place. Great food and music; the chef is friendly. I wish the place was a little larger and had a parking lot.
10/26/2018,20181026,5,4.18,"The shrimp omelette is excellent, and the pulled pork over fries is superb. Service is excellent."
10/27/2018,20181027,5,4.18,"One word: phenomenal! It is worth the wait!! From the moment we walked in, the host and managers were warm and welcoming. I looked all around at everyone's plates and was in awe. I knew I'd have a hard time deciding! Thankfully, my friend and I elected to split 2 dishes.The French toast was the best I've had. The shrimp chipotle omelette was something out of heaven!! That was an all star. The cheesy potatoes side were delicious and cooked perfectly. This place is a must try and this will be on my must list for anytime I return to Chicago."
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.18,"We went for Sunday breakfast, and like most breakfast places this place was pretty busy. We were given a 90 min wait, but got called back within the hour. The system they use seems very efficient and helps with the flow. We ordered the biscuits and gravy, hashed Browns, and a super flight of French toast. We came during pumpkin season so the pumpkin cheesecake French toast was part of the flight. It was the best pumpkin spiced breakfast item I've ever had. Our waiter was super friendly and the whole wait staff was accommodating. We were very full by the end of it and satisfied. If I'm ever in the Chicago area and am in need of breakfast, this will be the place I'll be going to."
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.18,"Wow, this place is definitely worth the wait. I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The chicken and waffle is amazing! The French toast flight is also a must try. The place is BYOB so bring a bottle to champagne to go with the amazing food. The place is always packed so we usually put our name on the list and go to Delilah's across the street for a few drinks. Can't go wrong with anything you order here."
10/28/2018,20181028,5,4.18,Excellent service! French toast sampler was amazing - sweet and yet not too sweet!    The lemon was light and had real lemon flavor. Crab Benedict delish. Cheese hash browns and hot sauce was perfection. Prompt coffee refills. Make sure you get their early for big parties and your whole group is there or you won't be seated! So glad we happened to be staying down the street and were able to check this place out. I'll be stuffed for the rest of the day.
10/29/2018,20181029,5,4.18,"A co-worker recommended this place to eat as three of us had just landed for a work trip and we were starving! The place is small and packed however that is an ultimate clue that the food is going to be spectacular!The menu was overwhelming and when the waiter explained to us the menu, from memory I may add, I was stuck on what to actually order. The plates comes to the tables around us had my taste buds in a frenzy as I wanted everything. I decided on a sandwich, however my counterpart got the shrimp omelette and I was immediately saddened at my choice. My choice was fantastic and the fries were insanely delicious, however the size of the shrimp was something to behold. It looked so good! Everything looked amazing. I will definitely go back to sample other menu items as it is a must for m Lt conscious and my belly. I want more."
11/1/2018,20181101,4,4.18,This place has amazing breakfast the wait is usually the only reason I don't go as often as this place is very popular lbs they have great food and the staff is welcoming.
11/2/2018,20181102,4,4.18,"The food is great, but the restaurant itself is kind of overrated (and overpriced). I'm sure I wouldn't care so much if it wasn't for the ridiculous waiting times! I can't see myself ever coming back if I have to wait 2-3 hours for a table again. Please, PLEASE, expand to another location!"
11/3/2018,20181103,5,4.19,"Went here for a Saturday brunch and was simply amazing. We had the drunken chicken omelette, Italian beef hash (special), and Nutella French toast. This was simply one of the most amazing brunches I've had. The French toast was light and delicious, and the drunken chicken omlette was simply the best breakfast combination I've ever had. Super fluffy eggs with amazingly well cooked chicken and delicious sauce."
11/4/2018,20181104,4,4.18,"Note: they do NOT take reservations, which is wildly inconvenient. (-1 star). Nonetheless - I love batter batteries, I've been here over 10 times and it does NOT disappoint. FOOD: From the basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, side) to French toast flight to jambalaya omelets (special) to shrimp omelets (special) to ox-tails (special) to the chicken and waffles (chicken in the waffles too!!) to egg benedicts... everything is OUTSTANDING. SERVICE: The service is great and the food literally never disappoints. I love how they show you pics of their specials on an iPad when going over them. So nice to see! BYOB: Bring your own champagne and they will provide the juice! This is what we usually do - great option. TO-GO ORDERS? They do not take to-go orders over the phone, but they do to go orders if you go in and order and wait. WAIT: On average for a wait for 4 on the weekends it is typically 45min-1 hr. However for a table of 6 I've waited over 2 hrs. The earlier you go ~7/8 AM, the shorter the wait. For 9 people we went at 8:30AM and the wait was 25 minutes. It's honestly hard to tell what exactly the wait will be , just be ready to wait.A lot of people are forced to wait in their cars because the restaurant really isn't very large and the waiting area only consist of 2 benches - FYI"
11/5/2018,20181105,5,4.19,"Best breakfast experience and food is amazing. Everything is fresh, the staff is energetic and engaging and we felt 100% welcomed. Here's a riddle...When you find the best place, with great food, people, and a staff that cares why go anywhere else? Uh, you don't.One last thing for our host...Go Notre Dame"
11/6/2018,20181106,5,4.19,"Went for a weekend visit to Chicago, and this place is 100% worth the wait ! Staff was friendly, food was delicious and our sever was the best. Ask for Tusime! He kept a lively attitude and atmosphere for all his tables and even has us interact with other guest. It made the experience fun and different. Plates are a generous portion, so you can definitely pick at least two or three things to share and enjoy."
11/7/2018,20181107,5,4.19,"Cluk n Goof, Super Flight, Chipotle Shrimp Omelette So delicious! Best breakfast in Chicago! Unique menu that changes up every so often. Their Instagram feed has amazing pics. I'll be back next Chicago visit!"
11/8/2018,20181108,5,4.19,Most delicious breakfast. Did a bit of a sweet and savory. I had poached eggs crispy hashbrowns and portobello in place of meat. What a delicious savory taste. My son had the Carmel French toast we did a little splits and it was perfect. Tim was one of the nicest waiters I've ever met. So friendly and gracious. Highly recommend
11/10/2018,20181110,4,4.19,"Tusline was our server and regaled us with riddles. We loved it!The Veggie Omelet made with egg whites instead of whole eggs was delicious!Cluck-n-Coffee is very good, a Columbe Louisiana blend.Hostess is very organized, warm, welcoming, and efficient.BYOB limited to Champagne, wine, beer."
11/11/2018,20181111,3,4.19,"The food was not that good. Undercooked potatoes, cold chicken sausage. When we mentioned it they replaced the order - the replacement grilled chicken breast was also undercooked. The place is small and crowded. Wait time is about 40 min.Definitely not going back."
11/13/2018,20181113,5,4.19,I went to Batter & Berries for the first time about a week ago and I must say the food was really good. I had been hearing about it on social media and I work in the Lake view area. I was happy that the line wasn't out the door because I had my hopes high. The service was great keep up and I will be back again.
11/15/2018,20181115,5,4.19,"I promise you, this is the best breakfast you'll ever have. It's a small place but boy oh boy do they relieve. We had the French Toast Flight (5 different flavors) I NEVER ate French toast before, I tried it when I was a small child and hated it, I was told to try it here and my goodness it was SPECTACULARLY DELICIOUS. I also had the Chipotle Shrimp Wrap and that was equally AMAZING. Will be going back time and time again!"
11/17/2018,20181117,3,4.19,"Three stars is being really, really generous. I've always had great service, so I decided to tack on an extra star. The food however is mediocre. .. at best. Even the signature French Toast is disappointing. I'm struggling to write this review because I don't want to crush this family business, but I've held off for years hoping the food would improve and it hasn't. I'm just going to stop here before I talk myself into a two star review."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.19,"Amazing! This was my first time and it won't be my last. I know this place has a long wait, so we came decently early. Heads up, they won't seat you until your ENTIRE party is present. The staff is SUPER friendly, and hospitable. I loved the staff the most. The food was the next best part. We got the chicken and waffles and the blueberry waffle along with a couple of sides. The waffles were incredible and definitely better than your average waffle. We are going to have to learn how to create that savory waffle! So so good. I will be sure to wake up early on a subsequent morning for another breakfast here!"
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.19,"Love this place. My first time here-- came from Boston and went there from the airport and We were not disappointed! Everything was sooooo good and our server was personable, funny, and added trivia every time he came to check on us. A definite must when you are in Chicago."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.19,"While visiting Chicago, I came here with by way of IG recommendations. I arrived at 8:20 and the place was packed! Luckily it was a party of 2 and we were able to be seated immediately. Service was great and engaging, food was delicious and it was a warm family friendly vibe. Thoroughly impressed. Will return in the summer."
11/17/2018,20181117,5,4.19,"This place is well worth the wait. A Chicago must see and taste for tourist and beyond. The Cluck and Goof; the omelettes! The service! First rate! I've gone there many times now for several years, and I'm never disappointed."
11/20/2018,20181120,4,4.19,Truly great food and wonderful service. Was super packed and they had a two tiered que. The first was understandable but they called you back and had you wait in a second holding area for 20-30 mins after a nearly 2 hour wait the first time. Was worth the 2.5 hour wait because we went to the bar across the street but to sit in a second holding pen for another 30 mins.
11/21/2018,20181121,5,4.19,"Couldn't have been happier to stop in Batter and Berries for breakfast. I read on Yelp how busy it gets on the weekend, so we made an effort to get there before 9am. Thankfully we did, the wait list got pretty long right after we were seated. The service was phenomenal. We were seated quickly, had drinks right away, and the waiter did a great job welcoming us and introducing us to the menu. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the french toast flight. I highly recommend both. The brioche bread made for the perfect french toast, and the four flavors were executed so nicely. The maple butter on the side takes each flavor to the next level. The serving of biscuits and gravy was huge! We were definitely stuffed after our visit. We had such a fun time here. It was really loud and busy, but our waiter was so friendly and the food quality was excellent."
11/22/2018,20181122,3,4.19,I was amazed to see how busy this place was on a weekday. They take reservations until up to 3pm which is closing time. I highly suggest to come 25 minutes before they close to avoid a long wait. Otherwise the wait moves quite fast and there is a waiting area inside at the back of the restaurant. The French toast was good and the waffle just ok.
11/23/2018,20181123,4,4.19,"I love this place for breakfast. The French toast flights, the New Orleans inspired specials, the fact that, despite the breakfast crush, they tend to get you seated pretty quickly, all make this a great place to have breakfast. It all seems to be because the General Manager, Don Jones, keeps everything hopping and friendly. Definitely recommend it for breakfast."
11/23/2018,20181123,4,4.19,"So excited to finally make my way to Batter & Berries. Do yourself a favor and get there early! The place is super tiny and packed. From pressing yourself against a wall to make sure wait staff can zoom by with trays of food to not bumping into someone or feeling your standing over them while eating. If you're claustrophobic this isn't the spot for you. The 'waiting area' is two little benches towards the back of the restaurant between tables where people are eating. The wait time here can be pretty long but if you order takeout it's supposed to be quicker. We were told a hour wait for takeout and 15-20 minutes for carry out. Well we opted to do carry out but still it took a hour to get our food. So time and patience is definitely needed to come here. Don't think about calling orders in as you have to be present to order. Alright on to the important stuff, the food. It is delicious. First time going here I would definitely recommend getting the flight. Each piece of French toast is a different flavor and all equally delicious. The other items on the menu are good as well. Would've been a five star review as the staff was super sweet but they seriously need to think about a larger space."
11/24/2018,20181124,3,4.19,"Batter & Berries has been around since '12, and offers various French Toasts, omelettes, breakfast plates, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, and drinks.We came as a group, and we ordered the following: their famous French Toast Flight (a sampling of all their French Toasts (Blueberry, Strawberry, Lemon, and Caramel; these were all pretty tasty, as the batter was perfect, had the right amount of sweetness, and the fresh fruit and the caramel sauces were divine!); ""We're Movin On Up"" Executive (Linz Heritage Angus rib eye steak, grilled onions, mushrooms, cabernet sauce, 2 eggs cooked-to-order, and B&B cheese crusted hash browns; the steak was cooked perfectly, but it was just way too salty (even for me!); the hash browns were cheesy, but I felt as if this needed more seasoning, and it was better with the ketchup and the hot sauce); Cluck & Gravy (handmade buttermilk & herb biscuits, B&B housemade chicken sausage gravy, and an egg cooked-to-order; the biscuits were slightly dry, but the gravy and the biscuit combo was pretty delicious! You can definitely taste the herbs, and the gravy had a nice thick creamy consistency); an Apple Waffle (had a great apple and cinnamon taste to it, and came out nice and crispy); and, The Traditional (comes with 2 eggs, B&B cheese crusted hash browns, and your choice of protein (bacon, ham, or portabella mushrooms).Service was super friendly, welcoming, but a bit forgetful; even though you get on a waitlist and notifications come via the text, there was some confusion in regards to the estimated wait time. We also waited on a missing cappuccino, in which we had to remind a couple of times.The place does get jam-packed, and it's first-come, first-serve. Most people choose to wait outside, but there are some benches in the middle of the restaurant in which you can wait.I'm glad I was able to check out B&B and would be interested in checking out their lunch items the next time!+yummy French Toasts+Cluck & Gravy+friendly staff+forgetful orders+metered parking off of Lincoln"
11/24/2018,20181124,2,4.19,service was crawling slow - I live in the area and was able to put my name down to fight the 90 minute wait and went back home; but once we got the text and seated it took over 2 hours from start to finish for breakfast. Major production - food was good... but not that good. All in putting my name down to leaving the restaurant was over 4 hours!
11/29/2018,20181129,5,4.19,"This restaurant is probably one of the best brunch spots I've had in my life.Food -I ordered the shrimp omelette. It was so delicious. I'm not even an omelette person but my friend hyped it up so much that I had to try. No regrets. We also got the french toast flight. Every single toast was so GOOD. My personal favorite was the blueberry. I think our waiter said it was the butter that made everything delicious? Service - So I arrived at the restaurant first before my two other friends. The main guy was so flexible about waiting for my friends. He did not get angry or anything, and even when the last girl came an hr late, he was not annoyed about it all. Despite everyone being late, we were seated as soon as the last person came. :-)Overall, I will be coming back here next time I'm in town! Pro-tip: BYOB!! (Champagne, wine, no hard liquor of course lol)"
11/29/2018,20181129,4,4.19,"Amazing food drinks, and service. The only concern is the wait, but thats because this place is so good. I wish that they would open up a second restaurant!"
11/29/2018,20181129,5,4.19,My favorite breakfast spot . All the waiters are nice . Every week they have a new items added to the menu. Amazing French toast .

I love coming here for my birthday brunch since it may be my favorite restaurant in the area. You're warmly greeted by someone at the front desk and there's typically a wait. Once you're seated, you're greeted by the friendliest staff. You look around and you just know you're welcomed, and it feels like home. Because this is a family operated biz, don't be surprised if the owner comes to your table and begins chatting you up. I like to order a pitcher of orange juice to go along with my champagne, since this place is BYOB! Their French toast flight is a must try, no matter what you're ordering. Order it and split it with your table, it's must. The flights are rotating based on ingredients of the season but one thing they all have in common is their made to perfection and it's always a good balance of flavor and not too sweet. Make sure you try the cheesy hashbrowns and their chicken patty if you're looking for side options to your meal."

It's popular, so there is definitely going to be a wait. We were seated at a long table with others, which helped us get seated faster, just made for some awkward interactions with others :) I ordered the sweet potato waffles stuffed with chicken, which CAME WITH A FRIGGIN SIDE OF FRIED CHICKEN TOO and maple butter - definitely get the maple butter. I usually have a tiny stomach so I'm flippin amazed I finished even half of this dish. The sweet potato waffle was definitely dense, and the chicken in the waffle is more located towards the center, but at least they give you a generous side of fried chicken to go with it. Friend and I walked the whole way back down to Mag Mile (trust me, you need that walk after getting brunch here) and we were still full after an hour of walking."

When I tell you it was good, I mean it was good. I had chicken and Blueberry French Toast. I put the house hot sauce on the chicken and the mingling of sweetness from blueberries and the spiciness from the sauce WOW! I shall return. Yessah Lawdy!"

The service was incredible once we were seated. Our waiter was hilarious and very accommodating and made some excellent menu suggestions. I had the Lemon Pepper Lobster Omelette and it was as amazing as it sounds. Everything about the dish was amazing, everything was fresh and it was soooo flavorful! The Cheesy Hash Browns were amazing as well, must have. If you are in the Chicago area you MUST stop by and give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."

12/8/2018,20181208,2,4.19,"After trying to eat here twice before we finally decided to just wait ....to see what the fuss was abt.NOTHING. Short review its basic food that's over priced and wait isnt worth it.The detailed review:The host told us 1 hr wait time. We waited 2 hrs. I went back and asked him whats up at the 1 hr mark and he said, ""I never told you 1 hr. We are very busy place on Saturday as you can see. Do you want to talk to the manager?"" ...and looked back down at his ipad.The atmosphere...I get they are trying to be the local, friendly and hip place for brunch but it's so loud that you can't even hear the wait staff. There was one waitstaff yelling and giving loud hi 5s. It was borderline obnoxious. The food runners and most of the employees has a ""I'm too cool attitude"" strutting and pea cocking like they are too good to work where they are. Need I mention, the food runner all but dropped our food on the table and ran....almost spilling out on the table.The food...as other reviewers that have mentioned, it's just ordinary French toast and waffles. Nothing special. Really NOTHING. You can get the same thing at IHOP, Fullerton Cafe, or any of the other 100s of bfast places.We had the brisket and hash- skip it. It was gross and tasteless. The chicken and waffles was pumpkin and chipotle?? Weird. The combo didnt taste good at all. The food looks good but it stops there. Our waitress was polite and was readily available to fill our coffee or water cups. Also, the food did come out fast so that's a plus....about the only.I am even leaving 2 stars is bc the saving grace was the manager. He tried to accommodate after waiting 1 hr and 15 mins....and sat us soon after but still we waited 2 hrs for mediocre brunch. I would have left but after waiting 1.5 hrs...you are fully vested to eat.Bottomline: Unless you want to wait 2hrs on a Saturday to be disappointed then just go somewhere else. We literally wasted all morning and afternoon for breakfast. Wasted. I left full but steaming from taking my whole day for a breakfast run."

The wait is consistently over an hour, but luckily, they have the system that will send text updates on status. We were able to go do a little shopping nearby and received plenty of notice to get back without missing our table.I am doing this review solely to talk about the Lemon French Toast. It honestly did not sound like anything I would normally want, but it was in the FT Flight so I knew I would get a taste. It was so good, my friends and I still randomly bring it up all the time. They also have a new French Toast flavor of the week (or month, cant remember) which is fun for a French Toast lover that would want to try as many flavors as possible."
12/10/2018,20181210,5,4.19,"What a find! We wanted to stop for brunch on our way out of Chicago and stopped at Batter and Berries and were blown away by how amazing the food was! We had the Lemon Pepper Salmon Benedict and the French toast flight and both were so delicious. The Benedict was fresh and the lemon pepper hollandaise was yummy without being too rich or overbearing. The cheesy hash browns that came with it were unreal. The French toast flight was amazing, my personal favorite being the lemon French toast. All were tasty without being too rich and sweet. Service was on point, our server (missed her name) was super sweet and made great suggestions. Definitely yummy comfort food on a cold Chicago day, highly recommend hitting this spot if you're in Chicago! :)"

12/12/2018,20181212,5,4.19,"Okay, when they said the French Toast was ""out of this world"" I was like how can you really make French toast that good? Ohhhh they did!!!!!! This is now my fave breakfast spot in all of Chicago! The spinach omelet (though it doesn't sound all that exciting) is ah-may-zing with a basil tomato ""tapenade"" on top. So good!"

12/17/2018,20181217,5,4.19,"Batter and Berries is the best brunch spot in Chicago. They put dedication and expertise into all the food they serve and have some of the tastiest menu options. They serve a French toast flight that I have never seen anywhere else and they have extremely good hash browns with cheese And bacon. However it doesn't stop there, there lunch food is phenomenal too! They serve hot chicken and veggie wraps that I am obsessed with. The best part about Batter and Berries though is the staff. Everyone there calls me by name and treats me like a true neighbor whenever I walk in. The warm and inviting atmosphere makes my morning every time I go in to pick up something. I love you guys batter and Berries! -Anna"
12/18/2018,20181218,4,4.19,Finally visited this restaurant. The French toast is to die for. It's so light and flavorful wish I knew the secret to this fluffy not wet French toast...amazing toppings but honestly it would be good just on its own flavor and a little syrup..the brisket hash is actually slices of oh so tender brisket set on top of yummy cheese hash browns with an egg cooked to order...this flavor is awesome ....everyone is very friendly and the owner comes by to see all is good. Well worth the wait can't wait to go again. I like going on week day less busy only 25 minute wait...Yummmmmmilicous!!!!!
12/24/2018,20181224,3,4.19,"Great food (for the most part), excellent service, and reasonable prices. Honestly, this would be a 4 or even 5 star review but unfortunately the ham they served me was way overcooked. With that being said, would definitely recommend!"
12/29/2018,20181229,5,4.19,Super fresh ingredients. Proper execution of good cooking technique. Undeniably good breakfast food.
12/30/2018,20181230,5,4.19,"I have been to this restaurant four times and each time I'm so impressed!! The food is amazing and the service is unmatched. Everything is amazing! No complaints !! Oh yes, and it's Black owned !!!!!"
1/1/2019,20190101,1,4.19,Customer service was not extended at all by the manager on duty. An older gentleman who acts like he isn't willing to slow down a bit and actually service people.
1/2/2019,20190102,5,4.19,"Although this place is known for French toast, it has great pancakes. I came here on a Sunday while traveling to Chicago. The jamabalya omelet is amazing. The staff was extremely nice and the area was clean. There was parking on the street. I have so many good options that I would want to try. I will definitely be back."
1/3/2019,20190103,5,4.19,"New Year's Day the wait was 2 hours!! Cramped and small was my first impression  But our waiter Twohsime (to see me) and a lady I met in the waiting area changed my whole mindset. Twohsime has all the riddles that kept us rolling. The atmosphere was beyond great. The table had 3 of the Fries Chicken Alfredo Omelets, 2 French Toast Flights, 1 Cluck & ""Goose""There was a side of chicken sausage. You cannot go wrong. It's BYOB keep this in mind for your mimosa. Specials change every 6 weeks.I don't think they can seat Parties over 5 people"
1/5/2019,20190105,5,4.19,"AMAZING! I've always heard great things and finally went with a friend. The staff was great, our server even had riddles for us and was so attentive! I had the French toast flight which was so good! They get very crowded so head early. We got there and were told the wait would be 45 mins. to an hour but it ended up being o lit 20 mins. They are BYOB for mimosas and you buy the juice. Overall so great and I can't wait to go back!"
1/6/2019,20190106,5,4.19,Some of the best bacon I've ever had in my entire life. Food was incredible! The atmosphere felt so homey and I'm 100% coming back the next time I'm in town.
1/12/2019,20190112,5,4.19,"5 stars for the food, which is what I came for! The omelette was a perfect amount of fluff, albeit the sausage and gravy is served around it? Too spicy for me but I'm a weakling. The French toast flight is on pointe -- I will be back for that caramel topping! Everything is thick. The hash is wet and goopy, mixed with cheese. The gravy is a congealed solid on my eggs.I noticed the manager walked around asking everyone how they enjoyed their food... and promptly skipped our table. I caught him crazy staring at me later. The server uses an ipad to quick-flash Instagram photos of the specials. I don't understand why she couldn't use the full screen while reciting the specials. It was too rushed.It was an hour wait on this Saturday morning."
1/13/2019,20190113,5,4.19,"First time and definitely going back! Great place for Breakfast/ brunch. Go in ask for Jessica the waitress. She was awesome. She showed us pics of all the breakfast specials. Never waited for coffee or water. The whole staff was in sync and friendly. If you are in the CHI you must go here. I had the Scallops omelet and it was off the charts! Try the French toast specials, my wife loved it! Next time we go out for breakfast, we are going here. Enjoy everyone!"
1/15/2019,20190115,3,4.19,This is a very popular place where the food was just ok for me. Nothing to write home about in my opinion but others really seem to love it. To each their own!
1/16/2019,20190116,4,4.19,"Phew! This place is an experience! Ok so the wait was ""45 minutes"". But, that was the wait to pretty much grab a spot in the door. Then we had to wait a bit longer after our wait for our table. Plan accordingly.We sat down and it immediately felt like we were at a family reunion or something. Our waiter was keeping us entertained with riddles. We were talking and laughing with the tables around us because the place is packed enough where you are sitting pretty close to everyone. It was loud in here! But everyone was having a great time. I ordered the Super Flight to share and the Bourbon Maple Dijon Lamb Chops which were on special for the day. The Super Flight was absolutely delicious! It came with blueberry, strawberry, pecan, lemon, and peppermint (the monthly flavor) french toast. I would say it is some of the best french toast I have ever had. I think I liked the lemon flavored toast the best. The lamb chops were amazing and it was a nice sized portion. My kids got the chocolate chip pancakes and they enjoyed those, as well. I would say that this place is a bit pricey, but the portions are more than reasonable. Also, expect to be here for a while if you do visit. With the wait and the banter and how crowded it gets, your meal will not just be an in-and-out experience. I would say to try this place on a weekday if you want a chiller quieter breakfast because the weekends are wild! But I do think it's worth here to come and at least grab some of the French toast."
1/18/2019,20190118,5,4.19,"Service was great. Came here a friend. Would recommend the buttermilk cakes, but I'm coming back for the scalloped omelette tomorrow. Will update hen. Zero wait even bough his place is hoppin! Jessica is a awesome waitress."
1/20/2019,20190120,4,4.19,"I've heard BB is overrated but I really loved it! I got this delicious egg white omelette and the cheesy potatoes were the perfect side. My dining companion got the french toast flight, and did not love it as much as I loved mine. I think that the egg dishes are the way to go! Very long wait and kind of a weird environment (waiting area is in the middle of the place). Fun stop though!"
1/20/2019,20190120,5,4.19,"Wait was extremely long but the food was delicious, the prices were reasonable, the food came out at a great time, in there is a little small but I still give five stars because the good outweigh the bad ..... we walked down the block to a bar and waited and by time we got a drink and walked back it was out time to eat."
1/20/2019,20190120,5,4.19,Such an amazing place! I've been 10x and I'm never disappointed. Weekly specials are so good. The French toast flights are delicious. Hands down best brunch in Chicago
1/21/2019,20190121,5,4.19,"I will come back here any time I'm in Chicago! One of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. Food was delicious, service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxing and fun."
1/24/2019,20190124,5,4.19,"Great atmosphere and service! Met a nice man that works there, sich a sweet guy. Great breakfast! Super nice place to go to. Enjoyed everything! Their fried chicken was so delicious with great flavor and the waffles was so soft and hot, it felt like it was meltingin my mouth. I'm from California and I've been craving this place. Miss it it so much! When I'm in town, we are definitely going to come back! A+"
1/25/2019,20190125,5,4.19,"For starters, I'm not from the Illinois area. I just moved over here for work about 45 days ago and have no clue on what's great around here. I just had some buddies fly in from Texas and wanted to go grab brunch so I called my guy, he recommended this place over here. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN, I know southern hospitality well, but the gentleman here by the name of ""Toceemi"" (probably spelling it wrong) is incredible at exemplifying extraordinary customer service. The immediate attention that was given, from recommendations on the menu, to the riddles he was giving out between tables, all of it has been great. I haven't had the food yet, but I'm confident it will be nothing short of great. As far as the environment? Top of the line. The service is in a class of its own. Highly recommend this place! Very reasonably priced for what you get."
1/25/2019,20190125,4,4.19,"Tuseemee (pronounced) was an amazing server, tons of humor and personable.The Crabcake Crawfish Benedict was spicy and amazing."
1/26/2019,20190126,5,4.19,"This is my all time favorite place to go to. It's literally a ritual for me to go here every time I go to Chicago. In fact, I feel like I betrayed Chicago if I don't go there. This place is nothing less than awesome. It's worth every penny!There's a wait as far as getting a seat, but that's because it's ALWAYS packed. So you know their food is fresh. I had a Chicken Alfredo omelette, and it was amazing!!! I also ordered their French Toast Flight, and I love that too!I love food; I LOVE THIS PLACE! I wish I could give it eight stars!I'm going back to Chicago just for this place! I recommend all Detroiters, and everyone else, to go to this place! You won't regret it!"

1/27/2019,20190127,1,4.19,So after waiting 2 hours to sit down and eat. We finally order our food. Which took another two hours. So I asked for management. Because it was weird that my food was brought out before the the person that was with me. We came out to eat to eat to gather. The manager was rude as hell. Long story short I want ever come back her again.
1/27/2019,20190127,4,4.19,"I love the food here, I'm never disappointed when I eat at this restaurant. My order comes out quick and the staff is very friendly. There's always a long wait at this restaurant so I suggest you have a snack before coming here. I gave this restaurant a 4 because of the wait time. I think if the seating was rearranged more tables could be added in order to accommodate more people. The place is small and the waiting area takes up space that could be better utilized."
1/28/2019,20190128,5,4.19,"Ok so I've heard about this place a lot from friends so me and the birthday gal had to try it out! I was not disappointed!!! We had the jambalaya omelette, and the poutine!!! Omg the flavors!!!! Plus the staff were so kind even though they were so busy!!! We waited about an hour but it was worth it!!! Yummers!!! I would definitely go back and would suggest you try as well!!!"
1/31/2019,20190131,4,4.19,"The reason why this nice little restaurant doesn't get 5 stars from me is not so much because of the pricing or the food but because of my first interaction. My wife walks in as I'm paying for the parking meter and the receptionist doesn't greet her but instead is just starring at her with a blank look. My wife has to greet her and ask for a table for 2 then the women unenthusiastic says I can't seat you until the other person shows then I walk in and she replies just wait until we get a table cleaned. So as I walked in I didn't get greeted as well but got seated fast within 2 minutes. What made up for the rest of my experience there was our waitress Jessica L who was extremely nice and basically went through the entire menu with us because she asked if we had ever been there and we said no. I ordered the special which was the jambalaya omelette, my wife ordered the chicken and waffles, and we shared the Oreo French Toast and every was super delicious. I would come back but with the expectation of the poor greeting."
2/1/2019,20190201,5,4.19,"The food is great! They make house-made chicken apple smoked sausage and their honey butter is not extremely sweet but quite flavorful to the point that I did not have to use any maple syrup. The potatoes were good and fresh. They feature a different French toast flavor weekly. I met the executive chef; Ken Polk, and he had a great spirit about himself, you can tell that he's serious about the food and when I explained to him that I was getting addicted and had to be careful before I gained 1,000,000 pounds, his reply was ""that's story of my life here"" as he's a constant diner there himself. The manager and the service staff folks that I encountered were pretty cool. To sum it up, I seldom enjoy breakfast/ brunch food or going to places for it. This was the first time in years that I did not have any complaints about anything and ran back up there a few days later by myself. Lol"

2/4/2019,20190204,5,4.19,Worth the wait. The have some delicious Chicken and Waffles.
2/5/2019,20190205,5,4.19,"I've heard SO MANY good things about this place but I've also been warned on numerous times that you WILL wait so I've never been in. When my breakfast loving friend from England came to visit, we decided to see what the hype was about, even if it meant waiting. At about 10:45 on a MONDAY, they were hopping but we were able to get a table right away. I noticed that everyone who came in after us had to wait about 5-10 minutes which is a step up from the reported hour long wait times on the weekends. While nearly everything on the menu was tempting, I had to go for the brisket hash. This was flavorful, hearty and a huge portion. My friend has never met a breakfast carb he doesn't like so he went for the French toast flight, which is as delicious as it is photogenic along with a side of their signature hash browns and also some eggs. He has the metabolism of a high school athlete so whatever, you do you buddy. Service is overall just okay but the food is the reason you're going here. They KNOW what's up. My friend ranked this the best breakfast of his trip to Chicago."
2/7/2019,20190207,5,4.19,"Housemade Chicken Sausage is AMAZING! The service, staff, smells and fare are all outstanding! These folks welcome you warmly, have a fantastic selection of hot teas in individual little pots! Classy and the food is sassy! Eggs done to perfection! The crunchy cheesy hash browns worth every indulgent bite! Joyous decor and wonderful people! Awesome!"
2/8/2019,20190208,4,4.19,"Today I had a craving of something sweet and savory! After a hard week of working out! I thought about treating myself to some Batters&Berries!A Flight of Strawberry French Toast, Scrambled eggs w/ American Cheese, English Breakfast Tea and a Side Of Fresh Fruit.Anyone that is familiar knows it's hard to get a table at the brunch establishment! But, I was determined to wait if necessary....Luckily, NO WAIT! (Given the fact it was only me haha). I was quickly seated and my server Nadine J, was nothing shy of a friendly face. Greeted me and started going over the special. Her attention to detail and explanation was on point! She definitely knows her job and great customer service. Couldn't have asked for a better attentive server while I dined in! When my food came a light skin, slim but clumsy bus boy brought out my food spilling some on me! But, Nadine right there with napkins! No big deal of the spill just slowdown.While I will suggest to the General Manager to take come of his concerns with his employees to the back! I could over hear quite loudly him ""correct"" an employee about his movement when filling waters. And, for a dining experience I could see how awkward the young man felt and looked around to see if anyone saw. But, as always my overall experience was 4stars.... Will Eat Again!"
2/9/2019,20190209,4,4.19,"Okay I will give B&B 4 stars but the WAIT, we need to talk about this wait so that you have adjusted your expectations. I expected a killer wait and I was STILL annoyed. We put in our name at 1PM and were told about an hour and twenty (mind you this place closes at 3). We did not receive any texts so we walked back in at about 2:25. We were told there were some parties ahead of us so it would be give or take 20 minutes. At 2:55 we were worried that we would get locked out so we walked back to B&B and were told that there were 3 similar sized parties ahead of us still and it would be another 15 minutes. We waited inside in a cramped area and were finally seated about 20 mins later.I understand that they can't make people leave and they can't predict how long it will take (which may be why they don't take reservations) BUT THERE MUST be a better way. I think the uncertainty of when we would be seated was huge... If we could have had access to the list and know how many parties ahead of us we would know when to walk back rather than checking in every 20 minutes. I know there are some apps that do this. Long story short, 1pm on Sat was probably a bad time to come but also expect a longer wait then they originally say. As far as the food, I thought it was fantastic but it may have been helped by all the hype I'd heard or the fact that I was hungry. We got their cointreau chocolate cake French toast special and it was phenomenal! The spinach omelette was pretty good too but the sausage we ordered on the side was only okay. Recommend sharing dishes and definitely get their specials."
2/11/2019,20190211,3,4.19,"Expect a long wait, the usual for any brunch place on a weekend morning! The downside with our wait was that the restaurant is so small, and there's so many people waiting for a table, that everyone stands inside crowding the hallways and waiting right on top of tables that are eating their food. This makes it so loud and packed inside! The servers can barely walk through the place. When we sat down, it just seemed all over the place.. we had no silverware and didn't get our drink orders taken (only got offered coffee). I understand it was very busy, but it gives the place a frazzled feel - not a relaxing place to sit and talk and enjoy breakfast. When our main server came, she was very nice, attentive, and knowledgeable though! I ordered the crab cake Benedict, which was delicious but pretty expensive ($19). The cheesy hash browns that come with every dish were the best that I've ever had! My boyfriend got the short rib special ($20), which he enjoyed. I did not try their french toast, but my friend got the french toast flight and loved it, it looked so good! It's worth a visit but I wouldn't go on a weekend - too busy and hectic inside!"

They make house-made chicken apple smoked sausage and their honey butter is not extremely sweet but quite flavorful to the point that I did not have to use any maple syrup. The potatoes were good and fresh. They feature a different French toast flweeklyI met the executive chef; Ken Polk, and he had a great spirit about himself, you can tell that he's serious about the food and when I explained to him that I was getting addicted and had to be careful before I gained 1,000,000 pounds, his reply was ""that's story of my life here"" as he's a constant diner there himself. The manager and the service staff folks that I encountered were pretty cool. To sum it up, I seldom enjoy breakfast/ brunch food and going to places for it. This was the first time in years that I did not have any complaints about anything and ran back up there a few days later by myself. Lol"

2/14/2019,20190214,5,4.19,"I honestly can't recall what i've eaten here, I just know that it's all been pretty good...I usually have whatever breakfast special they have for that week/month. Obviously I don't come here often or I'd know what their specials are and the frequency in which they are rotated. It's a cute place, excellent place to take a date or have breakfast with your person. Staff generally pretty friendly. I think the prices are fair for the neighborhood, but I really wish the french toast flight wasn't so expensive. It's so good, and I always just want to order more. Coffee is good, vibe is friendly and smiley. Support black business. Give them your money."
2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.19,My sister and I ordered the super flight and the hash browns! The hash browns were delish and the house hot sauce was amazing. My waitress was Leslie she was awesome! The service was incredible and Don the manager was amazing. We will certainly come back when we are in town.
2/15/2019,20190215,5,4.19,I love any and all breakfast and batter and berries does not disappoint. I'm not a huge fan of French toast but I get it every time I come. My favorite two things about this place as actually the hashbrows and the hot sauce they make in house. When the sides and condiments are this good you know you can't go wrong with the main entree. Love the food and the vibe. A must go to for any breakfast lover.
2/16/2019,20190216,3,4.19,"I've heard many wonderful about this establishment over the years and really looked forward to experiencing it for myself. Upon arrival, we were advised 60-90 minutes was the approximate wait time. Our actual wait time was 2 hrs. There's no waiting area and it's very loud. People that are seated have a dining experience surrounded by hungry patrons waiting to be seated. Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a very nice waitress whom meticulously explained the highlighted items on the menu. We made our selections and waited approximately 30 minutes to be served. My fiancé's order was not made as ordered so that was taken care of by a young man who turned up his face at the fact that he didn't want powdered sugar on his pancakes. My fiancé and I also did not like his selection which was promptly rectified by the restaurant manager by changing out his selection for something different. The second order was fulfilled quickly but was sloppily made and over cooked. We never received our ordered beverage. My order was just ok. Nothing to rave about. Overall this was well below my expectations and I will not come back."

The restaurant is very tight for the amount of clientele they have and wait times can be 45 minutes or more. But since I was here,I might as wait to see what the hype is about. They have a very small waiting area near the back where you can sit but more than likely stand! Because of the right space you'll find ypur self standing in front of the restrooms and practically hovering over patrons who are seated and trying to enjoy there meal. You will encounter the staff squeazing through the crowds with uncovered plates of food. Suggestion: because of the tightness, place a covering over people's food while navigating the crowd! Once we were seated, we were entertained with jokes and laughter while be informed of the specials and favorite foods by the wait staff. The jokes made the atmosphere relaxed and distracted from the crowds and the wait! We ordered a flight of French toast which included lemon, pecan and traditional ....each peice tastes better than the last!!!! The main meals was flavorful and plentiful.

And I just thought that was weird, well moreover, the fact they don't have an waiting area weird. Because when she gave me unclear directions of a phantom waiting area, it was in the mix and in the way of everything/one. While ONE of the greeters were happy to see me, told me my name was pretty and that the food was worth the wait, one seemed as if I pissed in her Cheerios.

Read it has 2048 5 star reviews as we arrived HOST WAS SO WELCOMING STAR GOES TO HIM....we looked around saw it was super busy and knew there would be a wait...however Our host asked how many and we said 3 its Mama Gloria's Bday. He said HBD & had us sign in with a phone number and would text when ready about 30 minutes. Place was packed I will give them that. He then said section towards back is waiting area & a text came right away to confirm phone number, so second received after 20 minutes to let us that our table coming up.Our Host went on break as did our place in line....After 50 min and all the new people walking in being seated I walked up to guest area I gave our parties name she said, Ohhhh I didn't even know you were here, you will be in the next group... Sorry this is awkward I wish this establishment well. Mom in the end picked ""Hollywood Grill"" and was delightful!"

From the perfectly caramelized French Toast to super creative NOLA style omlettes, home made butter and insanely good hot sauce...this places leaves me in zen every time. Also HUGE on the list is the many pork alternatives! The fact that they had Jambalaya omelette with alt pork options was incredible! Thanks B&B!!!"

Our friends literally had just ordered as we arrived and the restaurant was not busy. The hostess told us we could not join our friends because they had already been seated. I explained that they had two empty seats and she stated she still couldn't seat us. I could understand if the restaurant was busy but it wasn't, AND they had two empty seats at their table. It wasn't like I was taking two seats from anyone else, they were seats at their table, and did I mention they had just put their order in. So disappointing. I love supporting local businesses since I'm a Lincoln Park resident. To management, you should consider revising that rule. You guys lost a potential regular"

My friend got the chicken and waffle which was really interesting. The chicken was cooked beautifully and not dry all for something fried. The waffles are definitely savory and not sweet at all which was a shocker for me because I expected a little bit of sweetness because waffle."
3/16/2019,20190316,1,4.19,We were told 35 minutes and it was 1 hour plus. The coffee was hot and food was quite cold and not very good. The service was terrible up until we were to pay our bill. Then you would have thought we were the only people in the world. My vote thumbs down period.

3/20/2019,20190320,1,4.19,Went here yesterday for brunch and the food was ok. All of our food was cold. However the service was good and it didn't take long to get a table. Wasn't worth the hype though in my opinion.
3/21/2019,20190321,5,4.19,"OMG!!! This place is amazing...The food was amazing! The service was amazing! I wish I lived close, but I definitely have to get here once a week. I had the supe flight French toast... AMAZING!!!"
3/22/2019,20190322,5,4.19,The best is outstanding and the customer service is fantastic! Be ready to wait because this place is so popular. I had the chicken and waffles. My waffles had pieces of chicken and the waffle was made with sweet potato- What you see in the picture is what was left and i had to take with me because portions are generous.
3/23/2019,20190323,5,4.19,"Absolutely phenomenal, parking wasn't an issue we found street parking right away. We came inside and there were a few tables we could choose from so they gave us one close to the kitchen and our server Timothy was very attentive, helpful and friendly. Their menu was very interesting, several choices and they really don't rush you to order even though it's not the biggest place. Also they have a nice waiting area away from the door so customers don't have to freeze while the wait. I ordered the strawberry French toast and my sample French toast platter with bacon. All in all I was really impressed with how the workers were in sync and they made the customer experience that much more enjoyable. I cannot wait to revisit my hometown and try more goodies at this hidden gem."
3/25/2019,20190325,5,4.19,A really good brunch place. A little on the more expensive brunch places but definitely worth it since dishes are super delicious. I definitely always get the chicken and waffles. Get the salsa they have on the side and def order a side of their cheesy hash browns. I also like the French toast flight.
3/26/2019,20190326,4,4.19,"I have been meaning to try this place for a long time and finally was able to do a BYOB brunch last Friday. The atmosphere wasn't the greatest - it was difficult to wait for the table since there wasn't much space in the restaurant and I found that over half the restaurant smelled like the bathroom. This was definitely my least favorite part of the restaurant. However, the server was really nice and instantly made our experience better. I really liked the French toast flight and particularly enjoyed the blueberry and caramel French toast. I was slightly disappointed by the strawberry French toast, however, as it reminded me of the strawberry sauce served at iHOP. Overall, I would have given my experience 3/5 but my friends also loved their dishes. They would definitely recommend the chicken & waffles and the briscuit hash. This wouldn't be the first place I would come back to, but overall it was a good BYOB brunch!"
3/26/2019,20190326,5,4.19,"One of the most interesting restaurants you will eat at. My usual go to is the Cluck-N-Gaufre or the chicken and waffles. The sweet potato waffle is served with a piece of chicken with hot sauce and butter. Every bite is bursting with sweet and savory goodness that'll have you rushing for the next bite. Flavors like you've never tasted before. Great food, great service and one of the best breakfast spots in the city."
3/26/2019,20190326,5,4.19,"In a city with great restaurants, this little breakfast spot needs to be on your list. I had a breakfast sandwich of scrambled eggs w/ smoked Gouda and thick cut bacon on Texas toast. A simple order, I know, but it was great; fluffy eggs, crisp bacon and perfectly toasted bread. A co-worker ordered the Omlette Jambalaya. Think fluffy omelet with from scratch jambalaya ladled over the top. Having spent quite a bit of time in NOLA, I can tell you the roux was as good as anything I've had. We were immediately greeted and seated and our drink order was taken. Our server was fantastic, friendly and knowledgeable. And to top it off, the owner stopped by to check on us and we spent a good five minutes discussing his background and their menu. Can't recommend this place enough."
3/27/2019,20190327,5,4.19,"Love this adorable little restaurant. You really get the close, family feel when you're here, if only my family cooked as good as they did!We ordered the French toast flight, caramel French toast, and La Columbe brisket hash. The French toast flight came with strawberry, blueberry, caramel and lemon flavors and was deliciousss! I especially liked the lemon and blueberry flavors, so sweet! And I feel the half slices of each were the perfect amount to have you satisfied, not overstuffed and not overfilled with sweetness. My friend liked the brisket but we all agreed it was a little underwhelming in comparison to the toasts.The service took a little long but everyone there was so friendly it didn't matter. The tables are set up a little weird/it is cramped, but you can argue that it just helps with the family-like closeness!"
3/29/2019,20190329,4,4.19,"I really like how they had gluten free buckwheat pancakes. Their gofre with fried chicken was great too though its not gf. Their wait in line is horrible, but you can always byob and drink while waiting."
3/29/2019,20190329,2,4.19,"Make sure you bring your ear plugs and your gameboy, because you'll wait for 2 hours for overpriced food. I can barely hear myself think. God forbid I can hear anyone more than 3 feet away from me, or that the wait for a table be marginally quicker than the wait for a multi-million dollar loan. Waiter dropped our food"
3/29/2019,20190329,2,4.19,"Let me start off by saying this is not my first time being here,but it was my friend first time . My waitress Mia was very nice. I ordered the french toast flight, chicken sausage, and hash browns. I asked for my hash brown to be cooked crispy which they wasn't, and french toast was cold. Yes, I sent them both back, hash browns came back they were just ok and French toast stll wasn't hot enough to melt my butter on them. My friend thought her food was just ok. I don't think that I will return to this place again they are just ok compared when they opened they was very good and you always got hot food."
4/3/2019,20190403,5,4.19,"Best brunch in town and has a NOLA flair! It's a bright yetCharming yellow and purple interior with an even more charming staff.I've gone here multiple times and always always have a wait. That's the most frustrating thing about this place and the location isn't super entertaining. It's BYOB though so go down the street and grab yourself some bubbles for a mimosa.Once you're seated, please please do a flight of French toast ($14-16). It's lemon, walnut, strawberry, and blueberry. It's already sweetened so need to add more syrup. They also have rotating seasonal French toast flavors like pumpkin or even a honey jack Daniels. Also get their crab cake or crawfish or lobster Benedict's!! It's usually a special (around$20) and the seafood protein rotates. You can't go wrong with either three of those Benedict's. This place makes a mean hollandaise sauce and homemade hot sauce. Ask for your hash browns to be extra extra crispy and you won't regret the crispy yet gooey cheese intertwined those shredded potatos"
4/7/2019,20190407,5,4.19,"First time here for breakfast. We actually met the owner at the Chicago Bacon Festival the previous night. This place was awesome. Diverse crowd, unique menu that had something for everyone. I got the French Toast Flight which allowed you to try their different French Toast. I really enjoyed the lemon French Toast But all of them were delicious. My friend had Chicken n Sweet Potato Waffles which were delicious too. We got two different meals so we could share!"
4/7/2019,20190407,4,4.19,"Pros: Well lit and happy decor. The yellow walls are energizing. Pleasant staff and customer service, although it is hurried. They often have a wait, which is a good sign, people like it, and they use a text message system to alert you when your table is ready. They have a big menu and the staff was patient explaining the options. The food!! Delicious takes on American breakfast classics like strawberry french toast, banana creme french toast, crab cake eggs benedict. The food is top notch and breakfast lovers will become repeat customers.Cons: There is always a long line. The servers are nice, but will rush you out of there. Sometimes it can be hard to get the server's attention since there is so much going on. They don't really want you to sit and talk with your friends too long. Parking can be tough in the area. I only saw limited on street parking.I would go to this place again, but will be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes to get a table and expect to be rushed out after eating."
4/8/2019,20190408,5,4.19,Great staff quality food fresh ingredients wonderful presentation. I definitely recommend!
4/9/2019,20190409,5,4.19,"We were here for the first time this past Thursday, Yessica was our server and while she was very busy she took great care of us! The entire staff was very attentive and this is obviously a restaurant that runs on community and teamwork, I had the chicken and waffles but need to come back for the salmon, and my partner had the spinach omelet but there's a lot of things to try so we will be back! Thank you very much!"
4/10/2019,20190410,5,4.19,"Woow! Great French Toast. I still can't decide which one tasted the most. However, it will probably be a blueberry or a lemon. I recommend a visit to everyone. For sure, no one will be disappointed."
4/10/2019,20190410,5,4.19,Absolute favorite place for breakfast! Always worth the wait. The atmosphere is nice and fun! The service is also phenomenal. Definitely would recommend and go again.
4/11/2019,20190411,5,4.19,"Gem for brunch!! Especially if you are a lover of French toast. A must order at Batter & Berries is the French toast flight! It's a nice appetizer to share at the table even though I could have devoured the entire platter by myself. Flavors include strawberry, lemon, caramel, orange and blueberry and the butter is soft sweet and creamy. I ordered the cluck and gaufre which is a unique spin on chicken and (sweet potato) waffle. So the waffle is sweet potato and there are bits of chicken inside. The buttermilk fried chicken is ahmazing and it comes with a nutmeg hot sauce to give it even more of a kick.Service was super friendly and accommodating, there's a homey vibe inside and it's also BYOB!!They don't take reservations though so it can get quite busy so I recommend going early. Fav place for brunch in Chicago so far!"
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.19,"We had our first outing with our newborn to Batter and Berries on a Monday. We know that weekends make it impossible to get in without waiting in a long line, so we took advantage of maternity leave!Our server was obsessed with our baby, and we loved it :-)But they gave us a great place to sit by the window, let us enjoy our meal without interruptions, and served some excellent food.French toast flight- lots of flavors. I didn't love the lemon one because I am picky but my wife enjoyed all of them. All in all, delicious food. Menu felt short, but the feel of the restaurant was warm made up for anything that may have been missing!"
4/12/2019,20190412,5,4.19,"Great service, loved the french toast flights. First place I recommend to anyone visiting the city. A little out of the way from downtown but worth the trip."
4/13/2019,20190413,5,4.19,"My favorite place for their super flight French toast! Also byob for some mimosas They also have other awesome food, but I always go back to the French Toast!The wait is a little long and it does get crowded, but definitely worth the wait. I suggest to get there early!"
4/13/2019,20190413,5,4.19,Probably the best breakfast place i've been to. The service was phenomenal and the food was to die for. The environment was very happy and uplifting and the waiter made everything so nice and enjoyable for us. So well worth the wait.
4/17/2019,20190417,5,4.19,Worth the wait if you have one. Shared the spinach omelet and the French toast flight. AND the manager Frederick has a five star handle on hospitality. Thanks to our server Leslie and Cleveland Tusimi for visiting us from the kitchen. A+++!
4/17/2019,20190417,5,4.19,Awesome food and friendly staff. I went on a Wednesday morning and did not have to wait long. I ordered the French toast flight and I highly recommend it! Thank you Batter & Berries for creating such a welcoming environment. The fact that this is a black owned business put the cherry on the top for me! I can't wait to come back!
4/19/2019,20190419,2,4.19,"I've read good things about this place (on yelp of course), so my fiancé decided to go check out. Especially since we've heard that they have amazing Chicken and Waffles. Anyways... that's exactly what i got... and oh boy did I regret it. I did NOT a single taste of sweet potato. In my opinion it just tasted like nothing but mixed herbs, and the texture of the waffle was grainy. The only thing I liked the was the chicken. I just thought the whole dish in general did not compliment each other. My fiancé got the biscuits and gravy and it was pretty good, it just needed a bit of salt, it didn't have enough chicken (like the menu had said) and again in my opinion, I understand that gravy is supposed to be thick, but this gravy was wayyy too thick. I don't know if I was being extra picky, but I've definitely had better. Wildberry is the perfect breakfast place. The service was amazing though, there was nothing to complain about that. We didn't wait long either, we got seated right away. The atmosphere was good too :)"
4/20/2019,20190420,5,4.19,"I've lived in Lakeview for 2 years and this is one of my all time top spots. I highly recommend this breakfast spot for anyone who is visiting, and best advice is to go as early as possible! Service is great and food location for parking as well!"
4/23/2019,20190423,5,4.19,Was really good pricey food but definitely worth it I believe you all should try it out some time omg I honestly highly recommend this place
4/24/2019,20190424,4,4.19,I've been three times. I loved it twice and once it was ok. I love to support black businesses. I don't have to go again and its a little to far for me.
4/27/2019,20190427,5,4.19,Worth the wait every time- caramel waffles are my favorite go to here. Breakfast sandwich fills ya right up- whole grain with bacon and eggs y queso. Staff is friendly- doesn't hurt that this place is byob...bring a bottle of champagne and they'll do the rest!
4/28/2019,20190428,4,4.19,"Whenever I drive by Batter & Berries the line is out the door and the wait is hours long. I kept wanting to try this restaurant but didn't get around to it until this morning. Yelp has this new feature where you can be added to a live waiting list which is basically similar to having a reservation. Anyways we went early and got seated within half an hour. After we started eating, I checked the waitlist and it was upwards of an hour and a half. My wife and I ordered the French toast flight, chocolate short stack of pancakes, bb cheesy hash browns. The French toast was absolutely delicious but I wouldn't wait two hours to eat here. When we had left the wait was over two hours. I'd come to try out the French toast but definitely use the waitlist online so you don't have to wait long."
4/28/2019,20190428,1,4.19,Meh - would not repeat. Pancakes were flat and dense. Breakfast sausage unnecessary sweet. Hash browns were tasteless My husband had the crab cakes Benedict surprisingly was tasty. If we ever go back I will try the French Toast that seems to be there specialty
4/28/2019,20190428,2,4.19,"Lacks Attentiveness Service between the server and kitchen is slow. And this is from me just observing from the waiting line. The waiting list folks doesn't know how to keep the speed going with making sure that individuals with the ""byob"" bottles drink their beverage and keep the speed going. The attentiveness of the crew isn't there. They are just walking around as if their upset with somethings going on. I don't know if I would ever recommend this place to another person. Oh and... they are hiring... I wonder why. There was a gentleman walking around in a black shirt don't know if he is the owner or what. But he isn't making sure his folks or doing what needs to be done. And or isn't helping out. The kitchen was definitely backed up, and I only know this because I asked the question."
4/29/2019,20190429,5,4.19,"First time here. Cannot wait to go back and try more dishes. Between a group of us we had many different french toast options, grilled chicken omelette, maple chicken sausage, hash browns, and a lamb special. Everything was delicious! The restaurant is cute and everyone was very welcoming. Will try to be back soon to try more!!"
4/30/2019,20190430,3,4.19,I came in here today for the second time in the last few years. I had the crab cake Benedict on special. It was pretty good along with the cheesy hash browns which were very rich. A few things that irked me was how noisy it was- no insulation for the sound whatsoever where we could barely hear our server. The charge of the crab cake Benedict was $19 (something they neglect to tell you when flipping through their iPad slideshow of specials)- did you catch the crab this morning? How can you justify a $19 charge for the plate I included in the photos. We also ordered juice for which they forgot so we just said whatever and had our water instead.Maybe I just came in with high expectations having remembered this place being great- this visit just left me not blown away like I was before.
5/3/2019,20190503,5,4.19,"I had a top 3 brunch experience of my life this morning at this wonderful restaurant. I had ordered food from here once in the past, to go (a hack when the line is too long), and it was pretty good, so was excited to try it fresh. My fiance, a friend, and I ordered a sampling of dishes to share. Even though they had great specials, we decided to go with a few classics, including their biscuits and chicken sausage gravy, brisket hash, and a flight of French toast. Our food came out pretty quickly and the presentation was solid (see photo). We divvied up the food and dug in and holy cow, the food was just incredible. The recipes include subtle unique flavors that make the dishes magical, like the sage (I think) in the chicken sausage gravy or the mild coffee sauce on the brisket. My two companions watched me in awe as I raved to myself and aloud about how well the flavors went together. The cheddar hash browns were an excellent touch, and the eggs were perfect and exactly as ordered.Finally, we had the French toast flight, which was phenomenal. Of the five slices (we added the rotating special flavor), there was something each of us enjoyed. The food was so, so good here, but in a way that takes you by surprise as the flavors come together. Our table was cleared very quickly too. Excellent service, excellent food...go here, it's worth the wait!"
5/4/2019,20190504,5,4.19,Now I understand why this breakfast restaurant in Lincoln Park is so popular! The chicken & waffles was sweet & spicy. And B&B's version of crab Benedict is better than the one I had in Key West! Our server Tim was outstanding. Go early to avoid the crowds.
5/5/2019,20190505,5,4.19,"Foods great, service great!! No other place to dine and listen to house music in the background"
5/6/2019,20190506,4,4.19,"Tried this place for lunch right after a morning test with my friends and was super pleased! We came around 12:30 on a Friday, and although we thought it wouldn't be too bad because it was a weekday, there was a 30-45 minute wait! Luckily there was stuff to do around, so it wasn't a problem. The restaurant is a bit tight and with so many people to serve the tables are bit clumped together, but there is still enough room to relax. The waitstaff was lively and super pleasant, cracking jokes with us and making conversation that didn't seem forced at all. We heard our waiter joking with our tables too, and I just enjoyed the sense of ease and camaraderie all around. He recommended the brisket hash so I could that and was so glad I did: it's a coffee rubbed, slow roasted chunk of brisket served over a bed of cheesy hashbrowns with a delicious chile coffee sauce. The meat was so tender and full of flavor, taken up another level by the savory slightly spicy sauce. My friends got the chicken and waffles, which were a bit dry but still tasty, and their famous french toast flight, which had four delicious fruity or caramel flavors but the real star was the melt-in-your-mouth, almost ice-cream like housemade butter. To make it even better, this place is BYOB and you can just buy a big carafe of orange juice there, so you can bet your ass we brought a giant bottle of (moderately cheap) champagne to make mimosas!Overall, the place is a bit tight and crowded but I understand because that's just due to the size and popularity of the restaurant. The food, however, was fun, tasty, and a step above your average omelette/waffles/etc brunch joint."
5/6/2019,20190506,4,4.19,The service here was excellent. The food was okay. I didnt like the sweet potato waffle but the fried chicken with hot sauce was good. The biscuits and gravy was good but different
5/7/2019,20190507,5,4.19,"This is a beautiful, BLACK owned business. The service is great and the food comes out really fast. Definitely recommend the chicken breast, strawberry French toast and the lemon French toast. The weekend wait time is pretty lengthy but it's worth the wait. I'm regular at this place now and recommend it to anyone looking for quality brunch."
5/8/2019,20190508,5,4.19,They served the best breakfast I've ever had! Definitely get the French Toast Flight! Ask your waiter about the Super French Toast Flight which includes the weekly French Toast special. All of them were delicious especially the Strawberry and Lemon. We shared the flight and then I ordered the Chicken Fajita Omelette which was to die for! The house made hot sauce was so good on it and on the hash browns. The atmosphere is cool and the staff were extremely nice! I will definitely be making a return here on my next trip to Chicago!
5/8/2019,20190508,4,4.19,Great breakfast. Have the flight! Friendly servers and staff. Worth the wait. Specials change from time to time but always good food. If you are on the area. Go.
5/11/2019,20190511,5,4.19,The chicken & waffles and French toast flight were amazing! Can't wait to go back and try something new! Busy place with a long wait time but it's totally worth it. Just get on the waitlist through yelp beforehand and time your arrival.
5/12/2019,20190512,2,4.19,"The wait time, unless you were standing in line before it opens at 8:00am was over an hour???And for the price of the entire meal $50.00 w/tip, for two; I was not impressed!I understand the owners are from the neighborhood and many people patronize them however, there are much bigger, less expensive, restaurants in the area for breakfast!Sorry guys, but I can only give you two stars!"
5/12/2019,20190512,5,4.19,Consistently good. Staff is friendly and attentive. Very good at managing wait times and making you comfortable while your table is prepared. Lots of choices for those craving sweet or savory. Specials are always unique and delicious. One of the best breakfast places I've been to in the city.
5/15/2019,20190515,5,4.19,"Batter & Berries is my favorite spot for breakfast in the city. Me and my family visit them two times per month. They offer great variety of french toasts as well as breakfast specialties, waffles, omelets and cakes. I usually go with Caramel French Toast because it has my favorite candied walnuts. My cousin really likes Lemon Toast which I can't stand. Their price list is in a good point. Most of the foods are averaging between 10 and 14$. The interior of this place is nice and it seems to be cleaned on a regular basis. Definitely suggest for a visit if you are looking for a tasty breakfast!"
5/17/2019,20190517,4,4.19,"We went last weekend and the food lived up to the hype. We had the S.S. Gratin with lump crab and the French Toast Flight that included the tres leche French toast. Both were delicious and very filling, the portion for the gratin was hefty. A little pricier but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth the long wait for brunch"
5/19/2019,20190519,4,4.19,"Great food, atmosphere & customer service. Definitely will be back to try new dishes. Review from:Cleveland, OhioFrench Toast FlightLobster BennyBanana Nut Waffle Spinach OmeletteFrench toast was amazing."
5/19/2019,20190519,1,4.19,"Never again! So damned loud it echoes throughout, with tables practically on top of each other. Overpriced for fair breakfast food. What's with the texting thing when your table is ready? Why even bother? Rudest ""hostess,"" and I use the term loosely as she made us wait for our table until our fourth person arrived; our friend was trying to find parking, an impossible chore in the neighborhood. And we ended up at the same tiny table she was leading us to until she found out we were waiting for our fourth. What's with that stupid rule? And remember to serve what is shown on the menu; bacon was horrible. The most redeeming factor: I have to say our server was one of the most courteous and funniest with his witty banter and jokes. However, that visit was our first and our last. I know of a friendlier and reasonably priced restaurant for a delicious and relaxed breakfast without having to SCREAM at each other for conversation and it is BYOB."
5/20/2019,20190520,5,4.19,"I give them 5 stars all across the board.... Except for the wait time lbvs! Great food, atmosphere, service, etc ..."
5/20/2019,20190520,4,4.19,Great food! However Very busy expect to wait at least 30 minutes on the weekend. We got quoted 30 mins but turn out to be more like 1 hr and 15. Definitely will be back but will plan for a longer wait.
5/20/2019,20190520,5,4.19,"Great breakfast food, good service, large selection and reasonable pricing. You can't ask for much more. My only major complaint was I feel people skipped ahead of us in line as we were waiting to get seated."
5/22/2019,20190522,5,4.19,Best French toast in Chicago. I usually get the French toast flight (1 Slice Of 5 different flavors) and eggs and/or hash browns. All delicious. I'd recommend getting here no later than 10am on weekend because of very long waits..
5/25/2019,20190525,1,4.19,"The wait is ridiculous. I arrived at 10:48am hostess stated it was a 90min wait. We waited for 2 hours. No text. I've been here before, the food is good. BUT the wait is insane. I will never come back , I feel like because they are busy they can do what they want. No apology for the additional wait. RIDICULOUS"
5/26/2019,20190526,4,4.19,Breakfast is great. Sweets better than savory.Very long wait however so you better come very early or come ready to wait a while
5/26/2019,20190526,3,4.19,Food was ok but not worth the 2 and 1/2 hr wait. Then the waitress forgot to put our food in and to offset the inconvenience of us waiting almost a hr for food she took our drinks off our tab. My advice go somewhere else
5/26/2019,20190526,5,4.19,"Found this place on Google Reviews. Based on reviews I knew it was a good idea to go there early. So glad we did as this place gets busy but personally worth the wait. The vibe there is something special. We came from the burbs just for this place for my bday weekend! I couldn't of been happier. The manager Fredrick was so welcoming and came to our table several times, sometimes to just shoot the shit. By the end of meal, we felt more like family. Went with a family of 4 including 2 children. Both Fredrick and server both made my kids and us feels so special. The server (i feel terrible i didnt catch his name) may of been one of the best ever! He gave me the most beautiful bday blessing and was so patient with the kiddos. His recommendations were great as i pick what he suggested. The chicken Alfredo omelet. WOW, never did i think this would be a breakfast combo but holy smokes, amazing. Omelets are deconstructed which is such a cool concept. My hubby got the Cluck and Gravy...the gravy...OMG mouth watering... Got the french toast flight for kiddos and a side of pina colada french toast. what i thought was amazing was its BYOB!!! YesSSSS . So we brought some Prosecco and they put it on ice for us and got OJ so we can enjoy! Hubby and I both agreed we would definitely take the 50 min drive again to this place and bring more people next time. Big portions too. You just cant find a place like this in the burbs!! When the night ended I asked my kids what was the best part of their day and they said breakfast! That was definitely a first!!! Thanks for making our day Batter and Berries!!"
5/26/2019,20190526,4,4.19,Great new find. BUT....there are no reservations but there is a wait list. Use it before you get there
5/27/2019,20190527,2,4.19,The food looks a lot better than it tastes. I was so excited to try this place based on the photos of the beautiful rainbow french toast options. I got the French toast flight with an upgrade to try the special (tres leches). The lemon French toast was probably the best but still only ok. I've had better French toast at a bunch of other spotsLuckily we got in right when it opened at 8am otherwise we would have had to wait a crazy amount of time which wouldn't have been worth it.
5/27/2019,20190527,2,4.19,"Waited in line for an hour and half only wait another 30 minutes for my food. Waitress revealed that what I originally ordered was out of stock 20 minutes after placing the order. Food arrived cold and the waitress was quick about getting me hot French toast. Hash brown were bland, the French toast was okay, and the waffles weren't memorable. Going to give it a second chance because the staff was so sweet!"
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.19,Delicious food & the staff was SO NICE. I came for the food but will go back because of the staff. Also the gluten free pancakes tasted completely normal which is hard to find!
5/27/2019,20190527,5,4.19,"First time in Chicago. Batter and Berries came highly recommended. Excellent food. Excellent service. Don, you're the best!"
5/29/2019,20190529,5,4.19,"I've been here twice now, and the food is so good. Servers are really funny and friendly, portions are generous."
5/30/2019,20190530,5,4.19,"Batter & Berries is delicious!! On my top 5 favorite breakfast spots I've ever been to. We went on a Sunday morning and were fully aware that there was going to be a long wait so that didn't really sway how I felt about it. Luckily I happened to check their Yelp page while on the train heading over so I joined the wait list. The wait list helps but you'll probably still have to wait a bit more when you get there which in my opinion is worth it. After checking in with the hostess we waited another hour before getting a table. It's super small inside so you'll have to wait outside. They text you when your table is ready so you can go take a walk or head toa nearby Starbucks. Once we finally got our table our waitress was super sweet and showed us the specials on an iPad. Once she said their French Toast of the month was infused with champagne I was pretty sold. Everything came out pretty fast and tasted so good! Sausage patty was delicious, eggs came out perfectly. My boyfriend asked for extra syrup for his caramel French toast but didn't really use it because it was sweet enough on his own. Would definitely return to this spot and wait all over again for a breakfast like that."
5/30/2019,20190530,5,4.19,We waited about 5-10 mins to be seated. The waitress came over to show us the specials of the day within minutes of being seated . I ordered the roasted chicken Alfredo which was amazing . Our waters were refilled frequently . My dad and niece tried their French toast and cleaned their plates. Everyone was so friendly .
6/2/2019,20190602,1,4.19,"Tried to make reservation via Yelp but the app is experiencing a known problem and we called, Management was rude over the phone. Wild berries here we come."
6/3/2019,20190603,5,4.19,"This place has the best brunch that I've ever had! There are so many unique dishes on the menu, it was hard to choose. Which is why the French toast flight is brilliant! If I lived in the area, it would be difficult for me to stay away."
6/3/2019,20190603,5,4.19,Batter & Berries never disappoint! Food was awesome & worth the wait! And this time the wait was lessened by using the waitlist option on Yelp! Saved us a lot of wait time!
6/4/2019,20190604,5,4.19,"Black owned. Quaint. Great eats. I was pleasantly surprised by Batter and Berries. The food was great, the service was too and I felt welcomed by the staff and owner. I had the French toast super flight, the color, taste and syrup infused batter were top notch. The prices are very fair as well, though all sides are a la carte. It's BYOB so bring your champagne. The wait was crazy so make sure you plan ahead for that and don't think you're just walking in and being seated. We waited about 2 hours from the time we put our reservation in online to being seated."
6/8/2019,20190608,5,4.19,"The wait was long but it was so worth it. The food was great and the bill was inexpensive for what we ordered. Lastly, the service was exceptional. Everyone from the host to the servers to the owners were very pleasant. Highly recommend this restaurant."
6/9/2019,20190609,5,4.19,"This place is way too good. I love everyone who works here. It's got great energy. FYI for first timers, it's always very busy, 1000% worth the wait, and expect the staff to be hustlin to make everyone happy Everything I've ever eaten here has been incredible. It's the place I recommend to everyone when they come to town. Anything else I want to write is rated R because it's THAT DAMN GOOD."
6/9/2019,20190609,3,4.19,This is probably my 10th time here. I went Friday for my birthday and I was disappointed. The wait was less than 5 minutes. The waiter was wonderful as usual. My problem was with the food and the price for said food. The French toast flight was dry and uneventful. My sausage was VERY dry and rubbery. The eggs and hash browns were not flavorful. My daughter had steak and it was dry and almost burnt. If it were my first time coming her I definitely would not return. New cook?
6/9/2019,20190609,3,4.19,"I live in the suburbs of Chicago, about 45 minutes from this place so I don't get here often. I've been here at least 7 times and the food was amazing each time. The last two time I have been the food has not been worth the price. Last time I went my friend said her omelette was rubbery and bland. I had the French toast and it was dry and not flavorful. This time the food was even worse. If this were my first time trying it I would not return. I do not know if I will be returning anytime soon."
6/10/2019,20190610,5,4.19,Great staff and great food. It's been our family breakfast pace for a few months now. We recommend this spot to all our friends from out of town. Don't miss it!
6/10/2019,20190610,5,4.19,"Awesome food, and hospitality. Never leave without having a french toast flight to share with you group."

6/10/2019,20190610,3,4.19,"The food was above average but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  We went there Saturday, June 8th for Birthday Brunch, asked for the wooden table in front which seats 10. A party of 17 had gotten there before us, so we expected to wait. The party of 17 gave up and left. Our party waited from 10:30 to 12:00 to get that table and it was given to someone else that arrived after us. We were finally seated in table in the back by the kitchen. The waiter was impatient and there was an air or arrogance from him and the hostess. I am a south sider, and I for one, will never go that distance to be treated the way we were treated that day!"
6/11/2019,20190611,5,4.19,"Great little find which visiting Chicago! My friends live in Lincoln Park and love this place! They put us on the wait list via the Yelp app so we were able to have a leisurely morning at home before heading out. Once we arrived, the line was literally down the street. Thankfully, that wasnt for us (thanks yelp app)!The food was great! We had the French Toast sampler to share (whatever had caramel and nuts on it was MY fave, but the lemon stood out as well. Imagine lemon pound cake. That!).My friend had a traditional two egg and meat breakfast, her hubs had a grilled chicken salad, and I opted for an omelet with spinach and asiago, and mushrooms. Cheesy hash (I dont usually eat potatoes but at it all!). Service was good! Coffee refills and water refills were on point! Ambiance was good and on the lively side.Only down side was our initial greet. Our server (English was her second language and also leaps and bounds better than my Spanish) but she lacked emotion and just seemed to blurt out the menu and specials fast, with no emotion, and just, well, I was hoping for a bit more personable service. At the end, I spotted who I knew to be the manager - by his actions and his awesome job of having eyes on everything. I introduced myself and found that his name is Frederick. Great job, Frederick! We enjoyed and hope you will come to eat in our fine city someday!"
6/13/2019,20190613,5,4.19,New favorite breakfast spot in Chicago. The most fantastic French toast I've ever had! Will be returning here every time I come to the city.
6/14/2019,20190614,5,4.19,"Amazing French toast and a lot of variety, the food is a high standard great price match made in heaven!"
6/16/2019,20190616,5,4.19,The food was amazing and the service couldn't have been any better... our waiter(not sure of his name) was entertaining and attentive! He was full of riddles and brought all of his section together in laughter. Regardless of the amazing food I will be back for the engaging environment!
6/16/2019,20190616,1,4.19,"While it's understood that restaurants are busy during the holiday season, forgetting that you didn't seat your clients is unacceptable. It was even worse that I reminded them two more times putting my wait time over an hour over the time to get seated. The staff as well as the hostess brushed it off by saying we were ""back at top of list"" yet 2 other groups were seated before us. This is horrible customer service, no clear communication between the 2 hostess and gentleman seating people. Nonetheless not telling the customer where they stood now again or apologizing for their mistake is worse. NEVER again."
6/17/2019,20190617,5,4.19,"I have to start with I LOVE this new Yelp Waitlist feature, it made my trip to Batter & Berries even more delightful than usual! The food was scrumptious as always, I have the palette of a 6 year old, so I like everything quite plain. I had the Blueberry French Toast, Cheesy Potato's, and fried chicken breast - it was all things tasty and right in the world!"
6/17/2019,20190617,4,4.19,"Needs more space, and better wait times food was good but not great like it could've been, and if they're going to give free food to pretty woman they shouldn't let other people see, as you're not giving it to them as well but charging them for the peach French toast you're giving free to others because you want there phone number!"
6/17/2019,20190617,2,4.19,"Over-priced, bad service, and aggressively mediocre food. Terrible ambiance and no redeeming quality. But the food seemed clean."

6/18/2019,20190618,5,4.19,Great food and great customer service! The only issue was the waiting list was way too long. It was worth it but I wish they had a bigger place so that more people could eat sooner.

6/19/2019,20190619,5,4.19,"Amazing place! Food is always delicious! The only thing that sucks is the wait here but def worth it. The service is usually great. Always get the super flight to share. A good tip is they have homemade hot sauce which is amazing with their cheesy hash browns they make. Love everything here, been coming for years"

6/20/2019,20190620,5,4.19,"Absolutely awesome experience here. Heard about Batter & Berries from a few people, including my good friend I went with and the food and service was amazing! Loved the cheesy hash browns (yum!!). And I normally try to avoid carbs but I couldn't resist they were sooooo yummy. Also, met the owner Craig, who took a photo with me and my girlfriend. Super awesome and sweet guy . And I found out later, he's my cousins cousin so that was pretty cool too lol. Definitely would recommend this gem of a restaurant!!"
6/22/2019,20190622,5,4.19,Omg! This place is in my top 5 best brunch spots in Chicago! Food was great!! Wait wasn't that bad and service was impeccable! I'll definitely be back!

6/23/2019,20190623,1,4.19,"I put my name on the waitlist about 30 minutes ago via Yelp. When I checked my place in line 2 minutes ago, it says I'd been removed despite the wait being 75-104 min and my name being 54th on the list initially. Why my name was removed, I've no idea but I'm glad I decided to check prior to driving all the way there. If you aren't going to properly use the Yelp waitlist feature, take it off your business profile. Or at the very least, send a message to those you are randomly deleting off the waitlist so they know prior to arriving."

6/24/2019,20190624,5,4.19,Came here with my sister for brunch and we loved it immediately. Such a great vibe; everyone was clearly having a great time. The servers are great at helping you navigate the menu if it's your first time and encouraged us to try the Salmon Executive and French Toast Flight. It was delicious and worth the $$! We'll be back!

I normally get the Crab Cake Benedict or the Brisket Hash which are both absolutely amazing. The Brisket literally falls apart in your mouth. It is hard to decide which one to get so the wife and I normally order both and we share. The French Toast Flight is also another must try item here. If you are lucky, you will get the funny server who likes to crack riddles lol."

6/26/2019,20190626,2,4.19,"I have wanted to try Batter & Berries for the longest time but have never been able to stop by due to the insanely long lines over the weekend. Fortunately, I had some free time in the middle of the week and decided to stop by during lunch hours. Even though it was in the middle of the week, it was still pretty crowded so I would plan accordingly if you want to try this place.My friends and I each ordered the Cluck-n-Gaufre (chicken and sweet potato waffle) for ourselves and shared an order of the French Toast Flight. The presentation of the Cluck-n-Gaufre was nice, but there was a strange odor that was off-putting from the waffle. It turns out that the odor was exactly how the waffle tasted. Personally, I was not a fan of how the waffle tasted. The waffle had a peculiar whole-grain, gritty taste and texture to it that did not taste like sweet potato at all. It was also oddly sweet in a nutty fashion. I do not like to waste food, but I could not really stomach more than a couple bites of the waffle. The sauce on the chicken was eerily similar to that of Chinese sweet and sour takeout. The French toast flight was better, but it was overly sweet for my taste. To be fair, I was never the biggest fan of French toast from the start.Unfortunately, I was not a fan of my order. I greatly appreciated the waitress's hospitality when she said she forgot to mention that the waffle could have been switched out (it seemed like many people were not fans of the waffle's taste). I would not brave the lines on the weekends for this restaurant since the food didn't jive with my taste buds. I'm glad I was able to stop by to check out this iconic restaurant, but sadly my order did not hit the mark this time."
6/26/2019,20190626,2,4.19,"TLDR: Dont rely on the Yelp waitlist, quality of food isn't great/seems to be declining with increasing popularity I really wanted to like this place especially since there aren't many black owned businesses in Lincoln Park. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the experience from start to finish. This place has infamously long wait times but you are able to join the waitlist through the yelp app. I decided to use this feature to avoid having to wait outside the restaurant (they don't have a waiting area). When you join the waitlist it gives you a time you need to check in by. Before this time arrive I was kicked off the yelp waitlist out of nowhere. I tried calling to figure out what the issue was but nobody answered. I rejoined the waitlist and was kicked off again so we decided to just go. We arrived and I explained to the hostess that we got kicked off the yelp waitlist before our check in time. she responded with an attitude and said we would have to wait 1.5 hours. I told her that was unacceptable and she adjusted and said 30. 40 mins later we are finally seated. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, my friend order the brisket and another ordered an omelette. We were all disappointed with our food-- none of our meals were hot. The gravy was good but the biscuit was really dense and doughy, not flaky at all. My friend said the brisket wasn't seasoned and lacked flavor. My other friend had been there before and said that her food was noticeably lower quality than last time she ate here. The hash browns were the hugest disappointment this is supposed to one of their signature dishes and it disappointed. Not crispy at all and barely had any cheese even though it's advertised as ""cheesy"". Our waitress didn't check on us a single time after we received our food. Water glasses went empty. I really wanted to support this place but sadly I would not recommend."
6/26/2019,20190626,4,4.19,"Delicious breakfast food! Went alone and got a seat right away but it did take about 20-30 min to get my order in. Had to grab a manager since the server wasn't coming to my table, which is the only reason for a star deduction bc otherwise, this place would've def gotten a five star review!"
6/27/2019,20190627,5,4.19,Our hostess and server were so kind and accommodating! The food was delicious and fresh and mouthwatering!
6/29/2019,20190629,4,4.19,"This place is notorious for having a really long wait and you can't make reservations. Lots of different kinds of pancakes, waffles, egg dishes, etc. to explore. I had a traditional breakfast while my friend's did pancakes with different fruit toppings everyone really enjoyed their meal worth the wait. The french toast is so good and the fresh fruit is very taste. Food beautifully presented and arrived relatively quickly. Coffee refills plentiful."
6/30/2019,20190630,5,4.19,"Nayline is the best waitress here she goes above and beyond while eating here.Everything was amazing trio French toast to sausage omelettes , cheesy hash and that juicy ribeye in wine sauce ugh so delicious literally everything looked and tasted bomddotcom a must to visit and wait time"
6/30/2019,20190630,4,4.19,"The food was great and lots of options to choose from. I'm not big on pastries and toast. I sampled my friend's toast flight and it was devine, melts in your mouth. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Not a long wait for food, entrees came out 10 min after ordering. It did get a little hot inside, bit uncomfortable, needed better cooling system on the day I dined."
7/3/2019,20190703,1,4.19,"I've been wanting to try this place since breakfast is our favorite meal but it's never worked out. We found street parking and there was no wait. So far so good. Cute place but very noisy! We could barely hear the waitress explain the specials. We decided to split the Cluck & Gravy and the French Toast Flight. If you're looking for a traditional biscuits and gravy dish, the Cluck & Gravy is NOT what you want! The dish is explained on the menu as handmade buttermilk & herb biscuits with house made chicken sausage gravy served with eggs. I asked the waitress if this was a traditional biscuit and gravy dish and she confirmed that it is. The biscuits are not herbed BUT SWEET! And while the sausage gravy was a great consistency, it was sweet also from the chicken sausage which had maple in it...which the waitress confirmed after she served it! Honestly I'm so confused that a waitress doesn't know how menu items are prepared and taste AND is totally wrong when asked!We were hungry so we ate the Cluck and Gravy but after so much sweetness...we couldn't touch the French Toast Flight. I called the manager over and explained to him what was bothering us but he told me to take the french toast home as it would be great warmed up. Obviously didn't want to give comp it and I didn't push it. But I'm sure the entire dish will be thrown away!Also to add insult to injury...the 2 eggs over easy that my husband ordered came with one broken. He doesn't like to complain so he just ate it. And the hash browns were soggy. Covering anything in cheese is usually good but not these hash browns.Needless to say...we will not be back!"
7/5/2019,20190705,5,4.19,"The perfect spot for Sunday brunch and not just because the street parking is free! After hearing so much about this establishment we had to check it out and it exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend putting your parties name on the waitlist as wait times can be lengthy but well worth it. Another dope thing about B&B is that its BYOB which allowed us to make our own mimosas using their juices (we chose pineapple and it was lovely). My fiancé and I ordered the Brisket Hash, Lobster Benedict, and Caramel French Toast and were blown away by the flavor of everything we ordered from the savory and tender brisket, the richness of the lobster, and the downright perfection of the french toast we were left extremely satisfied and, as I write this review, wanting another round of our order!"
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.19,This place is definitely worth the hype! The waitlist function on Yelp timed out on us but the hostess was very accommodating and understanding. We were able to be seated rather quickly and the staff never let our glasses stay empty.The French toast flight was delicious as was the biscuits and gravy. Both dishes were split by two people and it was filling. I am currently typing this stuffed and anticipating the best food coma as soon as I get home. I would definitely make this trek again!
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.19,Service and food was amazing. Drove all the way to Chi town from ATL and had to try this place. It did not disappoint. French toast is to die for. Wait can be long so check in before hand.
7/6/2019,20190706,5,4.19,"When they opened, they were ""worth the wait."" But now they have reconfigured and you can get on the waitlist ahead of time on yelp. So now it is a must try. The French Toast flight is the four best French Toasts in Chicago. The fried chicken is second to none on the Cluck n Gaufre"
7/7/2019,20190707,5,4.19,I have no words. The food here was amazing. Our waiter was fun of great energy and unmatched hospitality skills. We arrived at 8:15am (they open at 8am) and there was already a packed house. I ordered the Salmon Executive which was very tasty!
7/7/2019,20190707,5,4.19,"What an awesome place! Chicago at its finest: great food, friendly service, unpretentious atmosphere. The French toast flight is not to be missed. Make sure you study up on your riddles before you go:). Our waiter had such positive energy and made it an unforgettable experience for us."
7/9/2019,20190709,5,4.19,Yassss yasssss yasssss Im here for all the French toast. Chicken was seasoned very well. I was disappointed in the sweet potato waffle but not to worry because they exchanged if for the succulent blueberry waffle which was delish! The waiter was great with his jokes and the room was filled with good vibes. Just remember it's byob!
7/10/2019,20190710,4,4.19,"Put your name on the list on yelp before heading there, saves you a bunch of time! I did this and was able to get a spot within 5 minutes of checking in and getting there! A friend has referred me here and after a year, I finally was able to make a stop here. I honestly wasn't super hungry so I decided just to get a breakfast wrap. I also ordered fries, to which the waitress said ""you know there are potatoes in the wrap already, right?"" YES MISS I KNOW. JUST GIMME ME MY FRIES. Anyway, aside from that teensy exchange, the service was excellent. The wrap and fries didn't blow my mind but they were tasty. If I were to return, I'd definitely want to try out the french toast. The couple next to me ordered the trio and it looked absolutely delightful. A couple small cons of this place is how clutter it is. Tables are close together, the communal table is in the middle, where a lot of traffic is, and there is a waiting area further back. Because of this, it can get pretty loud too, which isn't ideal for catching up with a friend etc."
7/10/2019,20190710,3,4.19,"Let me start off with saying the French toast flight was delicious. I ordered a side egg scrambled medium with cheese but it came cooked hard which Jessica our waitress could see and offered to replace . When she did bring it there was no cheese on the egg. I opted just to eat it as is. My guy ordered the Green City Omelet and he wanted no onions but was told they could not do it without the onions .... hmmm that was odd but he said ok. He said he enjoyed his food after he had to pick out the onions. The coffee was ""meh"" .. they only offer Stevia and raw sugar . Not a fan of either but I chose the raw sugar. I could tell it seemed to be short staffed . We were fortunate not to have to wait for a table perhaps because it was Wednesday before 12. Found a park in front of the place which was awesome! Jessica was sweet and accommodating however she had to service a lot of patrons. I am finally glad I had the chance to visit B&B. I would suggest that they lower the volume of the music a bit . I live south so not sure if I have to return."
7/13/2019,20190713,4,4.19,"I was in town from DC, and on a recommendation from a friend I went. Said from being told we would be seated in 20 minutes, which turned in an hour the place is a must try. The food was great. The pancakes had a ton of flavor, and other in my party raves about the French toast. Will return if I am back in the Chi."
7/13/2019,20190713,5,4.19,This place never disappoints! Service is great. Use the Yelp app to get on the wait list.
7/14/2019,20190714,5,4.19,I cam all the way from ATL to try their cuisine. I absolutely loved it. I had the French toast sampler and the chicken Alfredo omelette. Amazing!!!
7/14/2019,20190714,1,4.19,"This is by the far the worst experience I have had from some of the staff here at this restaurant. Let me begin with the hostess, she was not welcoming and seemed to be very dismissive when we realized we were kicked off the waitlist. To help everyone when reserving your spot - once you place your name on the waitlist, you need to arrive within 30 minutes to physically check in to the hostess. Once your checked in you will then be in the queue for a table. Unfortunately this is not on the website or on yelp. When we came to check why were kicked off, the hostess explained we should have received a text (which we didn't) and that if you don't check in you're kicked off the list. We explained we didn't know and again this is not articulated on the website or yelp. When asked what can be done she was not willing to assist and told us to wait an additional hour. So I asked for the manager and informed of the issue. I will say this, the manager Michelle was very understanding and accommodating. She informed us that she will see what she can do about getting a table for us within the next 30 min. We agreed to wait. We then returned inside to the hostess to check after waiting 45 min and the hostess, yet again was very dismissive and informed us to wait another 30 min. We explained that Michelle told us 30 min already and she replied ""do you want to talk to her yourself?"" I stated yes, but what my issue is - is that she, the hostess, was not willing to check with Michelle nor was she willing to see about anything. Eventually Michelle was able to get us seated after another 10 min. So all was well. Dining experience was fine - food amazing!! And quick!! But honestly we were rushed during our dining time. The bus staff was grabbing plates before we were done. It got to a point where one busser almost dropped the plate on our friend in her white dress. While the plates were gone, we were still sipping our mimosas just enjoying each other conversation. Same busser arrived and started grabbing plates and cups again including our water glasses. Which we were still sipping. Demanding if we were done and tried grabbing the champagne bottle. I got so frustrated and just yelled take it all. And walked out. I honestly couldn't take it anymore. I was tired of talking to Michelle. Tired of telling people we were still trying to eat off that plate. So over this experience. While I know this place will always have business it would help to take time to make the experience an enjoyable one. I felt rushed and didn't really get a chance to take it all in. I encourage the management to really take this review into consideration and moving forward in being mindful of the experience and not just try to get people rushed through."
7/15/2019,20190715,5,4.19,I loved everything here. It's BYOB and allowed for my friends to enjoy our company. The French toast flights were great.
7/19/2019,20190719,4,4.19,"not my favorite brunch place of Chicago but it is still worth trying if you've never been! I came for the much hyped French toast and I will say, their special French toast of the day lived up to the hype. It happened to be watermelon and Tito's vodka. I know what you're thinking, ""vodka in a French toast??"" They made it work. The watermelon was super refreshing for a warm fresh French toast. I love the creativity involved with the flavors that they have here. The other options on the menu look great too but the reason why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don't have any combos in place to pair savory with sweet. Eating a whole plate of french toast was too much even for my sweet tooth (and I love sweets). Ordering two entrees would be too much and expensive so I recommend sharing with friends.Also when putting yourself on the waitlist on yelp, expect the higher end of the estimated wait time. I had to wait probably much longer than estimated just to get seated."
7/20/2019,20190720,3,4.19,"First time here and will be my last, the food left a lot to be desired. You'd think that with the 2hr+ wait time the food would be good but it's overhyped, I suggest you save yourself the disappointment and go to Stax cafe or WHISK."
7/21/2019,20190721,5,4.19,This is my 2nd time here and it is even better than the first! This place does not disappoint. They're combination of flavorful dishes is a delight to my palette!
7/21/2019,20190721,5,4.19,"DELICIOUS food, Funny and friendly waiter. It's rare that I've gone to a restaurant and everything I have it mind blowing delicious. My party decided to all get something different so we could have a sampling of everything. I had the moving on up steak. It was super tender, scrumptious and the cheesy hash was similar to Cracker Barrel. We also had the French toast flier (their signature dish) the bacon was thick and perfectly crispy. My over easy eggs were perfect, the fried chicken was well seasoned juicy and crispy. Even the juices were good. Our server was a funny guy, who told jokes and was super attentive. Only slightly negative was the wait time but trust me it was worth it."
7/21/2019,20190721,4,4.19,The Flight was delicious and my favorite one was the caramel! It's BYOB which is cool. Seating can be a little awkward for the large tall table since multiple parties are seated there. All and all the food is good!
7/22/2019,20190722,5,4.19,Best French toast I've ever had and the Sweet potato waffle with fried chicken it was amazing!!
7/26/2019,20190726,5,4.19,This is a great breakfast place. French toast was awesome! Super friendly staff. Great customer service.
7/27/2019,20190727,5,4.19,Awesome food and service!!!! It was worth the wait. Once we were seated the service was good from start to finish. The server made sure that we had a great experience. I will definitely visit again when I come back to Chicago.
7/28/2019,20190728,5,4.19,"I went here with my girls and the food was amazing! I ordered the crab cake Benedict and it was so good and well seasoned! Our server, Tusimee was such and wonderful delight, he told great jokes and made our brunch super special. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely wait just to eat here again."
7/29/2019,20190729,5,4.19,My favorite place to eat. Great atmosphere and amazing food. I totally love this place! I attend here every 3 months with my friends.
7/29/2019,20190729,2,4.19,French toast is not really stuffed. Nookies is much better. Sweet potato waffles with chicken is decent
7/30/2019,20190730,5,4.19,"Went this morning for a family breakfast. This place is so good. The service is great and the food is even better. There is a wait, not long though. But it was well worth it. Would definitely recommend it, the food is an experience alone."
7/30/2019,20190730,4,4.19,"I absolutely love the food and the service at this restaurant. I moved away from home in Chicago, but try to make a visit here for breakfast whenever I'm home. I craved for the caramel french toast and nothing else would suffice. It was soooooo good. My steak was great as well. Until next time."
7/31/2019,20190731,5,4.19,The most amazing French toast I've ever had. The Carmel one is to die for. The staff is super friendly and nice. Plus they have a lot of vegetarian options. 5/5
7/31/2019,20190731,5,4.19,Been here a half dozen times and have yet to be disappointed! I usually go with the special!
8/2/2019,20190802,4,4.19,"Aside from the great food, the environment is really good. I love how inviting everyone is. The food is always on point and the service is fast. They don't keep you waiting all day. I tried something new. I liked it but I didn't love it like other dishes I've had. But I'm not writing them off. Some things aren't meant for everyone and that's cool. When I'm back I'm getting the flight. It's always something on the menu of the week that makes me want it. But I'll be back for sure."
8/4/2019,20190804,4,4.19,"Finally got to try this place. We had to arrive right when they opened to avoid a line or a long wait.We were waiting for one other person to join the party but our whole party had to arrive before we would be seated- which makes sense given how quickly seats fill up there's no saving seats lol.Our waitress thoroughly went over the menu with us. They had an array of specials outside of the regular menu, which was great but really we were there to try the famous french toast.Which leads me to it- it was delicious. I got the flight, which is a sampler of all of the specialty french toasts. They were all good but my favorite was the strawberry french toast. When I come back I def would just get the regular size of that.The french toasts aren't served with sides. If you want things like bacon, eggs, hash browns, etc., they are served and charged a la carte- which can easily tack another $15 on to your bill. I got a side of bacon which was $5 for 4 pieces however, it was super delicious.Def will be back and will try some different menu items."
8/4/2019,20190804,5,4.19,Make sure to join the Yelp waitlist or atleast see how long your wait would be if you walked in. It's actually pretty accurate. We had a party of 6 but the waitlist only allowed 4 at the time. However they were able to accommodate and we were still sat at said time. The food?! Delicious. Exceeded my expectations. I don't like how that door slams lol. they need to get that fixed ASAP but other than that. definitely recommend.
8/4/2019,20190804,4,4.19,"This place had great reviews so we decided to give it a try. They had a little bit of a wait but we thought why not? Be sure to add yourself to the wait list using Yelp before you get there to shorten your wait time. The restaurant is small so you may be required to wait outside before they call you in to sit in their inside wait area that consists of 3 small concrete benches. We ended up being seated at the high top table that sits in the middle of the restaurant. I didn't mind it because it forces you to have to interact with strangers. Please pass the syrup Mr. Fedora. The server was okay and I do simply mean okay. She wasn't attentive but I guess you can't expect to be checked on when you receive your food if it's known for being amazing. My boyfriend ordered the blueberry French toast. When I tell you the first bite sent me to heaven and back... I mean I just felt at peace! It was absolutely perfect. It wasn't crispy or soggy. It was just right. I originally ordered a mushroom and spinach omelette with hash browns. Don't do it. Absolutely disgusting. Not really sure why it's on the menu. There was some type of sauce spread on the omelette that was overwhelming. I usually will just suck it up since I ordered it but NO. I had to let someone know that this was not it. I then ordered a mushroom, egg, and cheese sandwich. That sandwich was amazing. The portobello mushroom was perfectly seasoned. It's a healthy portion so you won't be left hungry. I took away one star for the service."
8/5/2019,20190805,5,4.19,"so amazing!! we had the salmon executive special and banana walnut waffle. the place looks decent on the outside, but serves spectacular food inside! what drew us in is the constant lines of people waiting outside. all of the workers are friendly and this is one of the best meals i've had over the 3 months i've been in chicago."
8/6/2019,20190806,4,4.19,"I'm a semi regular. The food is great, but service if often a hit or miss. I was there with my mom and had a long 1 hour + wait, but the service and food was phenomenal. Today, I went with a friend, there was about a 5 minute wait, but everything was mediocre. Today was almost like a training day with bogus service. We were asked for our chair like 3 times during our stay. Today just wasn't it."
8/7/2019,20190807,1,4.19,"Food was pretty good - I normally don't get the ""lunch"" items for brunch; but they were better than the breakfast items. The fried chicken was especially good. The problem is the service was crawling slow - I live in the area and was able to put my name down to fight the 90 minute wait; but it took over 2 hours from start to finish for breakfast. Major production - food was good... but not that good for 2 hours."
8/7/2019,20190807,5,4.19,"Holy cow. Visiting from the foodie Bay Area where good breakfast/brunch places are a dime a dozen. But this place...Amazing French toast that is so naturally sweet and flavorful you don't need syrup. Good strong coffee. Great, down-to-earth vibe. Just go."
8/8/2019,20190808,4,4.19,"Food - AMAZING! Service - fast, friendly and fun! Our server told jokes and riddles - our six year old loved it! The only drawbacks to eating here is the heat - it's very warm inside the restaurant in summer. The front door is constantly opening and closing (because it's so popular) so I imagine it's hard to regulate the temperature. It's also extremely loud in there. But then food is well worth all of that."
8/9/2019,20190809,4,4.19,"I love Batter & Berries, but I do not love hour-plus wait times before I eat. Enter the new location along the riverwalk! There's a limited menu, but I'm all for concentrating on what you can execute well. Today I ordered the gauf, which is a sweet-potato waffle sandwich with fried chicken in the middle. I've never had it at the regular restaurant so I can't compare it to the original, but I enjoyed the sandwich. The chicken was nicely fried and had a little kick to it. This wasn't my favorite waffle, but it was pretty good and on the whole, the meal worked. Staff was very pleasant and efficient. I will definitely return before the summer's over to get the french toast flight."
8/9/2019,20190809,5,4.19,"Fantastic is an understatement! Great service, awesome food and the owner was so gracious... Check it out. Beyond delicious!!!"
8/11/2019,20190811,3,4.19,Went here specifically because they had the buckwheat gluten free pancakes. When ordering they said they were out of them and didn't have any other gluten free items available. Had to order a scramble with the sauce on the side because all the sides contained gluten. Be sure to call before arriving if your set on the gluten free pancakes.
8/11/2019,20190811,3,4.19,"According to the waitlist we were supposed to check in at 11:55am, we did but weren't seated until 1pm. What's the point of the waiting list? All to tell us they run out of steaks!!! Very disappointing!!! The rest of the food was good."
8/12/2019,20190812,4,4.19,"I had tried coming here a few years ago but was definitely not expecting a two hour wait. I'm glad I finally went back and decided to wait it out. There's a wait for a reason, as this place is super popular for the heavy breakfast dishes. Come hungry and ready to be in a food coma shortly after. We did not take advantage of the BYOB situation, but most people were. We sat at the community table and were served right away with great service.We ordered the chicken and waffle and the ribeye deconstructed omelet to share. The chicken and waffle was deliciously spicy and scrumptious. I loved the fried chicken bits in the sweet potato waffle, and the hot sauce was super tasty as well. The ribeye deconstructed omelet was not what we were expecting but still delicious. It was more of a scrambeled egg concoction, and the hashbrowns were tasty and cheesy. It was a lot of food, but some of the other dishes I was eyeing and would have wanted to try next time were the shrimp frittata and french toast flight."
8/12/2019,20190812,5,4.19,"My apologies for the late review. It's about one month late so I don't remember my waitress name, but the entire staff was welcoming. The food was a foodie's dream if you like soulful savory and BYOB. Anywho, I'll be back when I'm in town. It'll be my go-to breakfast/brunch spot in the area."
8/13/2019,20190813,5,4.19,"So freaking amazing. I love this place for breakfast/brunch. The French toast is so flavorful. I always get the blueberry flavor as well as ""the traditional"" which includes eggs, bacon, and hash browns. Great environment as well!"
8/14/2019,20190814,5,4.19,"6/5 HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE BRUNCH PLACE IVE EVER BEEN TO!!Not only was the menu so unique, with specials rotating every few months, but it was so DELICIOUS and the service could not be beat. PLUS it seemed black owned?? (I could be wrong) Even greater when we can support small, POC-owned businesses. I got the fried chicken and sweet potato waffles and DAMN was it good. The fried chicken was so juicy and well seasoned with a really good nutmeg hot sauce on top. The sweet potato waffle was like Christmas in a waffle, more savory than sweet, and was a good twist on a classic. I wish I could try their entire menu because the waiter that described all their specials so well I was drooling by the end of it. He was also so friendly and randomly asked the crowd riddles every now and then, the entire experience was just so fun! It felt like walking into a family gathering. All my friends food was good too, and it's also home to a WAFFLE FLIGHT! And God their cheesy hash browns were so good too!"
8/14/2019,20190814,4,4.19,This place is wonderful. I had the beer batter fish with fries. Loved it! My only complaint is I wish the fish was bigger lol lol. I totally recommend a visit here.
8/16/2019,20190816,3,4.19,"We ordered the chicken and seeet potatoes waffles. We both did not like it at all. It was not the taste we were looking for. It's suppose to be a really good dish but I didn't see it for it.We also ordered the French toast flight that I can give lemon, dulce , strawberry, and blue berry. It was all very delicious and tasty. I really liked this entree. We notified the waiter that we didn't like the waffle and she gladly exchanged it for chicken and biscuits and my boyfriend like it way better. It came with a bowl on grits with a biscuit in the middle, hash browns and eggs. It was very tasty and filling."
8/16/2019,20190816,3,4.19,The food was pretty good I got the French toast flight! The only thing I have to complain about is that the sausage I had was tasted a little plain. I wasn't completely satisfied but I wasn't completely let down either.
8/16/2019,20190816,5,4.19,This is one of the few places that I don't mind the wait time.. Every visit exceeds my expectations
8/19/2019,20190819,5,4.19,"Five stars to what will soon be my favourite brunch spot in Chicago, despite the terrible online reservation system. My party of 4 was given an expected seating time of 11:28 am, and we were finally seated at 12:21 PM, after being asked to wait another ""30 minutes"" twice. I recommend not going on an empty stomach, because hanger is a real emotion.I got the Cluck and Gaufre (chicken and waffles), my fiancé got the French toast flight, and our dining companions ordered the chicken fajita omelet. Batter and Berries is BYOB, but they require you to order a chaser, so we had to get the overpriced, not freshly squeezed carafe of orange juice as well.The Cluck and Gaufre is by far the BEST chicken and waffles I've had in this city. The sweet potato waffles with bit of fried chicken in it was topped with a yummy butter spread and was somehow both airy and hearty and altogether delicious! The fried chicken piece that it came with was on the smaller side, but was perfectly fried and smothered with a nutmeg hot sauce with FLAVOR FOR DAYS! My fiancé's French toast flight was also excellent, especially with the addition/upgrade of freshly poached fruits on top. My favourite was the blueberry waffle, but there wasn't a singable mediocre tasting bite on that plate. Our friends reported that the fajita omelet was delicious as well. Our total came to $62 with tip, and all of us left feeling full, so it was value for money as wel. Get a bottle of bubbly, make yourself some mimosas, and tuck yourself into what is probably the best brunch money can buy in Chicago. The wait is well worth it!"
8/20/2019,20190820,5,4.19,"This place is a mood. The ambiance, the people, the FOOD. 1. Black owned business. Rising tides lift all boats2. So much care put into serving quality meals.

8/21/2019,20190821,5,4.19,Tried Batter & Berries today. Went on a weekday because I heard/read it's very popular and I didn't want to wait in line. My daughter got the flight of french toast which was a very nice sampler. They also have a nice selection of savory dishes on the menu but I got their special fritata for the day with various meats (all I could remember was shrimp and chorizo). So light and fluffy and flavorful! Service was very good. By the time we left at 10:30 the place was full... with good reason. Delicious! I will be back to try other dishes!
8/21/2019,20190821,3,4.19,"I was super excited after reading all of reviews and seeing the pictures of the food. I was in Chicago for a weekend and went for brunch on Sunday. The wait was extremely long which to me was a great sign. We joined the wait list and was able to do other things. I wish they would have stated that it was BYOB being an out of towner that information is helpful. I ordered the strawberry french toast, chicken sausage and hashbrowns and my honey ordered the sweet potato waffle and chicken. My food was OK not great the french toast was unique, hashbrowns need to be cooked longer and needed some seaso and but the chicken sausage was killer!! My honey didn't really like his food at all. He said if he ate the waffle alone it didnt have any flavor so you had to eat the chicken and waffle together but the piece of chicken was so small."
8/21/2019,20190821,5,4.19,"This is my go to place for anyone coming into town! Always great food!! Very consistent and the staff are always cheerful! Must try the French toast Super flight, Cluck-N-Gaufre and the special omelettes are always SUPER special!!You will not be disappointed!!"

I've been here three times and it is not doing its justice on how tasty and warm this establishment is. Yes, it's small but, the kind of people I run into are polite, they ask questions, and if you're lucky there could be a potluck going on between tables. It feels like HOME."
8/23/2019,20190823,4,4.19,I really enjoyed the strawberry French toast with the maple butter. We came on a Thursday morning and were seated right away. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The service was great to go along with great food which made it a great experience all around.

8/25/2019,20190825,4,4.19,This place is very very popular. The wait time is really ridiculous. Management needs to come up with a better system to assist. I highly recommend taking reservations OVER THE PHONE. The online system of taking reservations DO NOT WORK. I also recommend to add a 2 hour maximum dining on the weekend due to assist with the crowd control. My wait time went from 20 minutes to 1 hour and a half to seat 2 people and we arrived at 9:30 am. They opened at 8:00 am. I have to be honest my server TIM made up for the wait time with his OUTSTANDING customer service and friendly disposition. This was my first time here and if it wasn't for TIM I would not come back here due to the wait. The food was AMAZING!! I like how they have different weekly specials. This week I tried the Peach Crown Royal French Toast and it Blessed my Soul. The fruit and the sauce make it PHENOMENAL!! The whisky BBQ chicken omelette was heaven! I had a great time at this establishment! I would recommend this place for brunch. Expect to wait up to 2 hours to be seated if you do not arrive when they open at 8:00 am.

Still busy a hour before close says good things lol. This establishment is BYOB, that's always good. Now for the food! I ordered the flight french toast which consisted of strawberry French toast, blueberry French toast, lemon French toast, and caramel dulce French toast. The strawberry was my favorite! The maple butter that came along side of the French toast was so yummy! After that Compliments of chef and owner we received their specialty French toast of the week which was peach French toast. Every week there is a new flavor. The shrimp frittata followed after all those sweet goodies! This establishment is cozy the atmosphere is just right. The staff was great as well! Everyone was polite and friendly. What I loved most was the diversity within the establishment from staff to customers! Great experience!"

His description of of the food literally swayed us into ordering multiple dishes per person. Waiting for the food to arrive to the table was awesome as the waiter did group trivia amongst the tables. Once the food arrived we started with the French toast Super Flight as a shared appetizer, followed by the Shrimp/Chorizo Frittata and Chicken and Waffles. The chicken and waffles was unique as it has chicken stuffed in the waffle as well as a fried boneless breast on the side. Dont forget your champagne, it's a BYOB brunch."
9/1/2019,20190901,1,4.19,"Seriously I've heard great things about this place but have always heard about the long wait so I never went.This weekend a group of friends decided we were going to go here no matter what just so we can see what the hype is about and hands down it is the most mediocre place you could ever find. I've always understood that people's tastes differ from one person to another so this person might like something, that person doesn't and its cool. But this is one of those places that I seriously do not understand why it's gotten the reviews it has.Everyone else must be eating off of a super special secret menu that my friends and I just weren't cool enough to get.First off:2 hour wait for a table. wt..? At the 2 hour mark we get a text and walk in.The seats they want to squeeze us into are at the end of a another party's table. wt..?I asked for a real table. ANOTHER 20 mins wait.After 2.5 hours of waiting we get called back in.We get a table in the back.The place is LOUD. Everyone is screaming and they got club hits blasting over all of it.I heard the french toast was just amazing so of course I had to go for it.Tried the french toast flight.you get 2 sad pieces of french toast on a big plate to make you feel like you're getting a full meal.I swear to you, it is 2 regular pieces of bread, cut in half and they drizzle some stuff on each one to make you think you're getting all this variety.it is a joke. That should be an appetizer or something they give you for free for wasting 2.5 hours of your life outside. (or inside because instead of setting up additional tables to take care of customers they had an indoor waiting area set up near the bathrooms. wt..?)My friends ordered a spinach omelet and breakfast wraps.Zero seasoning.Zero taste.Zero effort.I swear to you, I felt like at any moment people were going to come out and tell me I was on a hidden camera prank show. There is no way in hell people are waiting 2 + hours for this. I don't get it at all.I promise you, you can go absolutely anywhere and get better food without the wait.SMH."
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.19,"Long wait time, but the food and service is great! I had the fried catfish special which was good, but the sauce on top was a little too sweet for me. It is BYOB! I tried the super flight French toast and the lemon and lunchroom butter cookie (weekly special) and fell in love! Also the cluck & gravy was great!! I would definitely get either when I return!"
9/2/2019,20190902,4,4.19,"We came here on a holiday (Labor Day). Got here about 15 minutes after it opened, and it was already pretty packed. Our wait for 2 was less than 15 minutes. We ordered the French toast Flight...AMAZING. I couldn't pick my favorite. For entrees we got the ""executive"" steak and eggs....mixed feelings. The eggs might have been the best part. The steak itself was delicious, but not the mushroom sauce on top. It just tasted like lots of black pepper, so I recommended asking for it on the side. Also, they don't carry steak/A1 sauce so you're left with the sauce it comes with or plain. Hashbrowns were my least fav. And we also ordered the strawberry french toast as another entree. Still good. Overall good experience, nice spot. Get. Here. Early!!!!!"
9/2/2019,20190902,5,4.19,"Love the specials here. The french toast flight is a must and I don't even like french toast. Also, if you're coming on the weekend prepare yourself for a long wait. The food is really good but if you get hangry I might not come on a totally empty stomach."

Get some berries at the grocery store and whip an egg, some milk and melted buttered in a bowl, add a little vanilla and you have the same thing that you will be served here."
9/3/2019,20190903,4,4.19,"Great place. They utilize their space. So if you are a party of two and there is a four top open, plan on waiting. This is strategic on their part. But as a patron watching people be seated who just walked in, after you've been waiting for 10 mins isn't cool. Other then that the food is good. But very rich."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.19,"I came a few weekends ago with some girlfriends for a celebratory brunch, and we had the best time. All the food was delicious - I had the lemon French toast and holy cow. Friends got strawberry which was also very good. Also, their hot sauce (I had a couple of eggs as well) is to die for. Like I would buy a truckful of it and bathe in it. My friends brought champagne and we did a nice BYOB pitcher of mimosas. Finally, the experience was topped off with the greatest server who had a seemingly endless supply of riddles, which just made the whole thing more fun. The wait is long but now you can get in line through the yelp app which makes it a little better. Plus the weather was perfect so we didn't mind hanging around outside."
9/5/2019,20190905,5,4.19,"My family and I decided to eat here one random Saturday morning. We are a big family you could say, nine of us plus a 1 year old. The wait time was a bit long around 35 to 45 minutes. But once it was our turn to be seated the service was quick and great. The atmosphere was wonderful as well. Walls were a mustard, yellow-ish color, filled with paintings or other images. Though this is a small restaurant and not that wide, be prepared to possibly be seated close to people you may not know. Our food and drinks came quick, everyone in my family ordered breakfast. Consisting of either; french toast, eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, or an omelette. The food was great quality, juicy, warm, and reasonably priced. I got one of their breakfast meals that came with eggs, sausage, and four different kinds of french toast. Blueberry, Strawberry, Lemon, Pecan, and a birthday cake version remix special. Overall, with this being my first time dining here I would say i'm definitely going to go again. Everything was smooth going and an enjoyable breakfast. Our server was very nice, helpful, and patient. I can't wait to go back!"
9/6/2019,20190906,5,4.19,"What an amazing place! You know it's good when the wait is 45 minutes! This may sounds crazy but the best part of the whole meal was the fact they use cream for their coffee...what a life changer...I now only use cream in my coffee...and I way ten pounds more...but hey...you gotta live! Seriously though amazing French Toast, Spicy Cluck-N-Gaufre (fried chicken on waffles...you haven't lived until you've had that) most important thing I can tell you is.....MAKE A RESERVATION ON YELP! seriously I made a reservation for six before I left the AirBnB in Wriggleyville and walked right in to my table! You need to eat here!"

9/7/2019,20190907,4,4.19,I was a first time visitor on 8/27/19. The food was Great. It was very noisy but it meant we wouldn't be able to hear people smacking while chewing . I will return. The menu selections are inviting
9/7/2019,20190907,2,4.19,"This is my fourth time at this establishment and the previous three I've never had a problem but TODAY?......to the owner I commend you on your service and consistently good delectable dishes that you provide but sir your staff needs a lesson in plain ole courtesy. This is not a bash your establishment review but rather I hope you address the issue review. Sir as a fellow member of a BGLO I would hope you understand that being treated with kindness and respect should be paramount! Especially in a restaurant arena. Me and my girlfriend attended your establishment this morning, I was already prepared for the wait (that wasn't my issue) the problem came when I received a text saying that my table was almost ready and to check in with the hostess. The hostess was on her phone and twirling her hair before even addressing me. Her blank and cold welcome was off putting, I proceeded to tell her that we received a text stating that the table was almost ready and she sarcastically said you can wait outside. As unwelcoming as that was that was fine. When we recieved the next text saying the table was ready we walked back in and were asked if we wanted to be seated at the community table (as if we had a choice) I asked if we can have a regular table and the guy led us back to some benches and said it would only be a few minutes. After waiting a additional 15 minutes and watching EIGHT PEOPLE seated before us we asked the guy about our table. He tried to explain the people ahead of us had more people in their party but he would get the manager. After another 10 minutes the manager Michelle comes out and we explain our situation, she in return tries to explain that the tables that were open were for larger groups. My girlfriend got increasingly upset because while Michelle was explaining, literally right in front of us a group of three people were seated at a table for four, so eleven people ended up being seated before us after waiting hour outside. We were about to leave when finally she magically had a table open up. Her demeanor was very sarcastic when she announced to the guy that first sat us down that we would be sitting at ""this"" table. We were very upset and probably should have left but our server Leslie ended up putting smiles on our faces which eased the disappointment a little. I hope you take this review to heart and accept this criticism because if not I will not go back to a establishment to be treated like crap ever again."

9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.19,"Absolutely, wait your ass off here or use their virtual Yelp waitlist -- worth it either way. Mmm, maybe not worth it if it's longer than an hour, lol. I've got to say the French toast flight is a tad overrated? Don't get me wrong... it was super tasty. We even added an extra cookie flavor, but it didn't make me fall out of my seat. Don't cry if you don't get it because no one wants to share with you. We had an array of items, such as this specialty shrimp omelette, biscuit and gravy, and corned beef hash. Factoring in the price, texture, and flavor, the hash definitely made it as everyone's favorite. If you're a tourist and deciding between Wildberry Pancakes and Batter and Berries, chose this spot. The flavors are more worth it. Wildberry is only attractive due to their large portions."
9/8/2019,20190908,5,4.19,"Loved loved loved this place! I was in Chicago visiting from Dallas. This was probably one of the best experiences we had. The staff was just amazing! Honestly over the top! It's a small business that really takes pride in what they do, and it really shows through their amazing food. It's a small spot so you have to call ahead to make sure you can get in, there seems to always be a wait for this gem. Highly recommend it!"

9/12/2019,20190912,5,4.19,"This place is amazing. The food is great. It is pricey, for what the have to offer it is worth it. And the servers are very nice"

9/13/2019,20190913,3,4.19,"I had been looking forward to returning to Batter & Berries since I had first attempted to dine here last summer. After waiting in line for nearly 3 hours, the restaurant closed and I was given the managers buisness card with the promise of a free meal when I returned. A year has gone by since that happened so I decided to forgive and forget, and return to Batter & Berries fully prepared to pay full fare for my meal. I really ended up wishing I had brought the managers card in with me because I felt I over paid for my food. I knew I should have gotten a waffle or french toast, but once I sat down I really was only in the mood for meat. I tried to shake it, the restaurant is called Batter AND Berries! I really wanted to prder something that contained the ingredients of the namesake! My friend and I decided to split french toast and a menu option under breakfast specials that inculded Eggs, Meat, and Cheese Potatoes (I cannot call them hashbrowns, and I cannot recall if the menu listed them as potatoes or browns, they were not browned). The menu listed the Meat special as $12 give or take some change. I know at other restaurants this would be called a 2 egg special, or a 2x2 (two eggs, meat and some kind of starch or bread) at typically that would cost less than $10. That is at other restaurants, at Batter and Berries they serve the exact same thing for more money. I thought maybe thw portions were larger or the flavor would be put of this world but it was just two plain eggs, spiral ham from the market, and undercooked (and cold) potatoes. The portion was so small I couldnt share with my friend, there just wasnt enough to make it worth her while. Here is the skinny, make your own 2x2 breakfast at home, if youre coming to Batter & Berries then buy waffles or french toast. Dont mess around with anything savory because it just is not special enough to warrent paying special prices. I did sample some waffle and french toast and was pleasantly surprised by just how much better it was than what I had ordered.Also I would like to address the comparisons other Yelp reviews have made between this restaurant and Wild Berry. The only thing that is similar between the two is the word in the name. They are otherwise, apples and oranges. Pro Tip: There are lots of breakfast places in the area with virtually no wait time and food that is just as impressive. Look around for alternatives if the wait is over half an hour."

9/14/2019,20190914,5,4.19,This place was supper nice for breakfast/lunch. I got the lemon French toast which I was a little skeptical about but I think it was my favorite French toast ever since it wasn't overpoweringly sweet. My friend got the shrimp omelet which was one of their specials. If you order tea they give you a large plate that has all the tea leaves that they had and you get to smell and chose which one you want. If I lived here I would definitely come here again.

9/14/2019,20190914,3,4.19,Just okay sweet potato waffles were very dry; chicken was good though as was the French toast
9/15/2019,20190915,5,4.19,"Highly recommend this restaurant for amazing breakfast food! Everyone at our table agreed this was some of their favorite, unique breakfast foods. It's a small little restaurant, so they do a great job of turning over tables quickly! It's more a family, casual vibe as opposed to a boozy brunch (I don't think they served alcohol). Our server was very attentive and the service was great. The menu has great options for sweet and savory!!*highly recommend using yelps waitlist for this restaurant because the wait on weekends is at least over an hour*"
9/15/2019,20190915,5,4.19,"Perfection. The French toast has no right to be this good, but it's better than that. The specials are divinely inspired. Yay, catfish! The wait staff is attentive but not overbearing. The space is rustic yet eclectic. This really is Sunday brunch perfection."
9/15/2019,20190915,2,4.19,I was excited experience this restaurant as I have read a hand full of great yelp reviews. The hype did not live up. We only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (we put our name on the waitlist. You must do that if you are coming here. Otherwise the wait is 3 hours). The atmosphere of the restaurant is subpar. The art is awful and it's so loud in there you can barely here the waitress speak. We had to sit at a community table which I'm fine with but if we had to wait three hours like the wait time said I would not have been thrilled. I ordered a black hot coffee and it was trash coffee I'm not gonna lie. It tasted like they had burned the coffee or it was sitting on the burner too long. My boyfriend got a hot chocolate and it was so obviously powder mix. Like worst than Swiss miss. But like still pretty ok. The food was over hyped. The waitress showed us pictures of the specials and the food came out looking nothing like that. We ordered the flight of French toast to start which was ok but the waitress set it down and RAN away. We needed syrup and forks! I ordered the biscuits and gravy which also comes with a side of eggs and hash browns. The eggs were under seasoned. Hashbrows were average and needed to be more crispy also needed more seasoning. Now for the biscuits and gravy their gravy was check sausage gravy. And you would think you would get pieces of sausage in this gravy correct? Well wrong there were little to no pieces of sausage in the gravy. As for the gravy it was oddly sweet not in a bad way but not what I expected. The biscuits were average. Nothing special. My boyfriend ordered bff chicken sandwhich which he said was good but afterwords put his intestines into a knot! He needed a Pepcid and a nap ASAP. He's doing better now. But it really took him out there for a while. He also got a side of ranch to dip his fries in and it was I believe to be homemade but it was far too mayo based. It wasn't even really ranch like I would rate that ranch 1.4/5 on the ranch scale. I can't say we will be returning to this place. Service was decent food was meh wait was too long and it so over hyped. Thus my 2/5 star rating.
9/18/2019,20190918,5,4.19,"This place has excellent food. My family and I came here for breakfast and we ordered the lamb curry Benedict, shrimp & chorizo omelette and the chicken and waffle. The food blew our minds and was pleasing to the palette. Highly recommend"
9/19/2019,20190919,5,4.19,"Went on a Tuesday around 11am and there was no wait! The food and service we're great - we'll be back next time we're in town! Also, I recommend sharing the French toast flight as an appetizer and getting an entree of your own to try it all :)"
9/21/2019,20190921,5,4.19,"Get hear early and you'll never have to wait long. I love B&B. Great options and service. The worst part is the wait but once. You're in you are having a golden experience. Plus I love Black owned Businesses, so Godspeed B&B."
9/22/2019,20190922,4,4.19,"Worth the wait. (But join the waitlist on Yelp so you don't really have to wait). While out and about Saturday evening, my roommate and I asked for brunch recommendations. Someone suggested Batter & Berries so we decided to give it a go the next Sunday morning. It was within walking distance from us, but it's also close to the Diversey brown line stop for those traveling a bit farther. I knew it was quite a popular place so I joined the waitlist through yelp around 10 and was told to arrive by 11:40. We ended up being seated around noon and ordered pretty much right away since we were hungry. We ordered a French toast flight since that's what our friendly waitress said Batter & Berries was known for. I was disappointed by the lemon French toast (bland) but the pecan French toast was absolutely delicious and the strawberry and blueberry were good as well. We each ordered an egg dish as well. I ordered the traditional breakfast that came with two scrambled eggs, cheesy hash browns and house made sausage. My roommate ordered the chicken fajita omelette. I really liked the house made sausage and think it's worth the $1 up charge. Also, the homemade hot sauce was the perfect kick. Overall, the food and service were great, but the long wait, unappealing artwork, and tight space were certainly cons."
9/22/2019,20190922,3,4.19,"Don't believe the hype! The wait for this place is extremely long. To be perfectly honest it's not worth the wait. I have visited the restaurant twice, thinking, I'll give it a second chance and I'm still not impressed. Menu items are overpriced for what you're served. I will not go here again."
9/23/2019,20190923,5,4.19,"My favorite breakfast spot for French toast . The French toast flight are the best !!! You get one of each . They're all so tasty , soft and full of flavors . I love that they have the list to wait in line ahead of time . Awesome time saver !"
9/25/2019,20190925,5,4.19,"Batter & Berries is one of the BEST places to ever eat. it's a 35-40 minute drive for me but it's definitely worth it. I usually put myself on the waitlist through yelp and when i get there it's no more than like a 10-15 minute wait. They are always excited to greet customers, and always announce their specials. me personally i always get the blueberry french toast, i just can't stop getting that. I wish they had grits but everything is amazing."
9/25/2019,20190925,1,4.19,"We Walked in to have breakfast before work the whole place stunk like dirty kitchen rags or dirty mops. I've worked in many restaurants and have smelled that exact smell come from the sack of kitchen towels, the entire restaurant should NEVER smell like that! The food was good it didn't really make me feel like ""OMG"" but that could be because the smell turned me all the way off. The service was eh. The hostess waitress and busser were on their phones the entire time sitting down. One couple walked in we were already given our check and had put the payment inside the book but had to wait an extra 8 minutes for our payment to be processed because the waitress wine tot get their order. Not sure I'll be back especially because the way it smelled made me wonder how they wash their dishes and how clean prep areas are. Also my plate had a tiny hair on it I showed the waitress she didn't seem to care."
9/26/2019,20190926,4,4.19,"Thought the coffee was complementary. Dang, it's $3.75 each lol. We were asked if we wanted coffee the moment we were seated, so we thought it's free like in other restos. Lol. Food was great, though! Had ribeye steak and french toast flight. Awesome."
9/27/2019,20190927,5,4.19,"I really enjoyed the food here! The French toast flight is a must (shareable). It's a popular place but still has the neighborhood feel...not ""touristy"". They close at 3pm so don't hesitate like we did lol. We also got to meet the chef and he talked to us about his special dishes."
9/29/2019,20190929,3,4.19,Was highly recommended so I went to try it. Menu is limited you can't substitute on the the French toast trio. Wasn't wowed by the food. Wasn't memorable for me to go back.
10/2/2019,20191002,4,4.19,Excellent place for brunch. Had the chicken fajita omelette that was good. Wait is kind of long but that's expected for Sunday brunch. I didn't know the place was byob so had to get own alcohol but otherwise a cool little place and good food!
10/3/2019,20191003,5,4.19,"Best French toast in the WORLD. My boyfriend and I always go halves on the super flight and an egg dish (usually one of the weekly specials) and we've never had a dish we didn't love! This is the go to for a special weekend breakfast. There is always a wait so wait-list is a must. BYOB, we always bring a bottle of champagne for mimosas. The wait staff is phenomenal, one of the guys even has a thousand riddles on hand to get your mind thinking and the atmosphere fun. Always a great experience."
10/4/2019,20191004,5,4.19,"I loved this breakfast spot. I came here on a Friday around 10. The wait to be seated was over an hour, but it was worth it. I was not exceptionally hungry, so waiting was tolerable. French toast was what I was craving so that is what I ordered. Service was good and the wait time after ordering was reasonable. The french toast was delightful. No syrup needed. The caramel walnut was my favorite! The chicken sausage was also good, but played second place to the toast. The only thing undesirable was the the size of the establishment in comparison to how busy it was. I did see on the website where you can see live wait times and join the waitlist which is a plus. I did see a few other entrees I would like to try, so I will be back."
10/8/2019,20191008,5,4.19,You cannot go here and not get the french toast flight. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the blueberry or Carmel Pecan. It's also BYOB. Remember to use the Yelp Waitlist so that you don't have to wait so long in line. I will be stopping here EVERY time I'm in Chicago.
10/10/2019,20191010,5,4.19,"This is a MUST DO if you go to Chicago. For those that like chicken and waffles, theirs is a very different and tasty twist on this delicacy. The service was GREAT and the food was even better! Will be back next time I am in Chicago!"
10/11/2019,20191011,5,4.19,"6 stars if I could. This place was delicious! We had a party of six and we enjoyed everything. Great service! Our server took her time to share the menu, show us the specials with photos on FB.We appreciated it.*There was a wait but we had a big party. But it was worth it!"
10/12/2019,20191012,2,4.19,"First thing's first: the food here is good. In essence, the logistics of this place are a tragedy precisely because they are so bad it makes the food not worth the hassle, and this is coming from someone who will put up with a lot for good food. For one, the wait is unbelievable. I won't go into detail because it's as simple as that, and you can read other reviews to learn about the wait. The decor is a proverbial patchwork quilt of oddly sourced and assembled wall art and furniture. It feels cheap. The tables wobble. The plates and flatware feel like they've been through a dishwasher seven thousand times. The bathrooms felt unclean. The staging is confused and erratic. The kitchen is exposed and visibly dirty. There are homemade signs haphazardly taped on the wall. There is no semblance of an entrance or waiting area, save for what appeared to be decorative garden benches in the back--odd for a place with a 2+ hour wait. We spent our entire meal discussing how to improve this restaurant. It needs to start with an emphasis on turning tables. I don't know if they were understaffed or simply sheepish about moving customers out once they're finished, but the wait time is of such significance it is undermining the entire business. Indeed it becomes the most memorable aspect of the experience. It's a shame, because the food is delicious, but in a city with so many other good food options the mismanagement is of such a proportion as to threaten the survival of this business.I implore management to consider the following changes:- new decor, furniture and paint colors to refresh the place. New awning. Hire a decorator- new plates and silverware so it doesn't feel cheap, like a school cafeteria- install some galley doors on the kitchen- turn the tables by teaching the servers some tricks of the trade, eg politely asking if customers are done and then dropping a check- give people an honest answer about the wait time. People would gladly wait for the food, provided they can plan around it. - don't change anything about the food besides the presentation."
10/12/2019,20191012,3,4.19,"The wait staff was sublime. Do not order the La Columba brisket hash. Over salted, stringy, dry, burnt ends. It was palatable. I would definitely make a return visit, I just will not order that dish."
10/13/2019,20191013,5,4.19,"Great brunch! This spot gets crowded so expect a wait or get there early especially on the weekends. Despite the crowd our service was outstanding, it was apparent the waiter really knew the menu and was passionate about the food. The French toast flight is very popular, and is a good way to get multiple flavors on one plate. Another must try is the sweet potato chicken and waffles! Though you'd expect this to be super sweet and overwhelming, it's really a dish with deep flavors and just a hint of sweetness. The sweet potato waffle is incredible well spiced, topped with a sweet butter that goes perfectly with the fried chicken and homemade hot sauce. A lot of spots offer chicken and waffles now, but not like this!"
10/14/2019,20191014,4,4.19,"If there's one piece of advice I can give about this place, it's to get on the Yelp waitlist before you come, particularly on the weekend.I came on Saturday morning on the recommendation of several friends who said this was the best brunch place in Lincoln Park. Our wait was about 1.5 hrs on Yelp. When we got there, they told us the wait would be half an hour more and that they would text us. It was slightly disappointing, but the additional wait only ended up beyond 15 minutes more.We got the French toast super flight and the chicken and (sweet potato) waffles on the recommendation of our waitress. The super flight includes the 4 classic flavors plus one flavor of the week. I absolutely loved this dish. The French toast had the perfect texture and sweetness, and the toppings added nice pops of flavor and crunch. The waffles were okay. Chicken was nicely fried but waffles were kinda doughy.Service was amazing. Our waitress was so attentive and helpful, our waters were constantly filled, and the everyone was in a genuinely pleasant mood even though the restaurant was so busy. This is such a cozy and homey place and I'd recommend it to all my friends."
10/14/2019,20191014,5,4.19,Absolutely the best French toast I have ever eaten. The food is freshly made and has a taste that you won't get anywhere else. The wait can be a bit long but it is really worth it.
10/15/2019,20191015,3,4.19,"I had the sweet potato waffle with chicken and a side of hash browns. The waffle was too dry for me. Idk if they make them ahead of time or something but I wasn't a fan. The chicken was very flavorful. The hash browns were ok. Nothing great, tastes like the ones I make at home but mine is better and more seasoned. Bathrooms could be better attended too also."
10/16/2019,20191016,2,4.19,Not worth an hour drive or wait time!! Nor very accommodating to their guests either!! Waste of my $50!!
10/16/2019,20191016,3,4.19,"It one of those places where you should really only experience it once. Because if you keep going back, you will notice all the flaws, and there a decent amount of them to make you not want to return, including the long ass wait time. If you get a chance to try it once, you may be pleasantly surprised by how different and good the food is (mind you i have only had the sausage and the chicken and waffles- but i've had it like 4 times. i've tasted other items, but they were from other people's plates, not my own). Nonetheless, the food is not worth the wait, nor is it worth the congestion you have to deal with inside the restaurant because it's sooooo small and limited space."
10/19/2019,20191019,2,4.19,"Visiting from out of town and was told that this is a must go foodie spot to try out. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. The wait was nearly two hours for a table, although I was quoted an hour via the yelp waitlist. I patiently waited, however, when I was seated I was not blown away from the actual cuisine. It was very very sweet-- everything was sweet, even the chicken sausage. To top off the experience there was a hair found on the plate! The waiter was nice, but with all else that took place it's safe to say I will not be returning to this restaurant again.... and I was sooo looking forward to visiting here. Such is life."
10/20/2019,20191020,5,4.19,The blueberry French toast was the best I've ever had! Everything on the menu sounded delicious and I can't wait the go back and try some of their other food.
10/22/2019,20191022,4,4.19,"Something's gotta be done about this wait! Yelp let me get added to the waitlist in transit, but I still had to wait nearly 45 minutes. Guess the estimates might be off a little? But it's really good and worth waiting for. Service is great and friendly. It's a little cold from the draft, and it's a pretty small place, but they make up for it with the food. I got the omelette and shared the french toast flight. Everything is solid. Chicken breast is cooked just right and very flavorful. The french toast is just the right amount of sweetness. Very difficult to pick a favorite, so I thought the flight was a great idea. This is a convenient location, and there is some waiting area in the back, which I wish I knew about earlier on!"
10/23/2019,20191023,2,4.19,"What a blah experience celebrating my cousin's 18th birthday today. We were able to snag a table for two even though it was very busy on a Wednesday morning and were so excited to order. My cousin ordered the traditional (two eggs, bacon, and hash browns) and I ordered the pancakes. 35 mins later we still didn't have our food even though people around us that had gotten there later were already eating. I was ready to leave so I asked for the check and just gave our server my card. When I am going to sign the receipt I noticed we got charged for a drink that wasn't ours. Now I have to monitor my card because I can't tell if he actually voided the charge correctly. So irritating.Won't be going back because the food wasn't worth this hassle. It's good, but it's not so stellar that I'd put up with this again."
10/25/2019,20191025,4,4.19,Food was expensive but very good. It's a supremely popular restaurant with limited space so prepare for possibly an hour+ wait. Food is worth it though.
10/26/2019,20191026,2,4.19,"I've lived around the corner from this place for 3 years and always wanted to try it but wasn't willing to commit to the 60-90m wait time for a table. So, today I placed a take out order thinking I'd finally get my chance to try it. First off, you can only place an order in person in the restaurant. No one answers the phone here. The server who helped me said my order would take about 10m fast forward 45m later it was ready. ONE order of French toast and sausage took 45m. The sausage was tough, burned and cold and the French toast was barely luke warm. I had to microwave both multiple times when I got home. $17 for cold bread and meat isn't worth the 45m wait. As some other reviews have said, food is good, but not worth the hassle."
10/27/2019,20191027,3,4.19,"After anticipating coming here for almost a year, I had really high expectations for Batter & Berries! Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. 4 of us came on a Sunday morning after joining the line via Yelp. We shared the French toast flight and all actually ordered the Cluck n Gravy, which was biscuits with chicken sausage in gravy. This came with 2 eggs and cheesy hash browns. I'm not a huge fan of eggs, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could get mixed veggies instead!The Flight: my favorites, in order, were lemon, blueberry, caramel, and strawberry. I found the last two to be too sweet. The lemon was good, but honestly nothing to rave about. The maple butter is delicious. Cluck n Gravy: as other reviewers have said, this was very... different. The gravy is very sweet and there isn't much, if any, sausage in the dish. The hash browns were good, but had too much cheese (which is saying a lot -- I love cheese!), but it may have just been too much combined with the heavy gravy. For the flight and the Cluck n Gravy, $30, which is pretty steep for breakfast food in my opinion. I'll have to give them another chance when the French toast of the week is something I want to try."
10/29/2019,20191029,4,4.19,"Classic American lunch place. Huge portions, unexpected (for Chicago) seafood platters. Sweet dishes are SWEET. So don't complain about sugar intake!"
10/31/2019,20191031,5,4.19,Favorite breakfast restaurant ever. I love the creativity within the menu and the service is great.
11/1/2019,20191101,3,4.19,"This restaurant is a lot of good ideas shoved in a small area and poorly executed. None of the staff were overly friendly despite being a very busy, homey appearing spot. We waited quite a while before someone approached us at our table- once we did order I didn't receive my beverage until right before the meal came. Be weary- the special board items aren't priced and can carry a heavy punch. $18 for poutine with sweet gravy was not worth it. Unfortunately way to begin a day visiting Chicagoland."
11/2/2019,20191102,5,4.19,"Absolutely delicious food with fast service at a modest price, definitely worth the long wait!Our party of four joined the Yelp waitlist around 10:45am on a Saturday. Yelp estimate was an hour and 15 minutes. We got there at noon and were told that we would receive a text when our table is ready. Since the place was a bit tight, we had to wait outside. We waited an additional 30ish minutes. We were offered menus and water/coffee as soon as we sat down. The girls ordered Cluck & Gravy and the guys ordered the chicken omelette special. We also shared the Super French Toast Flight, which was the regular flight plus the day's French toast special. While everything was amazing (we cleaned our plates), the Cluck & Gravy was absolutely divine - hands down one of the best biscuit & gravy dishes I've had. The buttermilk and herb biscuits were flavorful and fragrant, and the gravy with chunks of meat had the perfect consistency. My taste buds were blown away by the bursting flavors. The dish also came with eggs and cheese-crusted hash browns.I've also been to Wildberry for brunch which is also really good and a long wait, but Batter & Berry is irrefutably the winner."
11/3/2019,20191103,2,4.19,"Disappointed in food and the service. Came here on a Saturday morning before the zoo. The wait was about 20-25 minutes. We were sat down and were brought coffee right away. We ordered a slew of dishes because we wanted to try several things. We ordered the short rib dish, flight of french toast, chicken/ gravy and 2 omelettes. Our waitress was Sheena and she was great at first. We got all but one dish and that last dish took forever to come out. It seemed like the waitress or kitchen forgot about it. We were about to cancel the order after 15 more minutes of waiting when it came out. Don't know what happened and it was not explained to us. I overheard another table had a problem with a dish coming out as well and had that part of the meal as comped. Nothing for us. Only added an extra star because the flight was the only thing that was appetizing."
11/5/2019,20191105,5,4.19,A great place for brunch! The food is picture worthy & so delicious. Be prepared to wait a while for a table since the dining area is very small. The good news is you won't be disappointed when your food arrives!
11/6/2019,20191106,5,4.19,The best food best service and the best eye candy Highly recommend this place Thank you
11/8/2019,20191108,3,4.19,They need a bigger location. Food was good but they take forever to seat you and rush you to finish eating. The dine in experience is awful
11/9/2019,20191109,1,4.18,"We reserved a table for 10 and they told us a 1 hr and 45 min, after 45 min we asked again and they said 2 hours! Apparently parties smaller than 5 can check in on yelp-- not sure why larger parties should be penalized :/"
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.18,The most delicious and artistically creative breakfast dishes in Chicago. A real treat.
11/10/2019,20191110,5,4.19,"This is the most amazing brunch I've ever had. Not to mention, our server sold us on every dish and knew the menu front to back. If you're thinking about whether or not you should go, the answer is YES!!!"
11/12/2019,20191112,5,4.19,"This place was small, cute and delicious!!! My waitress was very friendly and attentive. I never had less than a half glass of water, they constantly refilled it! I tried the ""Flight of the French Toast"", cheesy hash browns and fried eggs. Everything was super yummy. They have weekly specials! A wide variety on their menu! I highly recommend!"
11/13/2019,20191113,5,4.19,I have been oogling Batter and Berries for a while on Instagram and took the opportunity yesterday to brunch there with a friend. It was almost noon on a Tuesday. We were greeted warmly and seated right away. Tusiime went over the menu with us and made sure we saw all the vegetarian options. He was awesome and kept us on our toes with riddles. We got the French Toast Flight and the Bella Hash to share. Per Tusiime's recommendation we switched out the sweet potato hash and changed it to the cheesy regular hash. Food was delicious! Service was great! Tusiime was fun and attentive! Definitely recommend!
11/16/2019,20191116,4,4.19,"I haven't heard about this place until my friend mentioned about it since she lives in the neighborhood. This place is hoppin'! The waitlist on yelp helped a lot. I suggest doing that way ahead of time since there is a long wait time. There's also a waiting seating area in the back not in the front. There's some benches that you can sit on. We sat at the community table and our waitress was very nice...but she did forget about my friend's coffee (it wasn't on our check either). We totally forgot about it because we were so into the food! We ordered the super French toast flight with the special of the day. This place is known as the ""home of the world famous French toast flight"" according to their website. I have to say their French toast is legit. You will need to ask for their 100% maple syrup if you want it on the side. Their French toast is made with locally baked brioche and it comes with maple butter. Enter drool here. We also had another special dish which was the omelette. I forgot what it was called but it had bits of lobster. This is the last weekend they will have it tho...the cheesy hash brown that came with it was really tasty and it reminded me of the loaded hashbrown casserole from cracker and barrel but with higher quality ingredients. They hand shred their hashbrown here! The food is delicious here and whatever you order here, you won't be disappointed. It is more on the higher range of pricing but you're paying for the fresh ingredients that they prepare and put together for each dish."
11/16/2019,20191116,3,4.19,Seems like a much loved spot by many but I thought the food was mediocre. Atmosphere was pretty crowded and loud with nothing that stood out to me. Wait can be long so put in your name in advance. Seemed like chaos in the seating side but the serving staff were phenomenal.
11/19/2019,20191119,3,4.18,The food is relatively good here but it's a little bit pricey. I came here over the weekend and the service was painfully slow. It is BYOB so we brought our own champagne for mimosas. The server told me that we had to use their orange juice. No problem. I get the bill and they charged me about $7 for a liter. I get it they want to make their money but that left a bad taste in my mouth.
11/19/2019,20191119,5,4.18,"AMAZING BREAKFAST! Easily the best I've ever has in the city. The French toast is incredible. I had the strawberry and it was topped with strawberries, strawberry sauce, and the most amazing sweet butter. The entire menu is great...their ideas and ingredients are top notch. It can get busy so make sure to get there as early as possible! (They also have a great lunch menu)"

Beef short ribs with coffee and chocolate sauce was decadent. Worth trying once, especially if you're in the neighborhood."

11/27/2019,20191127,4,4.19,"Stopped in for breakfast with a friend of mine on a Monday morning. She loves the spot and was excited to come by on a day when the wait isn't a few hours long (which apparently can be on a weekend). And yet, on Monday, we still had a bit of a wait. But it wasn't terrible, so don't be afraid to come by on a weekday. Also, other reviews are saying they may be on Yelp Waitlist now which is awesome! The space isn't huge but it's colorful and comfortable. The menu is varied and everything sounded delicious. I had a really hard time deciding on what to get. Ultimately I landed on the banana walnut belgique and it was delicious! Got a side of the sausage and it had a bit of a kick. A nice contrast to the sweetness of the waffle. Service was wonderful and speedy. Prices were great and I look forward to coming back on my next visit to continue working through their awesome menu!"
11/27/2019,20191127,4,4.19,"I am so sad to give this place 4 stars as they truly deserve 5 stars but a 2 HOUR WAIT!!! Not to mention, lack of seating for the long wait time. However, let me be another customer to acknowledge it is well worth the wait times 5. To escape the cold we walked down the block to a coffee shop on the corner and a cool toy shop down the street. What really upset me was that after our names were placed on the waiting list, we could have joined the live one on Yelp to cut down the time. Oh well, next time. Just a quick note for everyone. After finally, being seated we were told the daily specials displayed on the chalk board on the wall. The waiter went into detail about every single one which was great. I selected an option from the specials which was a salmon Benedict. However, I couldn't pass up trying the French toast since they are the signature items the restaurant is known for. I added a kids size of the lemon flavor. Wow! Both of those items did not disappoint. The salmon was extremely juicy and the egg was just right. I thought the side of cheddar cheese hash browns would be too much but they complimented the salmon just right. Now, for my favorite, the French toast. The lemon French toast were absolutely the best French toast I have ever had. It was like eating a lemon meringue pie only better. They were warm, moist, and deliciously lemony. To make even better it was served with a sweet cream butter. I'm not in Chicago often so this was by far the best treat of the entire trip."

I'd go back (so long as I added myself to the wait list and planned to go early)Tips: - use yelp's wait list to save yourself a lot of time! - After you arrive, consider ordering the French toast flight.- I think it's BYOB so you can get some brunch mimosas going if you want"
11/30/2019,20191130,1,4.19,"I want to start this review off by saying the food and the service is always great and amazing. The reason why I'm even writing a review/giving one start is because of the manager. She slacks management skills.My ladies and i love coming to Batter & Berries because of the amazing service we get and also the delicious food. From the time we got seated, she made everyone at that table feel very uncomfortable. When we got seated at our table she proceeded to take a seat right across from our table and just stare at us with a disgusting look. I did not understand her reasoning on why she felt to do that but we come try our best to come to Batter & Berries every month. Then one of the ladies at our table asked a question that our amazing server had to get a manager for which was fine. When she approached the table she didn't introduce herself she didn't ask how everything was going. From the moment she came to the table I knew she lacked management skills. Her tone was extremely rude to what the lady at the table was asking then she didn't even pay attention to what she was saying. She said one thing and the manager said something else in a impolite tone. At that point I was just irritated about the whole situation because of how rude she was and how she lacks proper management skills. It was the fact our server was beyond amazing he definitely deserves a promotion because he was phenomenal and the food was made it better. The manager I am referring to is the with the short jet black bob. Then she sat across the table from us and was making nasty remarks she didn't think i would hear it but i did. I do not know how she is even a manager!"
12/3/2019,20191203,5,4.19,I've been coming here for years. I absolutely love this place and am glad to support a Black owned business.

12/8/2019,20191208,4,4.19,Their French Toast flight is well worth the wait! It's awesome and a must order. I got a side of their cheesy hash browns that weren't cooked all the way so the potatoes were still hard. But I took them home and cooked them a little more and they were great the next day!

Definitely will be going back! This is an amazing place to come if you are looking for southern comfort food with a twist."
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.19,The food was amazing. The service was great. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. The parking was ok. They only have street parking. I will definitely be back soon.
12/15/2019,20191215,5,4.19,It is exactly what you want what it looks like is how it tastes .. I gained about 5lb with just the smells shortly after I died from a diabetic coma came back to life and did it again.... in other words AMAZING
12/18/2019,20191218,3,4.19,"Black-owned restaurant! We waited 40-50 min...I ordered their chicken and waffles that was not prepared with care, it arrived with my hot sauce on it rather than a side. The batter of the chicken was not complimentary. I think there was a bit of too much experimentation. I tried my friends omelet which was delicious. Would love to come back and try other items"
12/22/2019,20191222,5,4.19,"The best stop for breakfast in the city. Great service(Jackson!), and the food..... wow! ...a must for everyone!!"
12/22/2019,20191222,4,4.19,It was really fun the service was great. The French toast is great but I think the cheesy hashbrowns are potatoes added to cheese instead of vice versa and sweet potato waffles are so heavy they need to be lightened up. The crabcakes were fantastic
12/23/2019,20191223,5,4.19,"Came on a Monday around 9am to avoid the long waits I read about. We were seated right away. Really cute place. Love the yellow walls and art.Our server was Timothy. He was so good that I checked for his name on the bill just so that I could give him a shoutout or this review. What an awesome dude. Incredibly bubbly and helpful. I wish every server was as good at his job as Timothy. I wish all people on earth had his bright attitude.They had a few specials. But he did something I'd never seen at a restaurant that I loved. He brought out an iPad and showed us a picture of what every meal looked like. I was blown away. Especially for a yelper that likes to do research and know what you're getting yourself into, it was amazing. Genius. I was blown away. The French toast flight was awesome. I'd get it again. The maple butter was to die for. I got the special flight that had the daily special egg nog French toast and loved all 5 equally.The spinach omelette was amazing. The pesto made it taste so different. I don't like eggs, but my wife gave me a bite and I thought it was great. Not just on the scale of I hate eggs and this tolerable. I legit thought it was great. Timothy brought some absolutely amazing hot sauce for the potatoes too. What a great experience.Also I guess it's BYOB. That's dope"
12/23/2019,20191223,5,4.19,"Many times you hear about different places and unfortunately they don't live up to your expectations! I'm happy to say that is NOT the case with this place! OMG, they did not disappoint. Our server recommendations were on point-the special smothered chicken omelet and the variety French toast dishes were perfect for my hubby and I to share. The omelette was seasoned to perfection and I found my favorite French toast to be the caramel. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience especially since I was seated right away!"
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.19,"This is my absolute favorite brunch spot in Chicago!If you're in Chicago, make time for this place & you won't regret it!Food: I always get the Strawberry French Toast and it's AMAZING. Definitely a 5 star dish. Today I tried the Maple Lamb Chops in addition to the SFT and they were a 3.5/5. Not bad, but the SFT is so great that I'm probably being slightly bias.Service: Tusiime is the waiter to get! He tells riddles to all his tables and his energy is electric! He will give you the full run down of the specials for that day and help you make the best decision.Wait Time: GO EARLY & get on Yelp Waitlist! This is an extremely popular place, so I advise going early in the day if possible. I've never gone later in the afternoon, but that could be a good time to go as well. Parking: Street Parking via Park Chicago"
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.19,The food was AAAAAHMAZING!!! The atmosphere is wonderful and the waiter was very helpful!! This is a must try when you are in the Chicago area!!! I had the smothered chicken omelette with eggnog flavored French toast!!!
12/27/2019,20191227,5,4.19,Why am I just now finding out about this place. Food was perfect the staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Great for groups. Don't forget the champagne for the BYOB mimosa
12/28/2019,20191228,5,4.19,"Best French toast I've ever had! Our server was so friendly and professional. My husband very much enjoyed their poutine special. There's always a wait, recommend either going early or putting in for the waitlist via Yelp while you're en route. We will definitely be back!"
12/29/2019,20191229,5,4.19,"Well Worth The Wait! The customer service is awesome and the food is amazing. One of the things that stood out to me the most is the hostess answered the phone right away when I called to check on my wait time. As busy as the restaurant was, she answered the phone and was polite and professional giving me the exact time I had been waiting and how many minutes I had left. Anytime I'm in Chicago for breakfast I will be back at this spot. The food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was amazing. I'd recommend the strawberry French toast!"
12/30/2019,20191230,4,4.19,"I came here with two other friends on a Sunday morning for brunch. I was so glad that we put ourselves down for the Yelp waitlist because the wait was around 2 hours by the time we actually arrived. The restaurant itself is very small and it is a tight squeeze in between tables.Hubby and I split the super french toast flight which came with strawberry, lemon, blueberry, caramel, and champagne (their daily special) french toast. They were all good but my favorites were probably the caramel and champagne. I had the brisket hash and hubby had the chicken with sweet potato waffle. The brisket hash was great and I especially loved the cheesy hash. Hubby enjoyed his too but I personally think that the sweet potato waffle was too dense and dry."
12/30/2019,20191230,4,4.19,BYOB. Great food and service. It's smart to get on the waitlist before getting to the restaurant. The line is usually long! The food was good. It was well seasoned and not too salty. They have several options for everyone's taste and preference.
12/31/2019,20191231,5,4.19,It's just hands down the best gourmet breakfast restaurant in the world!!! Nothing should be compared to Batter & Berries....
1/2/2020,20200102,4,4.19,I had to come back and update this review. As long as you don't come on a weekend you should be fine.
1/2/2020,20200102,5,4.19,this place has a SUPER long wait time so i'd recommend getting on the yelp wait list. the menu has a ton of great options and it's probably my fav brunch place in chicago! we got the french toast variety platter which was incredible & the portabella hash which was very unique as well. i do have to say my favorite part about this place was their service. our waiter was so so funny and kind making our experience a lot better. will definitely come back and would recommend to all in the area.
1/2/2020,20200102,4,4.19,The French toast was amazing. The omelet was flavorful. Check out it when in Chicago.
1/4/2020,20200104,5,4.19,"Batter&Berries is a slice of heaven. The quaint restaurant is located just moments from Downtown Chicago on Lincoln Park. I signed up for the waitlist prior to arriving at the restaurant- I would strongly recommend signing up for the wait list because this place draws a crowd. Once I arrived I noticed people waiting outside. I was slightly disappointed but was determined to be patient because all the reviews raved on the food. I'm so glad I waited. The food was heavenly. I started with the French Toast Flight ( A must have).The French Toast Flight had so many amazing flavors - lemon, blueberry, strawberry, pecan and strawberry champagne. All the flavors were so amazing yet not over whelming. Aside from my father's famous french toast, the best french toast ever. I also had the crab cake benny - sooo savory and delicious. I can't wait to visit again. I would strongly recommend dining at Batter & Berries you will be so happy you did. Give yourself plenty of time to wait and bring good company. If you like mimosas- bring your own champagne. Batter and Berries is BYOB."
1/5/2020,20200105,4,4.19,"Long wait but great food the first time we went. Server was very engaging-funny with his arsenal of jokes. Had a little difficulty making reservations for larger party but we got it worked out. Was so good we decided to go again on our way out of town, but the experience wasn't as good. Didn't care for the Crab Benedict or the sweet potato waffles or the mushroom dish (forgot the name...smothered mushroom??)"
1/5/2020,20200105,5,4.19,"I went to Batter and Berries the first time I came to visit Chicago in 2015, and it did not disappoint. It was so delicious that I still remember it to this day, and have a desire to go back. This is a great brunch spot!"
1/5/2020,20200105,4,4.19,The executive steak was great. Very tasty. However the flight of french toast did not love up to its hype unfortunately. Service was great though!
1/6/2020,20200106,4,4.19,"I'm going to give batter and berries four stars but if I could give a separate rating for the service I would. This is my fifth time eating here, two experiences were not very good but the other two were "" meh"" and today was pretty outstanding, I ordered the smothered chicken omelette and it was amazing! All of the food came out very hot and flavorful . My wife ordered the lemon French toast and she absolutely loved it!.She said it actually had a wow factor and she would come back for the French toast.The service leaves a bit to be desired, my complaint almost every time I come here is the Low talking Hispanic waitress with a thick accent. She is typically lackluster, speaks too quickly and is a little bit of a strain to understand her and she seems to get a little annoyed when I have to ask her to repeat herself. In the end I give it four stars because the service was not bad enough to offset the delicious food. I would go again"
1/7/2020,20200107,5,4.19,"HANDS DOWN BEST BRUNCH PLACE IN CHICAGO! Never fails and food always is phenomenal! Beat things are: Crab cake Benedict Moroccan shrimp omelette All specials of the week Super Flight of French toast - MUST HAVE! Street parking is always available. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
1/9/2020,20200109,5,4.19,Truly enjoyed this place. Definitely crowded and loud but the variety of options and quality of food were well worth it.
1/10/2020,20200110,4,4.19,"Very tasty french toast and combos. I love the sauce on the blueberry french toast. I went solo, but there was a line outside. Luckily I got in rather quick because they have a large center communal style table. So I filled in an empty seat there. I have to admit I was a little close for comfort to someone I didn't know and felt like I had to stay in place so my stuff wasn't in their space. The hashbrowns looked really yummy. But I am a hashbrown queen and I have to say these were not good. I think there was cheese in them, which normally makes most things better, but the flavor was just off. I would still say it's a great place for a decently priced breakfast in the area and to stop by if you're near."
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.19,"Hands down the best breakfast place everrrrrrrr. I highly recommend trying their chicken and waffles, it's to die for. Also, the service is great and fast!"

1/12/2020,20200112,3,4.19,I honestly was hesitant to even put 3 stars because this place is average at best. The chicken was extremely dry and the food just wasn't all that great. Not sure what the hype is about but I wouldn't recommend and probably will never go there again.
1/12/2020,20200112,5,4.19,The rotating menu is amazing! There's always new flavor combinations that are hard to pass up - which they know! The French Toast flight let's you try everything and it's just the right size to share if there's something else calling your name!
1/14/2020,20200114,5,4.19,One of my favorite brunch spotsNo reservations but it moved quickly. If you like brunch(and who doesn't) you will love this little hole in the wall!

1/18/2020,20200118,4,4.19,"This has been on my list to visit when I come to Chicago. This is a well renown breakfast spot. It is black owned! If this little tidbit of information upsets you, please read your American history on why this would be important to highlight. Moving on, this place is KNOWN for their French Toast. They have all variations of French Toast. We had a party of 7 and favorite was The caramel French Toast. Also the Lemon French Toast was noted to be good as well. They also had other tasty daily specials. The shrimp Alfredo omelette was a hit! I took a star off because two in my party ordered hot chocolate and it wasn't hot. Also someone in my party had a dirty spoon. Their waiting area is pretty small if you have a large party, I'm noting this in case you visit in the colder months and have to wait outside. Overall, the food was very tasty. Service was great! And I'd definitely come back."
1/18/2020,20200118,3,4.19,This place is honestly overrated. Their food is alright. I came here to have breakfast with my friends and ordered chicken and waffle. The chicken waS dry and the sweet potato stuffed with chicken waffle was not good. The nutmeg gave the meal an after taste that just killed it for me. Im also not a fan of their different flavored French toast. Their eggs are really good and I'm sure everything else on the menu is. I don't recommend the chicken and waffle and try the French toast at your own discretion. You can put your name on the wait list on Yelp before you go or you'll have to wait up to an hour and a half to be seated. The waiters don't really check up on you as often as they should. Prepare to wait 30 minutes for your food. I wanted to return my food for something else but I know they would've been mad. I just plan on not returning at this point. Oh and the lady with the Dora the explorer wig made sure to look at our tab after we signed it to see if we tipped. This was weird and uncomfortable.
1/18/2020,20200118,4,4.19,"This was the best French toast I've ever had period. The French toast flight was superb. The flavors were just the best. The taste will put a smile on your face. I also tried the pork sausage, not bad. The hash browns were decent. The French toast is the star."

1/20/2020,20200120,4,4.19,"The infamous Batter & Berries is a go-to for brunch and quite frankly is a must!! Batter & Berries is a black owned restaurant (which is always a plus in my book) that's small and quaint with an overly friendly staff. I will say due to the small cute space this place is ALWAYS booked and busy usually an hour or plus to get seated so I would recommend putting your name on the waitlist in advance, or planning to wait.One of my favorite parts of B&B is their rotating menu with decadent and flavorful specials which the staff explains with pictures right at the table using an iPad. On this particular day I ordered off the standard menu. I ordered the Chicken Fajitas Omelette and a Short Stack or pancakes. Please believe me when I say, the chef staff at Batters and Berries is NEXT LEVEL! This is NOT your average/ordinary breakfast place. All ingredients used were fresh you can tell they were prepared upon ordering the blend of spices and fresh ingredients had long lasting flavor. The omelette was very savory and the pancakes were the perfect amount of sweet. The pancakes had a small hint of lemon which made them almost refreshing and the stack was topped with B&Bs famous maple butter. This maple butter replaces syrup the way it melts into the cakes, no need for syrup the butter is enough! Although crowded and the wait being over an hour, Batter and Berries is well worth it. You won't be disappointed with the staff of anything you choose off the standard or rotating menu!"
1/20/2020,20200120,5,4.19,"We came here a first time from St. Louis and the wait was over an hour and was disappointed we couldn't try it since we only come to Chicago once a year. We tried a second time and got on the waitlist and didn't have to wait long at all. Everything on the menu sounded so good! We were torn between trying something savory and sweet. We ended up ordering savory dishes and was sad we had to sit out on the french toast which seems to be their signature dish. However, this man that looked like a manager/owner brought us over each a piece of their french toast on their special menu and told us we can't come there and not try it. We left there with happy hearts and bellies!"

1/22/2020,20200122,3,4.19,"Just above than average American breakfast diner but more expensive.No wait to get in but took about 25-30mins to get our food after ordering.I had the traditional breakfast - bacon, eggs, hash browns. Bacon was crispy and eggs were cooked correctly. Hashbrowns were supposed to be cheesy but really lacked in flavor.My husband ordered the apple, cinnamon & spice waffles, which I thought were a bit tough.We shared a shortie of strawberry French toast. FT was delicious on its own, didn't require any syrup.Service was a bit slow. Took 15 mins or so to get a pour of coffee. Despite lots of waitresses/waiters it seemed to take a while to get folks attention for refills/condiments/a full Salt & Pepper."
1/23/2020,20200123,5,4.19,"Make sure you are on the waitlist before arriving! As a party of two we got on the list 20 minutes before arriving , and still waited a addItional 10. Their waiting area is not too spacious since the restaurant itself is pretty small, but it was definitely worth it! We shared two of the specials of the day which were the peach French toast and the crab cakes. 10/10! The French toast tasted the same as they do anywhere , but what set them apart are the toppings! The crab cakes were cooked just right! Breaking The egg yolk on them makes it even better!"
1/23/2020,20200123,5,4.19,What a neat little hole in the wall! The French Toast Flight and the Chicken Sausage Omelet were extremely good. The service was quick. We had no wait for our table. A very diverse group eating here.
1/23/2020,20200123,4,4.19,Finally got a chance to visit. Wait was about 30 minutes but I was not surprised. This place is packed! The food was delicious and the owners and staff were so nice! My only complaint is that it is extremely loud in here. I could not hear my friends I was with and we ended up just eating as fast as we could so we can catch up at a quieter location. Food is amazing but not the best place to socialize.
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.19,"So when I tell y'all Beyoncé the Goddess herself has blessed a Chicago brunch spot, y'all should recognize that that place is #aboutitSeriously I haven't had a better brunch then this one in a while! After setting up for the wait list we were told to check in about a hour later. We arrive and told our table is almost ready, so we walk around to the nearby anime store and peruse. About 5 minutes later we get a alert that our table is ready and here we go!So first thing i notice is that it's loud. Like LOUD LOUD. There were times I couldn't even hear the waitress. Her attitude was kinda bleh the whole time and I could tell she had already had a tiring day. She told us the specials and I lit up at her exposing the smothered chicken omelette. Wow. Omelette with cheese and onions with chicken pieces on top and covered with that deeeelishhhhh smothered gravy. When it came out, I was in love. Everything was perfectly seasoned! The chicken was juicy and moist and nicely saturated with the gravy. The omelette was nicely made with the rich gravy as a accompaniment. Even the cheddar hash-browns were yummy. Wow. Literally this place Is worth the wait. It's not often you taste food and know that the made that food with care, but you literally felt the warmth. I would def come again. I orddered takeout once, although it's a hassle going in to order and waiting 20 minutess but it's worth it when you're home watching RHOA and eating hash browns. YAsss though. I think when Beyonce was like get in formation, she was talking about formation in a line at the door of this restaurant. Thanks Batter and Berries?"
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.19,What a place! Food is really good and if Tusimi is your waiter you are in for a treat. Will be back ASAP.
1/25/2020,20200125,5,4.19,"Amazing breakfast spot! Try the super French toast flight. It's 5 slices of delicious drench toast that taste best with no syrup. Sounds strange until you try it! Wait staff is friendly, fast, and always on top of things. Highly recommended!"
1/30/2020,20200130,1,4.19,"This place always looks so busy, I thought it had to be good. It was a total let down. The place seems less than clean. The waitress unhelpful and inattentive. The staff had an attitude of not giving a damn. The food very very sugary and not great. Food delivered cold. I will never go back."
1/31/2020,20200131,5,4.19,Best pancakes I've had in a long time! Went there on Sunday and they of course had pretty good bottomless mimosas. I would highly recommend! Keep in mind however that I don't think the place would accommodate large group without an initial notice. Let them know ahead of time if you plan on bringing a party of more than 4.
2/1/2020,20200201,2,4.19,"I had high hopes for this place. We stopped in on an early Saturday morning around 8:30 (best time to avoid a wait). As soon as I walked through the door the smell of dirty, sour mop hit me . On top of that, we were sat right in front of the restroom which is less than ideal. Our waitress was attentive and took our order pretty quickly. I had the traditional breakfast- the only thing that stood out were the cheesy hash browns, they were delicious! The French toast flight was tasty as well, but I feel it wasn't worth the hype.Maybe we came on an off-day but not sure if we will give Batter & Berries another shot."
2/2/2020,20200202,5,4.19,Well worth the wait! The french toast flight (a sample of 4 different french toasts) is a creative and delicious choice! Anticipate waiting at least an hour on the weekend.
2/3/2020,20200203,4,4.19,"Get the French Toast: whether it's on the flight or a special version that they are seasonally offering, just get it. It's da real deal. Batter & Berries always seems to have a significant line waiting outside, but it all makes sense once you get a taste of their French Toast. I would also say that the portion sizes are very fulfilling, but it can be a bit overwhelming sweet if you don't have something to balance it out. The interior is funky and fun; it's a bit hectic inside as it's always so busy, but our service was still very friendly and attentive. Price is fair for a Chicago brunch.I would highly recommend Batter & Berries. It's become a go-to spot for my girlfriend and I when we want to go somewhere we know will be great."
2/3/2020,20200203,5,4.19,"This is one of the low-key gems of Chicago dining. There is a reason why the Sunday wait regularly tips over an hour, even for solo-dining. You'd better put your reservation in on Yelp right now, if you plan on going. In addition to typical diner stand-bys, they offer spectacular, unique options for their French toast, omelette, and potato hash options. Their version of chicken and waffles (Cluck and Gaufre) gets everything in from maple butter and nutmeg to a house-made hot sauce. They rotate the specials regularly, so there's something new just about every time you go in.Supporting a black-owned business is a very nice plus, as well. :)"
2/6/2020,20200206,3,4.19,"I was entirely too excited to eat brunch here... But my first experience wasn't quite the best. Ok I get it... Everyone loves this place and it was, therefore PACKED. I got us on waiting list ... And waited almost 2 hrs to be seated, almost closing time. That 'waiting area' is God awful. It simply isn't feasible. Just unpractical especially with folks walking around and servers trying to do their job. Not the best idea. Our waiter was amazing, the service was on point....Food...Not so much. Strawberry french toast... Delicious then I also ordered ... I believe the crab cakes Benny ... With cheesy hashbrown and a fried hard egg. It was good except the cheesy hashbrown ... Was undercooked and definitely was not cheesy. I would definitely try it again to see if it was just a bad day to visit ...I do believe has great potential though that I simply wasn't able to experience *shrugs*"
2/7/2020,20200207,3,4.19,"Food was really good but part of that may be because my friends and I had to wait almost 3 hours for breakfast so we were starving. Service was okay, wait time was what really made it frustrating."
2/8/2020,20200208,5,4.19,"First, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. Secondly the food is amazing. I do recommended getting there early as they do get quite busy, rightly so. Did not wait long for my meal. Definitely will be visiting again. Well worth the money."
2/8/2020,20200208,4,4.19,"The place was packed ,glad i got on waititng list. But the smellls, ambience are everything. It didkt take long for the waitlist. We waited like five minutes. The food is absolutely amazinDont forget that this place is BYOB. Yes bring your own drinks.i got Jambalaya omlete, omg!!!!!! If you havent been ypu need too!!!!"
2/9/2020,20200209,4,4.19,"A few of my friends are from Chicago and I always see them enjoying brunch at this place, so I had to give it a try while I was in the area. I'm pretty impatient and we were seated within 5 minutes upon arrival, so that started the visit off on a great not for me. My date and I ordered the Super French Toast Flight and the Crab Cake Benedict w/ sweet potato Hash. Although all of the French toast were good, My favorite French toasts were the Lemon & Caramel options. They're sweet enough that you will not need to drizzle any syrup on them. The crabcakes has crawfish in them & they are flavorful. Not too crazy about the sweet potato & sage hash but it was the more healthy option so that's why i asked for that over the regular hash!The waitress was great and very attentive. I will definitely vIsit again when I'm in the area."
2/9/2020,20200209,5,4.19,This place is beyond the five star rating. The food is exquisite and the service is amazing. Please go and try to see their waiter Toseeme ( To-see-me). Not to take anything from the staff but this guy is awesome and he loves his job and it shows. Everybody there made me and my family feel like we were at a relatives house eating a meal prepared with love.
2/9/2020,20200209,1,4.19,"This place is the worst. The patrons and the service is subpar. Price doesn't match the quality. I can't believe people wait in line for this, although, sadly I was one of those people. So many other great places to go other than this place."
2/13/2020,20200213,5,4.19,First time and I must say if I ever come back to Chicago I will come here again! I had the jambalaya omelet and the other person had the crab cake Benedict...... it all was very good.
2/13/2020,20200213,5,4.19,One is the best brunches in Chicago. Well worth the long wait times. The eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy are two of my favorites on the menu but it's all really good!
2/15/2020,20200215,5,4.19,"Amazing!! Leslie was a wonderful waitress and the food was delicious, exactly what we ordered, and came out quickly. Cant say enough good things!"
2/17/2020,20200217,5,4.19,"Fye! Yummy food and great drinks. Ideal for brunch! Service was good, overall good experience. No complaints!"
2/17/2020,20200217,1,4.19,Was really excited to eat at this place but it was terribly packed. So my husband and I was placed on a waiting list waiting for 30 minutes no biggie. Our 30 mins was up we went back inside and was told we had to wait another 45 minutes after being assured a table would be ready for us after our first 30 mins. Very disappointed so I will not be coming back.
2/18/2020,20200218,5,4.19,The best French Toast I had in my life! And that pork chop was juicy. I went there two days in the row that's how good this place is. It was worth the wait. Small restaurant but great breakfast. Service was great.
2/19/2020,20200219,4,4.19,"The food was absolutely great! However, The place is super small and the wait was over an hour. While it was 1 degrees outside we waited inside like everyone else, but that was obviously an inconvenience to the waiters as we were asked multiple times to move from the two spots where we were waiting. Mind you again it was SUPER small and there was no where else to wait except for hovering over customers as they ate. If you go while it's not busy that'll be your best bet."
2/20/2020,20200220,5,4.19,"Amazing brunch spot that does get crowded.Batter & Berries is a brunch spot located in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago. If you can stand the wait, the food is above excellent.Booked a spot here via Yelp but even after arriving on time, we were still 12th in line. Though I can't downgrade a restaurant for being so popular, I wasn't too happy about still needing to wait so long after arriving on time.While here, I ordered the French toast flight & the eggs benedict crabcakes. The French toast flight was a diverse mix of flavors that went from the boldest & rich to the most subtle and sweet. Was a bit disappointed that the eggs benedict didn't have as much sauce as the pictures the waiters showed me, but the flavors were still top-notch.The waiters did their best to tend to my table even though the crowds were constant. I sat at the large communal table in the middle of the restaurant and was able to make a few new friends.5/5. I will be back. Maybe would come earlier to avoid the crowds."
2/20/2020,20200220,5,4.19,"My fiancé and I went for the second time today and although it was much busier, they did not disappoint. We decided to try the specials. I ordered the Crab and Crawfish Benny and he ordered the Jambalaya omelette. Everything was amazing including the service. I believe our waiter's name was Comsemi (probably not spelled that way) and he was nothing short of fantastic. I will definitely be returning."
2/21/2020,20200221,5,4.19,The food is excellent but one waiter is amazing I'll go back just for him and his riddles.
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.19,"I visited Chicago for Allstar Weekend one week ago and was told this was a must go so I went. The food was great and the service was on Pointtttt!!! Me and my friends tried a plethora of things including the French toast, crab and crawfish Benedict, jambalaya omelette, steak omelette etc. Everything was good! I recommend adding yourself to the waiting list rather than showing up to avoid a long wait. Also, this is a byob spot so you can bring alcohol with you as long as you're of age of course."
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.19,"Got the super flight, pork sausage omelette with cheesy hash browns, and the cluck-n-gaufre. Everything tasted amazing! Loved their hot sauce that came with the cluck-n-gaufre. The chicken sausage gravy that's on the omelette was delicious. Each french toast flavor was very good as well."
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.19,"Where do I begin. This is arguably my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I absolutely have to eat here every time I'm in town. They are known for the French toast flight, it is definitely a must try. I've had it several times and not once has it disappointed me.Not to mention the dozens of other tasty options on the menu. The food is very flavorful and authentic. That's why people from all over the world come in town just to eat here."
2/22/2020,20200222,5,4.19,"Be sure to save your place in line, they are always busy and for good reason! All the food was absolutely amazing, except for maybe a bit too much mushroom in the ribeye omelet. The hash browns were a game changer!!! So amazingly delicious with cheese and make sure to add their home-made hot sauce we will definitely be back!"
2/23/2020,20200223,5,4.19,"One word: Excellent. Knowing how crowded they can be on the weekends and how long the wait can be, I used the waitlist on Yelp and was impressed that we were notified just a few minutes ahead of our desired seating time. My friend and I were then told to be seated in the waiting area in the middle, where we waited about 10 more minutes or so. The owner greeted us at our table and thanked us for coming in! How nice.There's a lot to choose from and it's not easy. We chose the popular french toast flight and the blackened salmon special which came with your choice of eggs and their also popular cheesy hash brown potatoes. Everything was wonderful! They rotate the daily specials on the board and had so many good sounding choices! Street parking was easy and service was good. Can't wait to come back and try more dishes."
2/23/2020,20200223,5,4.19,Always a great experience!!! Typically a 30+ minute wait but IT IS WORTH IT!!! I love their hospitality and it always feel like home when I'm here.
2/23/2020,20200223,1,4.19,"I've read so many reviews about Batter & Berries so I've been meaning to stop by and give it a try, next time I'll go elsewhere. I decided it would be best to make my visit during a non-rush hour in order to be able to sit comfortably, not wait in line, and enjoy my food. I visited the restaurant on a Wednesday at about 10:30 am. It was a cold a windy day and the host seats my right by the door. I thought maybe it's their policy to sit single guests at the large communal table right by the door but since this was an off time I don't know why they wouldn't think to make their guests more comfortable. I got an email as soon as I walked in so I looked at the time and it took 12 minutes for a server to come over. Again, this was not peak time and when I looked at the counter I saw 3 servers standing around and one on their phone. I asked the host who my server was and he responds, ""She's Coming!!"" - in a tone of voice as if I had been asking the same question every 5 minutes for the past hour. To make matters worse when I placed my order and asked for iced tea I was told they ran out. The food was just OK but the main reason I will never visit again is the attitude."
2/24/2020,20200224,5,4.19,Everything about this place is incredible! Most delicious breakfast food in the city!
2/25/2020,20200225,4,4.19,The food was great! Everything was delicious and I would definitely recommend this spot to people looking for a great brunch spot. The only downsides are that it's always packed to the brim and you might get seated with people you don't know which can be a little weird. There's usually always a wait to get in but it's not that bad typically.
2/28/2020,20200228,5,4.19,"Batter & Berries gets a 5-star review, not only for the homemade food, but also for the top notch service. I grabbed brunch with a friend, and our waiter was extreme knowledgeable on the menu items and was enthusiastic, as well as personable. He suggested I try the special Jambalaya omelet- it did not disappoint. This omelet had andouille sausage, shrimp, peppers, and gouda smotheres in an amazing jambalaya sauce. It came with cheese potatoes on the side. Yum!!!Even on a Friday morning this place was bustling, so get there early! Although we had to wait for a table, Batter & Berries offers a text notification system when your table is ready, so I took a stroll around Lincoln Park until the table was available. Overall, this place is the real deal when it comes to breakfast and hospitality. Can't wait to try the world-famous French toast next time I am in!"
2/28/2020,20200228,5,4.19,"We had great service at Batters and Berries. We has a table for 12 and add ourselves to the waitlist on their website so they knew we were coming. When we arrived we checked in and only waited for about 10 min for our table. In the notes, online, I let them know that we needed 2 high chairs and 2 boosters. They accomodated us with no problems. We were greeted and waited on right away. The waiter played trivia with us and took our order. After ordering, our food came out almost right away. The food was amazing, full of flavor, and the right texture. My family had a great time. I will be visiting here again."
2/28/2020,20200228,5,4.19,Excellent service and atmosphere! I will go again tomorrow for breakfast or at lest one more time during my vacation really excellent options!
3/2/2020,20200302,5,4.19,"Really good food, well worth the long wait. The staff is very friendly and well informed. If there was one thing I would change it would be the size of the location."
3/6/2020,20200306,1,4.19,"Long wait time, front of house staff has huge bias and will treat you differently based on certain criteria. If you strictly stick to the breakfast food , it's great, chicken is dry and just not good. Managed poorly. Check was wrong twice. Get this place out of Lincoln park.....or manage it better."
3/8/2020,20200308,5,4.19,"Great weather deserves great brunch. Brother heard about Batter and Berries from a friend and decided to try the place out!This casual brunch place is a good place to bring friends. Our server Tusiime was hilarious and entertaining. If you're lucky enough to go in a day when he is serving, you're in for a treat! I recommend getting the French Toast Flight. Its good for individuals but I see it more as a shareable food item for the group.I ordered the We're Movin on Up Executive with Cheese Crusted Hash Browns. This was delicious! My brother got the pork chop special of the day and he enjoyed it too.Overall, this place is wonderful. Pro tip: make sure you use Yelp's Waitlist feature as this place is always busy.Parking: streetNoise Level: mediumSeating. Multiple tables, can accommodate larger groups but not a lot at the same time."
3/8/2020,20200308,3,4.19,"I was so excited to try this place after reading reviews, the wait time took so long it was ridiculous. This being said the manager was extremely kind to us and thanked us for our patiences. I had the spinach omelet and it tasted absolutely amazing ... unfortunately later that day my stomach was hurting so bad and I threw up the meal and had horrible diarrhea. I can only asume was from the meal, it was the only thing I had that day. I would say avoid the egg based meals, and make sure you have plenty of time to wait for a table even when you had a reservation!!!"
3/8/2020,20200308,1,4.19,"Never worry about me coming back!! I came at 10:30a anticipating a wait list. We were told it would be about a 45min wait...we were seated at 1pm!!! First they make you wait outside for a couple hours and then they tell you come in to be seated...only to crowd you in the back to a second waiting area for another half hour!! Once we finally were seated, 3/4 of way through our meal a barrage of ppl including the host, bus ppl, and the manager swarmed us ask ""are you done? Are you done yet?"". NO!! I'm eating the food I waited 3hrs for!!! As for the food itself it was ok but not 'I just waited 3hrs' good. You can only do so much with French toast and eggs. Bottomline if you can be seated in 20mins or less it's a good spot. If they tell you anything longer, take yourself off the list and go somewhere else. By the time you get seated for brunch it will already be dinner time!!"
3/9/2020,20200309,5,4.19,"I finally understand why the wait here is always so long. It's totally worth it. I've never been much of a French toast person, but I could eat their French toast everyday. My favorite brunch place in Chicago."
3/10/2020,20200310,2,4.19,"Great service, great host! Food was delicious! I'm giving you 2 stars for the taste.  But when you can not accommodate waffles topped with strawberries which you have both of on the menu, you broke my kid's heart! We expected more from an ""Omega"" establishment. My husband is a bruh and you came highly recommended. It's the small accommodations that will set you apart from the rest."
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.19,This is my second time I think and the employees were nice and understanding.I got the blueberry waffles and my mom got the French toast I recommend it
3/10/2020,20200310,5,4.19,"As always, outstanding, top notch breakfast!! Service is great, food is great, location is great. A must try breakfast spot for everyone."
3/12/2020,20200312,5,4.19,"Great place, had the steak and some caramel French toast... took a bite and the words ""f*** this summer body"" came to my head immediately"
3/13/2020,20200313,1,4.19,"I have been going to batter and berries for a long time at least once a week but I can confidently say that they have lost me as a customer after my experience today. Halfway through our meal our server brought us the check. We were no where near done eating when another staff member came and asked if we needed boxes. We had just gotten refills on coffee and the hostess asked us if we needed to go cups for our coffee..we were still not done eating. Another staff member came up AS WE WERESTILL EATING and started taking plates and told us to have a good day, obviously excusing us. He took our full cups of water and coffee. We had barely just finished our food and another person approached us and told us to leave because people were waiting. We had been in the restaurant for only 45 minutes. I will never be returning to this establishment which is a shame because my group of friends come here very often but we will not be coming back."
3/14/2020,20200314,5,4.19,"I love love love this cute little brunch spot. The service is always great and the staff is very accommodating and personable. Weekends are very busy so get here early if you want a seat otherwise you're looking at a 2hr wait! You can also use the yelp app to hold your spot in line. They have a small menu but it's the best food! You feel like you're actually having a home cooked meal. Lots of great flavors and new dishes to try weekly, as well as the French toast of the month! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My advice: get the super flight and try all the deliciousness of French toast they have to offer!"
3/14/2020,20200314,3,4.19,"Ordered the veggie wrap which was dripping with grease. The sweet potato fries that were included were top notch. My friend had the lemon ricotta french toast and raved about it. Servers were very friendly and prompt. Overall, not my personal favorite with so many other great brunch options."
3/14/2020,20200314,5,4.19,Love this place! The French toast flight and sweet potato waffle never disappoints. Definitely worth the wait.
3/15/2020,20200315,1,4.19,"Checked in via waitlist and it said it was a 2 hour wait. At hour 1.5 when I went to check the waitlist it was not working. Called the restaurant to verify I was still on the list and the host was rude, then hung up on me when I attempted to clarify the waitlist process. He said that in order to be put back on the waitlist I would have to check-in, in person and be re-added at the spot I left off at (45th in line). The yelp waitlist told me I would not have to check-in for another full hour. Needless to say, we picked another spot for brunch."
3/27/2020,20200327,5,4.19,"I always enjoy B&B and on this occasion, My family shared, along with our order, an order of French toast and OMG!!!! NEVER and I do mean, NEVER, have I had French toast without needing syrup, it was built into the butter!!!! Dayum!!!!!!"
3/27/2020,20200327,5,4.19,"I absolutely love this place. It's very small and the wait can be extremely long ( like two hours), but it's worth it! I have ordered almost everything on the menu like I am a food critic, lol. I just believe in supporting places that have good service. After visiting several times, I found out that my coworkers husband is a co-owner, how cool! We attended on a weekday after attending a Professional Development. This place never disappoints. The French Toast Flight is very popular, but you will enjoy whatever you order."
3/30/2020,20200330,3,4.19,Be prepared to wait if you decide to come here! Went on a Friday and waited around an hour to be seated. There's really no waiting area so you probably have to go somewhere and come back. The French toast was really good. But the chicken and waffles weren't really for me. The chicken was good but the waffles were too cinnamon-ey for my taste. Our waitress was super nice though!
4/5/2020,20200405,1,4.19,"I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are so stale that they are crumbling apart. I understand that times are tough but for charging $14 for biscuits and gravy and you know you are giving the customer old and hard biscuits, it's unacceptable. Waste of a meal and waste of money."
4/13/2020,20200413,5,4.19,"I've been here 4+ times, its about time I due this amazing review!Pricing is $$, Street paid parking is available, there is always a wait so make reservation over the phone or thru yelp, come with an empty stomach. Seating is tight together,but its all worth it.With all of the times that I have been here, I have never been disappointed. The food is FABULOUS!! When you first walk in, you are ask for your name and number, that way you can wait in the car if the establishment does not have seating for waiting. Also, you are all greet by the staff who are available to speak at the time. So nice!After your 30 mins to an 1 hr wait (this is given), you are seated and given water. The feel of the place is so cozy, almost crammed but enough to function. The smells coming from the food is so enticing, you would want to order everything off the menu. Everything is purple and gold and colorful like New Orleans, the theme and the food is based off New Orleans cuisine After your order is taken, your food is made fresh and the portions are Huge! so please come with an appetite. You can share your dishes and try the different french toast of the week. The french toast are the main attraction besides the omelets, so GET YOU SOME!My favorite so far has been the New Orleans Omelet and turtle french toast. everything is so flavorful and warm and PRESENTATION is everything. I promise you, if you could lick the plate in public you will."
4/21/2020,20200421,5,4.19,Wouldn't have expected the food to be as good as it was when I had just passed by. Lots of variety and very unique menu. I live in the area and will be stopping in again as soon as we are able.
5/10/2020,20200510,1,4.18,"I loved this place and was really looking forward to having Mother's Day brunch here. We ordered (via Grubhub since after 40 calls back to back we could not get through) at 8:08 a.m. My husband headed down there and waited, and waited. He spoke with the people working there and they couldn't give him any information. At 9:30 a.m. GrubHub said that the order was ready. So he headed in and they still had no answers. Then at 10 a.m., ALMOST 2 HOURS AFTER WE ORDERED, they told my husband they were out of the cluck and gravy, the one item we both ordered. Apparently they had run out right after they opened. So we waited almost 2 hours for something they didn't even have. They did not contact us, and they did not tell him after he repeatedly asked about the order. This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not sure I can recommend this place anymore. It's one thing to run out of food it's another to NOT TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS who have ordered it and let them wait almost 2 hours. Pure garbage - thanks for the great start to my Mother's Day Batter and Berries."
5/17/2020,20200517,5,4.18,"Easily my favorite brunch spot in all of Chicago. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Chicago native, and after looking them up I was so impressed that I had to make a day trip to Chicago from STL just to check it out. The thing that caught my eye initially was the bring your own champagne for bottomless mimosas, they provide the OJ! And they absolutely did not disappoint; a lot of people don't realize but the choice of OJ is very important for your mimosa, and Batter and Berry's has an excellent selection. Additionally, they provide a bucket and ice to help keep your champagne cool so that you dont have to rush drinking it in order to avoid it getting warm.  After about 2 glasses of mimosas each, we decided we should try a few things on the menu: AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT HERE EITHER. We got their chicken and chicken infused waffle, shrimp frittata, and French toast flight. Whatever the sauce that they put on their chicken is, is to die for: absolutely delectable. The waffles were thick Belgian style that were very obviously infused with chicken yet still complemented the additional piece of chicken well without being overbearing. The shrimp frittata was perfectly seasoned. But honestly, the French toast flight is what took my breath away. Each peace of toast was bursting with its own unique flavor, amazingly soft yet crispy at the same time, and topped with just the right proportion of topping and syrup.  I would highly recommend getting in line via yelp well in advance as there is no doubt going to be a crowd when you arrive. But even if you have to wait, the wait is worth it. Plus it is located in an area that is easily walkable after you put your name down. Plus the staff are great about seating and waiting! Would highly, highly recommend to all Chicago visitors and will definitely find a reason to go back for my next visit!"
6/2/2020,20200602,5,4.19,"I had eaten here for brunch before, but decided to try lunch today since I had a little extra time today (page 2 of the remixed menu on their webpage). We had the La Colombe brisket hash and the Issa veggie wrap (and then a side order of the sweet potato and sage hash for good measure). Portions are huge, great value and taste! Great carry out option - excited to try the rest of the lunch menu soon!"
6/3/2020,20200603,5,4.19,I'm so happy I'm finally trying this after hearing sooooo much about it. The seasoning on this chicken is so satisfying. And the butter that came with the waffles adds a flavor I didn't even know i needed.
6/4/2020,20200604,5,4.19,This place is amazing and I highly recommend the cheesy hash browns! You may have to wait a while but that's because it's worth the wait. They have really good specials and great service too!
6/5/2020,20200605,1,4.18,"I've been coming to Batter & Berries for years now and it's been declining since my first visit. Yesterday was the first time in months that I had been back to the restaurant and the food was pretty good. Today, I thought let's go for Round 2 and I was very disappointed.I called the establishment about 12 times before I could actually get through. When I got my food, one of the items I ordered were missing. I ordered the strawberry French toast as well and it was barely hot. Hell, it was barely warm. They didn't even add the special butter that makes the whole dish. I ordered chicken sausage as well and it was cold and burnt. Overall, I was left very unsatisfied and disappointed. I love to patronize black owned businesses, but after this experience I won't be returning."
6/6/2020,20200606,5,4.18,Some of the best brunch food I've ever had. For god sakes they have sweet potato waffles!! A French toast flight it'll knock your socks off and it's BYOB!! It's also black owned!
6/7/2020,20200607,5,4.19,"The food is always on point, everyone that works there is incredibly kind. So great to have a delicious black owned spot on the north side"
6/8/2020,20200608,5,4.19,Ordered the Banana Walnut Belgique Waffle this past weekend and it was sublime. If you like bananas walnuts and waffles then this is the place for you. I didn't dine in for obvious reasons so I missed out on the experience interacting with staff and the ambiance but I hear they crush that as well. I'll definitely be coming in soon to try the french toast flight but if you need some great food delivered in a timely manner they're pros at that as well. Love this spot! Maybe you will too?
6/9/2020,20200609,3,4.19,This place is honestly overrated. Their food is alright. I came here to have breakfast with my friends and ordered chicken and waffle. The chicken waS dry and the sweet potato stuffed with chicken was good. The nutmeg gave the meal an after taste that just killed it for me. Im also not a fan of their different flavored French toast. Their eggs are really good and I'm sure everything else on the menu is. I don't recommend the chicken and waffle and try the French toast at your own discretion. You can put your name on the wait list on Yelp before you go or you'll have to wait up to an hour and a half to be seated. The waiters don't really check up on you as often as they should. Prepare to wait 30 minutes for your food. I wanted to return my food for something else but I know they would've been mad. I just plan on not returning at this point. Oh and the lady with the Dora the explorer wig made sure to look at our tab after we signed it to see if we tipped. This was weird and uncomfortable.We tipped because we are graduate students working towards making money and definitely understand tipping is a part of going out to eat culture. If you guys actually checked up on your customers as much as you care about searching for tips maybe you wouldn't have to search at all. Very insulting
6/12/2020,20200612,5,4.19,I have been here twice and both times were amazing!! The food so so good and their customer service is great. The French toast flight is incredible. Make sure to get there early because the wait time can get very long.
6/14/2020,20200614,4,4.19,"I ordered carry out and got the lemon French toast and the cluck n gaufre (fried chicken and sweet potato waffles). The fried chicken was really good, the sweet potato waffle was good too, but pretty dense - it would be hard to eat in one sitting so good news is that you'd probably have leftovers. The lemon French toast was tasty as well. Will definitely come back"
6/14/2020,20200614,5,4.19,"I ordered carry out for breakfast and was very impressed. The breakfast wrap had such good flavor and the cheese hash browns were a nice, crunchy touch. The stacks were really sweet and wholesome. I will definitely be back again!"
6/15/2020,20200615,4,4.19,"I love their waffles!!! A bit busy and the line starts way before the place opens. High-paced place and a bit small on the inside, but I've only gotten the French toast every time I've gone. Fairly priced and friendly staff. FYI: If you're meeting up with others, they will not seat you until everyone shows up."
6/16/2020,20200616,5,4.19,"Everything on the menu is great but they recreate breakfast almost weekly it seems, so I couldn't even tell you what to get cus it may not be there. You know it's good if there is alway a line to get a table. Honestly, devote a morning to this place, BYOB and SUPPORT a great local company."
6/18/2020,20200618,4,4.19,"A lot of options available! I got the chicken fajita omelet and it was pretty good. Not a huge fan of the cheese in the hashbrowns, but I'm sure you could change that. Quick service despite all of the COVID-19 stuff"
6/21/2020,20200621,5,4.19,Love this place and definitely worth the wait to come and eat here!! It feels very homey and the food is so so good! It's a great place to come and gather with friends and family for breakfast/brunch. It's also fun that they do BYO. You definitely need to try the French toast flight!!
6/30/2020,20200630,4,4.19,"I ordered a breakfast delivery via Grubhub this past Sunday. It was an estimated 30-40 min wait for food at 9am so I placed the order. (It should be noted we live very close to the restaurant - 3-4 min drive AT MOST but I was feeling lazy).The delivery driver waited for the food to be prepared and gave me status updates that he was waiting for the food at the 35-40 minute mark. By the time the food came it was almost needing a reheat so not sure what happened there. We ordered the super french toast flight (good flavor), side of bacon (I wouldn't order this again, not worth it), side of cheesy hashbrowns (kind of small for a side of potatoes), half stack of pancakes with their maple butter (the maple butter is GREAT), and a mini fried chicken sandwich (it was big so was a good value but had to put my own mayo and mustard on it b/c it was a plain sandwich with lettuce, chicken and bun) with french fries.After wanting to try B&B for a while (given it is a neighborhood place nearby) we were hoping to be blown away, and we weren't. The food was good and we will definitely give it another try!"
6/30/2020,20200630,5,4.19,"Ordered through grub hub on Sunday morning, everything was still still warm. The Caramel French Toast, Hot chicken wrap and my kids Peach Cobbler French Toast were all delicious! Wish they had turkey bacon available! Still happy with our order! Thank you so much!"
6/30/2020,20200630,5,4.19,My first brunch moving back to Chicago for grad school. The French toast flight is UNMATCHED. I could eat here every day and live life to my fullest because of it.
7/5/2020,20200705,5,4.19,"This is the best tasting, well ran restaurant in all of Chicago. Be it breakfast or otherwise. I live in St.Louis and come here once a month if not twice just to indulge. This is a no brainer when deciding where to dine!"
7/8/2020,20200708,1,4.19,"Extremely greasy and small portions. Couldnt believe how much oil was in my food, almost not edible. Wouldn't come back."
7/10/2020,20200710,4,4.19,Ordering online was great. Chicken sandwich and hot chicken wrap were great. The salad was ok as the cucumbers had turned brown. Overall would go back. Thanks!
7/10/2020,20200710,5,4.19,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try out a black-owned business near us for takeout breakfast, and we were so happy with Batter & Berries! The menu was fun and colorful and included so many delicious options that are unique and not your typical breakfast food. I had the Cluck N Gaufre, which was incredible - so spiced and flavorful, and he got the Cluck & Gravy which was perfectly hearty. Thank you Batter & Berries, we'll be coming back!"
7/11/2020,20200711,5,4.19,Probably the best breakfast spot in the city. They have some classics but I always go back for their unique southern influenced breakfast meals.
7/13/2020,20200713,5,4.19,Black-Owned business that's spot on! Service and food was nothing short of amazing. Ordered the Jambalaya Omelette and the French Toast flight and enjoyed every bite. If your a breakfast/brunch enthusiast this place is a must!
7/15/2020,20200715,5,4.19,"If you haven't been here what are you waiting for?!? B&B is one of the top choices for breakfast, lunch, and if they stayed open long enough dinner and the munchies :-). I've been several times over the past few years and the service and food is consistently AMAZING!!! You'll find yourself trying to decide between several dishes...JUST GET TWO!! Dont even play with your taste buds like that. The food is reasonably priced so bring a friend and order like 4 entrees and split them. Create your own entree tasting session because the food comes out fast like tapas but well portioned like your own kitchen. Bring all the alcohol you want because they are BYOB but I promise you'll be too busy eating to finish that bottle of henny and champagne. Which by the way pairs well with the entire left side of the menu. Bon appetite!!!"
7/19/2020,20200719,3,4.19,"Great brunch. We had the apple pie French toast, the bourbon chicken omelette, and the jambalaya omelette. Flavors are always wonderful here!"
7/22/2020,20200722,5,4.19,"Amazing cuisine! It is so original and unique for a breakfast place. They have excellent seafood options. We loved everything we got from here including the french toast flight and the specials are amazing. If you like a little spice, savory or french toast for breakfast this is your place!!"
7/27/2020,20200727,5,4.19,The Food was delicious. The place was spaced enough to be safe as well. I had to have them twice before I went back home to philly. We Definitely will recommend them to anyone looking for brunch in Chicago. Black owned business a plus.
8/6/2020,20200806,5,4.19,One of the best restaurants in the city! Love their French toast and cheesy hash browns
8/7/2020,20200807,5,4.19,I ordered the Buttermilk Cakes and bacon for delivery and it was so yummy! Also beyond impressed with the people who packed and delivered this so carefully because it arrived fluffy and beautiful!
8/8/2020,20200808,5,4.19,"Best breakfast and best staff in Chicago. That's the review.Warning: I docked a star because a DoorDash order did not go well at all, but I take most responsibility for that. My order was huge and breakfast food is just not meant to travel. ""BUT WAIT! THAT MATH DOESN'T ADD UP!"" you might say... Sure it does. This is a six-star place.There is usually a short wait which I don't love, but I get over it fast because the food is amazing and they never make you feel rushed to make room for the next table."
8/11/2020,20200811,5,4.19,"Tried this spot after hearing so many great reviews and YES, it exceeded ALL of my expectations. It's only open on the weekends so they're always packed. But the wait is so well worth it. I enjoyed an omelette and grits as well as the shrimp wrap and the French toast flight. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on their menu!"
8/13/2020,20200813,5,4.19,"Missing this place so much right now! They are small in size, very close quarters but the atmosphere is beautiful and the staff is always friendly, high energy and very welcoming. The food is rich and delicious. Such a treat!"
8/15/2020,20200815,5,4.19,"Amazing food, welcoming staff. If you visit Chicago you need to have breakfast here. It was my first time and I could not be more satisfied with everything.  Batter & Berries is a Chicago-must!!"
8/27/2020,20200827,5,4.19,One of the best food spots in Chicago. Everything I've gotten has been fantastic. Would highly recommend the French toast flight!!! Will be back many more times
9/3/2020,20200903,5,4.19,"First restaurant/first timeAround Lincoln park area. So glad I was able to check out this highly rated restaurant before they got busy. Staff was nice and sweet, offered us with their fav dish off their menu and that yummy hot sauce for the cheeses hash. The jambalaya omelet was delicious and everything else we ordered. Would like to comes again sooner lol, great breakfast/brunch spot in the area. Debit/Cc cards only cause of Covid. Who carries cash now anyways lol"

9/5/2020,20200905,4,4.19,"In Chicago for Labor Day Weekend and friend in Miami saw me post being in Chi-town and recommended this spot which was co-signed by friends here. So glad I did. Black-owned yet had diverse patrons for the nearly hour and half I dined and observed. Not exceptional, just simply good soul food inspired menu. The items I ordered were seasoned well, tasty, quality prep. Salmon croquettes had hearty flavor, a good Cajun aioli with straightforward cheesy hash browns enhanced by a very good housemade hot sauce they should maybe bottle and sell. So glad my server advised I could do half order of French toast; they are known for their flight of four flavors. I followed my server's recommendation to have the week's special Butter Cookie flavor. Oh my, this was the move. Non-fussy yet creative and yummy menu.My server Nadine was awesome #receipts -- attentive, patient, knowledgeable, polite -- and such a pleasure to be waited on by someone that took pride in serving, particularly in this time of racial tensions. Had a chance to watch and then meet Me-Chelle a member of the family ownership. Solid covid-19 hygiene standards practiced by the staff. Professional and well ran establishment from my experience and in asking passersby on the street.Come hungry as the experience with be filling.

9/12/2020,20200912,5,4.19,"There was a wait but this place was worth it. If you can get on a waiting list I suggest doing that because the line is long. I love that they have very creative breakfast options. It was very difficult to choose between the jambalaya omelette and the jerk chicken but I chose the jerk. It was very filling and delicious. Slightly spicy and good. The eggs were fluffy and a perfect accompaniment. It was a miracle that I got the French toast down because I was very full. I enjoyed that they didn't have that inner sliminess that many places have. The salmon croquettes were by far my favorite item. They didn't taste like your standard croquette and the sauce really made it something different. They were tender and flavorful. The staff was funny and my favorite was the jokester of a waiter who made sure we had everything we needed and wanted. They also Accommodated us when we got to our reservation a few minutes late. They placed us next in line behind the next group , which was fair."
9/12/2020,20200912,5,4.19,"My wife and I stopped at B&B today and had such a great experience! As usual the food was fantastic. What really made the visit special was our server Tusiime. Tusiime made us feel so welcome and at ease. We've rarely eaten inside a restaurant since Covid began and are already a bit wary. Tusiime was quick with clever riddles, jokes, menu suggestions and just oozing with personality. Although he was masked for safety, I could tell he was smiling. During these trying times we're all going through our different struggles. Life is hard. Good food eases some of the hardship but a joyous spirit is priceless.I highly recommend supporting a great small business like B&B and amazing people like Tusiime. Go see him!"

And shes a liar...she allowed someone who came 15 minutes after go before me and my party. So we were forced to be seated in the window. At a table that was created due to the lady taking customers on the waitlist not knowing how to do her job!!!! Not happy at all. And I thought I would show my fiance a nice place with good service and food. Because he's never been. But the service was bad!!! Very unhappy customer!"
9/19/2020,20200919,5,4.19,"This place is amazing, heard so much about it and finally stopped in! The waiter was extremely delightful and recommended the Jerk chicken omelette and it was to die for! Awesome place for an early bite to eat"
9/21/2020,20200921,5,4.19,"My boyfriend had heard of this place from some family so we decided to check it out while visiting Chi-Town this weekend. The wait was about an hour after we checked in on the Yelp waitlist, so beware. We came on Friday and waited in our car until our table was ready at about 10 minutes to 1pm. I had the French Toast sampler with a side of cheese hash browns. My beau got the strawberry French toast with a side of chicken sausage. We both loved our dishes, however the hashbrowns were not much to write home about. That being said, our waiter brought some home made hot sauce to go with it that SET IT OFF! Try the hot sauce. It's worth it! The portion sizes were so-so, so next time we'll probably order something different. We were still satisfied though. Please note that this place is BYOB, so if you want mimosas, remember to bring your own bottle of champagne. Our waiter was also really nice and attentive. He gave us a run-down of the specials and even gave us some riddles which were fun. My only gripe with the service was that toward the end of our meal, multiple bus-boys and our server kept coming to us trying to take our stuff away while we were still eating. They must have needed the dishes, I guess, but it really started to be annoying with every minute, a new person asking if we were done. ""I've got a fork full of food in my hand sir, no, I'm not done!"""
9/25/2020,20200925,5,4.19,Food was spot on and tasty. Portions were very large and everyone there was so courteous. Ordering online and pickup was a breeze! We were thrilled with the food and even had leftovers!
9/26/2020,20200926,5,4.2,"Everything here is astonishing. The chicken and waffles and French toast are both sins of life and im obsessed with it. Can't say enough good things. A bit of a wait tho, totally worth it."
9/28/2020,20200928,5,4.2,"Absolute bomb breakfast. Definitely get the French toast flight, it's so good. I'd love to go every weekend. Easy parking for takeout patrons."
9/28/2020,20200928,5,4.2,I would like to say first and foremost BYOB GENIUS .....the food was amazing and came to the table in a timely manner....Very friendly service and the waiter even had a few quit witted jokes to tell!!!! The long wait to be seated was worth every minute! Can't see myself coming back to Chicago and not going to Batter & Berries!!!
9/29/2020,20200929,5,4.2,Utilized the delivery service. Reheated in the toaster oven very slightly to bring the temperature back and was delicious !!
10/9/2020,20201009,4,4.2,"First of all, I'm glad I read someone's post about Yelp waitlist. It is definitely helpful to do it this way instead of just showing up. We headed there as we became 8th on the waitlist and had to wait maybe another 20 minutes after the 15 minute drive there. I had the super flight French toast to try the rum raisin of the week. That wasn't my favorite. I enjoyed the strawberry and caramel French toast. Juicy and flavor penetrates the toast. The B&B sausage omelet was another favorite for me. I went with chicken. Gravy on top, well seasoned. I was full off this before I attacked the French toast. Go with an appetite. Go and eat. Oh, they don't have mimosa options but if you bring your own champagne and such, they are happy to mix for you."
10/11/2020,20201011,5,4.2,"I definitely recommend this restaurant. The wait is extremely long so I would recommend joining the waitlist before heading that way. I had the special mustard fried chicken, hash browns, and scrambled eggs with Gouda with a hot sauce honey mustard sauce. When I tell you that fish and sawwwccee was amazing they were the star of the show. Our waiter was A male Tsoume( I know I spelled his name wrong) his personality was great and he knew the menu back and forth and gave great suggestions. The hashbrowns were a little hard and the eggs were underseasoned but the sauce made up for it. The next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely be back!"
10/11/2020,20201011,5,4.2,"First time in Chicago, my father and I split the French toast super flight and the brisket with cheesy hash browns, both were amazing and I love the atmosphere! Service was also high quality!"
10/12/2020,20201012,3,4.2,"1.5 hr wait.40 min wait for foodSteak and eggs with harsh browns - steak was fatty and ligament, not good steak.Lemon French toast - cold47 dollars for a cheap meal.Not recommended."
10/17/2020,20201017,5,4.2,"This place was worth the wait. The food was of course amazing but the service was EXCEPTIONAL! Tusiime was such a great time and made the wait seem short. Being a Chicago native, I came back home for a visit and this place made the trip even more worth while. Will be back!"
10/23/2020,20201023,5,4.2,"PLEASE PLEASE GO HERE. The food was absolutely insane, and I will definitely be back. We reserved a waitlist spot on Yelp, and we had to wait about an extra 15 mins when we got there. It is pretty crowded so I recommend doing so. It was 100% worth the wait. We went on a Saturday morning at 1030am-ish. We ordered the salmon eggs benny, lobster omelette and the snickers french toast. Everything was absolutely delicious and they serve La Colmbe coffee which is a huge plus. Wish I had a picture but we couldn't help but eat instantly. Besides the excellent food, the service was amazing. I didn't catch our servers name, but she was absolutely awesome, as well as the bus boys. All staff had masks on, they have hand sanitizer at the front, everything is distanced properly and they make sure customers follow the rules when traveling to/from the restroom. The food an service was comparable to a restaurant in the Gold Coast. Can't wait to be back, hopefully this time I can snap a picture!"
10/25/2020,20201025,5,4.2,"Batters and berries deserves all the hype it gets! Someone in my part ordered the langostino omelette which i was hesitant about just because I have never seen that in a breakfast menu and it was amazing ! Langostino was amazing with the sweet and spicy tomato taste. The crab Cake was delicious with crispy edges but mushy and soft soft inside and with pieces of crab inside . The egg was perfectly poached. It came a with delicious mustardy sauce with a lil kick of spice. The French toast we got for the table after hearing a man outside saying how ready he was for his French toast. There were Fresh strawberries, that made the sweet toast feel fresh. My sister (who usually doesn't like French toast) loved it because it didn't taste egg at all!Service was good too! Just make sure to join the waitlist in advance. We got there way earlier than our time and had to wait over an hour. So try to time your arrival accordingly because you can not wait inside."
10/25/2020,20201025,5,4.2,As always great food!  The new waitlist option is a God Sent!  Did not wait more than 10 minutes. Service was great and staff is friendly and courteous
10/27/2020,20201027,5,4.2,"Batter and berries never disappoints. If you've never been here before, be prepared to wait. On any given day you are going to wait at least an hour and 15 minutes for a table even if you get on the wait list. It's definitely worth it! I always get the French toast flight because duh, French toast. The eggs are magical. I've never had scrambled eggs so good that I didn't need salt or pepper. Even the hot sauce is good! I love coming here and it's my go-to brunch spot when I'm in town. Shouting y'all out all the way from Maryland!"
10/29/2020,20201029,5,4.2,"BYOB, great service and good food. I ordered the flight French toast, & mustard catfish everything was delish."

I cannot wait until we can safely eat indoors again, so we can all experience the joy of eating at Batter & Berries! (Order delivery now! Support small businesses!)"
11/2/2020,20201102,3,4.2,"I hate that I came to Chicago at a time when the governor banned in door dinning. It makes it so much harder to get the vibe of the restaurant and give a good review. Although I must say the food pics look amazing. I ordered the lemon pepper lobster omelette which comes with hash browns. To be honest I didn't like it. The lemon pepper seasoning was a little bit to much, especially for a breakfast food. The eggs were fluffy and loaded with veggies, but the hash browns were a bit hard. They probably needed to be cooked a little longer.  On the other hand this place has to be a local favorite because it's been a revolving door from the time I pulled up until I left. Shout out to executive chef Ken L. Polk for the creative spin on french toast and omelette. Next time Im in Chicago I'll give them another try. Im excited to taste the french toast flight."
11/3/2020,20201103,5,4.2,Still open for takeout!Amaaazing French toast! Had to get the super flight to get a taste of many of their flavors and loved them all. Would absolutely come back/order again in the very near future.
11/8/2020,20201108,4,4.2,"B&B still got it!! They're doing their thing during COVID too. I no longer live in Chicago but this had become my favorite breakfast spot so during my visit I had to check it out. They've distanced tables and they're using their space a lot better, given the circumstances. The food was legendary, as usual, wanted to circle back twice in one trip. The server was knowledgeable, wore a mask and kept our surfaces clean. I truly enjoyed my time here, as always."
11/8/2020,20201108,5,4.2,"We had delivery two days in a row because it was so amazingly good. The best flavor, consistency, and menu choices. We have been in Chicago a few years and just decided to try this place....easily the best breakfast brunch we have had. The traditional was amazing - the eggs are perfect and pork sausage delicious. My husband has had waffles and French toast, all excellent. The lunch items are awesome as well. We will continue to support this business and can't wait to eat in the future! Do yourself a favor and try it out! You won't be disappointed."
11/11/2020,20201111,5,4.2,"I always love coming here. Unfortunately due to the current issues we're all facing, I am unable to dine-in. Almost every time I come to Chicago, I visit here. Great people, fun atmosphere, and the menu to match. There's people that make breakfast, this place elevates breakfast. They take pride in what they do, and it shows. If you want an inspired meal made by masters of their craft, this is the place."
11/27/2020,20201127,5,4.2,Great food good service. I pray they make it through covid. I don't like delivery service because it just doesn't travel well. It's disrespect to the chef to not be able to eat immediately after he has plated. I miss them because I can't go and sit down and eat.
11/28/2020,20201128,4,4.2,"Have eaten here several times and no matter what have always had a great meal. The service and the size of the resturant leave a little to be desired, and this is the only reason they did not get 5 stars. ."
12/1/2020,20201201,5,4.2,"These are the exact chicken & waffles I think about on my worst days. Hands down, the best thing ever--better than the numerous ~fried chicken with a side of pretention~ restaurants in NYC, anything I've had homemade, anything at all for real. We visited pre-covid so not sure how the situation currently is, but really hope that they're holding up okay. If I were in the area I would order takeout daily!My friends and I came by for brunch on a weekend morning; we drove in from the suburbs and joined the Yelp waitlist hours in advance. We still had to wait almost an hour once we were there (so, in total, a 3 hour wait), but I really think it was completely worth it. You can plan ahead by joining via Yelp too. Street parking is not too hard to find and there are options to walk around, sit in your car (if driving in), or sit in the restaurant (pre-pandemic, obviously). I had, of course, the fried chicken and waffles and it was absolute perfection. The maple butter, the sweet potato waffle, the hot chicken--just wow. All the flavors combined could not have worked together any better. I don't even like sweet potato and I'm obsessed with that waffle. Portions were generous, food came out quickly, service was WONDERFUL. Our server was so friendly and warm, it was like eating at a close friend's place.Highly highly recommend to all! I can't wait to return someday."
12/5/2020,20201205,4,4.2,"Have gone to the Lincoln Park location. Menu is fun and the service is simple. Make a reservation or likely you will wait an extensive time (will wait list times even with reservation, apparently). Full breakfast fare with some lunch time type entrees too - but this is really a breakfast spot. Decor is bright but could use an update and refresh. This is not spot for anything more than eating - low key spot and run like family restaurant not a professional dining spot. But the food is good. BYOB if you're trying to brunch with friends."
12/7/2020,20201207,1,4.2,"Placed a Order Over the Phone, I Was so Excited , Heard a lot about Restaurant From Family & Friends Just Moved 5Mins Away to find out When I Got Home My Order was Very DRY. To the fact My Husband & Kids Couldn't Eat Their Food I Ordered 3/ Pancakes side of Bacon and 1/French Toast, They Only gave me 3 Lil Cups of Syrup for 3 HUGE Pancakes The Syrup didn't even cover 1 of the pancakes, So We had to Throw the Food out, We Just Moved here so I don't have no condiments and I also express that when I called to speak with a MGR. It Saddens My Heart To Write This Review on a Black Owned Business, But I Tried to Handle it The Professional Way By Calling The Restaurant Concerning My Order, I Spoke with MGR. Michelle And All She Did Was, I'll Speak with My Staff, No Support at All Or No Justification I'm Not Use to Restaurants Treating You This Way, I Come From Schaumburg with Great Customer Service, I Will Never Spend Another Dime in This Establishment She didn't even say come bck, next time we'll take % off or what can I do to make this right just NOTHING!!! I'm so up set because I'm not working in this Pandemic and every dollar counts, and for me to be excited and spend 65.00 on break for my college teens and Husband was an insult or slap in the face!! Come on My People We Have to Treat each other with common courtesy"
12/12/2020,20201212,4,4.2,"The food is great, portions are a little small, but the coffee had free refills which was appreciated."
12/13/2020,20201213,2,4.2,"Great customer service but the food did not live up to the hype. The eggs were over cooked, the cheesy hash browns were bland and mushy. The French toast (which is what they are supposedly famous for) was okay but I make better. The one thing I did love was the portobello mushroom, it has so much flavor and was delicious!Overall, the food is over priced for the quality and taste of their food. This is definitely a one timer for me."
12/18/2020,20201218,5,4.2,I ordered the Strawberry French Toast and it was amazing! They give you their famous butter and you really don't need syrup because the butter speaks for it self
12/19/2020,20201219,1,4.2,"I thought this was supposed to be the best French toast in Chicago? I've lived here for 4 years and was told about this place right when I moved here. I finally tried it today and I'm sooo so so disappointed. Menu specified the French toast came with their homemade butter (which I didn't receive).For ""world famous French toast"" there sure isn't anything special about this. All the toast tastes the same, probably because I didn't get nearly enough of the toppings to actually differentiate them from one another - 5 blueberries for the blueberry French toast and 3 strawberries for the strawberry. Probably 1/4 of a teaspoon of whatever drizzle they put on here. It's not worth it. Go to Frances Deli in Lincoln Park for French toast. This feels like I got cheated out of a meal."
12/31/2020,20201231,1,4.19,"Me and my girlfriends family had ordered brunch for her birthday, more than a hundred dollars worth of food. When we had arrived home the containers were at best not even filled 3/4 of the way. The servings were minimal, unimpressive, and non filling. For its pricing the expectation of the quantity was more than what we had received, we were disappointed and let down by the great reviews we saw online"
1/13/2021,20210113,4,4.19,"It's important for me to start this review by saying I ordered here on New Year's Day. Huge thank you's to the restaurant for even being open and taking orders! I found Batter & Berries through Uber Eats and ordered for delivery through UE. I'm from the south and was so excited to see biscuits and gravy on the menu (cluck and gravy on the menu)! I ordered this with a side of the ""cheese crusted hash browns"". I didn't realize that the biscuits and gravy already came with a side of the cheese hash browns, so I wish that had been a little more clear on the UE menu because I didn't need two sides of potatoes. The order came packaged really well and was still warm and wasn't messy from delivery. The biscuits and gravy was definitely not a traditional southern recipe but it was absolutely delicious. It tasted flavorful and full of herbs. I will definitely be ordering again and was really impressed with taste. I was a little disappointed in the ""cheese crusted hash browns"". I definitely understand with delivery it's entirely possible some texture was lost in travel/time before it got to me, but they just seemed like regular shredded potatoes with some cheese mixed in. They weren't especially flavorful or memorable. Would probably pass for future delivery orders but would for sure try in the restaurant. Overall this was a good experience and I'll definitely order again!"
1/19/2021,20210119,4,4.19,"I ordered from this restaurant via Postmates to my hotel room but next time I will defintley try it in house. That's on us for being lazy. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I love the variety of flavors offered. The French toast - bread was a little too thin for my liking but the flavor was there. The chicken and sweet potato waffle was pretty good. I will be back when in Chicago. Support Black Owned Businesses."
1/20/2021,20210120,5,4.2,Three words: French toast flight. It is seriously incredible! They use honey butter on all of their French toast which makes it extra delicious. Batter and Berries is hands down the best breakfast spot in Chicago
1/25/2021,20210125,3,4.19,"Food is always great! I had the salmon croquette Benedict, for some reason I thought Benedicts came on an English muffin, but maybe not in this case. The cost seemed a bit pricey for two Salmon Croquettes and Two Eggs. Otherwise, still one of my favorite brunch spots. I am glad to see them expanding"
1/27/2021,20210127,5,4.19,"EVERYTIME I have eaten here it has blown me away I always go with my bf. The service is top-notch and I mean you cannot beat it anymore I have ever been in hands down. They are attentive, incredibly accommodating and efficient. This has become my Favorite place in Chicago for Breakfast easily. The French toast flight is to die for. Nadine is the greatest waitress I have had in my entire life you would be amazed and thank me later. I realize this may sound somewhat of a biased review but this place blows me away. It's phenomenal"
1/29/2021,20210129,5,4.2,"This place is great. As a native of St. Louis, I highly recommend this spot to anyone who likes amazing food and amazing service. Wait time is a little long early afternoon which is to be expected since it is a small restaurant and because of Covid 19. All employees and guests are wearing masks as well. Whenever I'm back in Chicago, I will definitely come back!"
2/6/2021,20210206,1,4.19,Sat and waited for over 10 minutes at our table and was never greeted. Watched two white couples sit right after us and while they were sitting immediately attended to. When I signaled for service was giving the hold on one sec hand. Waited a few more minutes and walked out when I saw the tables after us already had their drinks and were placing orders. What's sad is those tables were right next to us.
2/6/2021,20210206,5,4.19,Great Resturant with excellent service! Loved how knowledgeable the staff are and very accommodating in such difficult times. The me u is amazing and the Strawberry French toast is my FAV! Check this place out!
2/7/2021,20210207,5,4.19,I ordered their caramel French toast and a side of the cheese crusted hash browns and let me tell you this was one of the most amazing breakfast I have ever had! This was door dashed to me and they packaged my meals very well the food was still warm and the bread was soft and so flavorful! The hash browns were soooo yummy! Highly recommended if you haven't ordered from here yet do it!
2/11/2021,20210211,5,4.19,Such great service and the french toast a little too sweet for my taste but really good nonetheless
2/11/2021,20210211,4,4.19,"No doubt their french toast flight is delicious :)If you order takeout, I do recommend triple checking with them on how long the order will take. They told me 15-20 minutes and then 4 minutes later called me back to say it was already ready...I was bummed because then my french toast got soggy while it sat there waiting for me to pick it up - I wish they had just stuck with the 15-20 minutes they had told me previously."
2/12/2021,20210212,5,4.2,"Delicious French toast, do yourself a favor and try the sampler. For you vegetarians, the portobello mushroom option is delicious with some eggs and the cheesy hash browns."
2/13/2021,20210213,5,4.2,Such friendly staff. Food was delicious. I'd say the best breakfast I've had. And very unique omelettes made to perfection! *chefs kiss*
2/17/2021,20210217,5,4.2,I was visiting a friend and she recommended we check this place out because of all the great reviews. I must say they did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of French toast and theirs is amazing. The fruit was very fresh and the flavor so delicious. Will definitely be going back when I'm in the area.
2/19/2021,20210219,4,4.2,A very solid breakfast choice! Delivery worked out great and I was very happy with how delicious the food was.
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.2,Amazing food! Love it best French toast in townGreat costumer serviceIs BYOBDefinitely coming back
2/21/2021,20210221,5,4.2,"The food was excellent, the service was excellent, I got the Super flight of french toast and the brisket hash and it was all amazing!!!"
2/25/2021,20210225,5,4.2,"Awesome food and service! We ( my husband and I) went twice during our vacation. The first time we were clueless as to how busy it would be, so we ordered our food to go. I had a pepper steak omelet, it was ridiculously delicious. I didn't want to but I let my husband taste mine and he was immediately jealous! He had the Jambalaya omelet which was awesome as well. We had friends join us on our second trip, they were equally blown away by the menu and perfect French Toast! Can't wait to return! This a must try!"
2/27/2021,20210227,5,4.2,Excellent service from Tusiime. Exceptional levels of Blackcellence in effect in this joint. Food was eclectic and delicious. I had the catfish with hash browns and scrambled eggs. Fye!
3/1/2021,20210301,5,4.2,"Absolutely incredible in every way - truly THE definition of foodgasm! My friend and I split the French Toast Flight, ""We're Movin On Up"" Executive (which came with Angus Rib Eye Steak paired with two eggs your way and a side of hash browns), and the Fried Chicken and Mild Sauce Omelet (one of their special dishes). I had no complaints with any of the dishes - French Toast flavors weren't too overpowering and had the perfect amount of sweetness without adding Anya edition also syrup, the Angus Rib Eye Steak was very juicy and tender (literally melted in my mouth), AND and Fried Chicken was still crispy even after being covered with the mild sauce. On top of all of this, our waiter was incredible and had riddles for us throughout the entire dining experience! Last but not least, this is BYOB so an absolute MUST if you're wanting boozy brunch! They have a Yelp waitlist so you can definitely prepare your party ahead of time - this is an overall meal you won't regret. I cannot wait to feast again at this Black-owned business!"
3/4/2021,20210304,5,4.2,"We checked in at 1:30 and was told it was a 30 minute wait (keep in mind they close at 2). We still received the same level of service as if we walked in when they opened. Tim was amazing and provided great service and recommendations! This was my first time, I will be back!"
3/6/2021,20210306,5,4.2,The BEST food and customer service! Outstanding ambiance and the food was well worth the price!
3/7/2021,20210307,4,4.2,Excellent food. Very friendly staff. Efficient service. Food is fresh. Love the seasonal menus. The French toast is the best I've ever had. Love the tea selection. Must try. I always take my out of town guests here prepandemic. My only issue is the wait is always long especially on weekends. Recently the wait list was two hours so I had to go somewhere else. Just plan accordingly if you want to eat there.
3/7/2021,20210307,5,4.2,"The food was ok , but I think i gotta try more stuff to figure out why there always full . I like the service though but food isn't like superb but it's fine . My server was the best part because he ask riddles and acts like he actually wants to be there at his job! Overall i would come back plus it's black owned"
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.2,I love this place!!! Service was fast and server was delightful! Be the first one in line when they open or you will be waiting
3/9/2021,20210309,5,4.2,Food was really good. The crab cake dish they have right now was the best. I will be back!
3/11/2021,20210311,5,4.2,"SERVICE:- Although there can be a wait, it is definitely worth the time to come here.- Staff are polite, friendly and welcoming.- We were immediately greeted when we entered.- Great efficiency! I got frequent coffee and water refills.FOOD:- Everything on the menu looked so tasty! I ended up ordering the ""We're Moving On Up"" Executive. It is a 7 oz Angus Ribeye Steak with grilled onions, mushrooms, cabernet sauce, 2 eggs and cheese crusted hashbrowns.- Great portions, tasty and definitely filling!- Next time I want to try the Lobster Omelette and Jambalaya Omelette!COVID SAFETY:- After entering the waitlist, you must wait outside the restaurant to encourage social distancing and prevent fire hazards.- All staff members properly wore masks."
3/22/2021,20210322,1,4.2,"I was there yesterday morning. I ordered blueberry French toast, caramel French toast, a lobster omelette, and the blackened catfish. Everything came out together except for the blackened catfish. When the blackened catfish came, I cut into it and it was still raw. Didn't want another serving at that point, appetite was lost. I was so disappointed."
3/23/2021,20210323,5,4.2,"We joined the waitlist online - once we arrived we were sat immediately. Service was great, our server, Leslie, went into detail about all of their specials and were so nice! One of the best, easiest, and delicious breakfast experiences yet. Also BYOB!! I got the impossible wrap and it is 100% vegan. Easily one of the best vegan breakfasts I have ever had. Such a great experience, will definitely be coming back again and again!"
3/28/2021,20210328,5,4.2,"Mannnn oh man! This place is as amazing as I heard it would be. I heard it's extremely busy on the weekends so my husband and I stopped by at 8am on Friday (yay for work from home flexibility). It wasn't busy at all and we had just the most amazing experience! We heard about the French toast flight so we absolutely knew we were going to get it. You get a triangle of EVERY French toast on their menu and the super flight also includes a triangle of their specialty weekly French toast flavor. It was... mind blowing. Our favorites from the flight were the caramel, strawberry and blueberry, but all were amazing! On the savory side, our waiter convinced us to get the Jambalaya omelet and..... wow. SO GOOD. It doesn't have pork, it's made with chicken sausage and shrimp. The sauce is amazing and don't get me STARTED on their cheesy, crispy hash browns! Truly one of the best I've had. Had all of this with a great mug of coffee and I was set!!!! If you couldn't tell already, you should definitely try this place out."
3/29/2021,20210329,2,4.2,"For a brief moment & forgot that I wasn't a fan of this place however this visit knocked me back down to reality. For 21$ the lobster cakes was utter crap. Twas a tiny morsel of lobster & the cakes were dry to say the least. The reason they didn't receive one star was the lemon aioli was actually pretty tasty but other components of my order sucked to say the least. I also opted for a chicken sandwich (not pictured) for my souse to which her reply was simply ""dry"". All in all I spent almost $50 which was a reminder that no matter the convenience factor to stray away from places that failed at a first impression. Lastly always check on your food orde early. When I placed my order is said anywhere from 35-40 minutes & Twas ready in about 15 minutes total."
3/30/2021,20210330,5,4.2,"Our family loved this brunch spot - we had the best server ever - he was the most energetic, attentive, and kind and made our experience really special. Their cheesy hash browns are so good.. loved everything we ordered though, breakfast sandwich, impossible breakfast burrito, banana walnut waffles, and pancakes! It was such a hit that we ended up visiting twice in the one weekend while hosting our family. We will be back!"
4/4/2021,20210404,1,4.2,"I cant post pictures and cant really give a review as I never got to go in. We waited for over 2 and a half hours to be seated with a promise that it would be a 90 min wait. We came here because we saw this place on a documentary. In all fairness its Sunday, Easter and a pandemic. Only 10 tables available and apparantly the kitchen was behind. I hope to come back soon and try."
4/4/2021,20210404,5,4.2,It's just hands down the best gourmet breakfast restaurant in the world!!! Nothing should be compared to Batter & Berries
4/4/2021,20210404,4,4.2,The French toast is worth the trip alone! Also worth trying the sweet potato and chicken waffles. Perfect brunch spot in the city with great tasting food
4/9/2021,20210409,5,4.2,"Location perfect, tusiime was next level, professional, and loved his riddles, hospitality was 100%! Food 100%! 100% recommend"
4/9/2021,20210409,5,4.2,Food is ALWAYS good. We have our favorite servers but everyone is very nice. The Chef is top notch and when not busy will come talk to the patrons. I highly recommend the Super flight and the impossible burger.
4/9/2021,20210409,5,4.2,Great spot but 13 dollars for two pieces of French toast is absolutely ridiculous. Be papered to pay at least 30.00 for breakfast!
4/11/2021,20210411,5,4.2,Came here to treat my brother and family to their world famous French Toast. They thoroughly enjoyed their meal and the service was great. The manager is making sure that distancing is followed by monitoring that the indoor waiting capacity is not exceeded. I would recommend getting on the waitlist 30-45 minutes before you plan to arrive.
4/13/2021,20210413,5,4.2,"I love brunch so I'm always down to try places with great brunch options. I also enjoy supporting Black-owned businesses. Batter & Berries fit the bill and did not disappoint. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and the place was at capacity. We tried to join the waitlist via Yelp but it had been disabled. We ended up having to go in person to get on the list at the restaurant. Initially we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. I think in reality it was about an hour wait.Our server was great and made sure we were aware of all of the specials that were not on the menu. And also worth mentioning, our water glasses were always full! The young man responsible for water kept our refills coming. It was great. I couldn't decide between French toast or waffles so I got both. I got the chicken & waffles and a 1/2 order of French toast. There were so many great options to choose from. If you like waffles, give the chicken & waffles a try. It's a sweet potato waffle which I had never had before. It was very good! Our food came out hot and fresh very quickly. We had a great meal and great service."
4/14/2021,20210414,3,4.2,The food is great but the wait is ridiculous. You have to get on the waitlist on Yelp and then still go sign in at the restaurant. I see no point in getting on a waitlist on Yelp if you still need to get on another waitlist at the restaurant.
4/15/2021,20210415,5,4.2,"This spot is amazing although they didn't serve waffles the blueberry batter pancakes were fine, but the ace was the lobster Benedict the eggs were overcook slight but overall I had a great breakfast"
4/17/2021,20210417,4,4.2,"Always a plus to dine at BOB's! A family member suggested this place for brunch while visiting Chicago. It would have been a plus to if we were able to add ourselves to the waitlist from Yelp. We did not rent a car so we took a Lyft. When we arrived we were told it would be a hour wait and that we must wait outside in windy 50 degree weather. YIKES! Luckily we found a coffee shop a block or so away. I grabbed a coffee and we were able to sit and wait. The establishment is small only 10 tables for patrons. It's BYOB! Bring a bottle of champagne to add to your orange, cranberry or whatever juice you prefer! Our waiter Tusuime (spell check) was phenomenal! Very animated and made our experience enjoyable. He recited about 3 riddles for us to solve! We definitely didn't have our thinking caps on, haha. I think we got one right! We ordered Lobster Benedict, Crab omelette, Strawberry French toast! Now here's the thing, we're from New Orleans so seafood hits different for us so with that being said...the food was good. My egg was fried way too hard so I pushed it to the side. Our cheesy hash browns were yummy! & You can never go wrong with Strawberry French toast! Sometimes you should stick to what you know. LOL Overall all I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Oh, ask for a togo cup for your left over OJ!"
4/17/2021,20210417,5,4.2,I love this family restaurant. Crazy yummy food options and it's BYOB! Get there early or the wait can be long but worth the wait! Can't wait to go back
4/17/2021,20210417,5,4.2,5 star service each time! The wait is minimal considering these circumstances. Thank you for your fantastic hosts and the equally wonderful service.
4/20/2021,20210420,5,4.2,First time was pleasantly surprised. Food choices very diverse and Nadine was very knowledgeable and helpful. Her service was spot on very personable it felt like it home.
4/22/2021,20210422,5,4.2,"This was our first time here and we are definitely coming back! We came at a busy time so of course there was a longer wait time (1.5 hrs) but it was worth it! The Yelp Waitlist was frequently updated and accurate. Staff is super friendly, welcoming, and professional. Our waiter, Tusiime was very attentive and outgoing. We redeemed our free French toast flight -a promo they are doing through the ""Semy"" app, delish! We also got the ""We're Moving on Up"" Executive and the B&B Breakfast Wrap that were both amazing! Make sure you try their house made hot sauce, so good. Lastly, the place is well kept and staff follows COVID protocols with proper mask wearing, social distancing, limited seating, and cleanliness. Overall a great experience!"
4/22/2021,20210422,1,4.2,"To begin with, my food was cold. I placed a to go order because the wait was too long to dine in which was fine by me. I waited about 30 min and they said they would call me but nothing. Went in to check on my food, they said they called me but I never received a call. Food was cold, presentation wasn't good either. Do not recommend."
4/23/2021,20210423,5,4.2,"Very friendly and welcoming staff. The food was delicious! We will be back again! I had the lump crab omelet, and it exceeded my expectations! It was very flavorful and paired well with the breakfast potatoes."
4/25/2021,20210425,4,4.2,"Food was really good, enjoyed it a lot! The banana waffle and rum had no Rum taste so it was a bit disappointing but the chicken sandwich and French toast were absolutely perfect. I ordered to go and they said 20mim ending up waiting and hour."
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.2,"The chicken Alfredo omelette! Mouthwatering, this thing was full of flavor! A must try, don't forget to add a side of their delicious French toast. They are expensive but definitely worth a try"
4/26/2021,20210426,5,4.2,Saw the good reviews and had to try the French toast. Definitely the best I've ever had! I highly recommend and will go back if I'm ever in Chicago again.
4/28/2021,20210428,5,4.2,Been here a few times. Thrilled with my food each time. This last: waffle flight and spinach omelette. Yum!
4/30/2021,20210430,5,4.2,"The food was amazing! I got the blueberry French toast and a lump crab omelet (with a surprisingly good amount of crab) that came with cheesy hash. Everything was flavorful, tasted fresh, and served at a good temperature. Batter & Berries is worth the wait!"
5/3/2021,20210503,5,4.2,"Went there for the first time last month. I'm still thinking about their lemon French toast. YUM! The waiter was excellent (sorry can't remember his name but he tells funny jokes and riddles!) the drinks are good too, well worth the wait. Plus it's black owned!"
5/3/2021,20210503,5,4.2,I advise you to get there early and make reservations!! This place was great I had the fried chicken Alfredo omelette. It was AMAZING. The waiter kept us entertained and food was hot and fresh. I will definitely be back for more when I visit Chicago in the future
5/5/2021,20210505,4,4.2,"This review is for delivery, not for dining in.My husband and I ordered some breakfast from her last weekend. We decided to split the chicken/waffles and the French toast flight that included the flavor of the week. I thought the waffle was okay. It was heavier than I was used to. Maybe because it was sweet potato. But it tasted good. The chicken wasn't dry so that's a plus! I didn't care for their hot sauce, but that's just a preference of mine. We are well stocked in the kitchen with hot sauces! So no problem here. I really liked the honey butter. Paired perfectly with the waffle. The flight was good. The margarita was tart! I enjoyed it. The lemon didn't have a sauce like the others. Not sure if that's how it supposed to come or not. The caramel was awesome. The blueberry was ok, but I don't really like blueberries. The strawberry was good too. I only wished there was a way to package them so the flavors didn't mix. The caramel was on a couple of the others. We both got the cheesy hash browns. They were pretty good also. If we were in the area for breakfast we would try them again for dine in."
5/5/2021,20210505,4,4.2,"Service was great, very friendly and informative. They have daily specials with picture that was a nice touch"
5/5/2021,20210505,5,4.2,Love love love the food. Waiters were super friendly. Did I say the food was great lol.
5/9/2021,20210509,1,4.2,"I ordered my Mother's Day brunch the day before knowing how busy it would be and when I got there, I waited 30 minutes before being told my order wouldn't be ready for at least another 30 minutes. It was so crowded with people getting take out orders (many leaving without them) there was no place to wait. I live in the neighborhood and have eaten here several times and it is always amazing but sadly, on my special day, I was not able to have my French Toast flight. I should have known better and was so disappointed. If I ever go back, I would go on a weekday at a slow time but not sure I will go back. The food is always phenomenal and maybe Covid had something to do with the staffing issues but those poor hosts were stressed from the amount of people coming in and take out orders."
5/10/2021,20210510,1,4.2,"I have ordered from Batter and Berries throughout the pandemic and each time there have been operational issues - we've always had to wait for the food when we pick up. Their skills for estimating when food is ready is severely lacking but this time around it was absolutely unacceptable. We ordered through Doordash and while the restaurant confirmed receiving the order, our order was not ready for over 2.5 hours. It is clear that they did not begin our order and that other orders (perhaps dine in customers) were placed ahead of ours. Had they indicated that there would be over an hour wait we would have ordered elsewhere. Unfortunately, this is the last straw and we will no longer be patronizing this business. They have very good food but fortunately, there are other establishments in the city with equivalent quality of food."
5/10/2021,20210510,1,4.2,"Called to make a reservation but they no longer take reservations so once I got there they told me 4 hour wait to be seated SMH. I ordered food to go and my cheese burger had NO FLAVOR, all I tasted was the tomato. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was well done. 3rd time I had issues with this place so I'll no longer give them my business."
5/15/2021,20210515,3,4.2,"I was really excited about this place and I was sadly underwhelmed. The French toast was good but nothing overwhelming. Several of the pieces were just plain French toast with fruit or syrup on them. I got the traditional breakfast with eggs, bacon and has browns. My hashbrows, while they were decent, were cold and need salt. My eggs which I asked to have fried over medium, were hard fried and rubbery. My friend got the Crab Benny and the eggs were soft boiled and not poached and her has browns were worse than mine. The place has great vibes but just not so awesome food this time."
5/16/2021,20210516,5,4.2,"If you want to support black businesses while enjoying every bit of it, this is the place to go.Nothing fancy, diner like place, but great good and service. Weekends are pretty crowded so expect a longer wait. It's well worth it tough. The best chicken and waffles ( Cluck-N-Gaufres) to this date! Make sure you order that.I don't care about their French toasts much, nothing spectacular, but the omelets are great. While back when Derek Rylon was the chef, they had an egg white lobster omelet with gruyere cheese, it was the best! Hopefully they'll bring that back. Anyhow, it's great brunch/ breakfast place."
5/16/2021,20210516,5,4.2,This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The food and service are hard to beat no matter what you order.
5/16/2021,20210516,1,4.2,Was not impressed by the food at all. Tried the crab lump omelette and pancakes. Was not as good as I expected
5/17/2021,20210517,4,4.2,"You definitely want to take advantage of the ""Waitlist"" link on their web site. Add yourself before you leave home. I did not expect a long wait on a Monday morning, but it was 2 hours before I was able to sit down. Fortunately, there is a coffee house across the street where I could sit and get some work done. More fortunately, the food at Batter & Berries was very good. I ordered one of the specials - 2 crab cakes with hollandaise sauce and hash browns. Very tasty! The staff was very friendly here. 2 people stopped by my table and even remembered my name."
5/18/2021,20210518,5,4.2,The food is phenomenal but be prepared for a wait! We had about a 2.5 hour wait so get on the waitlist as early as you can or go for take out! The French toast flight was amazing and my husband loved the sweet potato waffle and fried chicken!
5/19/2021,20210519,2,4.2,"Came for breakfast. We were seated quickly. Water and utensils were given immediately and ordered 2 coffee with the guy with multicolor hair. Placed our breakfast and ordered coffee as well. We got the French toast flight and chicken and waffles in no time and still no coffee. We ate 1/2 of our meal before waitress came and asked what we ordered to drink. It took 3 requests to get our coffee. It took 3 requests to get a plastic bag as well. Again, we asked once to the same guy as we did our coffee and twice to our waitress.French toast was good so 1 star for that and take out utensils for the leftover chicken. Sweet potato waffles were okay. It was not busy so I can't imagine what it's like on the weekends"
5/20/2021,20210520,5,4.2,"This place is just as good as the reviews say! 5 star experience. I ordered 3 kinds of French toast; lemon, caramel and tiramisu. Each option had a unique flavor profile and tasted phenomenal. Not to mention the speed of getting my order. It had to have been under ten minutes to get all my food.Between the service and the food, I can't recommend this place enough."
5/21/2021,20210521,5,4.2,This food was amazing. I was done in 15min if that. I got the sample and fries chicken breast and a coffee. The service was great wish I didn't live in Florida if visit here every weekend!
5/22/2021,20210522,5,4.2,"I still remember my very time eating brunch here 6 years ago and it was delicious. The only brunch place I know that serves ""cheesy hash brown"". Fast forward 6 years and I came back with my bf and my friend and we were so content after the meal. Make sure to use the Yelp waitlist to help decrease the waiting time! Ordered the French toast flight, crab cakes Benedict's, and the brisket hash to share and they were all so good! We can never choose btn sweet and savory for brunch so we always order both. The fresh toast was warm and sweet, served with their very own maple butter- delectable. And as for the brisket, it just fell apart in your mouth with so much flavor. And every bite of the crab cakes makes you wanna go back for more. You can tell the food was made with love and care! Good food and good vibes throughout the restaurant. Highly recommend for brunch in Chicago. And it's pretty close to Lincoln Zoo where you can enter for free and walk off all the food."
5/22/2021,20210522,2,4.2,"meant to give this a 2.5, but no halfsies on yelp.friendly staff, but just-normal breakfast food. biggest issue for me here is the overhype of this place leading to excessive long waits (and just okay food).the novelty (i guess) of ""flights of french toast"" kinda wears off when you realise they are just okay. this place gives me overrated vibes like ""over easy"" in ravenswood, for which i share many of the same feelings. basically if i can have similar breakfast foods at denny's, ihop, or my house; what is the worth of the upcharge and long wait for these places?"
5/22/2021,20210522,5,4.2,Simply the best brunch place in Chicago. It hits every time. The lines are long but it's worth it.
5/24/2021,20210524,5,4.2,"Batter & Berries was recommended to us and we had a great meal here. I had the strawberry French toast and my spouse had the super French toast flight which included their special of the week, mimosa french toast with berries. All of the French toast flavors were excellent and the maple butter they come with is so so good. Service was quick and our waitress was very friendly. Definitely recommend giving them a try and hop on the waitlist to save some time!"
5/24/2021,20210524,1,4.19,"From the beginning our waitress was weird and you could totally tell she was hungover and tired. The chair I sat on had food stuck on it that I had to clean before sitting down. Our french toast came out before our actual food, which we didn't like. The chicken sandwich was burnt, the bread was burnt, and it made it so dry. The crab cake Benedict was gross, to say the least. Our coffee got cold and I had to wait until our waitress decided to pop up again so that I could request more coffee. My boyfriend finished his orange juice and was never offered anything else. Neither meal was close to being done and we were never asked why or if everything was ok. For a $50 breakfast, I was expecting more. We will not be back."
5/28/2021,20210528,5,4.19,"Omgeeeeeeeeee! Just had theeee best crab benny w lemon aioli and stole a piece of blueberry French toast off my mom's plate . Didn't love the sweet potato hash, but child, I don't even care. 10/10. Be prepared to wait..."
5/29/2021,20210529,5,4.2,Such a great spot. Expect to wait around 1-2 hours for a table though. We put our names in at 10:45 a d got seated at 12:30. They have a live waitlist so you can see where you're at. Our waitress was the sweetest human. She has worked there since the place opened and was so knowledgeable and friendly. Food is 5 stars for sure. The caramel French toast is actually to die for. Their homemade hot sauce is also incredible. No booze on the menu but I think you can bring your own. There's only a few tables indoors but definitely worth the wait!
5/31/2021,20210531,5,4.2,"Batter & Berries need to stop playing and open a facility for us Blackish folk in the suburbs. I love this place, they are so amazing. I've never had a complaint. The BYOB policy and being black owned makes it even better."
6/6/2021,20210606,4,4.2,"Went for brunch this past Friday and this Used to be my favorite place for pancakes.  I would have given just three stars but my friend loved her waffles. My meal was off a bit. The service was awesome! We were told about 45 minutes for a table but it took about 75 minutes but a lovely woman was passing out iced water and that made things better. My pancakes were a bit wonky but still decent enough to eat and our spicy sausage were like hockey pucks. We had three each and only finished two of them between the both us, one each. They were over cooked and over salted. I will return because the food at all my other visits were spectacular. Just an off day I guess."
6/6/2021,20210606,5,4.2,"Definitely one of the best brunches I've had. Would recommend to anyone. The French toast flight was amazing, wonderful flavors!! The restaurant is in a pretty neighborhood. FYI they do not take reservations, so wake up early and out your name on the waitlist so you can go at your desired time."
6/8/2021,20210608,4,4.2,"Great food and atmosphere! Wait was bordering on intolerable. Service was spot on. Would do again, but this time would have something else to do during the hour and half wait for the table."
6/10/2021,20210610,5,4.2,The food was soooo good! Worth the wait. The hash browns are the best i ever tasted! Never been a huge fan of French toast but their French toast is the best! Will definitely be back when I'm in Chicago again! It's also BYOB which is perfect for brunch.
6/12/2021,20210612,4,4.2,"This place can fill up quickly on a Saturday morning. We really enjoyed the French toast flight, my husband even ordered an additional order of the lemon! Service was FAST and the staff was very friendly!"
6/13/2021,20210613,5,4.2,"Far and away the best french toast I've ever had. Make sure to try the specials (they change the imaginative french toast flavors every week). I ordered the crab cake Benedict with poached eggs and hash browns without the cheese. While the egg wasn't quite poached and runny, I thoroughly enjoyed the crab cake and egg combo nonetheless. I tried a few bites of the current special, peaches and cream. With the maple syrup baked into the butter baked into the brioche, this is top tier food. Service is super friendly complete with riddles from the waiters and prices are great for what you're getting. The wait is always long--for good reason!"
6/13/2021,20210613,5,4.2,"Food was great, it was Mothers Day so a long delay. But enjoyed our carry out very much. This place make excellent french toast.."
6/15/2021,20210615,5,4.2,"It's always a pleasure supporting a local black owned business. My table ordered 4 different meals so we could try each other's meals. When I tell you the French toast was perfection, it was PERFECTION! The Sangria French toast literally tasted like sangria on perfectly made French toast, with fresh fruits on top. Nothing got soggy, even after sitting for a few minutes. The ribeye omelet had the steak/onion/mushrooms on top of the egg which was unexpected for me but still very tasty. The steak was tender and the gravy was very well seasoned, almost tasted like a Marsala sauce.I'm not a chicken&waffles fan but I did taste the cluck and gufte (spellcheck). The chicken was very crispy and fried well, and the waffle came with an amazing custard. It was like the texture of ice cream but was a rich, sweet, almost buttery custard. Chile idk how to describe that custard but it was amazing LOL.The Traditional was what you would expect from a traditional breakfast plate. My mom got hers subbed with fried chicken which was the same chicken that came with the waffles. Everything was amazing at this restaurant and I can't wait to come back next time I'm visiting Chicago!"
6/16/2021,20210616,4,4.2,"The food was good and we enjoyed the patio. Don't be discouraged by the long line, we didn't wait as long as we expected."
6/17/2021,20210617,5,4.2,"Incredible service, incredible food. The French toast (any flavor) is so good, I almost went back the next day. Make sure to use the Yelp waitlist because the wait time can be long. Shouldn't be a problem if you use Yelp"
6/20/2021,20210620,5,4.2,"Does this place ever disappoint? No! The specials are always out of this world and delicious, I can never order anything on their regular menu since the specials always sound so good. Definitely a must brunch spot for out of town visitors. My waiter was hilarious and so kind, he tells riddles and makes it such a fun dining experience. From the cheesy hash browns, to their special hot sauce. Go here!!"
6/25/2021,20210625,5,4.2,"This place is amazing. Hard to say anything more than that. I haven't had a chance to visit, as we weren't dining out much during Covid, but with the community reopening, you can bet I'm counting the moments until I have this amazing French Toast again!!"
6/26/2021,20210626,5,4.2,This place is amazing I loveeee it so much the blueberry and lemon are the absolute best.Love this place for visitors my Nola fam came and absolutely fell in love with this
6/26/2021,20210626,5,4.2,It's BYOB and their food is ! I try to go everytime I'm in town. The wait list is there for a reason.
7/4/2021,20210704,5,4.2,batter & berries was topppppp tier!great servicegreat vibesgreat food!!worth every single moment
7/5/2021,20210705,3,4.2,The food was good...We traveled 25 minutes to get a table. The wait was 2 1/2 to 3 hours...We went to the zoo and got the call. It took 8 minutes to get back. We were asked to wait another 20 minutes.Once inside it took 10 minutes to get to order... then 1 hour to receive our food.What was once a fun breakfast opportunity at a black-owned restaurant turned into a four hour event.Again...the food was good but all good is good after 4 hours. We were starving! LolWon't be going again.
7/5/2021,20210705,5,4.2,"Had a layover and my first stop was batter and berries. So glad I was able to get there and experience the place. The food was just as good if not better than it looked on IG. The server Tim was great, honest and helped to pick out great choices. Glad to have had him and be able to eat comfortably without remorse. Can't wait to get back there to taste more of the menu.."
7/5/2021,20210705,1,4.2,"Didnt even get a chance to eat because something ""happened in the kitchen"". Visting from Atlanta and was excited about eating here. But oh well.Service didnt let us know what was going on until waisted almost an hour and thirty minutes for our food to never come.."
7/6/2021,20210706,1,4.2,Checked in for 2hrs on Yelp walked in to check in for our table she told us 20-30 more minutes and it's been an hourExcuse us kitchen is backed upIf that's the case close off tables !
7/9/2021,20210709,5,4.2,"Omg! Batter & Berries is so delicious!!! From the time I entered the restaurant and was greeted by the general manager I knew I was in good hands! Upon seating, we discovered out waiter was from our home town. How awesome is that?! Tim was pleasant, helpful and just a joy! This restaurant is a family environment, full of love and the food is AMAZING!!! I will be supporting every time I come to the city."
7/10/2021,20210710,1,4.2,The wait took 3 hours. When we were finally seated the waitress was nice however the food took a long time and each of our meals was delivered at a different time with one person waiting the longest and receiving the wrong order. No concessions were made.
7/12/2021,20210712,3,4.19,My order was fine. The servers was great. The only concern was they do not serve fountain drinks.
7/13/2021,20210713,5,4.19,"Food is always bomb! There's no other breakfast spot to compare. There will be a wait of typically an hour, but it definitely worth the wait. This is my spot if we talking about meeting for breakfast/brunch!"
7/15/2021,20210715,5,4.2,Simply delicious! The peach cobbler French toast will make you feel like you're in heaven. There is always a wait...but it is well worth it.
7/17/2021,20210717,3,4.19,"Visited this restaurant while in Chicago for a weekend on Saturday morning. My party arrived roughly 1.5 hours after it opened and waited nearly two hours. BYOB was an option so we brought items for Mimosas. The restaurant is small, no frills decor, but the service was good. The food was tasty, seasoned well except for the hash browns which needed quite a bit of salt and pepper. If the wait was shorter and the ambiance smoother I would give 4 stars."
7/17/2021,20210717,5,4.2,I waited for 2 hours to get in but the toast and food was fire OMG . It was worth the wait so just wait you won't regret it. Plus they have very nice waiters. Live it and definitely returning soon.
7/22/2021,20210722,5,4.2,The food was amazing and the service was phenomenal. Several folks recommended this place so this was the first restaurant I tried on my recent trip to Chicago. The French toast flight was amazing. I wish they had some sort of reservation system or at least call ahead seating because there was a long wait on a weekday morning but it was totally worth it. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area.
7/24/2021,20210724,5,4.2,"Highly recommend the French toast flight. Got here early Saturday morning, and there was no wait. When we left, there was a line. Great food and atmosphere."
7/24/2021,20210724,5,4.2,"My wife & Absolutely love this place. We follow them on IG and foam at the mouth over the good lol, so we try to come to Chicago one weekend out of the heat to indulge. The atmosphere is very busy and LOUD so be prepared. Also be prepared to wait a good amount of time if you don't get in line on the app. Staff is very friendly and inviting and also very accommodating. They offer ""community seating"" which I thought was kind weird during covid but hey, it's just me. The good is ALWAYS on point tho and it's a good overall experience. Parking is crazy too ."
7/25/2021,20210725,5,4.2,We love love the French Toast and the impossible sausage is very tasty! Will eat here anytime we are visiting. It is worth the wait
7/27/2021,20210727,4,4.2,Food was delicious and well worth the wait!The plating was beautiful. These pics were taken after we started eating. Would've given 5 stars but I found eggshells in the last couple of bites of my Benny (not pictured).
7/29/2021,20210729,5,4.2,"This place was a pleasant surprise. My friends and I are on our annual ""Girls Trip"" in Chicago. We decided to have breakfast/lunch at this place of business and to our pleasant surprise it was definitely a winner. The super flight was an excellent choice. No syrup needed because the flavors were awesome. To my surprise the blueberry toast was my favorite. Let's talk about the maple butter.... The butter had so much flavor I put a little on each bite. I would definitely recommend this place. Oh and Tim our server did a great job of taking care of us. Now we're ready to see what else Chi town has to offer."
8/1/2021,20210801,5,4.2,Food is always delicious and ready on time! The Carmel French toast is to die for and I LOVE the chicken Alfredo Omelet!!! Wish it is always on the menu!
8/5/2021,20210805,5,4.2,"The food and service did not disappoint! True to Chicago, parking is scarce but it was definitely worth the effort!! Caramel French Toast was to die for. I spilt mine with my daughter but I won't make that mistake again"
8/5/2021,20210805,5,4.2,"I definitely recommend joining the waitlist as the line is long, and rightfully so. The service was great and and French toast flight was worth it. Good prices and a welcoming ambiance."
8/8/2021,20210808,3,4.2,I gave it 3 stars. 5 for the food and 0 for the service. I took my teenagers and got there at 945 am. We were told it would take 1-1.5 hours for a table. we put our name down and did a couple errands. We came back an hour later and still had to wait 90 minutes. We were seated at 1215. I asked the host once we were seated how long it would take for the food. They said 15-30 minutes. It took over 45 minutes.  I understand that they were busy but they should have told us it would be 2.5 hours.  Ruined our morning.
8/9/2021,20210809,5,4.2,"Don't sleep on the French toast flight! Comes with 4 flavors - lemon, caramel, strawberry and blueberry. You can upgrade to add a 5th rotational flavor. Also ask for the hot sauce. Goes great on the potato hash and any egg dish."
8/12/2021,20210812,5,4.2,This food is amazing. Even when the chef was my high school teacher. A nice place to go with your loved ones or a first date this is the place to be. The staff will make you feel like you been there 20 times before and the food is great.
8/13/2021,20210813,3,4.2,"The wait to get in wasn't bad. About 20 minutes for 2 people. Service was okay, waitress kept us updated on what was going on. But the kitchen was extremely slow. Took about 45 minutes to get one persons food and an additional 5 minutes to get the other persons food. But came out hot and tasted good."
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.2,Tusiim is the best waiter in the business. His service and care for you is what makes him stand out. Now let's talk about the food. The food was killer! Everything was great. Let's keep it straight and simple. YOU MUST COME HERE NOW! However get here when they first open because there is always a wait.
8/14/2021,20210814,5,4.2,"This place is just phenomenal! Great food, personable service and cute little mimosa glasses to buy that you can take home! The specials are on point! Keep it up black owned restaurant!"
8/23/2021,20210823,5,4.2,This place was packed but so worth the wait. It's worth getting in the Yelp waitlist rather than standing outside- gives you the flexibility to do other things while waiting to be seated. The service was great considering our waitress has multiple tables one of which had 10+ people. Food was to die for. I ordered the Crab Cake Benny! Will definitely come back!!
8/25/2021,20210825,5,4.2,"I had red velvet French toast that was breathtaking, I thought it would be to sweet but it wasn't. My son had omelette with chicken breast broccoli and fettuccine sauce over it. It was delicious. Both items were suggested by a wonderful server Liam. We will definitely be back"
8/29/2021,20210829,2,4.2,I ordered on line and came 10 mins after the estimated time for pick up yet food wasn't ready but that was no big deal. Problem is the food was cold like it had just been sitting there in the back. The host asked me my name then avoided me or going in the back to check my order for 10 mins. If I have to wait l expect it to be for a good reason..food piping hot. Nope. Then it lack favor and looked/tasted 'rushed'. I'm over this support black business. I'll support those that give me value for my money.#sick of it
8/31/2021,20210831,5,4.2,"This food has no words!! It was so delish! Not only that, the service we received was outstanding!! I mean, the 1.5 hour wait was totally worth it! I had the French toast flights within bacon and hubby had sweet potato waffles & chicken-/ SUPER DELISH!! Sure would be nice if they open up a spot in Dallas!!"
9/5/2021,20210905,4,4.2,"WORTH THE WAIT!!! I ordered the French toast sampler to share (a must), scrambled eggs, and pancakes! Great food, a fun environment- my server, I wish I remembered his name, told my table riddles when he came to our table. Those little things made a big difference and truly bettered my eating experience! Absolutely must try if you're in Chicago (and have a few hours to spare) would've given 5 stars if they took reservations as I had to wait 2 hours for my table."
9/6/2021,20210906,5,4.2,I am on my way for a second time. Taking my sister from out of town. The food is to die for‼The staff is fabulous and so friendly. I don't mind the wait and can't wait to get some more of the delicious French Toast which is a favorite food of my sister. I hope she enjoys
9/7/2021,20210907,4,4.2,"The only reason this place isn't 5 stars is because of the service. Its not because of any of the servers or staff there, it's just that when we went they were short staffed. It was just my wife and I. We were seated and given water, then had to wait 15 minutes before someone came and took our order, and then it was another 25 minutes before our food came. Again, they were short staffed the day we went, so we expected longer than usual service. Just a warning for patrons in the near future. I got the French toast special flight and it was delicious. It was blueberry, strawberry, lemon, dulce de leche, and their weekly special. Each one has their own flavor and was different. Blueberry was my favorite, but they were all cooked perfectly and had great texture.Wife got the creole salmon special. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the salmon was seasoned incredibly and had amazing flavor. Their hash downs were delicious. Be sure to get their hot sauce. Very vinegary, and cuts through all the fat and sugar perfectly. The food was delicious. You could tell the entire waitstaff was stressed out. Just a reminder to be nice to your waitstaff folks! They're doing their best, mistakes do happen, and you yelling at them won't help the situation any."
9/8/2021,20210908,1,4.2,"Please do not ever ever ever go to Batter & Berries. I was so excited to come to Batter & Berries with my family that was in town visiting. I have some friends as well in my party of 8. The online waiting system does not allow you to take a place on line if your party is larger than 5 (which doesn't make sense) so you have to call to put your name down. I called immediately when they opened to be added to the queue. However the lady said, ""I don't know what's going on, I've had a long morning"". This is totally understandable however, this shouldn't affect your work and if you feel like it will, you should call out for the day. Anyway, they didn't put my name down and by the time I got there they said it would be a 30 minute wait. That was at 9:55 AM. When 10:25 came, I checked in with the host and they told me it would be another 20-30 minutes. That is so unprofessional. Anyways, that's not where it ends. Around 10:40 I went back I'm to check the status of the tables and they said they couldn't give me an exact time for the reservation. What in the world? So I asked for a manager. The host then went on to tell me, ""the manager is in the basement and unavailable to talk"". I asked to speak to whatever manager is available and then was told that the manager was still unavailable. No restaurant should have ""no manager"" available for customers to speak to. The manager never came... I was waiting outside for over an hour with a party of 8, and never got seated. We decided to leave and go to another place. This was easily the worst morning possible for my family and friends. Please do not EVER go to Batter & Berries. Michelle is the name of the hostess that worked with me that morning and Craig is the name of the manager that was supposedly on duty but never came up to speak with me. After over an hour, my family was not seated, never given an update on the wait time, never got to speak to a manager, and never got food. Please again never ever ever ever go to Batter & Berries. Please do not support their business. They don't deserve any type of business."
9/11/2021,20210911,2,4.2,"Batter & Barries is a known place that black professionals go to. I always hear the food is amazing,but expect a long wait. The long wait was out of control. Business owner in 2021 it's no reason why this business should not have a booking system. It's always busy so they have the budget. We went and were told It was a three hour wait. We went to the Zoo near by. We were told we had fifteen minutes to get back. We got back to the location within six minutes and the host argued with us we took longer, so we had to wait an additional 15 minutes. Not to mention, we had the phone call to prove the the time we arrived. So you're finally seated and you have to wait an hour for food. Seriously, a hour for French Toast? It doesn't take that long to make. The food was good, but all food is good after you've waited four hours and haven't eaten the entire day.. This food is not worth a four-hour wait."
9/12/2021,20210912,1,4.19,The woman at the host stand has no idea what she's doing. There's empty tables that need to be cleaned and are just sitting there meanwhile people are standing outside waiting for hours.
9/14/2021,20210914,5,4.2,The food is excellent. Service is great. I would advise getting yourself on the waiting list early. Wait times can be over 30 minutes.
9/15/2021,20210915,5,4.2,"Got the Brisket Hash and Super Flight of French Toast. Brisket hash was super unique, huge and SO filling. Ate my left overs for dinner. Definitely recommend getting the eggs scrambled... they hit different here. Super flight was also great - french toast was super soft and dense. Be aware, the wait might be an additional 1-2 hours AFTER you've checked in in-person. Worth it in my opinion, but plan ahead."
9/19/2021,20210919,5,4.2,Long wait but well worth it! Yummy food Got the French toast sampler and pepper shrimp omelet both 10/10!!
9/19/2021,20210919,5,4.2,"This place is a must try, excellent breakfast, friendly staff and great service. Nothing disappointed and if I lived in Chicago I would be here nearly every day! Thank you guys for a flavorful food experience! Five stars"
9/20/2021,20210920,3,4.2,"Thankfully we were able to get in line through Yelp, as I would've regretted waiting for an hour plus otherwise. We were seated within a few minutes of checking in after having been in line for about 70-75 minutes. Unfortunately from there, it took another 10 min to get glasses of water and another 5 min before our waitress greeted us. The team was friendly in general, but the different periods of waiting were a little rough. The ""We're Movin On Up"" Executive dish was pretty solid and very filling, but the sauce that was used in the dish definitely didn't taste very breakfast/brunch-friendly. It kinda threw the rest of the dish off a bit. Having seen a lot of pictures of the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof) dish in other reviews, I had fairly high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it ended up being the most disappointing of the dishes. The hot sauce flavor of the chicken was actually very tasty, but was overshadowed by the almost burnt texture and dry taste of the breading/chicken itself. The Caramel French Toast was the highlight of the meal, and adding some cut up bananas/strawberries made it even better. The food in general was good, but between that, the insane wait times, and the average service, I don't see myself coming back."
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.2,"We were up early on a Saturday morning and I had the idea to head over to the ever-busy Batter & Berries in Lincoln Park! We arrived around 8:45 and had about a 20-30 minute wait. Definitely get here early to avoid the crowd and wait that is to come (even 8:45 isn't early enough!).The interior is not much -- but we didn't come for that! What really set Batter & Berries apart was the food and the service. Our server, Timothy, was a freaking ray of sunshine. You could tell he was happy to be there and excited to tell us about the menu. It was my husbands first time, so we HAD to start with the French toast flight. This is another one of those things that looks a little unassuming but the flavors....wow. I honestly can't decided a favorite, we kept taking bites wide-eyed but then would move onto the next one and be equally excited. The butter is maple syrup infused and perfect.For my meal, I went a little out of my wheelhouse and ordered the cluck n gaufre; a batter & berries twist on the traditional chicken & waffles. The waffle is a sweet potato waffle and is served with a fried chicken breast that is covered in a nutmeg hot sauce. The flavor on the chicken breast was out of this world good! Hot, but also warm & spicy from the nutmeg. Paired with the sweet potato waffle, I was in heaven. My husband got the biscuits and gravy and I swear I've never seen him so happy. The hashbrowns that came with his meal were also incredible. When he finished eating he said ""I wish once a year Yelp let you give a place 6 stars. This would that spot for me"". Timothy even brought him over his favorite hot sauce to eat the biscuits and gravy with. We loved our experience at B&B and will absolutely be back!"
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.2,"Cute little breakfast/brunch spot! Came on a Tuesday morning at about 9:45 and had no wait for a table of 2 but there was a line of people waiting by the time we left like an hour later. Menu is very unique, seems like they are most known for their French toast which looked amazing on the table next to us. They have daily specials and a unique french toast flavor each week. We ordered the chicken & waffles and the breakfast wrap, both were very good! Parking is paid in front generally, staff was friendly, food/drink was good and fast... would def go back to try more of the menu!"
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.2,"First timer, the wait was about 1.5 hours long but so so worth it. It's BYOB, so bring the champagne for the mimomos, but the main event, the food;Incredible, french toast flight sucker punched my taste buds and got me ready for the daily special.A Cajun salmon Benny, and leme tell you I wish I ate it slower, it was so good I couldn't help but practically inhale it. Came with a hearty side of cheesy hash browns. Overall an incredible experience if your looking for the best no frills brunch in Chicago."
9/21/2021,20210921,5,4.2,"Where to begin? Well, let's start with our server Darwin Tapia!!! Amazing!!!! Such a gracious server, it seemed as if the restaurant belonged to him! I would come back just to sit a his table. From the sashimi, oysters, filet, Chilean sea bass that melted in your mouth, delectable, every bite was a beautiful harmony, the filet was seasoned perfectly, the sides to die for! The lobster mashed potatoes, the asparagus, the au gratin potatoes, spinach was cooked to perfection. Thank you so much for making Our moms birthday enjoyable! It was my first time in Chicago and i will be back to eat at your establishment. If you've never been please treat yourself , so worth it! I didn't even mention the signature drinks..... go to Eddie V's and have a drink!"
9/21/2021,20210921,2,4.2,"The wait for this restaurant is easily 45mins to 4 hours on any given day so with that I was expecting it to live up to the hype but honestly the food was okay. I had the sweet potato waffle and chicken. My chicken was over fried and dry, the waffle was just okay and there was no substitute for a regular waffle which was odd given the name is BATTER & Berries. The coffee was expensive but was below speedway coffee quality in taste. I would not return nor wait any more than 15 minutes to eat here. Our server was really nice and timely."
9/23/2021,20210923,5,4.2,Food is delicious i usually get the caramel French toast and the streak executive but i suggest you get there earlier when they open or you will probably have a long wait time but the food is Definitely worth it
9/24/2021,20210924,4,4.2,"There was a long wait on the weekend plus the waitlist was closed, so just be prepared to hang out for a while! Luckily there are some nice coffee shops and parks in the area. I felt that the food was worth the wait. I recommend getting a French Toast Super Flight--great for sharing with a friend. The Super Flight includes 4 original flavors plus the flavor of the week! When we went, it was orange liquor. Each flavor was unique, and it was hard to rank them! I'd have to say my favorite were the caramel and lemon though.As for the place itself, it was quite busy and short staffed. The staff definitely work super hard, and our service was surprisingly quick.Just a heads up that the bathroom was also kinda gross.. Other than that worth a shot!"
9/25/2021,20210925,5,4.2,"Delicious breakfast/brunch! We ordered the Green City Omelet, the Traditional, and a half order of strawberry French toast. All amazing; demolished quickly. Great oat milk latte, too. We went on a Friday morning around 9:30AM and walked right in. Very friendly staff. Will be back!"
9/26/2021,20210926,5,4.2,"I love that this restaurant has a waitlist instead of reservations. They are prompt and friendly! I loved the server!!! He had us wanting everything on the menu!! The food was delicious! It's a small restaurant but the vibe and atmosphere is family friendly, fun and lively!!!!"
9/26/2021,20210926,5,4.2,"OMG from the service to the food, everything was fantastic. When I arrived, I had to get on the waitlist. The place was packed and now I know why. The weather is beautiful so I spent time walking around the local area while waiting. The manager, Michelle, greeted me outside and walked me to my table. Another employee brought me water immediately after I sat down. Shortly after that, my extraordinary server Tusiime arrived. He was very upbeat and animated while going over the menu and specials for the day. I ordered my food and prepared to wait. Little did I know, my expert was just beginning. Tusiime returned to the table and advised that everyone has to solve a riddle. He gave me two, which I solved btw! My food arrived and I was not at all disappointed. The caramel French toast came topped with candied walnuts, homemade rum butter and a few sprinkles of powdered sugar. I almost asked for syrup, but I'm so glad I didn't. No syrup was necessary! It was perfect. I ordered a side of bacon with my french toast, but barely touched it because I couldn't stop eating the French toast. If you're looking for a cute, fun place to enjoy some delicious good, Batter & Berries is the place for you."
9/27/2021,20210927,5,4.2,"The absolute best French Toast I have ever had in my life. My server was very pleasant. I had the steak, eggs and hash browns... delicious. Steak was very tender and the sauce that it is served with was amazing. Please go and support this local treasure!!"
10/5/2021,20211005,4,4.2,I am a fan of batter and berries. From the moment you walk in you feel like you're home. Everyone is so friendly and they genuinely look like they enjoy serving you.I took my mom here for her first time. She got the flight of French toast. The special was a brownie kalua. She enjoyed it.I was feeling basic so I went with the grilled cheese. It was like a grilled cheese on Steriods. Wish they served more of the Tomato paste. The OJ is freshly squeezed and the coffee I strong.They have street Parking and the wait during the week wasn't long. However on the weekend I have waited up to an hour.Only complaint was that the server gave us our check as soon as our food arrived. Didn't even allow for us to add anything and just felt rushed.
10/5/2021,20211005,5,4.2,"As a college student in the Lincoln Park area, my friends & I have found that this is a perfect place for brunch (especially after a night out). The waffles I got--the blueberry Belgian (I think)--were delicious. Great service, too. Will definitely be back. Thank you!!!"
10/8/2021,20211008,5,4.2,"DELICIOUS! Great service and atmosphere, it was a little small but that didn't do anything to the appeal it's a great spot for breakfast, Brunch or lunch. They have phenomenal flavorful specials and the French toast is definitely a must try. I put this on my to do list when I'm in Chicago! See you soon ;)"
10/11/2021,20211011,4,4.2,"HOT TIP - check in online for a reservation BEFORE you get there to avoid the long wait (even on a weekday).We got there and the wait was about 30 mins, they send you a text when your table is ready. Our waiter Tim was a doll, but our order got a bit screwed up. No big deal. We shared our French toast flight (and upgraded to the brownie toast of the day - which actually was our least favorite flavor of the 5 pieces) - I liked the lemon and then the pecan ones the best. There was no shortage of butter. It was definitely good, and we finished every bite, but if anyone wants their mind actually blown away by French toast - go to Nopa in San Francisco for their custard french toast at brunch, I think there is even a recipe for it online. The definition of ""decedent""!When our second entree came we split that too. It was the beef hash on top of cheesy hash browns, with a smokey/coffee sauce (requested on the side as I m not a coffee lover) - in the end, you could not taste the coffee -- it was more of a slow-cooked red wine taste to me. My quibble would be that the hash browns should have been requested crispy as they were pale and flaccid - Though not lacking in cheese! The beef was slow-cooked, tender, flavorful AND plentiful.The owner seems very involved and was chatting up several customers. Great Neighborhood place and I can tell why they are busy,The bathrooms could use a bit of love and cleanin"
10/14/2021,20211014,4,4.2,"The food was excellent.... The wait... painful. Unfortunately the wait after we were seated was unreasonably long. Our waiter was a pure delight, telling corny jokes and genuinely connecting with us. Our son attends college in Chicago and we had tried to get in before...hopefully they fix the wait issues which had to be in the kitchen."
10/15/2021,20211015,1,4.2,I went on this app to get on the waiting list 2 hours before we arrived. After getting there the energy was kinda off. I told the host that I did the waitlist and he couldn't find me. Even before someone spoke a waiter just looked at us without saying anything... I'm new to the city but I'll pass on this one...
10/15/2021,20211015,5,4.2,The service and food are both outstanding! I dine alone quite often and I truly appreciate how welcoming the staff is (some places act like it is an inconvenience to seat one person). The strawberry French toast is out of this world delicious.
10/16/2021,20211016,5,4.2,Food is always BOMB! Service is fun. Food comes out hot and quick and you can BYOB. Can't ask for more than that!
10/18/2021,20211018,1,4.2,My entire family waited for an hour and watching everyone around us getting their food. Comes to find out our order NEVER was sent to the kitchen! My coffee didn't even make it to the table. I'm sure the food is good but the service today was absolutely horrid. Left and never looking back here.
10/20/2021,20211020,5,4.2,"Visiting near the area and this was one of the brunch places that caught my eye as I was walking past. A long line must be a good indicator right?? Well lucky us, we went on a random weekday and got seated within 5 minutes. Let me tell you, the batter in their name does not disappoint. The batter had a perfect crunch and season to it that also kept the juices in the meats. Their plates were unique, their service was fast and efficient, and people were nice and friendly. So happy we stopped by!Local Family owned Black owned business"
10/20/2021,20211020,5,4.2,The French toast flight is to die for!!!! Sooooooo good! I highly recommend adding your name to the waiting list BEFORE arrival. The restaurant is on the small size and it's a very popular restaurant.
10/23/2021,20211023,1,4.2,"Post Pandemic this place is AWEFUL!!! Used to love it but it's fallen off the map beyond belief. Waited 2 hours to get our table which I had no problem with. Ordered biscuits and gravy, they brought out biscuits in a cup of milk with parsley flakes.... Even the server had to double back and apologize however they refused to take it off our bill.... Spoke with the manager who agreed and apologized that the meal was inedible but again would not take it off of our bill. If anyones for has any black owned brunch recos in chicago that care about their quality of their food/guest experience please let me know. Will happily never be return here again!"
10/23/2021,20211023,5,4.2,"Wow! I got one of the specials which was the lobster executive and it was delicious. It can with eggs, hash browns with cheese and fried lobster on top. The loathed was cooked perfectly. There were also quite a few sauces available which I put on the hash browns. They were all extremely flavorful and delicious. The line here was long. You can get added to the waitlist ahead of time but the estimate was still way off for us so be prepared to wait."
10/26/2021,20211026,3,4.2,"Different strokes for different folks. I feel this place is overrated. I've had better. Well let's start with that over an hour wait. It was a chilly Chicago afternoon and considering the place is so small, there's no where to wait inside. So we took our long walk back down the street to the car to begin our wait. I really wanted to try this restaurant but my stomach wanted to stop at another restaurant. Our table is finally ready. Well, now it's lunch time. So I can't decide if I want breakfast or lunch. So I opt for both. I order a single Carmel French toast, a chicken sandwich with fries and a shrimp omelet special. Ok, so the chicken sandwich was mediocre but it was good enough to eat. The fries were yummy!! The Carmel French toast was really good!! It was almost like eating a dessert. So it was great after a chicken sandwich meal. Now, this omelet special, boy oh boy. I ordered this off that daily special menu and ordered it to go so I can have it later for dinner. It was a folded egg white with a smidgen of bell peppers, onions and spinach on the side!! Like a sprinkle. I could have counted them. Then there were 3 tiny, extremely small, shriveled pieces of shrimp chilling on top served with a side of hash brown. But I didn't notice this horrible food choice until I got alllll the way home and I'm about 45 minutes away from this place. So imagine my disappointment. It was a total waste of over 20 bucks. Because it went in the trash. When I think omelet, I think a generous amount of ingredients inside of the folded egg. I guess you should just go here for what they're known for, French toast. I probably won't return because I live so far away."
10/27/2021,20211027,4,4.2,The food is fresh and delicious . The waiters are great. The only issue I really have is that the establishment is too small! There was an instance where people were waiting to be seated and so they were standing right by my table for at least 10 or 15 minutes which was very uncomfortable .
10/27/2021,20211027,3,4.19,After all of the rave reviews I really wanted to like this place. Cute quaint breakfast spot that has the promise of good food. My first visit I was told the wait was over 2 hours. I was there the next day within 15 minutes of opening and waited about an hour. Ordered the French toast flight and it came cold. This is the last thing I expect from a restaurant with a wait that needs to quickly turn tables and food out of the kitchen. Asked to have it reheated and it came back AGAIN cold. Wasn't even warm enough to melt the butter. My waitress came back to ask if it was ok 15 minutes later. After I explained (with a full plate) no it was still cold she shrugged and just took it away. Didn't remove the charge or anything. I wouldn't return or recommend due to lack of good food quality/service.
10/29/2021,20211029,5,4.19,This was the best french toast i have ever had in my life. The variety is a chefs kiss
11/1/2021,20211101,4,4.19,"I've been wanting to try this place for the longest. My opportunity final came when a friend invited me to breakfast. We visited during the week and their was no wait at all. However she arrived before me and they wouldn't seat her until I got there and she had to wait in her car, this is the only reason they aren't getting 5 stars. The food and service was great. I had the French Toast Flight, cheesy hashbrowns and chicken sausage patties. So delicious! Kinda pricey for breakfast, but very enjoyable."
11/2/2021,20211102,5,4.2,The blueberry French toast was soooo bomb and whatever they put in that butter you do not need syrup. I also had the veggie omelette. I would definitely recommend and go back. The customer service is great as well.
11/2/2021,20211102,5,4.2,"First time visiting this little gem and it was well worth it. I got the Peach & Stout (I think that's the name of the dish), which was accompanied with eggs and a side order of the caramel apple French toast. Everything tasted fresh and delicious!! The establishment doesn't currently have a liquor license, so they are unable to sell, but do offer a BYOB service should you want mimosas with your meal. Top notch service from start to finish. Highly recommend!"
11/5/2021,20211105,1,4.19,This spot ain't it . The restaurant is run down and dirty. I had the salmon Benny and it was over cooked and flavorless. Need remodeling and new chefs. Maybe if I was drinking it would be good !
11/6/2021,20211106,5,4.19,AMAZING food!! The French toast flight was so delicious and I usually don't even order French toast
11/6/2021,20211106,5,4.19,Top notch service and food. Worth the wait and definitely a fun treat for out of town guests. Will always recommend this place for breakfast/brunch.
11/7/2021,20211107,5,4.2,"Been trying to get in here for ages! There's always a line no matter how early you arrive, so be sure to get on the waitlist via Yelp! to reduce your wait time outside. There are so many great things to say about this restaurant I'll try not to bore you. BYOB! Just order your juice to get a great mimosa going with your breakfast. I'm not too big on French toast but the flight was so good, I ordered an second plate to take home for my son. The maple syrup butter was a great compliment to the toast. The flight was a great way to get a sampling of all of the French toast options as they all sounded good & the flight did not disappoint. He ordered the pepper shrimp omelette, even though he cannot stand anything remotely spicy, the great news is, he didn't taste a bit of spice. The ""pepper"" was just an ode to the bell peppers that were used. This was an egg white omelette, that was so light & fluffy, served with shredded hash browns with cheese. Excellent dish, he didn't leave a bite behind & was watching me closely as I grabbed a bite of the omelette. I ordered the Fried Lobster Executive which was served with 2 eggs your style, & shredded hash browns with cheese. The seafood delivered to our table was executed flawlessly, I only wished I had more. The sauce that came with my lobster was a beautiful compliment to the dish as well. The service was spot on, consistent check ins without being pushy. Can't wait to visit again."
11/9/2021,20211109,5,4.2,"This is such a wonderful establishment. The staff was friendly, the wait was 10-20mins, clean and delicious food. Our waiter made recommendations that I normally wouldn't take but he was so convincing and it was definitely a great recommendation. I had the special pumpkin cheesecake french toast with the cheesy hash browns (you have to try it with hot sauce). The food was so delicious there's no need to add salt, pepper or even syrup to your dish."

It's delicious and that, along with our friendly waiter, were the highlights of our mid-week, 11 am brunch and what earned the 3 stars. Otherwise, it might have been an off-day for the chef: my over easy eggs were undercooked (visible raw egg white) and the cheesy hash browns were tasty but only lukewarm. My dining partner wanted some gravy with her sweet potato chicken waffle, but they were out of gravy. Otherwise, the waffle was tasty. I can see the potential here and I would be interested to try this breakfast place again, if I were in the area (but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way)."

Otherwise, it might have been an off-day for the chef: my over easy eggs were undercooked (visible raw egg white) and the cheesy hash browns were tasty but only lukewarm. My dining partner wanted some gravy with her sweet potato chicken waffle, but they were out of gravy. Otherwise, the waffle was tasty. I can see the potential here and I would be interested to try this breakfast place again, if I were in the area (but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way)."
11/15/2021,20211115,5,4.2,The french toast flight was incredible! The service is great! Definitely recommend checking this place out.

11/20/2021,20211120,5,4.2,It's honestly one the best places for french toast!It can be pricey so expect to spend over $15
11/21/2021,20211121,3,4.2,"Honestly, I don't get the hype. If you don't get on the waitlist, you're essentially never getting a table. And the food maybe just isn't my bag. Last time we were there our server was very clearly on his way out for the day and it seemed like it was a burden for us to be there. Plenty of good breakfast places in the city, probably won't be back if I have my say."

11/23/2021,20211123,5,4.2,The French toast flight was amazing and our waitress was super helpful and sweet. The place was super busy with a long wait so make sure to get on their waitlist so you know you won't have to wait long.
11/27/2021,20211127,4,4.2,"I tried to order order caramel french toast . To be to be honest this is the best food ever taste it in butter and berries . The caramel french toast that cost $12.75 is good and very satisfying food for me , I like it very much it is enough for me for my everyday meal . The shape , the color and the texture was perfectly . I also ordered southern crab cakes benny , it looks like yummy . The crab is totally cook , the topped was perfectly presentable you really love this food i recommended it to my friend to eat in butter and berries i tell that this is the best toast ever , so try it , cant wait to come back again here ."
11/27/2021,20211127,5,4.2,"By far, the best breakfast/brunch restaurant in Chicago. Never disappoints. Service is always stellar, just like the food."
11/28/2021,20211128,5,4.2,"Batter & Berries is one of my favorite breakfast places in the city! The food is always so good and the service is excellent. I always order the french toast flight. Depending on what the weekly special french toast is, I might order the super flight. They get very busy. Recently, we arrived ten minutes after they opened and I think there were only two tables left. I recommend arriving early. There's a coffee shop down the street if you find yourself with a longer wait."
11/28/2021,20211128,5,4.2,"Great food overall, just wish they had a bigger space. It defly gets really crowded inside. But would recommend to first time comers!"
11/30/2021,20211130,5,4.2,This place was so yummy!!! Literally the best gravy I have ever had in my life. Also my friend and I got the super French toast flight as an appetizer which is totally the move!!!! Our waiter tusimee was hilarious as well. Always had a joke to make us laugh when he came by our table. A must!!!
12/1/2021,20211201,5,4.2,"Wait time is a little long, depending on how busy. The food was amazing, staff was very friendly, anything we asked the provided."
12/5/2021,20211205,5,4.2,"This place is AMAZING!!!!!! From the food that was phenomenal to the staff that was just as impressive! On our second day in Chicago we came to Batter and Berries because it was highly recommended by friends. From the moment we sat down is was one of the more memorable experiences i have ever had at a restaurant! Naidene who was our server on the first night was just such a pleasure to deal with. She continuously checked back on us and had amazing suggestions! Chef Ken was the real gem of the restaurant however, my partner was wearing an orange coat and the connection was instant! Chef Ken chatted with us multiple times, he really made our experience here worth all the hype! We had such an amazing time that i thought to myself ""let's go again just in case it was a fluke"" ..... it wasn't. The very next day we came back and everything was just as amazing ! I will forever recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Chicago !"
12/6/2021,20211206,1,4.2,"Came here for my birthday lunch , waited over 15 minutes to even be greeted with waters ... after ordering our food , it did come out pretty quickly , but as soon as I look down I see a thick black hair in my food ( I am blonde ) . I pulled the food runner aside to let him know ... not once was I apologized to , not once did someone come and check on us ... I never look for a free handout considering I'm a server , but after no apology I would assume they would discount the check ... but to my surprise full price and no apology , will not be coming back"
12/9/2021,20211209,1,4.2,"I HATE that I have to leave even 1 star because the server & his service was so Terrible. His name tag & receipt said "" Timothy S."" & he wore his braids wrapped around the top of his head. He didn't want to answer any questions & my guests & I had to ask other people in the restaurant for some more water, napkins, salt & pepper & butter while he stood on the other side of the counter talking to co-workers. We were going to go down the street to the Golden Nugget for breakfast but I said let's try something New. I now realize I made a mistake unfortunately. We will NOT be back."
12/12/2021,20211212,5,4.2,"My husband and I went on a Monday morning, away from the long lines and long wait. The service was excellent, the waiter explained the menu items with such detail and made everything sound so appetizing. We had the cheese omelette with sausage gravy and bourbon French toast with candied pecans. This food is NOT diet friendly. You are here to indulge and enjoy every calorie guilt free. We would definitely go again if we are in town. Loved it!"
12/13/2021,20211213,5,4.2,"Absolutely LOVE this place! Every time I visit Chicago this is a MUST stop for me! My favorite item to order is the French toast flight and every time I visit there's always an amazing flavor to try! The service is impeccable, their tea selection is great, (so many options!) What a great experience! Definitely a must try!"
12/18/2021,20211218,4,4.2,"I ordered the french toast flight the first time I went and also the 2 eggs meal with bacon and hash browns the second time. The food is good, but the portions are a bit small and the food is a little pricey compared other breakfast place in the area. The staff and the coffee is very good though."
12/19/2021,20211219,5,4.2,"Absolute game-changer. If you haven't been, GO. The French toast is so amazing and is what they are known for -- TRULY a must-have!"
12/19/2021,20211219,5,4.2,Nice spot to eat and chill for a little bit. Love lamb chops with the eggs . Definitely something to look forward too
12/19/2021,20211219,5,4.2,Amazing ! Best breakfast in Chicagoland .... Hands down . I've been going here since they opened ! Flight of French toast
12/21/2021,20211221,5,4.2,"I love driving in to the city just to stop here to eat. Worth the drive every time. There's always a wait but you expect that from a place with good eats! Great service, as always! Can't wait until next time!"
12/26/2021,20211226,5,4.2,"Visited for the first time on a Chicago trip. It was delicious, glad to support a black owned restaurant"
12/27/2021,20211227,5,4.2,"The fact that my friend made a point for us to wake our hungover asses up early on a Monday morning to beat the crowd says a lot about how much foot traffic this place gets, no matter what day of the week it is.Of course we slept in for another hour.By the time we arrived at around 10-11ish, it was still about a 30-minute wait for the both of us. Hangovers and waiting don't go together, either. But the area had some cute enough places for us to grab some coffee (plugging in Coffee Lab & Roasters, which is AAPI-owned) while we waited and my friend is almost never wrong about good food, so I trust her.Once we were handed the menus, hoooo boy, I really wished there were 1 or 2 more of us to share the dishes with. I'm not much of a brunch fan in general unless there's something extraordinary apart from the usual $25 avo toast and eggs, but I had never wanted to devour everything from a menu--everything skeptically sounded amazing to be true. But sadly, we don't have an appetite of a sumo wrestler, so we had to decide very carefully on 2-3 dishes. There is no way that you can even come here without getting their infamous Super Flight Toast--like...don't even bother coming here at all if you're gonna flight it. They were all fantastic, but my favorite is probably a tie between the lemon and the special Kahlua brownie. The Lobster Executive was fantastic. The batter was perfectly crispy and they had already deshelled it so that you won't look like a slob sucking to get the meat out.I underestimated the heaviness of the food and if we ordered a third dish, we probably would've made it obvious that we were trashed and hungover and puked everything (we wanted the food to stay in our stomachs) out. Nadine waited on us and was awesome enough to thoroughly explain the specials and gave us her honest opinion on how much food we should keep it at. The price point is a little on the more expensive side, but at least you won't be paying for some basic-bitch ""open-faced toast topped with poached eggs and a side of arugula""!Also (and not to get political), this place is Black-owned and you can definitely feel the warmth of the community flowing within the restaurant--one of the owners was walking around talking to customers and made us feel so welcome. I probably won't wake my ass early enough to come here (or for any place, really) the next time, hungover or not, but I don't mind getting on the waitlist and having the incentive to check out the other shops nearby."
12/27/2021,20211227,5,4.2,Took my sister for post holiday brunch. Smothered chicken omelet was to ie for. Beautifully seasoned gravy. Worth the short wait.
12/27/2021,20211227,5,4.2,The food is amazing. I'm not a sweets person so I got the fried lobster and had dish... amazing! I tried a bit of my friends French toast and that was also perfection. Brought my family here when they visited and now they're obsessed too!
1/1/2022,20220101,5,4.2,"The food was amazing! Highly recommend the flight of French toast. The specials are all very good, but I also loved the chicken and biscuits and gravy and the louisiane brisket brunch! Our server, Jordan, was great as well!"
1/7/2022,20220107,5,4.2,The French toast flight was so good and it's BYOB! Our server was great I wish I could remember his name. He tells you riddles and he makes your experience great
1/8/2022,20220108,2,4.2,"Disappointed. Beside the fact that the delivery itself was an hour late, The omelet was supposed to come with herb stuffed but it's just American cheese slices..didn't get any chicken pieces just brown mush"
1/14/2022,20220114,4,4.2,"Been here once. There was an awesome server who gave jokes every time he checked up on us. Support this place. It's always busy which is a testament to how good the food is, too"
1/17/2022,20220117,5,4.2,"The food was awesome!! I have never tasted French toast so delicious! The lobster, OMG! Everything even the darn coffee!! The waiter was great, friendly and attentive!!"
1/19/2022,20220119,5,4.2,"Love, love ,loved the experience and the staff at batter and berries. I took my fiancé and nieces on a brunch date and it was more than a success. The food was amazing and our waitress was very polite, knowledgeable and attentive the whole time. I recommend this establishment."
1/29/2022,20220129,3,4.2,"Here is the thing. I love supporting a Black-owned business, and I think you should eat here. I know they're known for their French toast, and I didn't get that. Which might be why I just didn't think it was worth the hype. Which could just be me! Try it anyways! Make up your own mind! But the coffee wasn't great and the hash browns were super undercooked. Totally could have just been an off day. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1/30/2022,20220130,5,4.2,"We had the most pleasant and delicious family breakfast at Batter & Berries! As a family we do not have much time together during the week, so our breakfasts on Sunday mornings are precious. We've been to many breakfast restaurants in Chicago and the Chicagoland area over the past 10 years. Service at Batter & Berries was outstanding from the time we walked in to the time we exited. Toseeme was our server and his sense of humor just made our time as a family even more special. The food was outstanding and had a variety of daily specials. The french toast was a crowd pleaser as Toseeme suggested it as an appetizer of 4 different flavors (Oreo, lemon, strawberry n blueberry). The beef brisket hash and chicken n sweet potato waffle(Cluck n Goof) were some of the unique, tasty dishes we ordered..have yet to try the braised short rib. This restaurant is now the restaurant that we will be comparing others to as it has become our good standard"
1/31/2022,20220131,5,4.2,"So! 6 of my girlfriends and I came to visit after a reservation to another black-owned reservation was canceled unreasonably. The manager allowed us to join last minute. He was very patient and accommodating. You would have thought the staff would have been rushing us out and making us feel unwelcome, but that was far from what we experienced! Everyone was delightful, fun and professional! And don't let me get into the food! I had the short rib and it was SENSATIONAL! There was not one to-go box needed, because we all enjoyed our food so so so so so much! I haven't been in years, but I have fallen in love with this restaurant all over again and will be back to join with others soon! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
2/7/2022,20220207,5,4.2,"Every time I come Chicago I have to come to Batter and Berries. The French toast is so good I don't even need the syrup. If you want mimosas you will have bring your own champagne, and they will provide the juice. The only thing I do not like is the way they split the bill if you have a large party (it was 9 of us). That is not a problem with this restaurant in particular because it happened at couple of other restaurants we went to over the weekend. We resolved the issue by send sending money via Cash App to one person."
2/8/2022,20220208,5,4.2,"This place is not perfect, but I can't help but love it. Casual environment, long waits, daily specials, and energetic service. The food is creative for a casual brunch spot, maybe slightly under seasoned/developed for my taste, but always cooked well. BYOB if you buy juice is a cool plus too. I could nitpick, but I honestly just enjoy it whenever I dine here."
2/9/2022,20220209,1,4.2,"I really wanted to love my visit to Batter and Berries. I have been hearing about it for quite a while and all the comments were great. So, I decided to use a birthday invitation to trek from my side of town, the great south side, to the north....just to partake of what I hoped would be a breakfast to remember. Sadly, it is a breakfast that I will soon forget and sorry I wasted a free birthday breakfast at this establishment. First impression, the place is not much to look at, no appeal to the food senses when you walk in the door. Very stark and cafeteria like, but I assumed that the warmth and love would be in the meal. It was not. I ordered the short ribs, which came with cheddar cheese hash browns. The short ribs were tender though there was lot of fat. The hash brown were cold, and I think they measured the portions with a tablespoon. I don't like eggs, so my birthday sponsor took those, yep they were cold. I have to say the tea was absolutely delicious and my server was right on point with his recommendation.  My friend had pancakes with the eggs which she stated were not memorable. The icing on the cake was the manager/owner who was a middle-aged man sitting not far from our table. While we were removing our coats, we gave him a good morning. We received a side eye over a mask, so we left that alone. Turns out the system was down, and they could only take cash.  We were told that AFTER we had eaten. My feeling about good customer service, let us know before we sit down as we had to go through all of our pockets and put together all of our change in order to pay the bill. Everyone does not carry cash! And as the owner/manager I would have visited every table checking on the food and apologizing for the inconvenience, but that's just my way of doing business. Our server was wonderful especially in light of the fact that because we didn't have a lot of cash, his tip was not reflective of his service, we apologized for that. Cold food, small portions and no ambience.....never again. I will go to Waffles, or stay south and give my money to L&G on Torrence (great portions), Peaches or Chicago Chicken and Waffles."
2/13/2022,20220213,2,4.2,"We ordered takeout this morning and it was pretty bad. My breakfast sandwich didn't have any cheese, nor did our side of ""cheesy hash browns""... they were also completely undercooked so we had to throw them on the stove for 10 minutes. They were completely unseasoned too, so it was as if we were working with raw shredded potatoes. Eggs weren't seasoned at all on the sandwich or in the traditional breakfast my sister got.This place is always packed so maybe we just ordered the wrong things."
2/14/2022,20220214,5,4.2,"Nothing bad to say! Pancakes were amazing, service was great, and owner was the bruhz! It's a win! I wasn't a fan of the wait time but it was worth it!"
2/16/2022,20220216,4,4.2,"This place has a LONG wait , so make sure to get a reservation ! The waiter was incredible , super friendly and energetic guy. Definitely one of the better breakfast spots I have been to in Chicago. The prices are high but the quality of the food follows. The French toast flight is a nice platter to share or eat on your own ! I wish the sizes were just a tad bigger but other than that, very solid spot! Also love supporting my black businesses"
2/18/2022,20220218,5,4.2,Phenomenal food and service! Had the French toast flight and crab cake Benedict. Felt like I was in New Orleans. Server was great and took time to make recommendations. Must try.
2/21/2022,20220221,2,4.2,"There's a good idea to every menu item. I just think the execution has started to faulted over the years. I'm not sure if chefs have changed, but the delivery isn't up to par."
2/27/2022,20220227,5,4.2,"Great service, great food. I came in at about 9:30 wanting a table for two and only had to wait 15 minutes when I expected it to be way longer. Given how busy it was, we were served relatively fast as well. I got the strawberry pancakes which were delicious and my dad got the spinach omelette which was also amazing. Highly recommend if you're in the area!!"
3/1/2022,20220301,5,4.2,The service is great and the food is even better! The restaurant itself is a bit small so make sure you make reservations since it is limited seating!
3/1/2022,20220301,4,4.2,"The French toast is delicious!! Also got the deconstructed omelette, not understanding what that meant Lmaoo, but it was still good."
3/3/2022,20220303,5,4.2,"Delicious food! It's a bit busy so if you can reserve a table a couple days before, that would be smart. But it's worth the wait"
3/5/2022,20220305,4,4.2,"I enjoyed my meal at Batter and Berries. I didn't expect much of the local neighborhood spot but was very much delighted at how good the meal was--in fact I didn't even make time to take a picture! I ordered The Traditional which came with two eggs, a side of bacon, french toast and cheese crusted hash browns. The french toast was paired with toasted pecans drizzled in carmel sauce. To my surprise, the french toast wasn't soggy and had great flavor with a hint of cinnamon. The cheese crusted hash browns were good also. They weren't mushy nor cooked al dente, but crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think if Batter and Berries had grits on the menu I would go more often.If you're planning a visit don't expect to walk right up and get a table. Either allot time to wait in line or head there closer towards when they open as they tend to fill up quickly and the restaurant is pretty small, especially the front entrance area."
3/6/2022,20220306,5,4.2,I'm a Chicagoan and had never been there. It was a totally amazing experience. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Next time we will bring champagne to make mimosas! We will definitely be back soon!
3/7/2022,20220307,4,4.2,"Huge buzz for such a small space. Got here around 11 on a Sunday and had 26 folks ahead of us. Waited it out at a local coffee shop which I didn't mind. I really wanted to see what the fuss was about regarding this french toast. Got in when my table was ready and seated promptly, the waiter was really nice, had some cool riddles to tell and ensured we were comfortable. All the staff was really nice honestly. I ordered the steak and eggs and French toast flight. Food was amazing and came out fast and fresh. I'll be coming back during an off peak time to get seated more quickly."
3/9/2022,20220309,5,4.2,"Best breakfast in the area. No question. If you have the chance to go, be ready for a long wait as they are always busy but a wait that is worth every minute. Amazing place."
3/12/2022,20220312,5,4.2,Great place VUT you have to get there early. The service is on point and the staff always have good suggestions. Definitely worth the drive.

3/13/2022,20220313,2,4.2,"I don't really understand the high reviews for this place. It's generic French toast. Pretty hilarious actually. Nothing special about their French toast--not stuff or unique. Just French toast topped with blueberries, strawberries, caramel sauce, or lemon sauce. I just don't understand it. Egg selection isn't that good -- you don't get fancy savory items like eggs Benedict. And the wait takes forever, probably because service is so slow and inefficient. I just don't get it."
3/13/2022,20220313,5,4.2,"The atmosphere, food & staff were gr8. Everything made fresh & reasonably priced. Ask for the homemade hot sauce with your meal (very good). You know it's good when your wait time can be 64-84 mins. Parking is not plentiful & feeding the Meter is a must because u WILL get a big ticket. So it's best to come as soon as they open or put your name on the wait list. ENJOY"

There were tons of folks there for breakfast and the staff was very quick to provide water to our table. The staff member shared with us the highlights on the menu and was very friendly.We ordered the french toast flight and seafood - crab cake benedict. Both dishes arrived fairly quickly and were good! Tasty, good flavor. Neither dishes made my jaw drop but definitely recommend them"

I will definitely be back for it the next time I'm in town!"

4/3/2022,20220403,5,4.2,Satisfied with specials of stuffed catfish and shrimp stuffed crab cakes and fan fave of the French toast flight. Table next to us complained about their food taking 45 minutes while ours came out first (we were seated less than 20 minutes) but I think it was an honest mistake. Friendly service.

4/10/2022,20220410,4,4.2,The French Toast flights are amazing!!! The interior is small but the food makes it well worth it. Our waitress was truthful to a point. Yes there was no need for extra syrup especially since they have their own butter syrup mixed that's ratio is perfect.
4/10/2022,20220410,2,4.2,"I honestly couldn't eat the dishes here because it was pretty dirty when we walked in. We came because the reviews were high but cleanliness is the first thing I evaluate a restaurant on and determines whether I eat there. Unfortunately, I couldn't bring myself to eat here"

4/15/2022,20220415,4,4.2,"The food was a solid 4/5. My salmon was a tad bit dry, and I'm just naturally not a fan of cheese hashbrowns. I ordered a side of pancakes (not pictured) and they were delicious! I'm not a fan of French toast, but the pieces I did taste were really good. The staff was incredible - so nice and made sure we were always good. I would definitely recommend to anyone traveling in the area!"

4/16/2022,20220416,5,4.2,"I love this restaurant. I often dine here solo, but whenever I have friends in town visiting I bring them here first. They're known for their French toast flight. They have four signature, delicious French toast flavors and they add a new flavor weekly that you can add to your flight and make it a ""super flight"". I always order the super flight when I go. They also have different specials that seem to change monthly. I usually order the specials. They're always delicious. They have very tasty omelets as well that come with their signature cheesy hash browns. Whenever I order an egg dish or hash browns I make sure I ask for their hot sauce to go with it. I'm not sure if they make the hot sauce in house, but it's very tasty and unique and it really amplifies their dishes. My only only negative comment about this establishment is how small the restaurant is. There aren't many tables inside and if you have a large amount of guests you will be waiting a long time. I usually get their around the time they first open so that I won't have to wait. I really hope they get a 2nd location soon or just get a bigger restaurant."
4/17/2022,20220417,5,4.2,"We had a group of 5, were able to get a table on Sunday for brunch after a 1.5 hour wait. The yelp waitlist didn't work, so we had to go and reserve our spot in person. The food was, however, SCRUMPTIOUS. I love to use gravy as a gauge for how a restaurant uses spices/herbs, and the biscuits and gravy was top tier-- thick, creamy, almost sweet? And the eggs were that impossible balance of soft but not runny. Everything was very reasonably priced, as well. Definitely a special spot."
4/18/2022,20220418,4,4.2,Absolutely delicious food. We eat here every time we visit Chicago. The French toast flight is a must!
4/19/2022,20220419,5,4.2,"Let's just start with us finding a way to order three different meals. (Thank you Nadine- our server!) loved the service here and the food is truly amazing. We definitely waited an hour to eat but it was worth it. It's BYOB which is great (we didn't bring any). The only thing I will say is I'm so accustomed to DC brunches with music and people naturally being loud that this brunch spot seemed very quiet and chill. If you want somewhere more ""lit"", then go somewhere else but for food and service, batter and berries"
4/22/2022,20220422,5,4.2,Yummy to my yummy Never a bad meal here always something new try!! Love it! Flights here I come
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.2,"I loved my experience here! Definitely a great spot to check out in Chicago. It's away from the hassle of DT, but still in a cute spot not too far.We arrived just about an hour after they opened which was right before the crowd so it was perfect. We were able to be seated right away. Our waitress also came over right away and was attentive.I ordered the chicken and waffles. The hot sauce they used for the chicken was PERFECT. It wasn't too spicy, but had all the right flavors. The sweet potato waffle was different but I actually enjoyed it AND it was stuffed with chicken!! I get tired of the same ole things for brunch, but the way they did the chicken and waffles was a great twist and def try! We also got the French toast sampler. I'm not a big French roast gal but the turtles one wss the BEST. It also came with lemon, blueberry, strawberry, and pecan praline. Not my faves, but still worth the try if you like French toast."
4/24/2022,20220424,5,4.2,"We live in STL and we were there for spring break my youngest came last year with my sister and we she found out we were coming to Chicago for spring break she kept asking can we go to the breakfast place my TeTe took me too. So of course I called my sister to find out what my daughter was talking about. Needless to say the customer service was amazing, food was good, and the facility was clean. Wish y'all had one in the STL"
4/28/2022,20220428,5,4.21,This place is amazing! Our service was great. The food was even better. And the jokes/riddles that our server had for everyone made the experience even better! 11 stars! Just visiting this place and we are so glad we found this.

4/29/2022,20220429,1,4.2,"Ok so we were seated directly by the door. The cold air kept hitting our table directly, I didn't mind putting on my jacket but I thought about my food getting cold after it came. I asked the waiter if we could move because it was another table available on the other side. She said let me ask my manger. Before she could ask the manger he shook his head NOOO, then was moving his hand under his neck back and forth.... I said wait he didn't even hear what I said, she goes I'm sorry before I could ask I guess he knew what you was about to ask. Apparently his name is Arieion (short dreads, about 5'4) Overall you just don't give customers jesters to customers. Makes you feel like your an animal or a kid!"

The music and overall ambiance was dope, but service was not great."

5/3/2022,20220503,1,4.2,"Grave disappointment at a high price. We went in a party of 3 on a Monday morning. The service was awful from its taking forever to get the syrup and salt once the food arrived to the busboy sloshing water carelessly on my iPhone. The scrambled eggs were overcooked and had an after taste that lasted all day. The poached eggs were stringy, not cooked as requested, and tasted like vinegar. The hash browns were cardboard- and we realized that no amount of salt was going to fix that. Everything was pretty cold. Plus the place has a dirty vibe. Sorry. I don't mean to be mean, but if felt like such a waste of money. Really- it was inedible. Even the coffee was bad."

5/7/2022,20220507,5,4.2,I went to this place last month and man oh man was the food delicious I ordered the special they had which was the jambalaya and it was sensational. The server was great he had a real positive attitude everybody was friendly actually I would recommend this place to everyone ! The north side of Chicago is full of amazing small restaurants it's very rare that you will find a server with a bad attitude up north to be very honest.

Please do! 5 star food every time I've been several times (because it's just that good) and the location isn't close to me at all, but that caramel French toast plate...shows up in my dreams and that steak executive. Amazing.Make sure you get hash browns. It's a must. The French toast flight is great for those that don't know what they want. You get a lot of food here so keep that in mind when ordering. The tables can hardly handle their large plates and portion sizes.The fact that it's BYOB makes having mimosas a little more fun. This place is perfect for a brunch date with the girls, romantic breakfast with the boo, or a simple family date to get some great food. The only draw back is the wait times! Thank God they have a wait list and you can be added before you head to the restaurant they didn't always have that so now when I know I'm going I just join the wait list on Yelp, stop at the store to get my champagne and head to the restaurant. I guarantee you a tasty meal! Enjoy"
5/16/2022,20220516,5,4.2,The most AMAZING French toast ever! The staff is also very kind and attentive. Can't wait to go back!

5/20/2022,20220520,5,4.2,"Decided to try to dine-in 30 minutes before closing. I was placed on a waitlist and was seated approximately 40 minutes later. As long as you are on the waitlist before close they accommodate you. I ordered the gluten free pancakes and the scrambled eggs with hash browns and chicken Apple sausage and a Oatmilk latte. The food was so delicious! I don't know what is in the pancakes but they were so flavorful you do not need syrup. The eggs, hash browns and chicken Apple sausage were so lenticular I could not finish it even though I wanted to. The hostess and servers were all pleasant and acted like they enjoyed working there. The music was good...I will definitely be back!!!"
5/20/2022,20220520,5,4.2,"Yes, yes,yes!!! Breakfast was EXCELLENT! I got the super French toast flight which came with the sangria French toast which was the week's special. O. M. G. The sangria French toast which has sangria in it tastes just like a sangria! All the French toasts were great!! The waiter was super friendly too. Asked all his tables riddles. All the staff is Super friendly. I will be back the next time I'm in the Chi. Oh it's BYOB for mimosas ..."
5/21/2022,20220521,5,4.2,Got the French toast flight and we had a veggie omelette which was also delicious. I can see why this place always has a wait. Definitely would go back!!

Our server Jordan was awesome, he was so knowledgeable about the food and his attitude was amazing. chef ken was awesome as well and even brought our food out to us. The food was beyond amazing, everything that we order was perfect and the portion size is beyond fulfilling that you have some left to take home. Definitely worth coming here and eating and bring your appetite you won't be disappointed."

5/28/2022,20220528,5,4.2,We are all still very full! We each had the grilled lamb chops along with the BnB special French toast of the week and the Cluck n Gaufre (sweet potato waffle stuffed with chicken + fried chicken with house hot sauce). Everything was phenomenal! The staff was very friendly and visited our table to explain everything in the menu and answer any questions we had. We are visiting from New Orleans and chef also gave us other recommendations for places to go. The food here is great and so is the staff. We'll be back tomorrow
5/28/2022,20220528,5,4.2,We arrived right at opening and were promptly seated. The restaurant filled up shortly after we sat down. Our server was terrific as were the food and ambience.

5/28/2022,20220528,1,4.2,"We came to Chicago from out of town. We called this establishment 1 week prior to our arrival in an effort to best plan our itinerary. We specifically asked the hostess who answered the phone if this establishment took reservations or if they accepted ""waitlist"" from Yelp. We were told ""no"" to both options. The hostess said that it was ""first come first serve"" and we had to put our name on the list in person, only... Upon our arrival we did just that, only to find out that there was indeed a ""waitlist"" option via Yelp and that we could have joined the waitlist prior to our arrival. We waited for almost 2 hours for a table of 2. When we complained to the current hostess, no accommodation or apology was given for the misinformation we were provided. The hostess was informed that a poor review would be given they shrugged their shoulders and said ok. I do not recommend this place the poor service and the quality of food was definitely NOT worth the 2 hours that we waited. You would be better off going to McDonald's.."
5/29/2022,20220529,5,4.2,Great food great service...my waiter was amazing...small and cozy.........................will definitely be returning
6/3/2022,20220603,2,4.2,"I don't get the hype of this place... I've heard so many people rave about it. They don't do reservations so we had to wait THREE hours. I thought that with a wait so long, it would bound to be the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. No...it was so mediocre. Not at all worth the wait."
6/3/2022,20220603,5,4.2,"The food is delicious, the service is superb. I will stop in when I visit Chicago again. It was with the wait."
6/6/2022,20220606,4,4.2,"Great food and creative dishes! I love this place, it's my go-to breakfast spot and it's black owned! Service is accommodating and friendly. Wait time can be long and a bit hectic, but the food is worth the wait. The French flight is literally to die for! The specialty omelettes as well. I highly recommend."
6/10/2022,20220610,5,4.2,"From the food to the service, this is the absolute best breakfast experience I've ever had in Chicago. Please get the specials."

6/11/2022,20220611,5,4.2,"Our last attempted visit we did not get in because of the wait time being over an hour. However this time, we were able to get right in. Our breakfast was great! I ordered eggs, potatoes and bacon with side of chicken. The chicken was absolutely everything! So much so that my husband could not stop eating mine! I also appreciated the speed of the staff. Not just our server but others there were quickly hustling to make sure everyone had what they ordered right away. Although it's a tight fit, I also enjoyed their photo back drop so that you may take a quick pic when you are finished. I think that was a sign-""so good, you'll want to take a photo""!"
6/12/2022,20220612,4,4.2,"Decent food, amazing serving staff! Worth going again just for the great service alone."
6/13/2022,20220613,3,4.2,"I come here often and food is usually delicious but today was not the case. I spent $150 and my hash browns are burnt dry and has no cheese. Not only that my buck wheat pancakes are not as good as it always is. It's was dry and disgusting. I asked for lamb chops well done and as you can see on the picture it was raw meat #sad, hungry paying customer."
