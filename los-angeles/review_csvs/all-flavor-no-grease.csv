I loveeeee this place so much, I can't even handle spicy food very well but mild is perfect for me. The fries are so bomb and so easy to reheat for leftovers. Best places to get chicken!"
5/23/2022,1 star rating,"Sometimes the Instagram posts made by this business are cringey, oh and if you leave negative feedback you'll be attacked verbally lol.Thanks but no thanks.Plenty of other black businesses I'll gladly support that treat both the customers and EMPLOYEES well.Probably a reason you're hiring, even employees you paid got fed up ‍"
3/7/2022,2 star rating,"More hype then anything.Food is decent but when it comes out to almost $20 an item I expect more.Had almost every item by now and eh it's just eh.Usually trying it with a friend who's ""heard of it"" so I humor them."

3/5/2022,1 star rating,"Have you ever felt defeated after taking a bite of food? Like you literally did your hard core research on a restaurant, checked out the Instagram photos, traveled to the place - paid the money - waited for the food and then went to the car so you can get a little bite of the food before you pull off? And the moment you open that box, let the smell hit your nose and feel your mouth salivating and you take that first bite - and you know what you taste? PURE DISAPPOINTMENT. Yes. that is what it feels like to eat at ""IG famous, no flavor"" It is just no. they should be ashamed of themselves. Charbroiled chicken that tastes like Chili's fajita chicken. The tortillas are store brought and not the fresh ones either. Extra large vegetables and whatever that special sauce is? Smells like shrek's toe jam. Bruh quit playing with people's money. Paid all that money to be disappointed. I tell you what - who ever owns this joint is banking on people to come in from out of town to keep them in business. Because bruh - ain't no way someone who resides in California is going to allow this to be passed off as Mexican food. Ain't no way. You might as well go to Chilis - get the fajitas and take yourself home - save you the $45 headache you will get. Just -- SMH. literally - take a bite out of this meal and you will be shaking your head. Shaking your head at the money you spent, the time you drove to this establishment, and shaking your head every time you see that transaction on your venmo transactions. Spare yourself the headshake and go get something else."
9/19/2021,5 star rating,"Will travel for AMAZING food! I swear, I need to get that saying tattooed on me, because it is the truth! My brother has been following All Flavor No Grease on IG for years and we finally made it to the west coast to show Chef Ocho some love! This truck quickly made it to my top five favorites, easily!I ordered the triple threat quesadillas which was the best quesadillas that I have ever eaten! The sauce that the meat was marinated in was amazing and their signature green sauce was a hit! And these weren't regular-size quesadillas, they were huge! I almost didn't finish my entire order, but your girl ain't no lightweight, so I was up for the challenge! Topping it off with a tasty and refreshing red kool-aid was the icing on this delectable cake!!What made the trip even more enjoyable was the fact that we were able to meet Chef Ocho! He is a great guy with a wonderful personality. He welcomed us with open hands and thanked us for visiting his food truck. Best believe All Flavor No Grease should be on your must-do-list whenever you find yourself in Cali! Trust, you will not be disappointed!"
10/16/2021,4 star rating,Saw the plug on Vice and wanted to support them. The owner had so much charisma and passion for his food we had to check it out (plus his quesadillas looked bomb!).Quesadilla was okay but not sure if I'd pay $18 for a 2 meat quesadilla again.
3/21/2021,4 star rating,"I've been a fan of AFNG for quite sometime now but I've only recently had a chance to eat the food. I drove 45mins to eat at the food truck. It wasn't until I was in line that I discovered they don't take credit/debit. Luckily they take Venmo, so I had to search and pay that way (with a line behind me). There were a lot of people waiting for food and waiting to order. We waited about 30 mins after we ordered until our food was ready. We ordered the 3 meat Chicken/Steak/Shrimp Quesadilla and the 2 meat Steak/Shrimp burrito. The quesadilla was amazing, had awesome flavor and was one of the best quesadillas I've ever had(also very messy). It was $20 but I could justify it with the flavor it had. The burrito on the other hand was disappointing. Since it was 2 meat, it cost $15 but didn't have as much sauce as the quesadilla. Luckily we paid the extra $1 for green sauce to add to the burrito but even then, it was below average. The green sauce is very tasty! ...but I wish they had salsa. I would come back for the Quesadilla."
4/4/2022,5 star rating,"As advertised, simply great. I have no idea how they manage to pack it with so much flavor, yet no grease. Just a heads up but they did not take credit/debit, but I have venmo so no issues there. Get extra green sauce for sure!!!"
1/11/2021,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have watched so many YouTube videos on this place and were so excited to finally be able to try it! It did not disappoint at all, only thing I wish was that we got two so I didn't have to share lolWe ordered the Triple Threat Quesadilla which comes with Chicken, Steak, and Shrimp for $20. No pico since we both don't like tomatoes, but I didn't feel like it was missing anything, it was flavorful enough as is! The sour cream and green sauce gave it the freshness it needed to contrast with the richness of the meats and cheese. My favorite protein was the shrimp, I don't know how Chef Ocho gets that bright red color on them but it's DELICIOUS.Next time we come, I'm ordering one for myself and getting an extra side of the green sauce :)"
9/13/2020,5 star rating,"So. Darn. Good. One of the best quesadillas I've had in while.Their name is legit...all the flavors...packed with meat and cheese, but no grease. How in the world is that possible!? I had the chicken quesadilla and it was just bomb.I'm ready to eat more from them! I'm going to be chasing this food truck with a quickness."
8/9/2021,5 star rating,"I LOVE this food truck!! I've been several times and the food & service has been consistently good. Yes, you'll have to wait in lines, but they do their best to keep it moving. I recommend getting there early because they sell out quick."
9/1/2021,5 star rating,So much flavor!!!!! The 3 way quesadilla is my go to entree! worth the drive! Worth the wait highly recommended!
1/31/2022,5 star rating,The Quesidillas are so good and definitely big enough to share. Great energy' as well.
6/30/2020,4 star rating,"So I was around the area because I had a homie who was working on my car for the low and saw this food truck. I gave it a try and damn it was bomb af. It was like Mexican food, but still it's own thing. The quality of the meat, especially the shrimp, was delicious. It was $20 bucks which was pricey, but I know it's a food truck so I understand. Totally worth every dollar. I came from kinda far (~40 mins), but I totally would come back for that again. I'll definitely stop by again if I'm in the area. I was told the owner wasn't there at the time, so I wanted to shout out to the owner, big compliments man. Your Triple Threat Quesadilla was great."
9/20/2020,1 star rating,"So I see this truck today @ an event and stop by because I was famished after work and wanted to try a chicken burrito. I reiterated that I wanted the chicken well done and the cashier confirmed. I paid and waited. Another guy had been watching me wait and then started to close down the front windows on the van. He left one open and went back in the truck and came back out 5 mins later attempting to close the windows extremely fast and asked if I was waiting I let him know yes and he reached in the window, questioning was my order ready and swiftly pulled back a burrito fast.. and handed it to me with no bag.. and others had been getting their orders before me which was strange and also received their food in a bag.. the main part is I don't understand why I received mystery meat. And why it was still uncooked. The event seemed to be closing but they agreed that they still had burritos and not tacos. That should have been another red flag but I stupidly wanted to support. I'm not sure if it ground chicken or beef but I don't eat beef and this is trash. I was played and rushed when they could have easily denied the business if they could not uphold the standards at the moment. The guy was even rushing the other after I requested a bag to put the burrito in. Smh. This seems so fraud. Like why me. Why do we lie and steal from each other for no reason or half -do something just because you want to take extra money from folks it's so weird .. why play with people food.. but they throw the phrase 'foodminati' as in I'm guessing 'illuminati.. and only fraud energy would suffice if that's what they want to be attached to, a secret organization to trick folks, yeah there you go. I want my $8 dollars back for this burrito because it's not even chicken and I'm guessing it's extra. But I never got it.. Also yelp gave me a hard time adjusting this post with more pictures ...."
7/6/2021,5 star rating,"I've seen this place all over Youtube and am definitely thankful that I stopped by in my visit to LA last year. I got the truck location from their Instagram, and sat through an hour of the iconic LA traffic to reach this spot. Definitely worth the drive. I got the Triple Threat Quesadilla, which was kind of pricey ($20) but definitely something I would order again. The quesadilla is LOADED with different meats and seafood, topped with a multitude of sauces that make this quesadilla like a flavorful punch to the taste buds. The staff were nice and the wait for the food was reasonable, given the multiple parts that make up the food items. Let me say that this quesadilla is huge, it's easily 2-3 meals or a snack to share with friends. I have yet to find anything that hits the spot as well as this spot in the entire state of Washington, so definitely take the time to visit this spot if you're in the area."
1/19/2020,5 star rating,"Still the best! 5 months later, damn I can say that they have made me a weekly customer. The homegirl on the truck knows my order by heart now, and truly it's become a weekly craving. The kool-aid is addicting, the food is fire, and the people are dope. My co-workers love the shrimp & steak burrito! I've never tried it, but they be tearing it up!"
8/26/2019,5 star rating,"I really had to write a review because this truck is FIRE. It's been on mind for days now! I was hesitant to try it because it seemed over priced and I read some mediocre reviews. I was driving by late afternoon on Friday and saw no line and decided to stop by. BRUH, lemme tell you I WILL BE BACK.I wanted to try out the food first so I got tacos! 2 shrimp & 1 chicken. $8 I LOVED IT. Food came out quick and lemme give you the breakdown. Tortilla, melted cheese, shrimp, Pico de Gallo, green sauce, and sour cream = 100% flavor. The chicken was okay to me, but the shrimp SOLD me. I'm not even gonna lie I couldn't wait for a picture or to leave the damn parking lot! Homeboy next to me saw me get down and dirty with those tacos in my car! I love love the sauce and how it drips down, perfect lil scoop for the end! I will be 100% be back and will get a quesadilla next time. I seriously recommend for some good eats. Support your local black owned business y'all! They're putting in work."
9/28/2020,5 star rating,"I was recently driving on the freeway and I looked over to See the all flavor no grease truck driving in the next lane. Had to be fate . So I went on their Instagram page and found the location that they would be at for the day and took my whole family.  ALL FLAVOR NO GREASE Offers Americanized Mexican food. I had seen them featured on the news and social media and had found that they have such a huge following. Tacos, burritos and quesadillas are a staple in Southern California but Chef Keith Garrett puts his own unique spin on the classics with amazing sauces and preparation. The name all flavor no grease is accurate because that's what you'll get with every order. Huge portions with quality ingredients that are sure to leave your stomach happy. The food was so flavorful and didn't skimp on the chicken or steak. We also got a chicken quesadilla but my brother devoured it before I could take a picture. Pro tip: they serve large portions so you'll probably have leftovers. This food is seasoned so well that it tastes just as good if not better when you reheat it for a few minutes in the oven. Follow @allflavornogrease for info on where they will be next. You can also follow me on Instagram for more food reviews as well: @melanatedpalates."
9/23/2021,1 star rating,Got my tacos today the tacos was very small tiny tacos and cold plus the chicken was dry and I had pretty much no cheese and a baby drop of Pico and guacamole and I didn't get green sauce which I ask for and I went when they first open of the day so I see no reason for this.
6/13/2018,5 star rating,"I had the greatest steak quesadilla ever at this food truck! The wait wasn't long at all. Prior to ordering, I parked right across the street and walked over to the sidewalk that was adjacent to where the food truck was parked. I was recognized immediately and the gentleman took my order.It took about 5 minutes for the wait and they were kind enough to offer me multiple sauces when I came to the pick-up window. I wanted to enjoy it at home, so I let it sit in the passenger seat for a few minutes. This quesadilla looked incredible! When I bit into it, I knew that I've never consumed anything like this before.The right amount of cheese and veggies complimented the tender and juicy steak perfectly. It was so tasty and filling that halfway through my meal, I was already thinking about what to order for my next visit. As mentioned earlier, the sauce is complimentary and street parking is always available for everyone. Come through when you can!"
11/9/2018,5 star rating,I am a LA native and when I herd about this Black owned business that originated in LA I had to stop by. Like most people I thought he food looked delicious but was very pleased to find it full of flavor. The serving is more than enough for two people. I choose steak  and chicken and it was amazing. I can't wait to visit again!
3/26/2021,1 star rating,"This is truly a sad review to write. A friend of mine had visited the AFNG truck the orange truck once before and was completely obsessed with the food. Today we made the mistake of visiting their Ocho location which seems to be their more permanent location. It's off some random residential street which was a little weird to me but hey it's a food truck. The truck itself is a sad site in comparison to the other truck you wouldn't guess it was the same company. They guy working inside seemed nice enough when we approached the counter. When we proceeded to attempt to order we were informed there was no shrimp for my friend who wanted the chicken and shrimp quesadilla. Okay that's fine he got steak and chicken I got chicken I tried to get a taco a first he said they didn't have tacos anymore but then said I got one left which was also weird. It went even more downhill after that we were then informed they were out of pico and the green sauce which was half the reason I was convinced to try the place I love a good green sauce! My friend was skeptical even asked if we should just leave cause they wanted me to try it with the sauce. Me having good faith said no it's all ready being cooked it should be fine. It was not. The quesadilla was okay but nothing like the hype my friend said without the sauces and pico it  was not the same didn't even finish his and I notice the ""steak"" was more like finely chopped London broil not quite ground beef but not steak either. Me I'm just hella confused how what's supposed to be your main location be so poorly stocked this place is obviously very popular for a reason but if most people who come get only a third of the menu there is obviously going to be some annoyance. From my friends experience at the other truck and this one it's crazy to see such a difference in the presentation. I might try the other truck one day if it ever gets close but I for sure can never convince myself to go to the Ocho location ever again. The one star is for the brother inside who seemed alright."
1/5/2020,5 star rating,"Bomb spot I allways recommend, I ate bomb AF that day and it sat in stomach for a minute.. didn't need anything to eat all night after that.. I got the shrimp joint"
11/1/2018,4 star rating,"Tried the Chicken and Steak Quesadillas. Both were delicious, but I did prefer the chicken over the steak. Had been waiting to try this place for months until they finally went over to North Hollywood, and by CSUN. Only issue I had was that when they were over in North Hollywood and chef ocho wasn't there, my quesadillas were a little bit burnt. Didn't have that issue when chef ocho was there for the CSUN location. Other than that, they really give you your money's worth! Both quesadillas were stuffed, the sauces were delicious, and overall great food!"
9/1/2016,5 star rating,"I've heard about this place once before from a friend living in Watts but I rediscovered this place on Facebook from a LA Eats spotlight video. The owner and main cook, Keith, promotes the business primarily on Instagram where he has thousands of followers. He sets up shop in front of his house and they even have a small sitting area for customers, and the customers sometimes even cause traffic on the streets!I heard from someone else that Keith opens up shop around noon time and shuts down when he sells out. Got there around 2pm with friends but unfortunately he wasn't open yet and told us 3pm. We came back around 3:10 and there was already a line! Took us about 15mins to order, and another 25-30mins for the food (someone ordered bulk in front of us). The food (quesadillas, tacos, burritos) is a godsend, it was so delicious and I wish I ordered my own instead of sharing. Each quesadilla was about $10 so it can be pricey like food truck-pricey but that doesn't stop people from waiting in lines to buy it up. Will definitely be back to try other foods of his.You can definitely tell that Keith enjoys the work and meeting people and talking to customers because he's constantly smiling and chatting. I definitely appreciated that he remember me and said thanks for coming back after I left the first time. I'm a real fan of Keith's now!"

7/15/2019,3 star rating,"It's alright. There's a lot of hype (P.R.) about this truck. But to be honest, the food looks better than it tastes. I had a chicken quesadilla and was underwhelmed."
9/30/2020,3 star rating,It was ok. The meat was very flavorful but whatever tortilla they use it doesn't hold up. I got the quesadilla. It was nice and crispy like I like it when I got it but by the time I got home which was only 10 mins away it was soggy and soft.
10/26/2018,2 star rating,"I have been following AFNG on social media for a while now, and finally today I was able to get my grub on! There were only quesadillas on the menu but that's all good.I ordered 1 chicken and 1 steak quesadilla with everything on both. When I got my order (no one was in line luckily!) ... I was excited because the presentation was fucking beautiful!I went at the chicken quesadilla at first. It was alright ... nothing I have not tasted before. Then I went to the steak quesadilla and I was baffled. It was ground beef, really salty, and just submerged in oil and grease. I just wasn't interested in eating anymore after the first piece.I was really disappointed with my visit, however, I will be willing to have another go if I can try the tacos or burritos. Until then, it is a no go for me!"
7/19/2019,3 star rating,"I was super stoked today when I found out they would be hosting in Long beach, just the area I was in. Upon pulling up the truck i noticed it is nicely wrapped and new with creative design. Great, so I go to order and the music is so loud in the back the lady taking the orders cannot hear me, she keeps asking me to repeat myself(maybe turn music down). We ordered one shrimp burrito (no pico) and a steak/chicken quesidilla(no pico) and also a steak taco. Minutes later my food was ready to go.Upon  picking up my order , she advised me they accidentally  made the burrito with pico, and kindly asked of I would want it remade how  I requested.. umm.. of course..As i wait for the burrito i began to dig into my quesadilla and my friend  goes to find her taco and to no suprise, no taco, only another quesadilla.ok so an order mess up, I come to the front to ask for napkins the front line tells me there are NO NAPKINS.. SSOO, Loud music, no napkins, order mess up ×2. I bite into my chicken and steak and it actually taste more like ground beef.All in all 3 stars for the presentation and flavor.. Green sauce was a go for me as well..The pricing is a bit high for sure.  Would I come back? Probly not, but is it worth my fellow helpers stop? YES WHY NOT??"
5/22/2020,2 star rating,I gave this food truck two star because the food was bullshit I been following this shit on IG and every one was talking about how good his food was .let me tell u it's all bad I never had a damn burrito with no beans in it and they meat have a sweet taste to it and they pico de gallo have pineapple in it  every one don't eat sweet shit in they food . And for the price of they burrito $10.00 for a small steak burrito when I say small they was small with no damn good favors people need to stop lying about this food because it's not all that .
4/27/2018,5 star rating,"I heard about this food truck and the owner through a documentary called Food Grails almost a year ago and today i finally got to try the quesadilla.God damn ... the name of this company and food truck did not disappoint .. the price is reasonable for the amount of food you get ... the ""green sauce"" which I take is cilantro and maybe parsley is the icing on the cake..Even though I am mostly plant based, this chicken was flavorful asf .. the chicken almost tasted like buffalo style with some Smokey flavors ..My only compliant is, they didn't have a veggie option .. a quesadilla with sautéed peppers, onions, mushroom with everything on it ... sign me tf up ... It is no secret on why is company is so successful ... quality food, exploding flavors with a freshness!#AllFlavorNoGrease ... no bullshit"
1/21/2018,2 star rating,"Tried their truck twice and was very disappointed! Got the triple threat and I just did not like it. Chicken and beef reminded me of the meat you get pre made at the Latin market- you know in the section that says ""meat for tacos"". The red chopped up shrimp threw me off too! The flavors all together just wasn't good to me. At $20 a pop I just couldn't rationalize the reasoning for it. I mean you can sit down at a restaurant and get a very good meal at that price point. I saw his quesadillas going up and down my time line and it looked so good! I was so sad about my food when I finally got it in real life!"
5/6/2020,1 star rating,This is not good food I don't know how they call themselves Mexican food they don't even compare. All flavor no grease is no Bueno waste of my money. Will never buy food here ever again I gave it one star because there's nothing lore sorry you just don't cut it.
10/6/2019,4 star rating,"I saw he was in my city down from UNLV so I had to show love. People were waiting for his arrival. The line was 30 people deep but no one was arguing. I was the six order in the line. We all wanted to eat. Chef Ocho brought his smile and his crew. He let us know there would be no Tacos just burritos and Quesadillas. I was kinda sad but I would survive. I decided to get the oldie but goodie shrimp quesadilla and a chicken burrito. I also got a kool aid. I the shrimp quesadilla was amazing!!!! I split it into two meals. The chicken burrito wasn't. The chicken had taco seasoning on it and that was a huge no for me.I don't remember him putting that on there previously. Either way, I'll pass on the chicken until he stops using taco seasoning. The food came out super fast. I ordered a kool aid just to round out the meal. They also had chips but I passed. I don't drink kool aid and have never been fond of it but, I will say it was sooo good!!!!! I could have ordered a second one. It's as good as TacoMel version."

2/24/2018,3 star rating,"They came by to the Riverside area and my husband and I were excited about this. We had been waiting for months for them to be in the area. Keith's instagram said there would be tacos, burritos and quesadillas, so we went with the idea of what we wanted. They started at 12:30pm, and we got there around 12:50, and there already was a long line. We said , screw it, people say it's worth the wait so let's wait. We start inching closer to order when they food truck worker let's us know they're only serving quesadillas, and not tacos and burritos like it said on Instagram. My husband and I were disappointed because we felt like we got pigeon holed into ordering their most expensive item. We ended up paying $36 dollars for a triple threat and a shrimp quesadilla. We waited a while to get our order, but we were patient. When we got home with our food we realized quickly we way overpaid . Don't get me wrong, it's decent food but not for $15/$20 a quesadilla. If they had a full menu I probably would've given it a higher rating. I don't mind paying $3 a taco lolIt was disappointing because we were super stoked about it but in the end we left with a dent in our wallets and a 75% full belly at best. We were like, alright we'll pay the amount because people say it's worth it, but it wasn't. I give props to Keith regardless for doing what he does , but I feel like it got seriously overhyped. I don't know that I'd go back based off our first experience if they were around the area again."
6/18/2018,5 star rating,"I had food from this place 2 days ago, and have been craving the chicken quesadilla since then! The portions are plentiful and the quesadilla were not greasy! Everything was fresh and made to order! I am so excited to write a review because this place is sooooo delicious! The only down fall is that by the time we found the food truck, they had ran out of food so we could only order quesadilla's. But I guess this proves how good the food is that everything was sold out.This place is a MUST GO if your in LA!!!!"
9/29/2020,4 star rating,"Stopped by one day on my way from work. We had ordered the triple threat chicken. Every piece of meat was cooked to perfection. It had the perfect amount of cheese (and trust me I LOVE cheese) to meat ratio and the salsa was to die for. The portion size was wonderful, I was able to eat off of it for the whole day. The green sauce that tops the quesadilla off is finger licking good. Amazing food, great service."
6/1/2018,5 star rating,"OMG the quesadillas were #offthehook #offthechain so yummy very filling.

1/15/2019,3 star rating,"I'm always for trying new places so I decided to give this food truck a shot. The food was good, but in my opinion, way overpriced. They do accept cash and debit card, so that's convenient. It was worth trying, but I don't foresee myself being a regular at this food truck."

Why not post that prior to arriving smh sad BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES never make things right, third time at the 4st market in Santa Ana he post on IG that's from Jan 7 on Mon thru Fri he will be open everyday so it's Tuesday me and my wife get here about 11 am he is closed hmmmmmmmm I comment on a pic on his page and say where are you I'm here ready to eat he post a pic that says we will b closed do to training sooooooo 11am on a day u r supposed to open u jus realize you have to train ???

12/23/2018,1 star rating,Tried this place to see what the hype was all about. Let me tell you it sucks! I ordered a steak quesadilla 12$ plus 1$ for using my debit card. The steak was super salty it was not good at all. The food was very bland and lacked flavor. Overall this is the first and last time i go. Everything is overpriced and the food is not good. Ill stick to KING TACO and its quesadillas.Going through the reviews it seems like most black folks love it however everyone else does not seem to agree. I understand that everyone likes to support their own race but stop lying to people saying the food is amazing.
12/14/2018,5 star rating,"This food is the BEST!!! His Tacos are the tastiest taco I've ever eaten!!! and I've eaten plenty tacos within my 31 years of life.

12/7/2018,4 star rating,"Food was tasty and made to order. Staff was friendly. Luckily the day I went it was raining and there was no line. I will be honest though... I was disappointed in the price/portion. $20?! For a quesadilla with chicken shrimp and steak (triple threat) ???? I get it ""shrimp"" = extra charge but that's insane. basic quality ingredients, I would never justify paying $40 for two quesadillas. I was eager to try it so I gave them a chance. Again food was good but the size of the food is definitely not worth the price. Oh and $1 charge for credit card haha cmon......"
12/4/2018,5 star rating,I Must give Credit where it is due. All Flavor No Grease is delicious. I cook for everyone so to have a place that I can enjoy Makes me Happy. I also love supporting Black Business! Had some of everything on the menu. Everything is Great! Appreciate the quick service with finished product looking Beautiful.Yummy. Bomb.. Delish... Get yours ASAP!!
10/18/2018,4 star rating,"I caught the food truck one day while it was in Lakewood at a hair salon opening. The line was long. The line was very long which only attested to the quality of the food I would be receiving. The line situation was confusing because there were what appeared to be multiple lines and no direction. The longest line was actually for people waiting with tickets. The second longest line was for those waiting who paid cash and the line of confusion was a mixture of those who paid and those who were trying to order. The employees in the truck were running around inside and likely did not notice the confusion between those who were waiting  and those who were walking up trying to order. It would have been helpful to maybe have signage for guidance but no biggie. After the lines were squared away, I ended up being 3rd but it took awhile to order because there were only 2 people inside of the truck doing everything. When I did order, I decided on the quesadilla with chicken and steak. I think it was $12....possibly $10. I ordered additional guac and sour cream/sauce. There was an additional $1 each but the container size was so small and only half full that they should have been no more than 2 for $1. Honestly, they should have been 25 cents each if you want to know how I truly feel. I could have gone to the store and got more for less overall. The wait for the food was also long. It is definitely not a place you can run to on your lunch break. Now the food is on point. That was the best quesadilla I had ever had. It was glorious. My taste buds were on cloud 9  which was a plus because I was hella hungry after all of the waiting. I started following AFNG before I relocated here and had been trying to get to AFNG since I moved out here in 2016 so they did not disappoint. Check out their IG and find out where they will be posted up for the day and on your way home stop through....do not be late returning from your lunch break because I tried to warn you."

10/17/2018,1 star rating,"This place is not that great, food is overly priced for it to not be that good. Barely any cheese on the quesadilla and the seasoning for the meat is not that good it's too salty"
10/12/2018,5 star rating,"Ever since I saw the video online about this place a few years ago, I've been dying to try it. We finally made it out to LA from Ohio and it did not disappoint. We got the steak burrito and chicken quesadilla. I got the green sauce on the side thinking I wouldn't like it and it was just as good. Also it wasn't spicy. I'd highly recommend trying it."
10/11/2018,5 star rating,"Decided to walk over and try the quesadillas and omg no joke the food is A1!!! I had the most adorable little girl take my order like a little boss perfecting her customer service game  I love the all family & love vibe of this truck and the people who run it and it deff shows in the food!My man and I had one shrimp and one chicken quesadilla with extra papa's sauce. Both where BOMB but that shrimp  was amazingly dangerous. Not greasy AT ALL not salty AT ALL perfectly seasoned, juicy little shrimpies with a perfect amount of cheese, salsa and sauces to top it all of."
10/2/2018,4 star rating,Finally was able to catch them when they came to town and thinking I would be able to get my food on my lunch break which is an hour...NOPE wait time was about an hour and a half I finally got my plate 1 chicken quesadilla for me and 1 steak quesadilla for my son. The food is GOOD but I was an hour late back to work. So be prepared to wait...
9/27/2018,5 star rating,I've been wanting to try AFNG and today I finally did. Ordered a steak quesadilla and it was delish! I was only planning to eat 1/2 of it but I somehow managed to eat the entire quesadilla! It was perfect! Not greasy or super salty... but flavorful! Can't wait to try more items on the menu!
9/12/2018,4 star rating,"Finally caught the truck on Western/ Manchester. I had the steak quesadilla and it wasn't bad... Nothing to go crazy over, but it was pretty good if I may so myself. If I'm ever on the East Side, I would definitely go back to get a quesadilla or burrito. I killed my quesadilla in the Ralph's parking lot before even getting back in the car so it must have been good lol."
9/11/2018,2 star rating,I recently wanted to try it again for a second time and it wasn't as good when Keith was making them on the Ocho.  I love to support black businesses but this go around taste like an expensive steak quesadilla from taco bell.  I will say it was a big portion size
9/4/2018,5 star rating,All Flavor No Grease hands down has the best quesadillas I ever had. the owner is the friendliest guy you have ever came across my favorite is just the shrimp quesadilla the shrimp are so season and delicious!  AFNG is really what it stands for the flavor of these quesadillas are so amazing I promise you if I could eat this every day of the week I would eat this every day of the week. If you have not gotten a taste of this deliciousness you are really missing out. I recommend AFNG for any occasion

4/27/2018,3 star rating,"1. The triple threat was surprisingly really good but the price for it is ridiculous. $20 for it.2. We waited an hour!!! After we placed our order to get our quesadillas. 3. Will I go back, maybe if they drop the prices."
9/14/2015,5 star rating,"I was trying to get my meals right and some dude on instagram posted some quesadilla's and told me to #pullup so naturally I obliged. They got chicken, shrimp,  beef, lobsters.  Portions match the price. Usually 10 to 20 bucks. I appreciate that it's a food stand in front dudes house.Only thing is you got to follow them on instagram to get times they open."
2/26/2018,2 star rating,"I was so excited that they were finally in my area! We got there about 30 min after they arrived and they didn't have shrimp, tacos or burritos- all they had were quesadillas. My family left because their kids wanted tacos but we stood to try the quesadillas. I was hesitant since they have a ""B"" but I've been wanting to taste their food so I stood. The Steak quesadillas was $12. It was OK- nothing special to me. I got a couple piece of fat which I hate. My niece got the Chicken quesadilla, chicken had no flavor at all. I thought because it looked orange it would have a good marinade but not the case. I personally wouldn't recommend , nothing special about the food."
11/27/2018,5 star rating,"This is the best option for a food truck. Their food is always delicious! The shrimp quesadilla is fantastic!I drive from Chino Hills to Moreno Valley to get my All Flavor No Grease, it's that good! Keep it up guys!!"
4/2/2019,2 star rating,"Really nothing special. I got the triple threat burrito, and I didn't think it was that special. Ground beef, chicken and a little bit of shrimp...something I could find at any other restaurant that serves burritos. I wouldn't be writing this review if it didn't cost $19 for the burrito. Not impressed, don't think I'll be eating here again."

3/29/2018,5 star rating,"You think you're ordering a regular Chicken Quesadilla, but let me tell you that I've never had one quite like this.Spices hate me, so I'm a bit gun shy about having sauces on my food. The crew assured me that it wasn't hot at all.  Feeling adventurous, I got the works on it.I'm not even sure how the chicken was marinated, but it didn't even matter.  The sour cream drizzle was just the right amount. The salsa verde was just for taste and didn't smother the food, like other places.The 'Green Daddy' sauce. Holy Hell it was epic!  I got hints of lime, garlic and avocado which made that chicken tap dance on my tongue.There is a reason the line is always 10 deep. The food isTHAT.DAMN.GOOD."
10/25/2018,5 star rating,Was super excited to try their food when they came down to Moreno Valley a few weeks ago. Was pretty good. There green sauce was very different but in a good way. Can't wait to try it again next time.
11/16/2019,5 star rating,"I've been chasing this truck for months! Opened Instagram this morning to find out they'd be in LaVerne today. 1pm I hopped in my car found their truck and had the steak, chicken, and shrimp quesadilla. They did not disappoint! Best quesadilla I've ever had! When I sent a picture of my food to my daughter, she screamed WHAT!!! I had to get back in my car and get her one! Delicious!!!"
5/23/2018,5 star rating,Really good chicken quesadilla. Although it is a little pricey I feel like you're paying for the experience of it all. I enjoyed my food and was happy to see how this business has evolved. I also really enjoyed how they cut up your quesadilla for easy eating.
5/23/2018,2 star rating,"I'm highly disappointed. Quesadilla was $18 for the steak/shrimp combo. It wasn't the price that bothered me, my food was lukewarm. Yet the tortilla itself is browned as if it was cooked right then and there. Cheese was barely melted, I mean...who wants to eat cold shrimp? I understand the need to be able to serve customers in a timely manner, but cold seafood is unacceptable and it also means my seafood was cooked beforehand when shrimp only takes 7 mins to cook anyway. I would've gladly waited 10 mins for a fresh meal. More importantly though, why are the shrimp red, they aren't spicy, or sweet, just cold, tough, and red. I only ate two pieces and I picked the shrimp out as I went along."
5/18/2018,2 star rating,"The only reason this place doesn't get one star is due to the plate presentation looking decent and the customer service wasn't bad but that's where the positive comments end.Food:Checked it out last night, ordered the triple threat (chicken, beef and shrimp). From the first bite it was evident that the quality of the meats are very poor and they try to disguise it with over seasoning. Which made it even worse. The green sauce is pretty bland. Couldn't even finish half of it and that's saying a lot coming from a person who over eats for no reason. You better off going to any lunch truck and getting a more tasteful quesadilla.Price:$20 for the triple threat quesadilla , you'll pay less at a high end Mexican restaurant. You definitely don't get your money's worth even if it costed $10. I guess if you don't know how a good quesadilla is suppose to taste then this is the place for you."
5/17/2018,5 star rating,"I was able to pull up to the Ocho one day while on vacation and try this gem out. It didn't disappoint at all. While the prices are on the high side, I didn't feel unfulfilled after getting the triple threat and the food was well seasoned and the green sauce set it over the top. I was able to see Keith do his thing and told him he needs to take this nationwide. The other truck can be hard to locate, but it was def worth the wait."
5/15/2018,1 star rating,"I live in Bakersfield and went with my family to check it out for the first time. I made sure we went during their business hours and... No truck anywhere. Why doesn't AFNG get a website and announce somewhere that they are not there? I had to read reviews to find out they are on Instagram. Not everyone has Instagram. Drove a lot just to be let down. If you want customers, GIVE THEM THE RIGHT ADDRESS. Seeing how successful it's become, the least this business could do is that. Will be taking my business to a real place."
5/12/2018,3 star rating,"So I've decided to try this place out because of all the hype I saw on Instagram, and the first time I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was pretty good! It's a very well sized food portion you get for the price. I enjoyed it so much that, I returned the next day and brought some friends with me and we all ordered the ""steak"" quesadilla because that was all that was left. The steak was more like ground beef. And it was just not good. It almost reminded me of taco bell meat, except that it was disguised by its beautiful presentation of the green sauce and sour cream. Let's just say I will never be ordering the ""steak"" quesadilla again."

4/30/2018,5 star rating,Love this food truck they are so good very professional ...veey neat and clean courteous and food SO BOMB GREAT FLAVOR AFNG...
4/30/2018,2 star rating,Its okay but not worth  20bucks. The 6 dollar Mexican quesadilla from a good truck like el Chato tastes just as good. No fancy sauces but the flavor is there. Maybe I was expecting more since it was overhyped on Instagram. And not to mention he tends to cancel very often so it's hard to track down the food truck.
4/27/2018,1 star rating,Got super sick and the runs from the shrimp quesadilla and my dad had to leave work because he has vomiting and had a fever from eating it as well. Iv been wanting to try their food for over a year and I finally got to and it wasn't what I expected on top of getting sick from it
8/3/2017,4 star rating,I really do like this guy and what he's doing. He has a great attitude and always ready to serve the community. The food here is great! It has a lot of flavor and you also get a pretty nice portion. The wait is just way too long for 1 quesadilla. I think the process needs to be a little better managed so people aren't waiting over an hour to receive their food. I'll try AFNG out again when it's a little more organized. But great food!
12/2/2018,4 star rating,Big boy food ! Very hearty meal. Love the flavor love the combinations . But I suggest to eat half. Will have you bloated. Other than that... VERY DELICIOUS
8/26/2017,5 star rating,Awesome man with a dream to advance and help the community. The chicken and steak quesadilla is fantastic! Definitely on my regular visit list.
9/23/2016,5 star rating,"hands down the best quesadilla I've had in my life!!  BBQ chicken and shrimp and that green sauce WHATEVER IT IS!!! is Phenomenal.  He sells out daily by like 3pm so definitely plan ahead.  He is the most humble and sweet guy ever.  I want him to win, I want a food truck.  I want it all!  cautionary tale:  it is not a restaurant, you WILL order on the curb, he and his staff WILL  prepare the food in the front lawn (with the proper equipment of course), you will wait about 10 minutes (made to order), you WILL NOT find parking easily....but you WILL NOT regret going!!! AT ALL"
1/9/2019,1 star rating,"Food is trash, all the hype for nothing. I could prepare better tacos and burritos at home. A waste of my money"

11/20/2016,4 star rating,"I heard about this young man through social media who was cranking out delicious quesadillas in the hood. I decided to find out his next event to try out his food. It's difficult for me to go to his house in LA because of work, but I caught up with him this weekend at an event he posted to his IG. I arrived early on time at 1pm to avoid the massive line. To my surprise they were still setting up. I waited about another hour before I actually ate. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. I must say it was quite delicious never tasted a quesadilla with so much flavor. The Chef, Mr AFNG has this bubbly personality that instantly draws people to him as he cooks. Not only is his food good but he's a positive young man with warm spirit. I enjoyed the experience looking forward to trying the other quesadillas on the menu."
10/12/2017,5 star rating,Sweet Jesus!! I've never liked ANYTHING but steak with my quesadillas but IT WAS FCKN WORTH IT!!!!  half steak half shrimp
9/30/2016,5 star rating,"Literally the best quesadillas I have ever had in my life!!! Everything is fresh and preprepared for perfection! I got the chicken and shrimp quesadilla while my girlfriend got the steak and chicken quesadilla. It took me over an hour to come and eat over here but was worth it. Plus the music was LIT! Like I wish the DJ who is playing over there, should be playing at half of the bar that I go too. Will come back again!!!"
5/16/2020,1 star rating,"First of all let me tell you why I gave it 1 star. It's not cause it was gross or anything but because I woke up 3 hours later with massive diarrhea. That's my most main concern from the outcome. Now let me tell you about the experience itself. We got there around 7ish and they were closing already but they still took our order since there were lots of people waiting for their food. My fiancé and I both got quesadillas since it's the main dish so he got chicken and I got steak so we could  share it. They ran out of their green sauce so there goes that. Their steak wasn't steak, it was like Taco Bell meat; tasted the same too. Their chicken was chunky and wIth some seasoning not too strong it was okay. Their steak one was strong in some seasoning but the meat as my fiancé called it ""mystery meat"" tasted like so. I usually don't do bad reviews unless it was bad. Their ads and their reviews were good, maybe I just had a bad experience overall. But it sucks to say I paid $20 for a bad case of diarrhea. I couldn't even finish my  quesadilla"
9/30/2016,5 star rating,I'm from Washington and have been so excited to be out here to try out these quesadillas. They are definitely the best quesadillas I have ever had and wish I lived closer to have more :(

5/4/2016,4 star rating,"I honestly did not like it very much. Maybe it was just a bad day for the chicken quesidillas I'll come back and try something else but I wouldn't come back for the quesidilla. The shrimp looks good but since I'm allergic, I can't have it. I wish the wait wasn't so long to get the food but since he's making it from scratch in front of you, its completely understandable."
2/1/2020,1 star rating,"First time ordering the tacos and was not impressed at all. I was not expecting to pay $3 for a taco that was half the size of my hand, meaning it was so small I ate it in 2 bites. Also  only had 3 pieces of shrimp. So disappointed."

1/26/2016,5 star rating,"Now wait a minute, I know you're probably saying 5 stars but you'll have to judge the food for yourself. First things first, keep your eye on the prize AFNG! Now once you arrive, I suggest  a taco of your choice ( depending on availability ) chicken, shrimp, steak , and lobster tail. I did the steak taco with everything (Pico DE gallo, sour cream,  cilantro sauce) ate that so fast can't remember how good it really was. Last but not least Triple threat QUESODILLIA! .....Let me wipe these tears of joy before I continue. ..Dear Mr. AFNG not too many times does a patron get to meet the chef and I'm glad I was able to meet the true essence  that is a part of what makes the street food experience at AFNG well worth a real foodies dream...Mmmm"

I arrived at 12:24pm since they opened at 12:30pm. I stood in line till about 1:20pm just to put my order in.!! I did not have my food untill 2:30pm!!!! Ridiculous!! I ordered the triple threat quesadilla, since it was the only thing they were serving. The cost was  $20.00 ,which I thought it was a bit much for a quesadilla. I am a foodie so if The price is right I have no compliant. The flavor was ok, but not worth  $20. They barely add on any sour cream or ""green salsa"". A side of the salsa is $1 for a small container, which they don't even fill to the top. Overall taste was not bad, but not what I expected. The wait and price ruined the food truck experience. 2 hrs for a quesadilla is just insane!!!"

3/8/2018,1 star rating,This will be the most honest review of all flavor no grease the food was not great it was way too salty and I'm glad I didn't get shrimp cuz that would have made it even worse the man himself who owns a truck is amazing and a very very very nice man and to top it off the price was way too high at steak and chicken quesadilla was $15 I'm not sure what it was with shrimp but I feel like all flavor no grease is taken advantage of his community and overcharging his customers because of internet and social media hype it's all flavor no grease would bring the quesadilla down to maybe $8 then I would probably go back but only if he did less salt and it's not worth traveling all the way down to watts to wait in a long line
11/27/2018,5 star rating,The Pictures do not EVEN begin to explain how FANTASTIC they are. You will not be disappointed. They're name says it all All Flavor No Grease  The Steak n Shrimp were my Favorite. I try to have them everytime they're in town.

3/29/2018,5 star rating,"I first had their triple quesadilla at a urban food festival in the parking lot of a shoe store. It was absolutely worth the 1 hour wait and I really really regretted sharing one instead of getting a dozen just for myself. Since then, I have constantly dreamed about eating another one and regularly stalk them on Instagram. If I thought my body could handle it, I'd follow the food trucks around like a groupie. But because I'm trying to be all fit and healthy for some reason that I can't think of right now, I save it for my special cheat days when I inhale it in my car minutes after getting it and immediately wish for another one."
2/25/2018,1 star rating,$32 for 2 flavorLESS quesadilla . Save your money you're better off at your local taco stand .
5/27/2018,4 star rating,"Tried the three meat quesadilla a few days ago, it's alright.  Not worth the price though.. I can get a tasty quesadilla elsewhere for far less.  Place is a bit over hyped and pricey.  Mexican food shouldn't be that expensive!"

The chicken was to chewy, and the flavor of the shrimp didn't blend well with all the other flavors."

7/3/2017,1 star rating,"This rating is for the service only. I didn't get to eat the food because it takes way too long. I pulled up at about 12:34. On the Instagram, it said they'd start serving at 12:30. Finally around 12:45 they took the first order. It took 3-4 minutes just for one customer to even order.  Next, there were two girls that ordered and it took almost 10 minutes just for them to finish ordering.  I decided to wait again for the next people to order. It took them about 2 minutes. At this point I had been there 30 minutes and still no one had even gotten their food. Sorry, but 90-120 minutes (about 12 people in front of me) for a couple quesadillas is just too much.  I wanted to support a local spot, but not gonna wait that long."
3/26/2018,5 star rating,I have been coming to Keith for years now. My husband and I would drive from Orange County just to eat his food. Its so amazing that the drive is worth.
3/25/2018,5 star rating,Literally so bomb. All of the ingredients are so fresh and the food is so flavorful  the name literally describes what the food tastes like. I like how they have a vegetarian option. The truck was easy to find and even easier to order. I will most definitely come back to AllFlavorNoGrease for sure!
9/22/2019,5 star rating,"I feel like if you give them anything less than 5 stars you're a hater, the food is perfect I can't complain about nothing. Chef Ocho burritos, tacos and quesadillas is better than anyone's and that's FACTS he cooks with love!!! The food is perfect, the prices are perfect and worth it AND the customer service is perfect!!!! You will not be disappointed."
7/10/2018,5 star rating,The most flavorful food you'll ever try! I heard all the buzz about this place and it wasn't until I finally tasted the deliciousness myself that I continued to indulge in more. I recently attended their kitchen takeover at Villan's Tavern and it was a great experience! The food selections on the by Chef Ocho were as always delicious! And a drink from the tavern compliment the meal all together. I would definitely attend another kitchen over and still stop by the original location for some great food!
9/13/2017,2 star rating,"Quesadillas are overrated. Guy himself is really cool. But priced too high for quesadillas that aren't that great. I got the triple threat, and let me tell you, it looked nothing like the pictures."
10/4/2019,3 star rating,"I'm very disappointed in the customer service on my 2nd visit. I've been waiting for them to come to Victorville since my last post and I've commented many times asking for them to come back. They finally came back and like the previous time was late. Then they didn't have permission to be on the property they were at and had to shut down about 3 people ahead of me. I was in line in the hot sun for over an hour just for them to shut down. I offered the people getting their last order money to get my food and before I could even finish my sentence the owner cut me off and said no. I told him I had been writing him to come out here and how I waited for a simple order and he didn't care. I know he was given 20 minutes to get everyone off the property who hadn't ordered, but seriously it was one extra order that wouldn't have hurt if the couple ordering would have already been ordering it. Not to mention that the guy taking orders said they were out of tacos and steak. How were they open for only about 1 and 1/2 hours and out of those? We were told to come back Sunday. Not only do I work Sunday, but why would I want to stand in line again and not be told they're out of things or be cut off again? No thanks. I really wish we would have been offered a ticket to bring back Sunday so we didn't have to stand in line again behind people who already got food today. I don't think I'd ever give them my business again"
9/4/2018,5 star rating,"I randomly saw a news post about the food truck shared on facebook. I thought the food looked good and wanted to support the owner. To my surprise two days later I see they're gonna be in Victorville in a few days. I found them on Instagram because of the facebook post and wow were the pictures amazing. I was so excited to try them. They had a long line, maybe 5 people in front of me in line, 6 waiting for food and a growing line behind me. It took about 15 minutes to get my food. I git it to go because there was no seating where we were. I got a steak burrito for $10. I started eating it on the drive home (I was the passenger). I think the portion was good. I really liked the burrito,  nothing bad to say about it. The meat and everything in it was delicious, not burnt, the tortilla wasn't burnt either. It was a great burrito. Was it the best I've ever had, no. Would I eat it again? Yes! I think you see so much popularity online and you put a too high expectation on it. That's why some people say it's overrated or didn't live up to the hype. You have to try everything for yourself. I'll say it again, the buritto was good. The lady that took my order was very sweet and they were all friendly as I stood waiting for my food and eavesdropping on people picking up and ordering lol. I saw others post online after they git their food, and I'm definitely getting a quesadilla next time they're in town."
3/28/2018,5 star rating,Love love love this place !!! I had always wanted to try them out and finally a few months ago they came out to Palmdale and man it was everything I expected it to be and more I can't get over all the flavors! I had a steak quesadilla and a chicken taco and man there was nothing I didn't like about it low key mad they didn't have shrimp when they came out here but I'll catch them next time and please keep coming back to Palmdale we love you out here !!!!
8/14/2018,1 star rating,"Cant find a stable location, thry cancel out on alot of promised locations. Drove 1 hour to villans tavern only to be told food isnt there. Its been an hour since they said theyll open. Im honestly over it. Could be a good business, but its not organized."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"Food delicious. Service is awesome. Definitely worth the drive from my house. But even if you're not up for driving, you get the option of Postmating the order. AFNG needs to just open a restaurant. That place would be busy as hell 24/7. Also, loving the new truck. Lookin' slick. Keep up the good work!"
5/12/2018,3 star rating,"So I've decided to try this place out because of all the hype I saw on Instagram, and the first time I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was pretty good! It's a very well sized food portion you get for the price. I enjoyed it so much that, I returned the next day and brought some friends with me and we all ordered the ""steak"" quesadilla because that was all that was left. The steak was more like ground beef. And it was just not good. It almost reminded me of taco bell meat, except that it was disguised by its beautiful presentation of the green sauce and sour cream. Let's just say I will never be ordering the ""steak"" quesadilla again."
3/29/2018,5 star rating,Being pescatarian I love getting the shrimp quesadilla!!! Extra green sauce pleaseeee

8/30/2017,5 star rating,I was in the area when I remembered seeing them on Facebook so I was let me go try it. I supper glad I did.... The food... AmaZing if you haven't been here your missing out! It was so good I forgot to take a picture LOL
10/21/2017,3 star rating,"I've been following AFNG for some time now and I finally had a chance to try it in DTSA on my day off. I went ahead and got the Triple Threat quesadilla, which came with chicken, steak, shrimp, pico de gallo, sour cream, and a great green sauce. I also got a free steak taco as that came with any Triple Threat order that day (I heard last week they were giving out free sodas).I was impressed that the quesadilla was really flavorful with no grease, but a bit dry. Also the quesadilla was presented really sloppily, but this is due to new staff working on the line... hopefully they get into the swing of things soon.While I would eat this again, I thought the $20 price tag was way too high. Also the food truck originally was scheduled to arrive at 11 AM but it was changed to arrive at 12 PM, but it finally arrived over a half over late (which is unfornuate especially for those who are on tight work schedules). Also the schedule said it would go on until 8 PM but they sold out at 3 PM, which I could see would be unfortunate for those planning to come after 3 PM. Hopefully they work out the food truck kinks..I hope to try the food again at the 108 location!"
6/9/2019,5 star rating,"Food trucks are clean, which is a plus. But, the food is delicious, and they give good sized portions. I've only tried the chicken quesadillas, and the chicken tacos. Can't wait to try the other selections, they all look delicious!"
7/14/2019,3 star rating,"We drove to Santa Ana from Hollywood just to try this place out. We ordered the chicken quesadillas and the presentation was nice, and the food was decent, but where was that FLAVOR?! The food was very bland and under-seasoned. Maybe this store-front location cooks/prepares differently from the actual truck, but whatever the case, it was disappointing and underwhelming."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,That chicken & Shrimp burrito is serious business !!! Hella fire. I for sure gotta make AFNG apart of my monthly routine.
3/25/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely the best food truck ive ever eaten at, and keith actually got out and spoke to everyone, super humble! The green sauce definitely put a icing on the cake for me! We love when he comes fo west covina!"

I expected a long line but man the wait time for the food was ridiculous !!!!!! For crying out loud it's just a freakin quesadilla ! Lol. Oh, and there's no loud speaker on the food truck so you'll be there waiting for 45 minutes with your ear sticking out to the sun trying to hear your Oder number. Crazy ! It was good food ! Just don't know if I'd visit again considering how unorganized they are. Not t mention that it's suuuuper overpriced. I supported the cause once but probably not again. Thanks for the experience tho '"

5/17/2018,5 star rating,"I was able to pull up to the Ocho one day while on vacation and try this gem out. It didn't disappoint at all. While the prices are on the high side, I didn't feel unfulfilled after getting the triple threat and the food was well seasoned and the green sauce set it over the top. I was able to see Keith do his thing and told him he needs to take this nationwide. The other truck can be hard to locate, but it was def worth the wait."
1/30/2018,3 star rating,"This place is in the hooooddddd. The guy who is in the videos was not there. I expected a line but there was only one other person there. I mentioned them not being busy and the guy said that was a good thing. I'm sure the business owner wouldn't have the same outlook. The quesadilla was 10 dollars, I expected that but I thought I would be able to see the process. It is a food truck so it is handed to you after they finish. I also grabbed a canned ice tea which said 99 cents on it but they charged me 2 dollars. That bugged me a bit. This is a small business and the man doing the videos has his heart in the food he is cooking. The people at the food truck on this day really didn't seem to have the same fire and desire. The food was okay. Not anything you can't get from another Mexican food resturaunt. I drove 30 minutes out of my way for this experience. I wouldn't do that again but I encourage people to try it for themselves. I'm sure it would be better if the owner was there."
9/23/2017,5 star rating,I love the food but more then that I love the owner. Great spirit. He know how to be kind and humble
6/3/2017,3 star rating,"I tried the steak quesadilla and it was really good! But it was not what I expected. For the price ($12)it was a small portion and the wait made it even more disappointing. We arrived around 5 and there was already about 10 people waiting, not in line, just for the food. The staff was nice,but the service was extremely slow. After finally waiting at least 30 minutes(or more) for the food, the quesadilla was small and didn't look like the ones shown on his Instagram or featured on other social media. The food is worth a try, but probably won't be coming back."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,All my friends told me to to try it and I was a skeptic but it had to be the best Carne Asada quesadilla that I have EVER tasted ! The guys on the truck are friendly and helpful when you can't decide on what to get !

5/15/2018,1 star rating,"I live in Bakersfield and went with my family to check it out for the first time. I made sure we went during their business hours and... No truck anywhere. Why doesn't AFNG get a website and announce somewhere that they are not there? I had to read reviews to find out they are on Instagram. Not everyone has Instagram. Drove a lot just to be let down. If you want customers, GIVE THEM THE RIGHT ADDRESS. Seeing how successful it's become, the least this business could do is that. Will be taking my business to a real place."
2/10/2018,3 star rating,I finally tried the food since I saw all this hype on instagram. So I went and waited exactly one hour for the food they would skip people here and there. Though the people are friendly and apologize for being slow I wouldn't come back cause it took an hour to get a steak quesadilla. The steak quesadilla was good though but the waiting for the quesadilla isn't worth waiting an hour for.
4/30/2018,5 star rating,Love this food truck they are so good very professional ...veey neat and clean courteous and food SO BOMB GREAT FLAVOR AFNG...
12/9/2017,4 star rating,Finally had the opportunity to try this truck. The food was great they did not hold back on anything. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was in point. I am glad I pulled up when there wasn't a long line. I would diffidently come back and try other items.
4/23/2018,5 star rating,"I finally had the chance to get a taste of this goodness. I had been following their Instagram page forever. The truck just happened to be in the parking lot of a store I was going into. Finally, it was my turn to try it. It truly is ALL flavor and NO grease. We ordered shrimp tacos and a chicken quesadilla.  It was absolutely delish! We ate it all before we even left the parking lot. What ever that green sauce is,  it will make you want to make sure every bit of it makes it into your mouth. I can't wait to have it again. What are you still waiting for? Go get some you some! Your taste buds will thank you."

4/25/2017,3 star rating,Good tasting food... it's just too expensive to have to wait in line for 1 hour and 30 minutes for your order. If I could have my order in 15 minutes i would give him a higher ratings. His food is tasty and the meat he serves is tender.

4/14/2016,5 star rating,"First it's good to get some important things out first. You should follow them on instagram @allflavornogrease . We can call this spot a food stand and there is a chance that they will sell out on their food. If you follow them you can check to see when they're serving and when they sell out. I have stopped by twice before and missed out on food. I ordered their ""triple threat"" quesadilla today and is made of shrimp, steak, and chicken, a combination of cheese and pico de gallo. On top they drizzle sour cream and cilantro sauce.  I have eaten many quesadillas in the US, and Mexico and this spot is legit. Due to demand there was a wait and it was worth it. This place will become a staple to take my friends and family that come out of town."
11/20/2016,5 star rating,"Best quesadilla of my life. Boyfriend agrees! We love this place. I've tried the BBQ chicken, steak, chicken/shrimp quesadilla as well as the lobster quesadilla.

1/15/2019,3 star rating,"I'm always for trying new places so I decided to give this food truck a shot. The food was good, but in my opinion, way overpriced.

10/17/2018,1 star rating,"This place is not that great, food is overly priced for it to not be that good. Barely any cheese on the quesadilla and the seasoning for the meat is not that good it's too salty"
4/7/2017,2 star rating,"Let me say this first. His quesadillas are amazing!! The taste is awesome. The quality is spot on!. BUT! you will be lucky to even get one. I have gone to wherever he was located on 5 different occassions. Only two of these occasions was I actually able to get food. But not the food I wanted. Each time I have come to get a shrimp quesadilla he is always sold out by the time I get there which is normal 15-30 min before he is scheduled to start selling. Its very frustrating and a constant dissapointment. Yesterday was the last straw. After working a 10 hour day and picking my husband up from work we both decided to make the drive from Manhattan Beach to Bellflower. Mind you this is on a thursday afternoon so theres Hella traffic. It took us an hour to get there.(not his fault, just saying). So per his instagram post he is schuduled to be there and start serving at at 6:30pm. We got there at 6:10pm.  Already there was a nice size line which I completely expected. Ok heres where my irritation started. So at about 6:45 one of his(Keith the owner) representatives comes out and announces that there is no more shrimp. (Keep in mind he has not even started selling yet so I am confused). He states that the ""Pre Orders"" took all the shirmp so basically we are SOL. I am immediately irritated and cant help but have an attitude because A. Thats specifically what I came for and B. Nobody told me anything about him taking ""Pre Orders"". Thats just not fair. Oh and let me add a C! You already know you have a high turnout of people who support you and love your food. As a business owner why arent you anticpating the need and buying enough product to meet the demand. This is rediculous. Litterally the 5th!!!!!!!!! time this has happend. But I digress................ So my husband and I are dissapointed (again) but figure hell weve already been standing in this long ass line so we might as well just get his other two options which are the chicken and the steak. So we finally make it to the front of the line to place our order about 7:15pm. The guy taking the orders lets us know that now there is no more chicken available and that all they have is steak.  At this point I am livid. I have an attitude and cant help but share my frustration. I tell the man that this is the 5th time this has happened. Mind you 3 of those 5 times I wasnt able to get ANY FOOD AT ALL!.  He apologized to pacify me but he really just wanted me to STFU and I could tell. smh.. After throwing a mild fit my husband and I ordered two steak quesadillas for $12.00 each. I could have just left but we were both starving, annoid and tired. So we just bit the bullet. We ate the quesadillas in the care and OMG they were amazing. But not amazing enough to make up for all the bullshit I just had to go through to get it.  Im just done with this place. Its just not worth it. So my advice to all if you want an amazing quesadilla and dont mind waiting forever to get it only to possibly not get it all. Give this place a try"

9/14/2017,2 star rating,"I ordered the steak and chicken quesadilla (fully loaded) and $15 later, I must say that I was not pleased. Although there was plenty to eat, lots of meat and cheese, the flavor was lacking. They need to rename it No Flavor No Grease. All I could taste was salt. So, I guess the upside is that it was seasoned. Downside, it needed citrus to elevate the flavor. The cilantro sauce was bland and there was no heat. How can you serve a quasi-Mexican dish with no salsa? Or, at least something to kick up the flavor. Overall, nice try, but more work is needed."
2/24/2018,5 star rating,Hype is real!!. He came from LA to SD...waited pretty long but it was well worth it. Ordered Chicken & a Steak quesadilla with sour cream and green sauce.  Both were sooooo good. Must eat it fresh..all flavor!!

7/28/2017,3 star rating,I really really really wanted it to be as good as everybody was saying it was came on my lunch break one day my boss and I want to dance one at lunch about 15 people in front of me but yet I still spend about an hour and a half in line music was so loud I couldn't hear myself think he's on a side street off of Central and I believe Avalon or Main not really trippin about that per se but then I get up to the food truck and okay city is $13 what the hell so I'm expecting my styrofoam to be super heavy because $13 mean that I could have bought five chickens and some cheese and some onions and probably still have some money left over cuz chickens are 99 cent a pound not the case my styrofoam was so light I literally had to open it up to make sure that it was still in there my boss said her son used to work for him so I was just kind of like she was high I was high and when we got back to my office 2 hours later I was very disappointed the quesadilla was basic I don't know if you've gotten too big for the hype or you trying to stretch your dollars but charging me $13 I will not be back

6/25/2016,2 star rating,I've tried the food multiple times.. The BBQ chicken quesadilla was bomb... I tried the chicken and shrimp enchilada and quesadilla... Both times the shrimp was waaaay over cooked it was very rubbery and tuff.. So I have learned only get the chicken..

10/18/2016,5 star rating,"Went to Oozefest in Santa Ana actually looking for AFNG and ended up walking right past them. Found them as we were leaving with full stomachs. I did however order a few Quesadillas for home. The guys at the booth were  great and entertaining, but the food was DAYUM. It didn't even make it to my car, took a bite and couldn't stop eating it. ALL FLAVOR NO GREASE . You guys are the best.."
