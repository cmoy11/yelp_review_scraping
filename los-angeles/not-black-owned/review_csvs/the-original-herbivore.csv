7/14/2021,5 star rating,"When I heard vegan chicken sandwich, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was excited that this was possible to finally try.I went in to the store & after deciding, I got their Nashville chicken sandwich at a level 2 for the spice. I also saw they had many options for their sauces that were all made there. I got fries and a lavender lemonade as well to go.The sandwich was indeed fire! It packed a punch even with just a level 2, but it was crunchy at the first bite and consistent with the flavor and texture all the way through. It seems like a smaller sandwich but with the carbs & seitan, that sandwich will fill you up.I'll be back here when I'm in the area!"
3/7/2021,5 star rating,"Just happened to stumble across a post stating that they were going to be in San Diego and couldn't resist to make a quick stop and man I was literally blown away WOW. The flavors were insane!! Whatever they're doing they definitely got it right!They had ran out of the Buffalo sauce by the time I got there so they made my sandwich a ""low"" heat Nashville and let me tell you there was nothing low about it but ya girl can handle the heat so I loved it. On to the Mac and cheese wow delicious I'm pretty sure I'll be dreaming about it until I can have it again lol.OVERALL, you best believe whenever they plan to be in San Diego I will be stopping by! :) keep up the good work!"
2/5/2021,3 star rating,"I liked the Chick'n & Waffles. Rating might seem low, but this was way better than my last order. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not a fan of vegan chicken since it consist of Tempeh, and that's OK. The crispiness and seasoning of the 3 piece was on point though!!   I had to warm up the waffles which is completely fine since I had this meal delivered to me through DoorDash, and it was good. This is a classic food combination and something I enjoyed. I didn't like the butter with the waffles, but the syrup did taste mighty fine.  Overall: I wouldn't get it again, but I didenjoy this option of food for my dinner compared to my last experience."
1/22/2021,2 star rating,"Whewww, I can't catch a break with giving out these low ratings. Haven't had a 5 star review since December (haha)（＾~＾) (sad face)   To put it short and simple, this meal wasn't for me. The 'Nashville Chicken Sandwich' had the spicy sauce dripping out the untoasted buns, pickles, coleslaw, and arugula, but I honestly didn't care for it. It wasn't terrible, but a bit under being mediocre for my liking. I ended up not finishing it.   The 'seasoned fries' were a bit too potato-y, could have been more crunchy than soft. The seasoning was just salt, no other seasonings were tasted on my pallet.Overall: Wasn't for me, but I might crawl back and try their 'Chicken and Waffles'."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"The BEST vegan Chick'n I've had in my 4 years of being vegan in OC no cap! Their breading they make is amazing and the inside of the chickn is not like a lot of other places' spongy seitan. Original Herbivores is stringy with layers and is juicy, not dense at all like how a lot of other Seitan style chicken can be. Many restaurants/pop ups have the Chick'n breading down but hide the insides texture with it. I've had to stop ordering Chick'n sandwiches from other places until I see a picture of the inside for this reason!  But Original Herbivore neverrr dissapoints in texture!I've posted some of their pictures from their Instagram here so y'all can see what I'm talking about!Their morals are on POINT too! Definitely people you want to be supporting with how transparent they are about important issues!Will definitely be ordering from y'all again soon! Thank you!!"
3/2/2021,3 star rating,"After following their food truck's weekly locations on IG for awhile, I was so excited when their schedule coincided with mine at Vegan Depot I.E. in Corona! I grew less excited during the 30 minute wait (there were around 8 people ahead of me in line). Once I got to the front, the service was warm but they didn't seem the most organized, needing to double check someone's order and giving me the buffalo sauce last minute. But the food came out quickly, looking and smelling amazing!!- Famous Chick'n Bucket (Original): $14: it was okay! The crinkle cut fries were fine. The chick'n breading was fabulously crispy and seasoned but the inside was bland with a vague tofu-like taste and slightly rubbery texture. I was hoping for more umami flavor and didn't find mine to 'shred'. Still, it wasn't overly greasy or salted and felt almost healthy. This was my first time trying seitan - maybe it's just not for me.On another note, I realize that there are many hidden expenses to running a food truck, higher costs to making vegan specialty food, and that tax and tip were included in the meal price. However, $14 for a relatively small portion of 3 chick'n pieces is a price I'd only be willing to pay once in awhile. All in all, I don't regret trying this food! Their fried chick'n fell below my expectations of rivaling real chicken, but was pretty good for what it was."
7/3/2021,3 star rating,"I was excited to try this from all the IG hype. There was a long line, but we ended up getting the regular chickin bucket and the fried chickin sandwich. It was pretty good but we were kind of offset by the service. I know they're busy but I'd hope for better service. Overall it's pretty decent, flavors are all there and decent!"
11/21/2020,5 star rating,"I've enjoyed Original Herbivore in small doses in the past at event (the fourth of July last year, Vegan Sundays/Vegan Exchange LA, etc), but today/tonight was my first time being able to really take it all in via their food truck in Sherman Oaks on a Saturday night. I know the standing location that will be in the area is currently under construction so this is a nice alternative in the meantime.My first time trying a bucket rather than one of their savory sandwiches and I'm in love... They have amazing dipping sauces, however I must convey that having my order tossed rather than accompanied with dipping sauces on the side was more than worth the extra buck and something I highly recommend... Especially with Buffalo, BBQ Lime or Jerk... Though all amazing.YES my hands got sticky, but that's what sanitizer is for! Treat.Yo. Self!A three piece is great for one person and pretty filling but one more strip would have sent me over the moon because it was so great. Aside from their chick'n (everything 100% plant based and vegan) they also do tots as well as fries pretty well, an incredible Buffalo Chick'n sandwich, waffles and wingz.... I haven't had the mac & cheese but have only heard good things... Not everything is available on the truck as to be expected... But great things are coming soon.The S.O. food truck spot was very close to the store front... Like mere feet... Just off of Ventura Blvd and Allot Ave between Woodman and Fulton... literally next to Starbucks. I managed to park pretty close by with little to no issues off Ventura but would recommend parking off a side street if street parking is full. My order only took about fifteen minutes. I could have sat at Starbucks and enjoyed my meal with plenty of outdoor tables and chairs and staff pretty on top of keeping things clean, but I enjoyed in the car and at home... Finger licking good style.I have been to the Koreatown location, but unfortunately it was on a Monday and I wasn't to familiar with the hours.... But hopefully can revisit there one day and get the full chain experience.Definitely check it out and their Instagram page for updates and food truck locations."
11/25/2020,5 star rating,"Dank vegan fried chicken. Seitan based, with the batter tasting seriously good. The chicken is extra crispy on the outside, and incredibly moist on the inside. The chick'n even shreds. Its freaking good. If you have ever tried Temple of Seitan/Temple of Camden in the United Kingdom (London), their fried chick'n reminds me of it, which makes me incredibly happy because I have been longing for vegan fried chicken like theirs for so long, and finally got to have it here in LA! My only thing is, I'd probably go broke if I were to eat here regularly lol. The price point is a little on the pricy side for me right now. It's definitely nice to treat yourself with this once in a while though."
3/28/2021,4 star rating,"holy fried chicken!! ofc I had to try while I was in the area, and yasss worth a try!! Easy ordering through Yelp/gh Chicken bucket comes with fries or tots and one sauce. The fried chicken itself: chewy ?seitan based I believe, super crunchy breading, well seasoned. A little on the greasy side so I could only eat like 2 pieces with the tots. Ranch was creamy and good but a little more would've been nice Nashville hot chicken sandwich: ok warning it is super super spicy!! It definitely creeps and it lingers til the day after if you catch my drift. It was amazingly delish but if you have plans the next day, maybe try a less spicier flavor lol Chicken and waffles: the waffles were super crisp and had a light vanilla scent, comes with butter and syrup YUM, we air fried both later and we enjoyed this All in all def delish if you're craving fried chicken vegan or not!"
1/25/2021,5 star rating,Came here from off the menu the owners were so sweet. When I was there a homeless man asked to work for food and the owner was so kind and said no worries offering the man a nice hot free meal. I got the chicken sandwich it was very tasty. I gave some to my dad snd he didn't realize it was vegan. The tots were also great!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,They opened a spot down the street from me in Koreatown and I was am so excited they are here! Koreatown needs more vegan joints. I've been 3 times already and love everything I've had. Friendly staff as well! I will continue to support this small business and can't wait to bring my friends here as well.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Was on a hut for vegan chicken and they didn't disappoint. Contacted them early via Instagram to make sure the place was safe for my hubby with nut allergies and they friendly and responsive. When we arrived at the food truck, they provided helpful recommendations on the most popular food items to try. We ended up getting their bucket of vegan chicken with coleslaw and biscuits and it was heavenly! Although we live in the Central Valley, we'd gladly drive the 100 plus miles to eat their delicious food again."
5/9/2020,5 star rating,"Back on Feb. 7, 2020, the first world problems were piling up. The scenic distractions of Temescal Canyon and Santa Monica meant I was behind schedule and my phone was depleted. If you can't take a photo of Abbot-Kinney First Fridays, were you even there? So it was back to the hotel for a recharge.And I would have ""only"" 2 1/2 hours or so available, as opposed to the ideal plan of walking around with light snacks from to 5 to 6, strategizing lines and seeking main courses from 6 to 8, then walking it off to get a second wind before closing time. Original Herbivore (still active as of May in various spots, per Instagram) was my 4th stop of the night and I wasn't hungry. But that Unreal Reuben picture, tho. Is this thing photoshopped? How can it look that much like pastrami? Either it would be good or it would be an impressive case study in photographic overpromising. It was 9:30-ish and in minutes the decision would be made for me. So even though this wasn't the ideal time for a big sandwich, the alternative option of returning to New Jersey without knowing was untenable.It was a beautifully constructed sandwich. If you sample the main ingredient on its own, you're not going think its pastrami, but overall it was a delightful concoction that can appeal to curious carnivores. Other ingredients include ""cheeze."""
12/23/2020,5 star rating,"I've become a regular at this joint! The vegan fried chicken is oh so good and the staff is always friendly. I've tried the Jamaican jerk, original, lemon herb, and Buffalo and not one is anything aside from delicious. They are generous with their servings so you never leave hungry. I like to get the bucket because I don't need anything but the pure ""chicken"" chunks. The tots are a nice accoutrement. For less than $15, have a yummy lunch and maybe even some leftovers for a snack or dinner."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I have never been so honored and happy to write a review !!! After 5 years now as a Yelp Elite this one makes me the proudest to write. While in California. I had seen a Vegan event posted ! I was excited as a Vegan to go and try the food out. They had an amazing food truck and a small but amazing menu. I have tried to date most items on their menu it always updates but I highly recommend their Reuben or their bucket of chicken !!! I missed fried chicken as a Vegan and this made me happy to find this Vegan alternative. As time passed they became friends of me and my children. We would at least monthly purchase food from our favorite truck. My son loves the chicken as it's not greasy and doesn't hurt his stomach like other vegan choices. They are always such kind people to both of my children. Besides the amazing menu, amazing service and cool truck...having them apart of my life for the past year and a half and watching them grow has been great. It couldn't have happened to better people. Try everything !! Everything on the menu is epic and the people are epic. If I could rate a 7/5 it would go to Herbivore."
7/24/2021,5 star rating,"Was able to try this stand at the corona fair and I think it was my favorite thing I tried!!! The fried chicken had such a beautiful texture and a peppery, savory, and overall umami fried crust. Along with the butter, waffles, and maple syrup, this meal was absolutely perfect"
2/28/2020,5 star rating,"Ok this place is legit. I've been vegetarian for 9 years transitioning to vegan just this last year. And honestly there's nothing I've missed more than chicken and this place nailed it! So long morning star chicken nuggets. I've tried their fried chicken bucket and it was amazing. Looks just like chicken and has the same texture as chicken. I've also had their Ruben. Exactly what I remember corn beef taste like. This place has nailed it. They also have chicken and waffles, I've only tried them because my boyfriend bought them but they were just as good. My boyfriend said one of the best waffles he has had. We honestly look forward to seeing them at vegan pop up. Staff is friendly and Sebastian is the head chef, knows what he is doing, he's also very nice and friendly. Thanks to them I can enjoy some of the foods I gave up long time ago. Definitely check them out!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"We're planning to move and considering staying within LA proper JUST so we can have easy access to this place. THAT is how freaking amazing their vegan fried chick'n is! Hands down the best in LA.  The fried ""chicken"" sandwich is seriously epic, too! We always buy an extra bucket of chick'n to save in the fridge and reheat in our air fryer the next day. It turns out perfect every time. I don't know how they do it but I hope they keep going and expand! Dear Original Herbivore, Santa Clarita is a very underrated market within LA county you should really explore ;) there is a demand for more vegan food up there and it's bursting with new communities! PS thank you for also standing up for human rights!"
11/16/2020,5 star rating,"Every time I come here I always think I'm being tricked and that I'm not actually eating vegan food. I truly cannot believe how their plant-based products taste so much like meat, it's amazing!Ordered their fish and chips which are insane that there's no fish in them. Taste exactly like fish...howww! And also got their Nashville chicken sandwich which is also great because there's so many hot chicken places in Los Angeles it's hard to find ones that are vegan but this one hits the spot. So in summary BEST VEGAN PLACE IN LA! Bonus: I feel like fries never get any reviews but it's worth saying that the fries that came with the fish and chips were seasoned and were amazing by themselves. I would go there just for the fries alone. But then how could I when everything that I have on the menu is equally as good. I want it all!"
7/30/2021,5 star rating,Wow.. this place is amazing. The food was extremely fresh and was by far one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had. The staff was also very welcoming and friendly. Can't wait to go back!
2/28/2020,5 star rating,"By far the best plant based fried chicken I've ever had. I've ordered the bucket of chicken as well as their chicken and waffles. The chicken is amazing; crispy, flavorful, and the texture is very much like the real thing. As for the waffles, they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, which appealed a lot to me since I'm a bit of a texture eater. I like a little bit of crunch in my waffles and this fit the bill. The waffle batter itself was delicious even without the syrup. I think they put some vanilla or nutmeg in their batter, which is a big plus. I don't like plain waffles. Having a flavorful batter makes me feel like they care about the details of cooking, if that makes sense. If you're in the area, definitely give these folks a try!"
10/22/2020,5 star rating,I had the Nashville chickn sammich and a bucket of buffalo chickn. Both were sooo good. I've been meaning to try this place out for the longest and I'm so glad I finally did.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I love this place. Like others I'm bummed they won't have a brick and mortar in Sherman Oaks, but they usually come in the truck once a week. And now in burbank near my work. Really great vegan fried chicken, like the best I've ever had. The consistency of the 'chicken' is great and the flavors are amazing. I'm not a fan of bbq sauce in general but theirs is delicious. The Nashville Chicken sandwich is also tasty. I want to try more things but the chicken bucket is just too good. Also probably some of the friendliest and kindest owners. Definitely check it out if you're in Ktown or near their truck"
4/9/2021,5 star rating,The food is bomb and service is I shall be back. Nashville hot chickn sandwich is where it's at.
2/4/2022,4 star rating,Hope to try them when the hours are correct. How are they closed on a Friday  I'm sure it's gonna be amazing tho. Just update the info plz. I'm glad I called before driving over there.
8/30/2020,5 star rating,They just opened a new vegan restaurant location in Sherman Oaks a few days ago. The food truck is just in front of it until they are fully opened. We ordered the xxl vegan fried chicken bucket with fries for $24. It was so delicious and crispy. We also had the spanakopita with a cucumber onion side salad for $12 which was also delicious. For dessert we had the mango cheesecake and the baklava also delicious. The owner is very nice and thoughtful.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Not only is their food absolutely delicious, but they also have good morals and ethics! This makes me love supporting a small business even more.I live in Northridge and drove out to Burbank to try their food this week. When I got home with my food it was still nice and crunchy! I threw it in my air fryer for a bit to heat it up(no biggie) everything was great. Very friendly owner and I felt safe picking my food up, I ordered online. They have a food truck pickup option which is awesome!"
8/11/2021,1 star rating,"I had a terrible experience ordering from this place online! I'm so sorry to say! My university was planning a bbq, since I'm a vegan and a local I pick this place to order from. Big mistake! I called last week to let them know their online menu did not include the items I was interested in ordering and I told I would be order for the following 3-4 buckets of their chicken which were not on the menu, they said it would be fixed. Fast forward to yesterday, day before bbq I checked online to place the order the items were still not on there. On my phone the site did not work and I called again and got a hold of the manager/owner. I was able to place the order on my laptop successfully I called and in 30 mins they were added. The website gave me the option to order for 11:30a delivery, the following morning I get a text saying hi we can complete the order but it won't get there till 12 because that's when we open. I was okay with that despite their website letting me place the order at 11:30. Then it got worse, he said they canceled the order and I needed to replace it! I was frustrated but I obliged, went online and it said the chicken was all out. The person I spoke to had said earlier that were going to ""accommodate me"" and open early but this wasn't my error. I'm really trying to understand how a customer ends up feeling responsible for their terrible site! And ordering system. I told him that I would not be moving forward with the order and the person was super defensive and said ""hours are posted online, we open at 12. Good luck.""  Rude and passive aggressive, if you opened at 12 your system shouldn't have let me order for 11:30a, If your system worked I wouldn't have all gotten all the error messages I received."
3/29/2021,5 star rating,"After failed attempts at catching their truck when they came to the I.E. I decided to make my way to their L.A. restaurant to see what the hype was all about. There ain't no hype about it - this joint is the TROOF (that's 'hood talk for truth). I ordered the original chicken sammich and I was NOT disappointed. Once I bit into the ""chicken"", all I could say was ""wow"". The texture was what got me! I had to check to make sure that it wasn't real meat. The batter used was just right and it added that crispy crunch that melted my face shortly after it blew my mind. I love pickles but I believe it may have added a bit too much saltiness to the sammich. The slaw was a nice pairing and the buns were warmed to perfection! I paired it with one of their root beers for juuuuuust the right amount of bite to add to me barking. I also ordered a mini bucket that sadly did not make it to my house. If there was a guilty feeling of any kind, I felt it but it was immediately overtaken by the simple fact that the entire meal is plant based. The ranch dip wasn't so much my cup of tea but that North Carolina dipping sauce was what did it for me. For dessert I had their oreo mylkshake which really felt as though I was drinking a cookie. It was light, fluffy and with the right amount of sweetness. I saw a review that said it was tofu pssh. Nah homie. This was NOT tofu because I've had that style of chicken before and there was nothing similar. I find myself conflicted because on the one hand I want everyone to experience this food. On the other hand, it's holding one of their chicken strips and I'm thinking, ""If too many people read this, they will go and there will be no chicken left for me."" Thankfully, I don't see this restaurant going anywhere anytime soon. I hope to catch their truck when they come back to the IE but I don't mind making that 1 hour trip there to experience the goodness that is THE ORIGINAL HERBIVORE."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Such awesome food! The best vegan fried Chick'n out there! Great customer service and friendly staff! They have delicious sandwiches and phish and chips, and the Chick'n bucket with homemade sauces is amazing!"
2/25/2021,5 star rating,O.M.G. This is my new obsession! The Korean fried chicken & Mac and cheese are insanely good. Also 5/5 for the service! Will definitely spend all my money here.
7/16/2019,5 star rating,"Changing the game! I've always heard good things about Herbivore, and it did not disappoint. The fish (phish) and chips are a scientific wonder. A special flavor and delightful texture all their own. I got a couple appetizer-like fishes for my first visit, just to get a sampling to guide my next visit. Kimchi fries were great. My boyfriend's reaction sums them up best: ""Maybe I don't not like kimchi, these are amazing!"" Buffalo cauliflower - spicy as warned, but some of the tastiest I've ever had. Just be prepared for the heat. Phish and chips - YES. Unlike anything else in the whole world. Next time I know I have to try the chicken and waffles because everyone I heard pass by say excitedly to each other, ""that's THE chicken and waffle place."" I don't think they could do any wrong, I'll definitely be back and looking forward to more creative, plant based versions of hard to find vegan dishes."
9/11/2020,3 star rating,"Adding an update to this review - this is my third time schlepping over to enjoy this new café - and after spending 25 minutes to get over there walked in and was told that they are out of chicken - ""because the truck is out.""Apparently customers are supposed to just know that when the truck is out they don't have their main course.I have been told to call ahead - which I did - but nobody answered the phone - so it's basically leaving customers to somehow guess what's going on.Highly recommend ownership be far better at communication PARTICULARLY during Covid when everyone's time is of more value / under more strain - It's really a disservice to customers to just expect them to know what's going on and any particular day if they want patrons to feel comfortable coming over."
9/8/2020,4 star rating,AMAZING food.They're still gettin up and running at the new Cafe so coupla small snafoos on hours but so worth the wait !!!The owners are passionate about gourmet alternatives to all of our favorite meat and comfort foods Dash and seem to be changing up the menu weekly with new gourmet goodies.Highly recommend -  but you'll probably want to call ahead of time to make sure they're open!!
6/10/2019,4 star rating,"I've had Original Herbivore three times now over the span of almost a year and I would say that of all the items I've eaten, it's been either a hit or a miss.My first experience was at the Long Beach Vegan Fest in July 2018. The hit was an Unreal Reuben made with seitan pastrami, fried onions, sauerkraut, and cheese on rye bread. Deliciously comparable to the one Locali makes. This was my favorite item at this event. bit.ly/31oe7nLNot as much of a hit but not necessarily a miss was the Chickpea Burger. Though it was good, I wouldn't go out of my way for this. bit.ly/2ILle1dThe bigger miss was the wait time for these two sandwiches. Roughly 30-45 minutes from the time it was ordered to the time we received it.My second experience with Original Herbivore was just a few weeks later at Vegan Faire 2018 in Anaheim. There were two hits for me: Fried Mozzarella (bit.ly/2WBWyBH) and Fried Chickun (bit.ly/2R4oatj). I think their cheese and seitan is housemade along with the tasty dipping sauces. Again, they made my favorite items at the event.The miss was the Bitchin' Burger. Though a burger topped with gochujang sauce, kimchi, and pickled veggies sounded super unique to me, I simply wasn't a fan. I was also a bit weirded out by the black sesame gomasio which reminded me too much like dirt (visually) and even though it tasted fine, it was hard for me to get past the visual once the thought hit my brain. bit.ly/2ZkZtvtAnother miss, it took a good 30+ minutes to receive my Fried Mozzarella, Fried Chickun, and Bitchin' Burger after I ordered.My most recent experience was at Vegan District at The Pike this past weekend. They had a new item, Phish and Chips, made with marinated banana blossoms. It was unlike anything that I've ever had and loved every bite of this batter-fried dish! Definitely a hit! It came served with tartar sauce. Another hit, it only took about 5-8 minutes to receive my order. bit.ly/2WBtTwWDespite to few misses, Original Herbivore does make good food. It's obvious that I've been willing to check out other items on their menu and I would likely continue to eat from this plant-based food truck."

1/9/2021,5 star rating,"Best vegan fried chicken ever. In fact , better than some of the real fried chicken I have had. And whatever seasoning they are using on their fried is straight crack. Amazing customer service too. I always try to get some of their food at their Sherman oaks stop. Can't wait to try their mashed potatoes and chicken with the waffles. Assortment of sauces like Buffalo and spicy Korean bbq to keep things interesting too. Definitely don't hesitate in trying their food!"
4/17/2021,5 star rating,"I was looking for a spot serving all day chicken and waffles. I love Floré on Sunsets chicken and waffles, but they only serve it for breakfast. The Original Herbivore Vegan Chick'n and Waffles, delicious! The waffles are cooked amazing and they're not too firm, not too soft. Just right. The chicken is pretty good too. The crispy breading is seasoned amazingly. The chicken is a little bit firm and chewy for my taste, but overall I would order it again"
1/16/2021,5 star rating,Treat your tastebuds. Just go. Please go. Bring a friend. Get the bucket of chicken. Lemon pepper. Ask for ranch. Add some fries or tots. Just do both. It's not one dollar wasted. You'll eat it and get all the pleasure of fried chicken without the guilt and sluggish feeling afterward.
1/8/2021,4 star rating,"My review is for the truck and the previous Sherman Oaks location. Enjoyed the Nashville Chikn, the spanikopita, and cake. Service friendly and good. Haopy to support local vegan businesses. Looking forward to trying some of their new dishes"
8/11/2019,4 star rating,This food truck at the noho Sunday vegan festival has the best vegan lemon pepper chicken. I loved it and wanted more! The lady on the truck was very sweet and she explained the menu to us. I was super excited to see lemon pepper chicken because I dont eat meat so this was exciting for me. They didnt disapoint. It had the perfect texture and flavor!!! I will be back for more!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"The best, most exciting food truck in LA County. Their vegan fried chkn will make your tummy smile!  This truck is the best thing to happy to fried chkn and to anyone who loved the real stuff but doesn't want to eat animals. The staff is always happy to see you and the food is hot and delicious. Los Angeles is lucky to have this truck. Hoping they open more locations asap! Come to Long Beach!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Original herbivore vegan fried chickun is so delicious!! The chickun meat is so tender and moist! Flavorful and crispy breading! Ive been a vegetarian for 10 years now and these are by far one of thee best fried chickun sandwiches I have ever had! Definitely will be coming back for more and recommend to others! My friend tried the waffle and chickun which were bomb as well. Couldn't tell that it was vegan. The combo of sweetness and fried chickun hits the spot!
2/4/2021,5 star rating,"This place never ceases to amaze me. I saw on their Instagram that they had a mango habanero flavor for the chicken bucket and needed to try it as soon as possible. This flavor is an amazing addition to their menu and I really hope it stays! I was skeptical at first because I can't handle anything spicy, but this flavor really did it for me. It's wonderfully sweet and then the spicy kicks in. I will be coming back on Thursdays just for this flavor! Keep up the good work Original Herbivore!"
1/21/2021,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I still come every Thursday to their food truck in Long Beach, usually getting their infamous Nashville Hot Chick'n Sandwich. Tonight we decided to switch it up and try their Chick'n Waffle Sandwich, and it seriously looks as good as the picture of it. The habanero butter with the waffle was amazing. It tied it all in with the chick'n and the arugula. The only thing I would change is to make it a touch, just a touch spicier. Otherwise, this item is a great addition to their menu; a must try. See you guys next Thursday."
11/24/2020,5 star rating,"I first tried original herbivore at a vegan food festival in March and was completely blown away. I got my boyfriend and best friend to try it and now we go every Thursday when they have their food truck in Long Beach. We have officially become regulars hahah. I always get the Nashville chicken sammich, and it NEVER fails. This thing is perfectly put together. It's spicy and the sweet pickles evenly balance it out. I always ask for extra pickles. We also really like their Korean flavor and their lemon pepper when we get buckets. I will say this, the guy taking our order when in Long Beach would sometimes get our orders wrong and forget things, so always make sure you double check that you got what you asked for. I always recommend this place though, I love the food here."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I visited their Sherman Oaks location before they closed, I LOVED their desserts. I couldn't contain myself and ordered all of them. I'm lactose intolerant and appreciate vegan desserts so much. Once they closed I started visiting their food truck and I cannot get enough of their Nashville ""chicken"" sandwich! And I don't know what is up with their fries, but they are honestly the best fries I've ever had. I also really enjoy their honey mustard which is a condiment I normally don't like, but theirs is 100%! The owner tended to me each time and he is so kind and funny, he cracks me up every time I go. Maybe it's because I stalk their Instagram and show up as soon as they open and have been first in line! LOL"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"This place has the BEST vegan fried chicken ever! And biscuits, and gravy, and Mac n cheese. Oh and the phish and chips - SO creative!! All of their stuff is to die for. I have 3 younger boys, and this is by far the meal they look forward to the most. Definitely an indulgent meal, and so worth the indulgence. The portions are huge and the owner is so generous. Both the truck and the storefront provide excellent quality food and great customer service."
12/5/2020,2 star rating,I had the Nashville x3 (the hottest) was not hot at all. Didn't taste bad but was not what I expected also ordered the fish and chips texture was there but not that flavor. The fries were the best Part about the meal. 6/10
3/7/2020,5 star rating,"I went to this truck for the first time yesterday at First Fridays at Abbott Kinney, and I was blown away! I had the Unreal Reuben as a main course, which was unbelievable. The seitan had the exact texture of strips of corned beef, and the sauerkraut and cashew sauce complemented the flavors very well. I've never had a Reuben with meat, but I can't imagine it being better than this!I also tried a piece of my friend's Fried Chick'n-- just wow. You need to try it for yourself. The texture is exactly like a piece of chicken, and the sauces were also tasty. Whether you're looking for meatless alternatives to some of your comfort favorites, or just want some really good vegan food, look no further. You'll want to come again and again and again-- I know I will!"
9/7/2021,5 star rating,I love love love this place!! I have been vegan for 8 months and am always looking for new restaurants to try. I was so glad I found Original Herbivore online. The staff is friendly courteous and polite. The prices are reasonable for the portion size. I was expecting it to be a bit more expensive as vegans spots usually are. I dont mind paying for quality healthy food at all. It was delicious! Cant wait to try something different from the menu. I'm hooked. I'm telling all my friends! They wont believe its plant based.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I live in North LBC and I am glad that I can treat myself to this heavenly vegan food on Thursdays. Currently, their spot is on the corner lot of Orange Ave and South Street. All their food it delicious. I like their Buffalo Chick'n sadwich, their Phish and chips, and OMG those waffles are amazing!!! I recommend to order ahead of time because it takes a while to prepare and cook their delicious creations. Treat yourself to this food as soon as you can. Now I am so hungry, can't wait for my next Thursday treat day at their truck!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Best chick'n and burgers in town. Whether you go to their restaurant in Los Angeles or order from their food truck, you won't be disappointed. I'm glad that they are in Los Angeles now just a few minutes away from me because I used to have to make the drive all the way to Sherman Oaks to their food truck before but that's how amazing their food is. Staff is always super friendly and if you meet the owner himself (Sebastian) he's a stand up guy so give him a hello and a high five from 6 feet away for now at least. Lol."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,This place has some of the best Vegan Chicken I have ever had. I always get their Buffalo Chick'n Sandwich and it's so bomb! The breading on it gives you such a good crunch and that garlic aioli is so good! Their fries are also amazing. They are super fresh and the crunch on them is out of this world. Their ranch and honey mustard is so fire!! If you are ever in the area definitely check them out! You will not be disappointed. You can order ahead of time or in-store. The staff is always super nice and friendly. Definitely my go-to place when I want a chicken sandwich.
11/29/2020,5 star rating,"Ordered the chick'n and waffles and took a bit of time but completely fine, the food was delicious and hot when I received it. The waffles were made perfectly, soft with a very slight crunch with a bit powdered sugar on top, the chick'n was pretty good too, hot and fresh. I like how they give you a wooden fork and knife with your to go package, very eco friendly. I'll come back again for the same thing or maybe I'll try the ghost pepper sammich."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Amazing place!Just one look at their insta and my mouth starts to water!I really hope we're on the tip of the plant based ice berg!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,This spot is so good! We are trying to be more conscious about our food and we love that the taste we grew up with [fried chicken] is not compromised. Got the fries extra crispy and that extra crunch completed the meal. We love the Original Herbivore!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Best chick'n sandwich in town! I've taken multiple non-vegan friends there too and everyone is fan. I eat there more often than I probably should..
11/5/2020,3 star rating,"Very disappointed. Yelp is listing the brick and mortar location in Sherman Oaks. I just drove out of my way to try it out and the space is vacant with a sign ""closed for construction"". Would be nice if the listing would be updated."
6/23/2021,5 star rating,"We just ate at this hidden, strip-mall gem on Wilshire for the very first time and we are hooked! We also talked about all of the non-vegans we know who would appreciate the food. The chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy, with a deliciously lofty bun, and the right balance of pickles and slaw. The fish and chips were indescribable! So crispy and light, and we failed at figuring out the mystery of what has been fried in lieu of fish. No spoilers here, but now that I know, I will tell you it is much healthier than fish. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and delicious. We will definitely be back!"
8/30/2020,1 star rating,"Im giving this place a one star for the following reasons: 1.) 2 of the 3 items I wanted to order were not available. I was advised the jerk chicken needed to ordered a day in advance, and I was offered to wait an hour to order the baklava because is was not ready yet. 2.) The service was slow and poor. I waited in line 20 mins even though I ordered over the phone 25 mins before my arrival. There is no system for customers who order via phone versus walk-in customers.  No one was apologetic for the missing menu items or the long hold times. 3.) I ordered a 6 pieces bucket of chicken and only got 5 pieces. The chicken was under seasoned, and the accompanying sauces didn't help to mask the blandness (with the exception of the honey mustard).4.) The ""6"" piece bucket of chicken was a $26.46 waste of money and a 20 mile drive waste of time and energy.I do not recommend this vegan eatery."
9/20/2020,5 star rating,My first time here and its amazing I bought the bucket of chicken it was amazing .I'm for sure coming g back here soon.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food and service! Can't wait to be back at the Corona Park Vegan IE Depot for more.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,One highlight of the pandemic was discovering this food truck as my family and I looked for an safe alternative vegan option when we are not cooking at home.  I would say it's rare to eat food that tastes as good as it looks on Instagram.  That is what sets Original Herbivores product apart.  When people ask me do you miss the non-vegan food you used to eat.  I say always say nope because of trucks like this.  Their plant-based tenders are Bomb.  Their Phish & Chips are Bomb.  Their sandwiches are bomb!  Most Importantly their staff is bomb!  Best in Southern California.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Original Herbivore has good food and service.  I ordered the banana blossom (fish) and chips last week and a chicken bucket for my friend both were terrific.   I am happy to spend my vegan dollars at an ethical and kind business.
3/22/2021,5 star rating,The vegan fried chicken here is amazing it was my first time trying it and it didn't disappoint. The spices or seasoning that they used made the chicken almost taste like the real thing. Sadly didn't take any photos to busy eating lol .
1/8/2021,5 star rating,I haven't been lucky enough yet to try but I can't wait!  I hope y'all come to San Diego soon!  Nashville Chik'n is my favorite. I can't believe anyone could take any action against someone who condemned violence. I say good riddance to that kind of rubbish. You guys rock!
11/17/2021,5 star rating,"Tried the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and the Mac and cheese with fried and really enjoyed both! The ""chicken"" was super crispy, Good portion sizes and quick service and everything was really delicious!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,The food here is UNREAL. Wow. I am still blown away at that cauliflower. The flavors are so well put together and these people are so kind. Makes me happy to support this place!!! Can't wait to come back!
6/7/2020,1 star rating,"I had been looking forward to trying their chikn for several weeks. I got the biggest bucket they have. I ordered the regular and lemon pepper. The texture is crunchy and the breaded exterior is held nicely. It LOOKS incredibly appetizing but I'm sorry to say it was not. I don't know if it was their off day. But the chikn was absolutely bland.   When I say no flavor I mean it. It's like they added no seasoning whatsoever. Just because the food is vegan does not mean it has to be bland. I could have saved some money and bought myself a bag of the tasty morning star chikn nuggets. I thought the price was also a bit high considering that the bucket is not that big and there is not much chickn. I felt like I was given more hash browns aka (tater tots) than anything. Wanted to have my meat eating husband try it in order to convince him to eat less meat but will definitely skip original herbivore. I also had to wait a very long time to receive my food would have preferred if they were able to stick to the time frame they set up. It is not very fun waiting around with a baby in your car in this virus era. Seems more of a hyped up food truck. Changing my review to one star since the owner decided to message me just to tell me I should have contacted them directly instead of posting a review. Incredibly unprofessional in my opinion. I've left reviews and have had owners reach out to me in a professional manner this feels far from it. In all honesty if the owner truly wanted to  ""make things right"" he could have still done so instead he decided to reply in a defensive tone. If you read the other negative reviews the owner always replies back in a defensive and rude tone. Doesnt seem to take negative feedback very well. ""Ma'am. I wish you contacted us directly to give us a chance to make things right instead of posting a public review.If for every 1000 happy chick'n customers we get 1 unhappy it's hard to adjust the recipe. Thanks for your feedback!"""
5/1/2020,2 star rating,"We are in the middle of changing out the stove on the boat so we went up to the apartments and found this truck scheduled for Friday. The Buffalo chicken was good. I recommend you stick with the chicken only. It was crispy.. The dumplings were lackluster and the pastrami was awful. None of us could force it down. The flavor was so off. Had it gone bad? Other people here seemed to have enjoyed it, but one of the worst things I've been served in a very long time. If not for COVID-19, I would've taken it back up to them. $13! Not worth my time. Again, stick with the chicken. The fries were perfectly crisp. Only a couple food trucks have hit value and taste for me. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I normally avoid trucks. I was desperate and hungry though. I knew the risks and I took it."
5/9/2021,5 star rating,Btw make sure to try their milkshakes. I'm not sure why they arent marketing that beautiful creation like it deserves.
4/18/2021,5 star rating,"Finally got to try them at IEveganSundays and the Buffalo chicken sandwich was on point. The famous bucket of fried chick'n was a nice shareable item that was simple and delicious. As for the Mac and cheese, idk what the inspiration was but I couldn't figure out what it wanted to be lol sorry I have to be honest. It's a side dish that I've yet to find done really well as a vegan but I know it's out there. Not this one though unfortunately but still 5 stars because that's not what you go there for anyway."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Best Buffalo vegetarian chicken I've ever had, served my great people who love what they do and love their customers. They are extremely clean and every is prepared With love. Their food satisfies vegans and meat eaters alike. I can't recommend this business enough!!!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Love this place their food is bomb the spices are on point the flavor on their sauces is just mouthwatering, hands down the best vegan fried chicken spot ever. And there's a bonus they have sandwiches pizza and other delicious vegan treats that are made with love The owner is super sweet and works very hard especially the employees. If you haven't gone you should! Can't wait to come back again!"
1/9/2021,5 star rating,"This place is a true gem! Whether your totally vegan, plant based, or just enjoy delicious food, OH has you covered. One of the things I missed most going vegetarian and then vegan was fried chicken. I actually think theirs is better than the real thing since there's no nasty bits to deal with, no bones, skin, and best of all, no cruelty involved. If I could make one tiny request, it would be to offer a different alternative to the current fish n chips. I love vegan fish n chips, but this really wasn't my thing, and I found it very greasy. But hey maybe it's just me? Everything else has been off the charts amazing including the tater tots and potato salad which I don't usually like from other places. We have to drive 40 minutes each way to get food from the original herbivore and trust me, we wouldn't do it if it wasn't delicious. Check them out. You'll be glad you did!"
5/18/2020,5 star rating,"Holy crap, their vegan ribs are the best ribs I've had since the meat ones I loved at Tony Roma's as a kid. And these don't have any bones so they're less gross and have even more 'meat' to enjoy! They're also super crispy which is the best part . I was wasn't even hungry and devoured all three at once. Glad they are going to have a brick-n-mortar in sherman oaks soon! Took away one star bc I'm waiting for them to offer a side of only ribs on their menu ."
1/9/2021,5 star rating,Absolutely love these guys. Will drive long distances anytime we have a craving for fried chicken. Don't skip them!!!

You must check this place out , I am the only vegan in my family but whenever I mention I'm coming to eat here , they come with me ! Honestly it's just great vegan food , for both vegan and non-vegans , trust me ... you'll want to come back !! Ugh I'm craving it now ......."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I discovered this place a few months ago on Instagram. I was so happy to find out their restaurant had literally just opened in my neighborhood. So far I've had the ""phish n chips"" , the chick'n bucket, and the chick'n and waffles. All of them were soooooo freakin good! I brought my boyfriend who isn't vegan but he definitely appreciated the spot on taste of the ""Phish and Chips"", so much that he went back again. I will continue to support this restaurant they have always been so kind to me and truly care for ALL of their customers"
1/10/2021,5 star rating,BESR VEGAN FOOD EVERRRRR!!!! Not only does this company care about their craft but they care about people too  I live an hour away but I am always driving out to the LA area to grab a bite on my days off. Make sure you stop by and try it when you're in town!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"OH has the absolute besttttttt vegan fish and chips I've ever had. Not a block of tofu, not the frozen gardein ones, but something you've never had before. So good. They're chick'n is also amazing! Plus, they're wonderful people always looking out for their customers. They also speak out against racial inequality, unapologetically. We love you Original Herbivore!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Made the effort to drive here from South Bay on a day off and it was so worth it! I didn't know when I'd get a chance to try it again so I got the regular chicken sandwich, chicken and waffles, and Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing! Sometimes I don't like vegan ""chicken"" where it's just a thick slab of somewhat tasteless protein (seitan or whatever) but original herbivore's was actually flavorful. Also, I drove all the way back after some errands and it stayed pretty crispy! Mac and cheese was close to the one I make so I'd say it's one of the better vegan macs I've tried. I'll def be back."
3/27/2021,5 star rating,The best vegan chicken sandwich I have ever had. The chili cheese fries were also exquisite! I dream about this place.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Best vegan fried chick'n! Found these guys' food truck at food truck event and once I tasted it, I was so happy that I could now eat fried chickn again! Fried chicken was one of the foods I missed most after becoming a vegetarian (I have a salty tooth) but now I don't have to miss it! I wish their restaurant was closer to me but I try to order from them whenever their truck is around. Cool and kind owners too! I recommend them even if you aren't vegan. It's just good food."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"The food here is incredible! I drove over 40 minutes just to eat here! I love the food! They were very friendly and very accommodating!

I highly recommend this place!! You should definitely eat here and support this business!"

1/8/2021,5 star rating,"They stopped by San Diego a month ago and oh man their ""chicken"" is the stuff I have been dreaming about since I started following them years ago on social media. If I lived near them in LA it would be a problem that might turn into an addiction that I would probably eventually need professional help for. Great news is they are coming back to SD 1/31 and I hope coming down becomes a more regular occurrence."

12/9/2021,1 star rating,"Went to them pre-covid and a few other times in 2020, and loved them! It was a bit pricey, yes, but I figured I was willing to pay it for some good food. Fast forward to now, I had them at UCLA and it was just...not good to put it lightly. I got the fried chicken sandwich with fries and both items were incredibly salty, and the chicken had this off-putting taste I couldn't identify - other than being brine-like. I was also missing the greens in mine - wish I took a picture to show! I think the green would have definitely helped the saltiness situation. Not sure if the saltiness was a fluke, or something they do at UCLA as a way to appeal to the college students, but it was sickly salty, with even the bun being salted on top. I couldn't finish the food, my boyfriend had a part of the chicken patty and we had to throw the rest out because it was just way too salty for us to finish. I plan to perhaps come back and try their fish again, as I was a huge fan of that last year, but still a bit weary that it's changed perhaps."

9/24/2020,1 star rating,"I wish I could give this place higher than a one star, but I can't...here's why. Here is my honest review and true account. My friend and I ordered the chicken sandwich and fish and chips to split. We received a text message stating they did not have the fish and chips. We were bummed, but since we took the long drive, ordered the chicken and waffles instead on the fish and chips. For the inconvenience we asked for an extra fry but they declined and said the owner said they couldn't.  My friend even ordered a Mac and cheese still. That's fine. Later, the man at the register came to our car and informed that we needed to pay $2 extra for the price difference of the waffles. That's fine.We then received our order after a long wait only to find the waffles stale and cold. We were confused as to why they were hard and cold. I didn't want to make a fuss, but if we couldn't receive our original order, at least have the waffles be hot. We would have been OK with them at least being warm. I informed the man at the register of the situation and ASSURED him that we were happy with the chicken sandwich, but informed him of the waffle situation. He informed me that they were hot and that there was nothing he could do. He never check them or anything. He went to the back to speak with the cook, returned, and asked if I wanted a return for the money. I didn't wanna return because I didn't want to seem like I was trying the scheme, but simply at least have the waffle warmed. I ended up accepting his offer for money return if that's what they had to offer. We ended it by him giving me a random $2 and some change and was told the rest of the funds would be returned to the card. My friend nor I ate the waffles and when I bit the chicken it seemed not cooked. How?? But it's fine. Lesson learned. The plot thickens.As we ate the chicken sandwich, the cook leaves the food truck, walks across the lot to our car(which I'm surprised he found us), and proceeded to tell me I had a vendetta since I ordered. I informed him that I didn't and that I'm not able to eat the waffle and that's fine. At this point because he had a mask on and couldn't talk how he wanted, he pulls off his mask bent over in our car window. He proceeds to state his case, which at this point I don't want to fuss, because it's not in me to do so.  I repeat have a great day and he eventually leaves the car. I'm not sure why he felt the need to come over.I didn't get the order I wanted, didn't fuss about not getting the fries, nor the warm waffle(which should be a given) so why did he come to the car to tell me off.  Even after all of that I would have chopped it up as a loss, but when he came to my car, I had to write this review. On a final note, the Mac had zero flavor, which...how do you mess up in Mac and cheese. The man at the register also called my friend sweetie, which she felt heavily disrespected and grossed by. Lesson learned. But kindness and decent customer service should be across the board. I can't make this up. If I could, Id be rich.Edit: Even if they gave the whole meal free, the food was still lacking flavor and stale. Poor food is poor food. This post is not about it being free, it's the customer service. The man who responded to this is the man who came to my car. I can't make this up. I of course tried the waffles only to find that they were stale and cold and threw them away. This man seems, by his accent, to be from another country, and with all due respect, may have a different customer service etiquette. I've done a fair share of traveling to know customer service is different around the world.Anyone who wishes to eat at this food truck is welcome to do so at their own risk. If you like this place, by all means keep eating there. It's not a loss on my part and I think everyone deserves great food and service in 2020. Was this it? No. It is what it is."
1/10/2021,5 star rating,"THE. BEST. VEGAN FOOD. EVER! I literally cannot stop thinking about when I can eat this again and how many orders are too many for 1 person. :) It is the perfect texture and flavor and crunch. Got the OG chicken sandwich, the vegan brioche bun is another level too. Wish I lived closer to LA to get this every day, but excited to visit vegan depot again in Corona to have my fix! I'm hooked for life! I've been stalking their instagram just drooling over all the food since I discovered them. You have to try! You will not be disappointed. I honestly like this 1000% times more than regular fried chicken (before I went vegan). Plant and meat eaters alike will love this place. Staff was very nice as well!"

1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Best tasting vegan products. I was hooked instantly on the unreal Reuben. I would drive over an hour to eat at their truck and even compared other vegan reubens, but none could hold a candle to their's. Then when I tried their fried chicken - a whole new dimension. I've never been a fan of a lot of fried food, but I didn't have a problem hogging all of their fried chicken to myself. Not sharing. Thank you for making homemade vegan products and sharing the love! You're talented!"
1/8/2021,4 star rating,"Love the food here! I've never experienced the truck, only the brick & mortar restaurant. Such good ""chicken"". Juicy, delicious and decadent. I'd come here again and again. And I love the southern cuisine theme: Mac & cheese, collards, etc. So fun!"

The waffles were fluffy and tasty with powdered sugar and butter, but the chick'n is what really blew us away. It was crispy, well seasoned, and tasted like the real deal. Their food is delicious and would have even the biggest meat eater stumped as to how it's vegan! Definitely a must try, whether you are vegan or not."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this food truck! My husband and I had been craving a fried ""chicken"" sandwich after going plant based 2 years ago and this satisfied the craving! It does not taste vegan at all and honestly a meat eater would have no clue. Can't wait to come back and indulge again!!"
9/10/2021,5 star rating,"I just tried this for the first time today and I must say it was absolutely delicious. Please support this place, if you want good vegan comfort food this is the place to go to. I ordered their lemon pepper chicken and Korean bbq chicken it was amazing. I also had their phish and chips and that was great too. Seasoned well, texture just right, just mmmmmmmm yeah. Its worth it. This is coming from someone who rarely ever writes reviews too. This is goooooood. lol"
1/24/2021,5 star rating,"Oh my GOD!!! This is so damn good! The texture, the taste, the everything is so on point that you have to remind yourself to slow down before you choked yourself."
3/14/2020,5 star rating,One of several places i tried at Vegan Exchange and i like how they use seitan for their fried chicken.
12/8/2019,5 star rating,"So met them for first time at Desert veg fest in the Palm Springs area. The fried chicken is so fun and delicious, everyone tried it and loved it that I talk to as well. I also tried their pieroge with cashew creamAnd condiments and they were  off the charts. When I found out the owner is Polish, it made perfect sense. Poland should be proud as he represents the cuisine well!Reminder this is a food truck, limited spaceAnd the work is really hard. So for that they get five stars alone, for the quality and love in the food, another 5. Yelp needs a new system so we can give them a 10!"
5/30/2021,1 star rating,"I really hate to write a negative review but my experience was not very pleasant. I will start off by saying that I order from Original Herbivore regularly (store and food truck) so I'm a regular. I've even told non-vegan friends to try it, and they have and continue to order from them. So the food is good, in my opinion. Today my problem was, I walked into the store to pick up my order and the owner was sitting behind the register on his phone and never spoke or even looked up when I walked in and said I was picking up my order!!! There was a pleasant woman there that helped me. I didn't hear him speak a word until I was leaving and it was a mumble. Listen, I know everyone has their good and bad days but at least try to put on a happy face and speak to your customers. If you can't do that, sit in the back! That was such a negative experience and I'm all about good customer service when someone is spending a lot of money with a tip to support a local business, so I won't be back unfortunately. He's usually been pleasant in the past so I don't know. If you don't appreciate my business, I'll take it elsewhere where it's much appreciated. Very disappointing!!!"
1/9/2021,5 star rating,Just tried your food for the first time and I'm upset I haven't been in sooner. The Nashville hot sandwich was everything and the fries were crispy! The side of mac was amazing. You have my business in the future.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"The best vegan fried chicken, no question! I always look forward to when they come to San Diego and hope they open a spot here. When it is safe to do so, I will definitely go to their location because it is worth the drive and wait."
1/8/2021,4 star rating,"I have only experienced the food truck when they visit the IE, and I have to say it is pretty darn good! I got the Nashville hot sandwich and was not disappointed! There was a good kick that had flavor, not just spice! The tater tots was good and crunchy,  but they were room temperature. I bought a sandwich to go for my  guy,  and they put the coleslaw on the side so it wouldn't get soggy since he wouldn't eat it immediately.  He really enjoyed it! Very nice guy helping me with what to order,  I appreciate the recommendation and the service!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"The first time my wife brought home the fried chicken, I was hooked.  The food was unreal!  For being vegetarian friendly fried chicken, it looked, smelled, and tasted as good as the real thing.  And way, way better than most nationwide chains I've had.  A few weeks later we tried the fish and chips.  Again, wow!  It was a joy to have another meal made with such care and perfection to have the such an amazing similarity in taste, texture, look, and smell to the original.  Keep up the good work y'all!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Went to their KTown location. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my chikin bucket but I didn't mind and I love it when places make the food fresh instead of giving you something that's been under a lamp or in a warmer. The tots were really good and the chikin was BOMB. Definitely going back and will continue to support this small business
1/8/2021,5 star rating,The Original Herbivore food truck came to San Diego a few weeks back. My PGOM boyfriend and I devoured every last bite and mentioned multiple times - between bites - how we wish they had a location here in town. Epic food and kind professional staff.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I often forget to write reviews. I only leave positive reviews and I always have the best experience and the best food from Original Herbivore so this is a long time coming. You can't go wrong here. Obviously the fried chick'n, and chick'n & waffles are a must, but if you want to try something else the phish & chips are awesome. Also, the team running the truck are some really great people serving up some really great food. So try it! It's a win win!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,There fried chicken sandwich with bbq and phish and chips is amazing! But you know what's more amazing there great morals and awesome vibes. That's what makes me return every time there around!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I have loved and supported this business because they make delicious vegan food and they travel all the way to San Diego to spoil us! I am even more excited to support them because they are intelligent, kind human beings who promote equality, justice for all, public safety, peace, and love and they are not afraid to stand up for what is right and to denounce all the disgustingness going on in our county and world. I love you Original Herbivore!!!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Great staff and even better food. I haven't had a single item on their menu that hasn't impressed.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,AMAZING vegan fried chic'n! I drive about 30 minutes in traffic to get it. Not only is their food amazing but they have high moral standards which make me proud to support their establishment. A must try!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I absolutely LOVE Original Herbivore!  It is the best vegan comfort food!  The chikin is crunchy and seasoned perfectly, the waffles are delicious, the Mac and cheese is creamy and awesome. I would highly recommend the food it is absolutely amazing."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Food was great, customer service was great. 5 stars . Give them a try some really good vegan plant based food"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,I have made it a mission during this pandemic to try and support local and small businesses if I eat out and I only wish that this truck came to Anaheim more often. Not only is the food amazing (Chicken bucket with spicy Korean sauce) but I love a business who put themselves at risk of losing customers to stand up for what is RIGHT. I'm speaking as a person who isn't vegan or vegetarian the food is amazing and it makes me happy knowing that the people who make the food care about their customers. They've actually cancelled days where their batter or chikn recipe isn't up to their standards and that is the kind of integrity that brings customers back.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"My Husband and I got a chance to eat from here when the food truck came to Temecula and let me tell you it was BOMB! We've been vegans for 4 years now and this is the best vegan chick-n we have ever tasted. I highly recommend everyone to grab a bite from here when ever you do get a chance, you won't be disappointed!! Wish they would come back to Temecula more often!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Quite literally some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. An entire bucket wasn't even enough for me (though it lasted a few meals because it's huge haha) -- point is, I could literally eat this every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. Great service, great people, great food."
1/8/2021,4 star rating,"My review is for the truck and the previous Sherman Oaks location. Enjoyed the Nashville Chikn, the spanikopita, and cake. Service friendly and good. Haopy to support local vegan businesses. Looking forward to trying some of their new dishes"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Best vegan fried chick'n around! First time we had it was in Santa Ana during a vegan fest and most recently at their truck in San Diego where we live when they visited. Highly recommend!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Been following the food truck on the hunt for their vegan biscuits and gravy and finally caught them at the Corona depot. They ran out of biscuits and gravy but we did get to try the Mac and chicken and IT WAS AMAZING!!! My two little ones (not vegan, don't force them to be) tried all of it and loved it! The flavors and textures were spot on. Worth the wait if you're able to catch the truck!"

It does not taste vegan at all and honestly a meat eater would have no clue. Can't wait to come back and indulge again!!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,I discovered the food truck when I first became vegan a few years ago. I had been stumbling around as a newbie trying to make this new lifestyle choice work for me. When I had their AMAZING food it was the motivation I needed to explore things in my own kitchen & motivation to find the food truck whenever it came to my area! So yummy!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,The food here is UNREAL. Wow. I am still blown away at that cauliflower. The flavors are so well put together and these people are so kind. Makes me happy to support this place!!! Can't wait to come back!
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Finally got a chance to try food from the truck which I've been drooling over on IG, and it did not disappoint! The Italian beef sandwich was what motivated me to finally go, haven't had one since quitting meat, and it was intensely tasty, juicy, and I'm now jonesing for another. Got a bucket of chicken too, the breading on the chicken is so perfectly crunchy and wonderful that I can't wait to try the 'fish' and chips next time!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Great vegan food. Their chicken bucket is amazing. They added new flavors too. Try the jerk or lemon pepper flavor
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food and service! Can't wait to be back at the Corona Park Vegan IE Depot for more.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Original Herbivore is a super great add to the LA vegan scene. They make super tasty and delicious food and i hope they start growing more and expanding in the future. Some of the best vegan fried chicken I've had!
10/20/2019,2 star rating,"My family and I had been waiting for their truck to come to a location nearby. So when we saw they were at the VegFest, we were super excited! Sadly, it was a HUGE disappointment (outside of the unreal Rueben, which was very good). The fired chicken had no flavor and a very rubbery almost gooey consistency, this sadly was also in the buffalo chick sandwich and my son tossed it, too!) we couldn't even eat it, it was so gross! My husband got the Bitchin Burger  and it was OK, he said but he's had better almost everywhere) Well, the good news? No more looking for their truck to show up in OC, we vegans will look elsewhere!Now Seabirds Cafe? That is a vegans dream! We eat there every Friday night. WOWd every time!"
1/11/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food delicious chick'n! Amazing staff ! Can't wait to try their new item chili cheese fries !
5/11/2021,5 star rating,Great serves and fulfills the craving for a hot chiken sandwich!! Would want to go again and maybe try the chiken bucket. Over all a great experience!!
12/3/2020,4 star rating,"It was our first time going there. It was really delicious. I seriously would rather eat this than real chicken tenders. It was that good. the crust was amazing! Super flaky and crispy. I'm really impressed. I highly recommend this to anyone who used to love chicken and went vegan. The cauliflower wings were also crispy and delicious. The only thing I think they could improve upon is the sauce, I got the ranch and honey mustard. They lacked a bit of flavor but not bad. I feel like the ranch had a little bit too much of a dill flavor but overall the meal was delicious"
7/20/2020,2 star rating,"Prices appear below average. The food quality was decent (warmth, freshness, etc.). Time it took to get food was good. However, the thing that lacks big time is the flavor. At first, the food looks great. But then once eaten, it is not so. The tator tots and chicken just seemed really bland. No flavor at all. I would definitely rate this below average. Other people that I know that have had this food too all said the same thing as well (therefore it's not just me with this opinion). Simple, constructive feedback on this establishment."
5/13/2021,5 star rating,Just got food from the food truck. Wow!  Whole family loved it.  Waffles were amazing and the chicken sandwich and bucket of chicken were devoured in minutes. Great dipping sauces too!
4/17/2021,5 star rating,Spot is absolutely fire. Best vegan chicken I have had in LA. I recommend the lemon pepper with that honey sauce.
5/13/2021,2 star rating,"Extremely greasy and salty. In a way that made it inedible. Fish was just banana blossom with no other attempt to add any flavor. The chicken was just meh. And there was a crack head casing the strip mall, back and forth."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"This place is so amazing, the Nashville Hot Chick'n sandwich is so great.  I can't wait to try their wings.  I normally go to the food truck but their location is now really close to me and I plan to go within the next week. (also I am happy to see businesses stand up for their beliefs and to stand up against injustices)"
4/5/2021,4 star rating,"I had been wanting to try this place for a while. After ordering my food, when I was paying, I felt pressured to tip as the person taking my order kept looking at my screen. I ordered the chilly cheese fries and some fried chicken. I'm not too picky but to be honest, the chilly cheese fries did not taste good at all. The portions were SMALL. Too small for $30, Barely any fries. I was shocked! And disappointed. As for the chicken, it was pretty delicious! It lived up to my expectations. I could barely tell it wasn't real chicken. It had a nice crisp, not too greasy and a good flavor. Debating whether to go back or not."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Original Herbivore is a super great add to the LA vegan scene. They make super tasty and delicious food and i hope they start growing more and expanding in the future. Some of the best vegan fried chicken I've had!
4/21/2021,2 star rating,"2 stars is bc the food, I was very excited to try them at the vegan fest in IE. everything looked delicious but it was not. Mac and cheese was bland. Bucket of chicken was okay but not delicious and pricy. I do not recommend the ranch as it has no flavor. They do charge extra for sauces FYI. The staff was super nice but it did take almost 45 minutes to get our food so if you really want to try it then have patience."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"New to the neighborhood and just found this yummy vegan place on IG. Had one of the spicy chicken sandwiches and it was great. Can't wait to check out more of the options. Take away only right now but inside looks bright, clean and cheerful for when indoor opens again."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Amazing, delicious food!  My husband is not vegan and really enjoyed it.  Wonderful people too!  Do yourself a favor and try it!  I would give 100 stars if I could."
3/7/2021,5 star rating,"Got the Original (ranch) and the Nashville (level1 hotness was enough spice. Don't know how people do any higher levels). Both sandwiches were so good and so filling! Loved the pickles and the flavor . Yum! Fries and tots were good as well. Liked the tots a little more than the fries , but both were excellent"
12/12/2020,1 star rating,"Terrible food and customer service. I drove 25 minutes to check them out with high hopes. Maybe too high. I ordered the chkn and waffles my waffle was so hard when I bit into it, it cut my mouth. I  Went back to exchange for something else , the man in charge was not helpful. I then asked for a refund and he said I can get store credit for next time. I asked if I could use the credit today and he said ""no only next time"". After this experience I don't plan on coming back."
3/23/2021,5 star rating,"Truly a fantastic place. The food is DELICIOUS the staff are gracious, the experience is always a highlight of my week when I am able to get my bucket of vegan chikn! Absolutely a fan. Everyone try this one out :)"
12/10/2020,5 star rating,"What an amazing experience. The flavor, texture, and appearance of their products are outstanding. Truly a fan. I will be returning real soon to more of this delicious chick'n"
3/23/2021,5 star rating,"Hands down the best fried chickn. Taste and texture is spot on. The batter seasoning is better than anything out there - ckicn or chicken. My husband is a super skeptic on anything mimicking ""traditional"" foods and he LOVES Original Herbivore. Our favorite treat. And the tots are fantastic also."
3/23/2021,1 star rating,"This was a sad day. After supporting this company from afar for my boyfriend and I finally went to try them in LA; a 40-minute drive from where we live. After waiting several minutes to be acknowledged, we were excited to finally be helped and to get our food. Then while paying at the cashier, a cockroach ran across one side of the counter right towards where our food was. My boyfriend and I both saw this and reluctantly decided we would rather eat somewhere else as a precaution. We told the cashier about the roach and said we would prefer to eat somewhere else. The cashier was understanding and went to get the owner to issue a refund, who, instead of apologizing became extremely defensive and insisted we did not see what we both saw, no apologies whatsoever! We were so hurt by how arrogant she was after we drove 40 minutes to support this business. The minute we stood waiting for our refund was so uncomfortable. Luckily there are plenty of other vegan burger joints that appreciate their customers, so you don't have to make the mistake of coming here like we did."
3/23/2021,5 star rating,"This is place is bomb, the phish n chips is absolutely unreal. The owners are super nice and the service is always great"
8/9/2020,5 star rating,"Original Herbivore's vegan fried chick'n was incredibly delicious. I've been vegan for over 3 years so I've had my fair share of vegan chick'n, and this food truck takes the crown. My fiancé and I ordered a bucket of the Original with a side of their buffalo and Carolina BBQ  sauce (which was A+), their Flamin' Hot Cheeto bucket which was the perfect amount of spicy, and their Vegan 'phish n' chips' which was surprisingly tasty and indistinguishable from actual 'fish n' chips'. Vegan 'phish' is always a tough one to crack, but this was the best I've had. It was made with marinated banana blossoms, so all-natural compared to the overly processed, soy based ones on the market. Can't wait to order from this truck again!"
1/7/2020,1 star rating,"Got major attitude for asking about my order. They serve the food out of order (as highlighted by other reviews here) and when I did order I asked if the fried chicken bucket or the sandwich was quicker. She said the bucket would be 20 mins and the sandwich closer to 10-15 minutes so I ordered the sandwich. The guys in front of me's bucket came up, then the 3 orders behind me bucket's came up. Then 3 more sandwiches behind me came up so I asked if there was a chicken sandwich and the guy responded ""probably not"" sarcastically. I told him that I was told the sandwich was quicker than the fired chicken and he dismissed me saying at all takes the same time - which doesn't explain why 4 separate orders behind me came out before me. And when I got my sandwich it was mediocre at best. If you want a great vegan hot chicken sandwich there's a truck at the monthly Abbott Kinney food truck night. It's incredible. Won't be frequenting Original Herbivore again.LOL - the comment from the owner is exactly the attitude I refer to. I did not storm the back door as he says. I simply asked about my food. There also wasn't a long line. And yes, the food would have been more bearable if the owner wasn't an asshole, but don't get me wrong - the food was still basic and mediocre. Even without the douchebag owner I still wouldn't go back. Stop being defensive and be better.LOL again, another douchebag response from a douchebag business owner. I don't drink. I'm Muslim. Throw punches? I came up to the window and asked a question. You're not only a douchebag but a pathological liar. You are clearly pulling this out of your ass instead of listening to the feedback and getting better. Good luck with that. Now you not only have an unsatisfied customer but one who will recommend that everyone he knows avoid your truck. Also, the line wasn't long that day, and the food was bad. Stop deflecting and grow up douchebag."
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Best vegan chicken I've ever had! Worth the drive. Follow their Instagram for Their different locations through the week.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"I had the fried chick'n basket and fried chick'n sandwich from the truck when it was parked at Earle's Meatless Mondays. The basket and sandwich were both delicious, well seasoned and fried to perfection. Sometimes my fried vegan food is too oily or the oil is old and I can taste it in the food; Not here! Perfect all around. AND, the customer service is top notch!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,Great vegan food. Their chicken bucket is amazing. They added new flavors too. Try the jerk or lemon pepper flavor
3/30/2019,4 star rating,"Tried the Ruben at the IE Vegan Festival. Yummy sandwich, fair prices.I agree with the other reviewer that the wait time was unreasonable, even compared to other busy food trucks. Also, the food descriptions on the menu aren't totally accurate--the burger came without avacado, for example.Good food. But worth the wait? If you're alone or not into talking to strangers for an hour, then I'd say no."
9/2/2020,5 star rating,"They have really outdone their customer service and are very upfront and honest about any hiccups in the food quality. The Korean BBQ wings were my favorite and my boyfriend (who isn't vegan) loved the buffalo chick'n sandwich!! Overall great food and service, support local businesses!!"
2/27/2021,5 star rating,Go and order the chicken and waffles! It was very good and the service was super friendly. Can't wait to try more.
1/21/2020,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious!  The staff are kind and helpful. The chick'n was amazing! Wait time is a bit long (15-20 minutes for fries and fried chick'n but definitely  worth it! Food was popping hot and fresh. I will definitely be seeking them out to try other items  on their menu!!
8/6/2020,5 star rating,"Today we ate the fried chick'n, the flaming hot cheetos chick'n and the phish and chips. All were so delish! The fried chick'n and the phish were perfectly crispy and delicious! Exactly what a former meat eater would expect.  The flaming hot cheetos chick'n was so flavorful too! By far some of the best plant based food I've ever had! Will be back again soon."
9/27/2020,5 star rating,"I'll start by saying this- my partner is a lactose intolerant hardcore carnivore. I dragged him over by surprise to get him to give vegan food a try. He ordered the Nashville sandwich, I ordered the Mac and Cheese. There wasn't much of a line (Saturday afternoon). The food was out within 5 minutes of us ordering, super fresh! The person in the truck was patient and explained the difference between ordering from the truck and the cafe. We took our food to a nearby park and ate. His first bite, he said it was good. He poked at my Mac and Cheese and said it was amazing. I got filled up from my order of Mac and Cheese, something I wasn't expecting. It had a lot of flavor- they weren't kidding when they said it's nacho style!  An hour after we finished our food, he said he wouldn't mind going back someday. The next day, he said he wouldn't mind driving the 7 miles to pick up some Original Herbivore for our next date night. He finally agrees Vegan food is good and affordable! Thank you Original Herbivore!"
1/11/2021,5 star rating,This place is great! I'm so happy when they come to Long Beach. I love that they have different flavors of chikn! Love what this food truck stands for. Definitely visit this food truck next time you see the schedule on Instagram
1/8/2021,5 star rating,I've been a vegetarian for almost 20 years and this is hands down the best vegan fried chicken I've ever had.  My non- vegan husband and I are hooked! We truly appreciate their care and concern in reg to food related allergies. The owners have always been very kind and I want nothing more than for this business to succeed.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"Vegan Fried ""chicken"". Sign me up. I love the food and the vibes here. I will definitely be back for more !!!!"
1/8/2021,5 star rating,love this place so much. everything is so ridiculously good. highly recommend any of the chick'n sandwiches (my personal favorite is the nashville hot chick'n sandwich) or even just get a bucket of chick'n. the mac n cheese is fantastic too.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,The food is amazing! By far the best tasting vegan Chickn I've had. Oh and don't get me started on the vegan Phish and chips knock ya socks off good!!!! super delicious and affordable. Every-time I come here it feels like family good people with great service.
1/8/2021,5 star rating,"They're good is great!  And they care about our planet and social justice.  Very sad they closed in Sherman oaks, but we highly recommend their rueben , fried chicken and fish and chips!!"
1/23/2021,5 star rating,"Ok I've tried a lot of mock chicken in LA but this is just unreal. Am I sure it's not chicken? No. Am I sure it's delicious and gives those Korean wing shops a run for their money? Yes. If you ever want to fool meat-eating friends into eating vegan, go here, then go ""psych""!!!"
2/19/2019,4 star rating,Found them at Super Vegan Sunday at DTLA.  I had the fish-and-chips. 1st time having vegan fish-and-chips and they were delicious. Flaky just like real fish & nice and crunchy. Amazing.
5/14/2021,1 star rating,"after seeing all the hype on social media over this place I decided to give it a try. I paid over $30 for a bucket of ""fried chicken"", tots, and a chocolate milkshake. I believe I ordered a BBQ flavor. Anyway I liked the tots, but the chicken not so much. I will never come here again and I do not recommend it. Also my sister said the cashier at the K-town restaurant was very rude and after reading the owners responses to several reviews, I definitely believe it. He sounds like a huge asshole and for that reason alone I would never recommend this place. I love LETTUCE FEAST and recommend Lettuce Feast.  In my opinion their food is much better and the owners are very nice. Almost forgot to mention that one review said that they saw a roach in the restaurant. I don't know if its true, but maybe someone can verify. Although I can't say I recommend this business, I do recommend you read the owners responses and decide whether u want to support someone who conducts himself in that manner. No thank you."
11/2/2019,2 star rating,"I'm so sorry because the woman at the truck was so friendly, which is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. We had the kimchi Mac n cheese. It didn't not taste of kimchi whatsoever. I've had vegan Mac n cheese in the past and it was pretty good. However, the pasta was overcooked and so mushy, the vegan cheese didn't taste good, and the kimchi was non-existent. I really wanted to like this."
9/19/2018,4 star rating,I had the poutine jackfruit fries which were not on the menu but I saw the vendor announce it on FB that they would make it upon request. It was delicious! I highly recommend and would definately go back for more and to try more items on their menu.
1/14/2021,5 star rating,"Covid safe, and the best fried chicken sandwich in LA vegan or not. Definitely recommend the Mac and cheese as well! Silky smooth and delicious, and you can't go wrong with their delicious French  fries."
1/10/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food and people who run it. They are good people. Please support. Their food-truck is always on time and delivering the best vegan eats out here in Corona at our Vegan Depot farmers market. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication.
9/8/2018,5 star rating,Just had the Buffalo 'chicken' sandwich today outside TradeWinds bar and grill. It was hands down the best vegan buffalo sandwich I have ever had! Their seitan  fried patty was So So delicious. The menu had burgers and a Rueben sandwich that looked good also. Find this truck!

6/30/2020,1 star rating,"I highly recommend vegan LETTUCE FEAST truck over Original Herbivore.  Everyone in the Lettuce Feast truck wore masks and gloves when preparing their insanely delicious food. When I asked the owner/chef of Original Herbivore to wear a mask and gloves while preparing our food (because my mother is immune compromised and I don't want to catch the virus, either), he refused and said he legally didn't have to. Honestly, that's what he said. Search out Lettuce Feast. Nicest people, better food, far better customer service."

4/24/2021,1 star rating,"I just went to this food truck at the corona vegan farmers market. When I got to the cashier( a white male) I was told no service without a mask. I had forgotten my mask and went back to get one. I came back with mask and got served. However after receiving my food I noticed not one but two other white males were served without having a mask in sight. The rules should apply to every one, not just people who are not white. Disgusted at this behavior. There is no plausible reason why this guy did this other than being racist! Respond to the owner. How can I be mistaken when I saw with my eyes the guy service 2 white guys without mask. I alerted someone else to the situation and they too saw . No mask. I don't care what race the cashier was. He clearly pick and choose who the rules apply to. FYI I have no problem wearing a mask or following any rule an establishment may have. Instead of making sure it never happens again u come on here to denounce a customer."
5/8/2018,5 star rating,"This was my second time trying Original Herbivore. The first time we tried them at the La Mesa Wineworks. I've been following OH on FB so I thought I'd check them out. Recently, I mentioned to my Apt Complex that I was looking for more vegan options here (since they host food trucks often) and fortunately OH was able to come! My BF and I really enjoyed the food - AGAIN. I tried the Falafel Secret Menu Item which was delicious and my boyfriend tried the burger with Mac and cheez and a side of fries (the fries we tasty &he said the burger was good too). Food is savory and filling. Since we were the first there, there was no wait. Win, win :) I will have to try the reuben sandwich next time because I've heard good things about that one."

8/30/2020,5 star rating,I went to the restaurant deli in Sherman oaks! The goat cheese pizza is AMAZING! My boyfriend got the Reuben and loved it. I'm excited to try the chicken in future!
2/25/2018,5 star rating,this food truck has great vegan options! I got the Korean barbecue seitan and my mom got the tunaless sammich. both were fantastic. the seitan was seasoned well and nice and spicy. the tunaless sammich tasted very much like a tuna salad sandwich - it was so tasty! the truck had vegetarian starter guides which was amazing to see. i'm so glad they support that kind of lifestyle. they had sustainable cookwear that was made from corn- very impressive. the cashier also looked like walter white so that was pretty sweet
4/26/2019,5 star rating,"WONDERFUL food. I got to eat from this truck after a friend of mine ordered the truck for a party. They basically catered the meal while parked in the driveway. I ordered the Fried Chick'n after it had ""the bomb"" written next to it on the menu. Delicious! Also had the special - the Korean BBQ tacos. They were spicy and excellent. My son had the vegan hot dog and french fries - you couldn't tell it was vegan. very nice staff. Wonderful, 5-stars."
1/20/2018,5 star rating,"Got the chance to check them out at The Dojo event today. Try their Vegan Döner, was soooo delicious. The tsatsiki was incredible. I asked what it made from, they said cashew, tasted like the one with yogurt  Excellent!"
4/12/2018,5 star rating,"1st time eating here at the Brewery on Weds & went for the popular Reuben sandwich. Exactly the same taste & texture - amazing! Friend tried the special of the day -fish & chips made from banana flowers & very tasty too. Vegans get a discount on Weds!  Although great vegan prices to begin with. Will be coming back to try more of the menu items. Oh & ""zero waste straws & containers"" so eco friendly -saving our environment."

12/15/2019,2 star rating,First time I came here two weeks ago  and tried the Unreal Reuben which wound up being very good. I was excited  to see them back in the area to get the Reuben again but when I got it this time it looked different. The bread was a lot thicker and harder and the sauce or something that was in the sandwich was unbelievably sour/hot/spicy to the point that it overpowered the whole thing so I just threw the other half away. I still have the tingling rancid flavor in my mouth. It was such a disappointment I don't know why they changed the sandwich
8/29/2020,2 star rating,"Was so excited to finally try this place after seeing how long there lines were at every event we went to and seeing how hyped up it was, but when we finally got there, the wait was so long and the worker didn't seem to care to speed it up and I noticed that the prices were raised (I understand supply & demand, but it just didn't sit right with me seeing a piece of tape over the original price that had a higher price on it, even though other vendors I've seen multiple times haven't done this no matter how many ppl were there). The guy was nice and all. Got the food and we were incredibly disappointed and such a waste of money ): the batter on the ""chicken""  was so thick it was like eating crunchy flour, had zero flavor whatsoever, it was literally just a steak of mushy tofu overly battered. So gross. The fries were good, but were under done so the ones at the bottom of the bucket were just mush even though there wasn't that much weight on them. And the best part is that we woke up feeling sick somehow (without dairy, egg, or meat idk how?) and it couldn't of been something we previously ate bc we only had just linked up to try this place. Overall wouldn't recommend unless you have money you don't care to risk cus I understand restaurants can have their bad nights. Won't be coming back and won't be recommending it to anyone ):"
9/8/2018,5 star rating,"I've had the distinct pleasure of trying several menu items here and today, with the new Buffalo Chuckun Sandwich which I opted to pair with kimchi fries, I'm again shocked at how insanely creative, flavorful, and craveable food can be. The depth of flavor and rainbow of colors coming out of this truck make it an absolute can't miss.  Note: my omni son is among the pickiest eaters I've known and he declared the reuben ""so freaking good!""."
9/8/2018,5 star rating,Just had the Buffalo 'chicken' sandwich today outside TradeWinds bar and grill. It was hands down the best vegan buffalo sandwich I have ever had! Their seitan  fried patty was So So delicious. The menu had burgers and a Rueben sandwich that looked good also. Find this truck!

6/2/2018,3 star rating,"I got the kebab gyro. It tasted okay. Nothing particularly special, but nothing particularly wrong with it. Portions were somewhat large, but not that generous for the $10+ range. Based purely on food quality, I'd probably order from them again if it were a few dollars cheaper.Beware of upselling and extra fees. They change extra if you pay by credit card. They also trick people into overpaying by offering a choice between coleslaw and fries - presenting it as two options that are part of the meal, not as an additional purchase. Turns out the fries cost an extra $2, which you'll only know if you look at small writing on the Sides section of the menu (which isn't visible from where you're standing when you order). It's easy to miss that the price doesn't add up right when you're ordering multiple items."

Everything we have ordered was delicious and the prices are great too! I love trying all of their dishes so much, I try to follow where they will be at, and what Vegan Events or faires they will be at, just to get some more of their bomb vegan food. The chefs are awesome, and very friendly. Everything was cooked to perfection, and absolutely wonderful. My new favorite Vegan spot."

4/3/2018,5 star rating,Stopped at this truck last Friday on my way home from work to pick up dinner for the family. Even my Non-Vegans loved it! If you ever get the chance to try their amazing food selections please do! If you can be anything...be kind.
2/3/2018,4 star rating,Food was delicious! The truck looked clean and well maintained. The only reason for 4 stars is they forgot a part to our order. They were incredibly busy so it's understandable and took care of it the minute we asked. So that was cool.:) Would def check them out if you get a chance!
