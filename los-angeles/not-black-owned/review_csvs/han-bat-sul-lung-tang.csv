6/13/2022,5 star rating,"I'm not sure what else I can add to this place but it's good. It's a simple place, with a simple menu - you choose the meat that comes with the beef bone soup and you eat it with rice, and it's amazingly delicious, hearty and healthy. Love the tripe there, spleen not so much. Kimchi is great there too. Sometimes you get a kind waiter sometimes you get a possibly fierce one but you come anyways because it's that good.Oh don't forget to add the salt. It makes all the difference!"
6/2/2022,5 star rating,This place has been my go to for Seul Lang Tang. I first had this in Korea back in 2017 and have been hooked ever since. I live in the Bay Area. This place is a must for me everytime I visit LA. The Seul Lang Tang has a very strong meaty taste.I hope to come back here soon.
6/2/2022,3 star rating,"I have been coming to this place very long time (8 years). Food is delicious. That time, the cup of beef brisket soup costed $8. Over the time, they have been increasing the price little by little and now cup of soup costs $18. I understand the price increase due to this inflation. However, price is increased but to go container size decreased. They got new paper container and that size is smaller than what they used to serve. Also i just realize after opening my soup container, it is HALF FULL.After paying $18, people not getting the full size food. That is frustrating."
5/27/2022,2 star rating,"So they raised their prices and reduced the amount of meat they put in by half!!!Not worth it and going down hill.Been coming here for 25 years, will only come a couple times a year now. Used to go 3 to 4 times a month."

5/22/2022,5 star rating,"Support your local mom and pop stores y'all. This hole-in-the-wall (literally have to go through the back) serves up some hearty and satisfying beef bone soups and meats. Love how there's no pretentious attempt to be something it's not (enough of that from other people and places). The menu is SIMPLE and self-explanatory (my type of menu, I must say). Got the ""seokum"" Seolleongtang, which is basically a mix of different beef parts in your beef bone soup. I would probably not get the spleen and intestine next time cause I realized it's not my thing. People who want to be more conservative with their soup, go for the beef brisket.Soup came with a PERFECT bowl of white rice, radish kimchi, regular kimchi, and green onions.Add in the seasoning (salt and pepper) yourself, but I personally didn't think any seasoning was necessary because the pure soup itself already seemed perfect. One downer? I personally like less fermented kimchi. But whatever, because that is preference and ultimately subjective.Food comes out FAST, and the ladies working there are so efficient and accurate that you start questioning if they just walked past you or if that was God. Just kidding. But in all seriousness, there is no bs here. You get what you pay for, and you get it fast. But that also means that they put the check on your table quickly because there's a line going out the door.In and out. Hungry and satisfied. Some antonyms to describe my experience."
4/20/2022,5 star rating,"Can't even remember when was last I visited Korean Town with friends!! It feels so good to be back with an old friend to cruise around and eat around. Today we visited this well-known breakfast spot for most Korean in town named-- Han Bat Sul Lung Tang, located on the 5th St. in Los Angeles. Street parking is available but limited, we arrived around 9:30am and there were still a few spots open on the curbside in front of the restaurant. Very friendly and welcoming staffs, we are quickly seated and served. There are roughly about 20-25 capacity for indoor seating, everything is nice and clean. They accept both cash & card payment. We get the kimchi and kimchi radish with two bowls of rice to start with and within 5 minutes, our delicious ox bone combination soups are served. Here I present their top one choice on the menu-- Sul Lung Tang with Seokum(aka. mixed).Seokum means mixed and it comes with beef brisket, flank, intestine, tripe & spleen and tongue. It comes with a big bowl of warm, slow-cooked beef broth with all the fresh and delicious ingredients in it, on the side there are salt and lots of fresh-cut green onions for self-serving. The soup is so creamy with layers of flavors, it fills up every corner of your mouth and that is very satisfying. Imaging in a cold morning, this nice and warm bowl of soup will definitely bright up and warm up your day. Highly recommended if you are in the area for all LA foodies."
4/26/2022,4 star rating,"Came here on a friend's recommendation on a Thursday evening and the place was busy but we were able to get seated quite quickly. The space is cozy and overall seemed like a very homey spot to eat. Their menu isn't *huge*, but if you're craving seollongtang then this is a great place go to.The service was quick and super efficient. Our orders were taken as soon as we knew what we wanted and the food came out quickly as well - the portions were good too and I enjoyed the quality of the soup as well as its flavor. The kimchi was great too! The only thing was that the price definitely seems to have changed due to the pandemic ( I overheard a few complaints ) so that's a bummer. $16 for the soup seems a bit much, but it tasted good and it was worth at least a try. I probably would come back if I was ever craving it and I was in the area - the experience overall was super nice!"
4/18/2022,5 star rating,"We came for breakfast. This was on my bucket list for our trip out to LA, and it did not disappoint. The staff were all very friendly and there was hardly any wait for our food. Everything was delicious! We all chose the mixed bowls. The taste of the broth was so incredibly rich and deep. I only added a bit of salt to mine. It was easily one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. My sister did mix her kimchi in, and it was also really good, but I just wanted to savor the pure flavors separately. All the beef parts were super tender and rich. I'd highly recommend the mix of meats if you're not squeamish about eating different organs. Highly recommend this place if you're anywhere near Koreatown!"
4/1/2022,5 star rating,THE MOST AUTHENTIC SOUP EVER. The moment you walk in you know this place is dank. Menu is so simple but it hits home. The beef is probably the most tender beef I've ever tasted. The soup is so rich so warm -- so good for when you just want to eat something and go ah that was so good. We came here on a weekend night no wait!! PARKING: - there's a parking lot right in front of the back door entrance
3/13/2022,4 star rating,"I've been to Han Bat Sul Lung Tang a handful of times throughout the years, and I always order the same thing. Beef Brisket Sul Lung Tang. Along with Sun Nong Dan, Han Bat is probably the most famous/popular spot in Los Angeles to get this Korean dish. It never disappoints.My latest trip here was this past Friday night for dinner. Parking in Koreatown can be pretty difficult, but this restaurant does have a parking lot behind the restaurant. As it's a popular spot, the wait can sometimes get long. Once seated, service is very quick and efficient.For those that don't know, Seolleongtang is a type of Korean ox bone soup. Seasoning is usually done by yourself based on personal preference with salt, pepper, and chopped green onions (spring onions?). Aside from the meat, the soup also contains some noodles.The soups here are served with a bowl of rice, kimchi, and kkakdugi. You'll likely need to eat all of the rice to satisfy your hunger, as the soups really don't come with a lot of noodles. Though a definite hole in the wall, I would say this is a must-try restaurant."
3/11/2022,5 star rating,This is the heart and soul of Korean food culture. If you want to experience the ultimate comfort food and understand Korean taste buds; this place is a must. I love that the restaurant has one thing on the menu and that is their oxtail soup (sullang tang). There are different variations and fillings but the base doesn't change. This soup is very time consuming to make as well as hard to get it just right. The flavor of the broth tells you a story; the hardiness and rich bone broth tells you the hands that are making it are experienced as well as we've through a lot of master the flavor.I thought the place was going to be more hipster and flashy like some Korean restaurants but; it's a humble and simple place with 2 Korean ladies working. Reminds me of my childhood when I had it with my grandmother back in Korea...Must get!!!!!!
5/2/2022,5 star rating,"Hole in the wall spot, but definitely worth coming here for the sullungtang as it's their specialty. It's the best we've had so far compared to bay area spots, the depth of flavor in the broth is superior and there was a lot of tender meat in it. We got one mixed and one brisket. They also give a lot of kimchi, radish, and rice per order. The kimchi is pretty strong and fresh. Some may think it's pricey, but honestly it's pretty comparable to any other spot nearby (including prices in the bay area).I called ahead to order takeout thinking it'd take a while but they said it'd be ready in 5 minutes, lol. I even made another order on the spot and it was ready pretty quickly. So it's an efficient spot for takeout, good if you want something hot and soupy."
2/7/2022,4 star rating,"Prices have increased! I've read reviews that each bowl used to be around $10-$11. Now it's $16-$17 for one bowl. The soup is good & perfect if you want something clean in your system or to cleanse your system. The bowl is big and comes with a bowl of rice and usual side dishes. The soup is clean because it is bland with a few strains of glass noodles and the meat choice based on the menu selection. I ordered the Naejang  (intestine, triple & spleen). There was plenty of meat but obviously more soup than meat. On the table is also a big bowl of salt. These are actual fat salt grains so start off with ONE spoon of salt. My friend decided after one taste of the original soup that he needed 3 scoops of salt. Well, turned out to be completely salty and hard to enjoy. So try ONE and taste and sprinkle more gently if needed. Other things to look out for:-parking is a bit of a struggle. Valet parking is available in the back of the restaurant but we found nearby street parking -eat the meat with the kimchi & rice for a great comboOverall, very cleansing and hits a certain spot but also very pricey."
2/15/2022,5 star rating,Comfort food no doubt! Just come for the quick yet warm service and yummy beef bone broth and meats! It will soothe your soul from the bustling LA and reset you for success. P.S. The fresh kimchi here is also such a hidden gem. It is so good I begged the ladies to give me more with my takeout order and brought it all the way back to NYC.
1/30/2022,5 star rating,"Ox tails soup that taste just like one in KOREA!!! They are generous in meat and fresh kimchi. Let's start with kimchi. Their kimchi is best fresh kimchi I ever had. They are crispy fresh sweet kimchi with extra juice made for this soup. They also give u raddish kimchi which people put that juice in the soup. The service is fast and nice Korean ladies lol which is surprising. If I could give one more extra star I would.Tip: 1 .parking is behind the restaurant.         2. Tell the Korean lady how many ppl is in ur party 3. Menu is on the wall4. Salt , pepper , red little spicy paste is on the side if u need to put extra in"

6/5/2022,5 star rating,Total staple. I come here every time I go to LA. I personally like it better than Sung Non Dan. I think the flavors are more traditional and like the feeling of being in a mom and pop. I also love that you can really load up on green onions! They bring a cambro to your table!!! It's a hole in the wall but there's parking in the back. Across from an Arbys.
1/26/2022,5 star rating,"If you like light bone broth soups, this is by far the best sul lung tang spot in the area. Luckily, there is some parking in the lot behind the restaurant too. While I am not the biggest fan of this dish, Han Bat is veryyy good. My only reservation is that a bowl is fairly pricey for what is mostly just broth and a couple slices of meat with rice. At $16.7+tax+tip that is quite a lot for a ""light broth"" meal. Hard to say I'd rather take this over a bowl of ramen at say Slurpin'. Since this is the best version of this I've had here/NorCal/Korea - 5/5But overall I would probably say more of a 4.5/5. Great in the colder months of LA (aka night time in the winter)"
4/15/2022,4 star rating,"Came here for lunch during the week!Great hole in the wall location. Parking is $2 valet. However we found a parking spot on the street for $1/hr! Saved a buck. Service is fine. Once you're seated you have your choice of meat. Otherwise the meal is going to be a bone broth soup. I got the flank while the gf got the brisket. Food was good. It comes out plain and bland. The idea here is you spice it up as much as you want. Salt, green onions, pepper, and gochugaru. I put a decent amount of each. The banchan is only kimchi and radishes. Both were good. The flank is basically a brisket with some fatty tendon. So I think the flank is better than the brisket. Overall. Great hole in the wall for some comforting soup. Really good on a cold day. It's 17/per per soup so a bit pricey but well worth it. I'll be back soon!"
6/15/2022,5 star rating,"I absolutely loveeeee this spot for my sullung tang cravings. It's a mom and pop shop and they only specialize in sullung tang and nothing else. The broth is deep, and the kimchi is BOMB. I often buy 2-3 servings at a time just to store in the freezer :)"
5/21/2022,5 star rating,"A hidden gem! They have a small lot in the back but I was fortunate enough to find street parking with a meter. The menu is very simple: ox bone soup and your choice of meat. Beef brisket is a safe choice if you are unsure. The brisket was melt in your mouth delicious! What's neat is that you have the freedom to flavor your soup how you like it. I went with minimal salt an no green onion. The soup also contains some glass noodles (delicious!) rice and kimchi and radish kimchi on the side. The radish kimchi was so good! I like to scoop some rice, dip it in the soup, pile on a piece of meat, and top it with a piece of crunchy radish for the perfect spoonful."
12/24/2021,5 star rating,"Okay, still solid 5 stars.  Still an awesome place for ox bone soup and a must visit whenever I""m done in LA.  They still serve pretty much the same thing after almost 10 years.  Only difference is that I each bowl used to cost about ~$10, but now it's almost $16 + tax/tip!  Inflation be crazy man.Still worth it imo."
1/7/2016,5 star rating,"There are only two things on the menu.  Sul Lung Tang or Suyuk.  All you gotta choose is what kinda meat you would like in it.  Easy enough for all you indecisive eaters!  I went for the Salgogi (brisket) Sul Lung Tang and my, oh my, was I in soupy heaven.  Now... there was a bit of stairs that I had to climb before I got there, but follow these simple steps, and you'll be on your way up.Step 1)  Don't know how to eat?  Observe the Koreans in your surrounding.  Or... you can just follow my steps to heaven.  c:Step 2)  Don't be shy with the salt.  I found myself adding half teaspoons each time, and after doing that 2/3 times, you can be confident that you can give a full spoonful before it even being salty.  But taste intermittently! Step 3)  Add plenty of green onions!  They give you a bucket full.  *______*Step 4)  Maybe add some pepper or spicy paste if you're feeling hot.Step 5)  Add rice into your soup.Step 6)  NOM NOM  NO MONOM N OM.I haven't been so happy with my meal in a long time.  This little hole in the wall is seriously a gem!  It's inexpensive and it's absolutely delicciousssssss.  I was in heaven.  This is a must anytime I'm back down in LA.  Heavvveeennn I tell you.  Heaven."
11/30/2021,5 star rating,"Okay I know there are opposing opinions on this restaurant and I'm here to clear it up. This place has a simple menu where they offer beef broth with rice and kimchi. That's the gist of it. You get to pick what beef parts to add to your broth and you get a tub of green onions. The broth is very clean. Personally I don't think it's bland. It has a clean beef flavor profile which gets enhanced with the green onions. Paired with kimchi and rice and you got a soul warming meal. If you're looking for fancy Korean food, then this is not the place for you.The waitresses are very nice. They make recommendations if you're unsure about how to order. I'd say trust them. They know what they're talking about."
3/2/2022,5 star rating,"One of my favorite S(E)OUL food spots in Koreatown. This place is a true gem! Their menu is very simple - they have sullungtang and suyuk in varying cuts of meat. Their broth tastes balanced and healthy (and of course, absolutely delicious). If you like lean pieces of meat, I recommend getting the brisket or yangji meat cuts. But once you get you bowl, add pepper and salt to taste and you'll be amazed! You can ask the wait staff for the pepper paste if you want to ""doctor it up"" :)"
2/6/2022,4 star rating,"Gahhh sullungtang is my favorite Korean breakfast food, and LA does sullungtang so right. I do wish the soup came in one of the regular Korean soup bowls to maintain the heat because my soup ended up a little too cold after only a few minutes. But that's just personal preference to have it boiling throughout the meal. The mixed came with all the goodies and each piece of meat and tripe and all that was incredibly flavorful and tasty. The soup itself was SOO milky. The kimchis were just the right balance of sour and spicy. Loved it here!"
5/22/2022,5 star rating,We came all the way from houston and we're not disappointed.  This was the perfect breakfast after a long flight.  Food was delicious and hit the spot.
11/19/2021,5 star rating,"The ultimate Korean comfort food! This is my kind of meal - just a good hearty bowl of ox bone soup with simple fixings of kimchi, radish, and a bowl of rice. This is a no-frills type of place. You eat and you go. There are only two items on the menu:- Sul Lung Tang (Ox Bone Soup) for $15.07+Tax with your choice of meat- Suyuk (Platter of Slice Meat) for $38.36+Tax with your choice of meatI ordered the mixed ox bone soup, which comes with a little of every meat. I do not recommend mixed if you are new to offals as it is an acquired taste. The beef brisket was perfectly tender. The milky-colored broth was just a nice clean broth, which reminds me of soups that my mom would make for me. A must-visit in Los Angeles!"
2/21/2022,5 star rating,Edit: I came here on a Saturday. This business is closed on Sundays. Still 5 stars and one of my favorite restaurants in LA.
9/7/2021,5 star rating,"Even though it was busy on a Sunday at noon, my group and I were seated quickly after a short wait, and we literally had our food in front of us in less than 5 minutes! So fast. So good. Perfect for a hangover. Absolutely amazing and recommended!!!"
10/17/2021,5 star rating,"I've been telling my Korean partner that I do not like sul lung tang because there's no flavor. That is until he took me to the best one in Ktown. I didn't know that sul lung tang could be so flavorful. All the other times I've had it, I had to put lots of salt and green onions. This time I didn't even need to put any salt.We ordered 3 brisket sul lung tang and it came out pretty quick. The brisket was very tender and the soup was a nice milky look. First I had to taste it without any seasoning and it was already by far the tastiest sul lung tang I've ever had.My partner was in heaven. He told us on our drive over that he dreams about eating sul lung tang and adding the radish kimchi in it. The kimchi here is really delicious too. Good Soup."
8/26/2021,5 star rating,"This was so comforting to eat!! Been craving real homemade sul lung tang since my trip to Seoul and Han Bat delivered! It's such a simple broth but so rich and complex at the same time. The layers of creamy flavors unravel in your mouth. The beef brisket is so tender it just falls apart. Paired with the fresh cabbage and radish kimchi, it's so comforting and refreshing. You can load it up with green onions, add salt and pepper to your liking, or drizzle some of the radish kimchi juice into the broth or just have it plain as it comes. It's so DIY! The staff was super friendly and the good come out rapid fast. Highly recommend this place for a good healthy meal."
11/19/2021,5 star rating,"It's so good! I got the beef brisket sullungtang and finished off the entire dish. I didn't have to put that much salt in because the soup was very flavorful, and they let you put as much green onions as you want which adds a nice crisp flavor. They also provide pepper, but I didn't add it since I'm not a fan of pepper. The kimchi and spicy pickled radish was also very good. The kimchi was fresh so the cabbage was sweet, and although there are no other side dishes, I was very satisfied."
1/17/2022,5 star rating,"There's something so comforting about going to a no frills mom and pop spot that specializes in one thing. I always order the brisket seollongtang. It's so comforting to eat as a breakfast meal. You get a big portion of soup + meat so you'll definitely leave full. Included with the soup is a bowl of rice, 2 types of kimchi - radish and cabbage. Make sure to season your broth! You get sea salt, pepper, green onions, and pepper paste for spice on the side. I add a little bit of everything slowly while tasting to make sure you don't over salt. One of the best meals I've ever had. It reminds me so much of my childhood. This is my go-to breakfast meal when visiting LA. Prices have increased over the years, but it's worth it to me because quality hasn't gone down. Valet parking for $2, and proof of vaccination card is required currently."
6/4/2021,5 star rating,"Not more I can say, humble spot with the best sul lung tang in LA. Their sides like their SLT are simple, but a perfect pair together. Ugh I crave this often! I even had this togo which was in my fridge for a couple of days and can tell you it is still as great leftover!"
5/18/2021,5 star rating,"Yelp Reviews: Quarantine Edition #109The gold standard for Sullungtang in LA. Forever.One of the earliest victims of Coronavirus hysteria in 2020, I thank Jejus that Han Bat Sul Lung Tang survived the Pandemic. Having first discovered it when I was in college, Han Bat stands singularly as THE measuring stick for Korean milky white beef bone broth in all of Southern California. Never diluted, always comforting, this thin yet MEATY tonic water is what the doctor ordered whenever you're feeling cold, down, under the weather, or just in need of some simple, restorative soup.This place is as no frills a dining experience in LA as it gets: you sit down, place your order, your order comes out with banchan and a container of green onions to use at your discretion. You slurp your soup and/or mix it with rice as you eat it with kimchi and pickled radish... and then you pay and you're done.As the Quarantime comes to an end, Han Bat has taken special measures to make sure their customers are safe... only every other table is used and now they even have pre-written, laminated bills for you when you're ready to pay. At $15.50 for a bowl of Chadol Sullungtang, simple brisket and broth, the peace of mind and comfort this classic Los Angeles Koreatown dish brings you cannot be properly appreciated until you have a bowl for yourself on a cold Southern California night.If you consider yourself an LA local, this is a must eat... make sure you go at an off hour so there's no wait!"
12/12/2021,5 star rating,"First let me say that the idiots who give this a poor rating because ""the soup"" is ""too thin"" or ""not creamy"" are wrong. Just because food doesn't meet your incorrect and ignorant expectations doesn't mean you should rate it poorly. That's like giving a sushi restaurant a poor rating because ""the fish is undercooked."" Ignore those reviews; this place is top notch. I will note, it is a hole-in-the-wall (my favorite type of eatery), and while the service is fast and efficient and friendly, this place is no-frills. If you like places where they worry about plating, or proper placement of utensils, or speaking English, this is not for you. This is a place where you enter, sit, point to what you want on the menu (which is very sparse, because they do one thing only, but exceptionally well.... oxtail broth, with a few options for added meats), eat, and leave.This is a broth soup, like many Asian soups. It is not intended to be thick or have texture or, horrors, have cream. It is clear that this broth has been simmered many hours with oxtail including the bone, and it is wonderfully flavorful without being overpowering with added flavors. It is exactly what it is intended to be, and the execution is perfect. You order it with some added meat of your choice (I suggest the flank) and it comes with some clear noodles. You add minced scallions and salt to your taste when it arrives. Paired with a bowl of steamed rice and some kimchi, this is PERFECT."
4/11/2022,5 star rating,"I would come here every day if I could. Deadass. It is that good.Han Bat Sul Lung Tang only serves one thing: Oxbone soup. You can pick a choice of meat (I recommend beef tongue) and it comes with a side of rice and some banchan.The soup comes pretty bland but there is salt on the table so you can salt it according to your liking. It also comes with a tub of green onions so you can add as much as you like. I'm a scallion fiend so I put maybe two handfuls in.The waitress was nice and the restaurant had such a homey feel. It felt so familiar and warm. The food also comes out relatively quickly. The food was so light and delicious, it wasn't incredibly heavy and over the top. It was just good, authentic soup. However, the banchan was my favorite part. Sometimes I dream about the kimchi I had there. I really do. I yearn for it when I go to any other Korean restaurant. The kimchi and the pickled radish there are absolutely phenomenal and it was the best kimchi I've ever had.Give this place a go if you're in K-Town. Absolutely worth it and I miss it so much."
12/27/2021,5 star rating,"A rainy day and all we wanted was hot soup to warm up the soul! Went to K-town to visit family and we ended up ordering from here for dinner - Seol Leong Tang (Salgogi/Seokum) and Suyuk (Yangji). There is parking in the back as well as street parking out front if you are lucky. I'm told that it's a pretty long-standing establishment and for a place that predominantly does just two items, it has to mean they are pretty good at it right? The answer is yes haha.To start, the prices on their menus have changed recently, but the price listed is the price with tax included. The food preparation is very quick and within 10 minutes of ordering, the food was ready for us to take out. Even after about 15-20 minutes, the soup was still hot when we ate. For the Seol Leong Tang order, it comes with rice, which they packed very generously. The soup base itself is pretty clear, light, and full of beef flavors without the heaviness. The soup base didn't taste watery to me, but I can see why some might if they are more used to heavier flavors like a tonkotsu for ramen.  The order came with a salt condiment, a spicy condiment, diced green onions, noodles, as well as daikon kimchi and napa kimchi. Mix each item as you desire  In the soup itself, to enhance the flavors within or as you eat. However you mix it is going to change the soup base to how you desire. I had the Seokum and they gave one piece of each meat they offer. With green onions, noodles, and some salt, it enhanced the item after giving the soup base a try from the get-go. I definitely preferred a bit more salt in the soup hence they provide the salt. The quantity of meat is kind of skimpy versus the amount of soup they provided, but the quality was decent for each type. For the mixed, they provide beef brisket, flank, intestine (tripe and spleen), and tongue. The beef brisket was very soft, the flank was nicely sliced, the intestine was tender and definitely had that intestine taste of it, and the tongue was tender as well. Not bad quality, but definitely makes you wish you had some more. For the Suyuk, it was an entire piece of flank sliced up. Definitely see why it costed so much, because of the quantity provided. The flank was very soft and tender and easy to bite through. It comes with a soy sauce with wasabi dipping sauce for it and again, the rice provided with it was very packed.All in all, a decent soup place that I enjoyed more than I thought I would. The soup base definitely makes me want to come back on a rainy day or a cold winter evening. For what they do, they appear to do it well and with efficiency. No frills, just good home-y kinds of comfort food for the soul. A great place to give a try despite the neighboring environment to formulate your own opinions."
5/2/2021,3 star rating,"Maybe it's because I'm not a super big fan of Korean food... I felt like this place was not bad, but also not anything outstanding. I appreciated that you can scoop however much green onion in your soup and add salt to your taste. Sides were also refilled a couple times so the service was pretty good; for that, I would probably up to a 3.5/5 star review. I can see it being homey comfort food for some people but it just didn't quite hit the spot for me."
3/7/2022,5 star rating,"Call phone, say ""hi salkogi to go, extra kimchi please"" and hear ""ok thank you."" A 5 second transaction and 10 or so minutes later and you're ready for some Korean soup. It is disheartening to see how much they had to raise their prices in the past year, but their quality is still great. Highly recommended for those looking for something Korean or are hungover! Very hearty, great with kimchi."
4/21/2022,5 star rating,This is my go-to spot every time I visit LA. The wait was pretty short and the food speaks for itself. The servers are always so friendly. They even refilled my moms soup because she had rice leftover. 5/5 best sulungtang ever.
9/30/2019,5 star rating,"Coming from MD where good korean food is hard to come by, this was such a satisfying, rich, broth meal. At first glance it seems pricey, but the meat portion and the taste is well worth the money!"
12/29/2021,5 star rating,"One of the best meals I've ever had. So simple yet so good. Took me right back to childhood memories of eating seollungtang that my grandma and mom made for me. The kimchi was so good too, paired beautifully with the meals, and were truly the only side dishes that we needed. The beauty of seollungtang is that you can season it to your own personal preference--after seasoning with salt and pepper to taste and adding a heap of green onion the way my mom always did, the flavor of the beef broth came to life."
12/12/2021,2 star rating,"Eep. I was really looking forward to trying out Han Bat, especially since I saw them on Buzzfeed! However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. I ordered the mixed soup, which was a fat $15, so I was really expecting something mind-blowing. However, I received a seollongtang that I could have received at any Korean restaurant. The portion size was really small and there wasn't a lot of meat :( I think this place really hiked up their prices due to all the attention they got, but it's super not worth. The only good thing is that their kimchi is handmade and they cut it in front of you."
5/27/2022,5 star rating,"OMG. That BROTH. I don't know why -- maybe because I'm really into exploring my Korean roots right now -- but the taste of the broth almost made me cry. It was rich and creamy and surprisingly sweet (I think because of the richness) but not overpowering. I loved the broth so much that I only added a tiny bit of salt and pepper so I could keep coming back to that taste in my mouth. I built some other flavor profiles on the spoon with different combinations of rice, kimchi, and brisket. I couldn't decide which I liked more, so I'm glad I kept the broth basically as is and played with flavor on the spoon. Definitely understand why this is on Eater LA's top Korean restaurants list... SOOOO good!"
11/24/2021,5 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Tang was absolutely delicious!! Located in K-town and has a parking lot in the back & meters! They have two items on their menu (soup & meat platter).Food: We got the mixed oxtail soup which came with rice & kimchi. We also added some green onions, salt, pepper, & chili paste! This meal was like a warm hug :)) Ambience: very home-y and traditional; has an A health ratingService: quickest I've ever received my food! It took maybe 5ish minutes for our meal to come out!Overall, a lovely experience & would definitely come again!"
5/17/2021,5 star rating,"If you ask me what my favorite informal restaurant is in LA, I will recommend this one.Han Bat Shul Lung Tang serves up Korean ox bone soup. The cloudy bone marrow broth is nothing short of  legendary, simple yet incredibly flavorful,  filled with a protein of your choice. Most go for the brisket, but if you're adventurous I recommend the mixed meat (brisket, flank, intestine, tripe, spleen, and tongue).It comes with sides of delicious kimchi, green onions, salt + pepper, gochujang, and rice, so that you can mix it in and build up your soup exactly how you like it. I originally discovered this place from the BuzzFeed show Worth It, and now I can't go to LA without a meal here.  Don't let the line out the back door drive you away - it goes by fast and the waiters are super efficient!"
5/21/2022,5 star rating,"There food is always good or should be good as i've only tried their main dish, beef brisket soup. Anyhow, will be ordering again, soon, and will try with soju, this time :)"
5/29/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for years and it's been a staple in my LA experience! This hole-in-the-wall serves THE BEST Sul Lung Tang I've ever had (including my experience in South Korea). The beef broth is so hearty and rich, without the heavy feel. You add your preference of salt, green onions, pepper, and chili paste to enhance the flavor and every bite is worth it. To add, their kimchi is so fresh and crunchy, it completely pulls together the meal.10/10 recommend!!"
4/11/2022,5 star rating,"Where do I start? This seollungtang place is a must-try in Ktown!The key to finding quality seollungtang is to first taste the soup before you any added salt or condiments (the way it's first served). If it's good seollungtang, the broth will be creamy, meaty, and most importantly, clean. There's no way to really describe what ""clean"" tastes like, but if you know, you know. This seollungtang achieves that and more! Also, the banchan here (particularly the kimchi) makes the perfect addition to your hot soup. I always recommend this place to people who ask me for recommendations in the area. It gets pretty busy and during lunch time, a line can form. But, most people understand that this is a place where you eat and leave (no dilly dallying). The server ahjummas are always really efficient.Parking is difficult though! Not a lot of great street parking but you can always look for parking in the surrounding neighborhood."
5/17/2021,5 star rating,"Can you say comfort food?! Han Bat is known for their sulung tang, it comes with a few options: brisket, oxtail, mixed and a few others. With each order you will get a side of rice and two banchan dishes, kimchi and radish. The soup is so full of flavor on it's own. Not sure how to describe this, but it has a ""sweet"" note to it because of how long it's been simmering and all the bone marrow goodness has seeped into the broth. No salt is added. You have salt, pepper, scallions and chili paste at your table so you can add to your own taste. I LOVE scallions, but I had to be considerate, otherwise half the bucket would have been gone. TBH, you don't have to add anything else to the soup, it's delicious and full of flavor by itself, but if you do add other condiments, it will elevate the flavors to another level. I grew up on soup before dinner practically every night and this is a nice reminder of my childhood. They're also very reasonably priced. Don't worry about parking, there is metered parking in the front and a valet in the back for $2."
11/11/2021,5 star rating,"You are missing out if you are visiting LA without a trip to Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. This is a no-frills, hurry-up-and-stop-wasting-everyone's-time type of place. You go in, eat, and get out. There was a slight waiting time (10 mins, whatever right?) on a Monday night. We got seated and immediately, the waitresses served us water and gave us silverware. Super speedy and efficient - to the point I looked around and chuckled. I got the beef brisket soup, which didn't disappoint. Milky, salty, and clean broth - reminding me of hours-long nourishing soup that my mom would make at home. And you sure know it's made out of love."
12/5/2021,5 star rating,"No frills restaurant that serves delicious seolleongtang that absolutely hits the spot.Although the broth is thin, it's rich in beef flavor.  Don't expect something hearty and thick like tonkotsu broth; the soup is watery, but it certainly doesn't lack flavor.  I think some reviewers here are confusing unflavorful with unseasoned.  The broth is lightly salted, but they provide salt at each table, and just a sprinkle in the soup and on the meat really heightens the flavors.  They also provide plenty of fresh scallions with each dish.  It's the perfect bowl of soup for a cold day and it's exactly what I'd want if I was feeling sick and needed something to revive me.  Each meal is served with radish and cabbage kimchi and rice, which complement the richness of the soup.  The staff there are very friendly and offer refills on the kimchi if you're low.  Service is super fast as there are only a few options on the menu.  We were seated and served food within 5 minutes.  This place is the perfect example of great, simple food done well with no extra bells and whistles.  Would recommend!"

10/27/2021,5 star rating,"We drove from San Diego all the way to San Francisco and stopped LA Ktown for a authentic Korean lunch. We found this famous ox soup place. They only serve one kind of soup and you can choose what meat to add in. My husband chose brisket and I chose intestines, lungs... I missed eating those delicious organs. The soup is white color, the taste is so delicious, flavorful, meaty, creamy and umami. The complimentary kimchi and radish are super good, absolutely like a Korean grandma's homemade dishes. Also the spicy sauce is awesome, I can just eat it alone for a cup!"
6/9/2021,5 star rating,"I've been lucky enough to come here many times over the past few years, and lucky enough to have it for my last (restaurant) meal in LA!I got the brisket sullungtang and it arrived in less than 5 min from ordering. I really missed it! It's light and slightly milky but full of beef flavor, with the meat and some glass noodles to give a variety of textures. I love to load green onion on mine as well as some salt/pepper and chili paste little by little. The kimchi is crisp and fresh. Unassuming, unpretentious, and warm, it's the essence of Ktown to me."
12/10/2021,5 star rating,"There is something about a restaurant that serves one dish, and does it extremely well and extremely fast. I would harken the speed akin to a pho restaurant where the dish is already made and only the individual components need to be added before it is served. No muss, no fuss, just really good food.While initially we felt like the broth was on the bland side, we added a small amount of the coarse salt that is served on the side and oh my, did it make all the difference. It's likely that the restaurant does this on purpose so customers can adjust to their palate.  The soup is light and the portion of 1 soup with kimchi and rice was perfect for two girls who were still somewhat full from breakfast. The bucket of spring onions was hilarious but very welcome.Looking forward to my next visit!"
1/25/2022,4 star rating,Only serves soup or boiled meats. Well done bone broth.  Thought it wouldn't make us full. But after all the rice and kimchi it was perfect. Gentle sweetness in the broth.  I ordered the tripe.  Very tender. Perfect for a cold day. Recommend parking in the back. Neighborhood can be worrisome if you park on the street. Ambiance: super casual.  Can seat 40 easy. Gives buckets of green onions  lol.
2/21/2022,4 star rating,"The signature Sul Lung Tang (Ox bone soup) is so flavorful and rich.  The bone broth is tasty and great on cold days.  I loved the simple light texture and the simplicity of the taste.  Also, the fresh kimchi goes well with this soup.  Not a fancy place by any means but the soup will warm your heart."
11/20/2021,4 star rating,"If you come to K-town and don't get sul lung tang, did you really come to K-town? Han Bat is a no frills bone broth place and perfect for your sul lung tang hankering. You come in and order from their very limited menu, and in no more than ten minutes, you receive your delicious soup in a hot stone bowl. Pro tip: be sure to load up on the self-service green onions, salt, and pepper!! The broth is very hearty and Han Bat's kimchi is a perfect cold accompaniment to the soup. To say Han Bat is an institution is an understatement and to not bring your friends to this K-town mainstay is a disservice!One con I'll mention is that it's a bit difficult to get ahold of your server -especially if you're non-Korean- despite the fact that the restaurant is no larger than a hotel room. But if you're here, you're obviously not paying for the service."
6/9/2022,4 star rating,This place is a must for people who like korean soup. The only problem is the parking if you come for lunch. But they have valet at the back.
9/24/2021,5 star rating,"Been coming to Han Bat for years and they've been consistent the whole time. Food comes out fast, the kimchi is delicious, and the line moves quickly. They have a parking lot in the back which is $2 valet (at least on Saturdays), so par for the course for ktown. They're closed on Sundays.The star of the show, their Sul Lung Tang, is amazing, especially with a little bit of salt and a generous helping of green onions. Combine with rice and their amazing kimchi, and you have a spoonful of happiness. I usually go for the brisket and I'm pretty full after finishing it.The only thing I dislike is that the prices keep slowly going up, but if that's what they need to do to stay in business, I understand. Looking forward to my next visit!"

2/25/2022,5 star rating,"Ok, this place is one I seriously think about driving from Phoenix to. I planned to take time off to go just to get the Sul Lung Tang (ox tail soup). That's pretty much all they make (I could be wrong and had tunnel vision when I went.)Is it that good? Stop. Yes it is. You can disagree with me, post it below so I can never take your recommendations because you have bad taste.Do not go on Sundays, they're closed. Bring cash when you go. Go with a couple of friends not a gaggle. The tables are four tops.  If you need pointers on how to eat it let me know. I'll help you. Whatever you do though, do not act like a hipster or a Karen. Enjoy yourself, that's comfort food from Korea."
11/9/2021,5 star rating,The best sul lung tang Ive had. I live in NYC and LA but the korean food in LA definitely taste a lot more authentic. The portion amount is perfect for one person and there is unlimited ban chan of kimchi and radish which pairs perfectly with the ox bone soup and rice. The soup was filled with so much flavor and was just perfectly made. They also provide salt which youre allowed to add to the soup to your liking. The brisket option is definitely the way to go.Highly recommend visiting if your in the area. Brought my bf here and he said it really hit the spot for him and is great comfort food :)Ps the parking is in the back and free :D
4/23/2022,5 star rating,"when you walk in, the restaurant has such a cozy homey feel to it. there's a parking lot which is amazing for ktown! we got the mixed sullungtang and it was one of the best i've ever had. the broth was flavorful, clean and milky and came with noodles too. ours initially barely had any so we let the waitress know and she brought our extra noodles for us (  ) the banchan here is so good - very simple just kimchi and kimchi radish (kkakdugi) but the kkakdugi was so perfect! they give you a bucket of green onions so you can add as much as you'd like, along with flaky sea salt and pepper. the food came out super fast and the experience was amazing. perfect for a cold day or whenever you're craving a clean broth :D"
9/13/2021,5 star rating,"This restaurant is a hole-in-the-wall that feels like it could be missed if you're not looking close enough. This place has a small menu and the pace of the restaurant overall feels a little fast-paced so that they can feed as many people as they can. I had the Seokum Sul Lung Tang and of course added enough green onions to cover the surface of my bowl and salt to taste. The broth was absolutely amazing. You could taste the depth of flavor that was developed over a long cooking process. This kind of soup felt like it could cure any illness, ailment, or bad day you could be having. The sides of radish kimchi and napa cabbage kimchi were great compliments to the soup, creating this delicious cycle of flavor making you want to go back between both over and over. I 10/10 would recommend this place to everybody and come back again to try the other sul lung tangs as well. Whether you're having a hangover or having a bad day, just have a nice bowl of sul lung tang with lots of green onions and salt (emphasis on the green onions!) and your day will undoubtedly be better!"
3/7/2022,5 star rating,Amazing food. The menu is simple and to the point. Super quick service. Come with an empty stomach because the portions are substantial. Don't forget to ask for wasabi and soy sauce to dip the meat in. Will definitely be coming back!
2/9/2022,3 star rating,"I came here with a friend on a weekday around 730pm and the place a quite busy but we were able to get a table. Somewhat of a hole-in-the-wall spot. It was recommended by a friend and the menu was bare bones as they served only soup with kimchi and radish for sides. We ordered the brisket and flank in ox bone soup. Taste was bland so I guess it's healthy. Service was so-so. Several times I had to get up and ask for service. Looks like they raised the price, as the menu looked like someone pasted a sticker over the old price. I thought it was a bit expensive at $16.44 pre tax for a small bowl of soup."
10/26/2021,5 star rating,My favorite soup place! Best comfort food after KSPA!My favorite is beef tongue. Looove all you can kimchi.
11/13/2021,3 star rating,"It's $15 for their soups now!!!! I remember coming here with my dad all the time as a little kid. It used to be the best place to be for a quick and cheap meal, but now.... I dunno. $15 seems kinda expensive for a bowl of soups now. The kkakdugi (radish kimchi) is still the same taste as from when I remember it. I don't know how they manage to do that, but it's very nostalgic and very good. Service is lightning fast. They don't even take your order unless everyone in your party is present at the table. Our mommy was in line for the restroom and they wouldn't take our table's order until she sat down. (Then she got back up to stand in line for the restroom again. O.o) My bowl didn't even arrive piping hot. More like lukewarm. :/ Overall, it wasn't worth the now $15 price tag. Come for the nostalgia, but you can get more for $15 elsewhere."

11/18/2021,5 star rating,"Best ox bone soup place and a Ktown staple! I love coming here knowing I won't need to stress about ordering at all since their menu is so straightforward. I usually get the sul lung tang with Seokum (mixed) because I appreciate the variety of beef parts, but a lot of my friends just pick Salgogi (brisket) to play it safe. As always, don't forget to add salt, pepper, and green onions to personal taste. Han Bat has comforted us through it all - chilly nights, exam seasons, and whatever trials and tribulations we were dealing with at the time. This meal always feels like the food equivalent of a warm hug, and I hope the restaurant will continue standing strong!"

5/26/2021,5 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Lung Tang never misses. Although the menu is small, Sul Lung Tang is what they specialize in. They have flavors such as: Mixed meats, beef brisket, flank, intestine/tripe/spleen, and tongue. The hearty ox bone soup provides the best comfort food for whatever occasion"
5/21/2022,5 star rating,My personal favorite place for sul lung tang. I willingly drive from sgv to pick this up. It's a small mom and pop hole in the wall with a very simple menu. Don't let that fool you. Their soup is mind-knowingly good. What's even better than their soup? Their kimchi. Definitely a must go in ktown.
3/28/2021,5 star rating,"The ultimate comfort food on a rainy day. Menu at this place is very simple. Soup with your choice of meat. I always order the brisket. It comes with a side of rice and cabbage and radish kimchi.Their soup broth has a rich and milky texture, and you add salt and green onions to your liking. You can tell the time put in to make their soup. The meat is always fall off the bone soft and tender. Mix it with fluffy bowl of rice and FRESH radish kimchi. The servers are always seen extremely busy and working hard. Although the service is not 5 stars, I still want to give them 5 stars. For their hard work and exceptional quality of food."
10/21/2021,5 star rating,"Ordered for to go. The ink on the receipt didn't even dry yet and the food was packed and ready to go. In and out in less than 5 minutes!Came with all the fixings - kimchi, kkakdugi, small containers of green onion/salt, rice. You can't beat the flavor of the broth and how tender the brisket is. Love this place."
3/14/2021,5 star rating,"So LA has been hyping about bone broth lately. People literally paid $5 for a shot of bone broth which really baffled me. But what they don't know is they can have a pint of bone broth fixings for a fraction of the cost from this place. That's right folks, ox bone soup is the OG bone broth! (To be fair thought, the practice of shimmering bone for a long time to make stock is pretty common in Asian cuisine so I guess you can say the same thing for Pho or any other noodle soup but you get the point... actually I take that back. Pho has spices in it so it doesn't taste EXACTLY like bone broth so Korean ox tail soup may be a better match but anyway I'm rambling) $15.50 for a HUGE portion. Probably enough for 2 people. This is a steal.Oh they don't have dine in option right now because of covid, but that only give you the excuse to eat in the privacy of your car without having to worry about other people wondering why you're slurping so much. Also, the ladies working are so kind and fast! Happy eating."

8/17/2020,4 star rating,"I was visiting my friends after not seeing them for a long time and requested for Han Bat Sul Lung. My friend said it tastes really good and was happy to pick up the food. Everything was nicely packed.I ordered the brisket soup and it came with rice and sides. Unfortunately, they did not have purple rice, which is what I usually prefer. Broth was rich and creamy on its own, but I had to add more salt and green onion to enhance the flavor. There's a lot of brisket and it is very tender. I also like adding rice into the broth to convert it to congee towards the end. Definitely a very hearty and satisfying meal. Reminds me of the times when my friends are out in ktown after a night of drinking."

11/28/2021,5 star rating,"Had to leave another review for those who aren't familiar with Sul Lung Tang. Everything they put at the table is for you to add to the soup. They focus on the broth which is amazing but bland if you don't add salt. That's why there is salt, pepper, red pepper paste, and green onions at the table. I love it that I add it myself, cause I like it spicy with a lot of green onions. Most bad reviews I see for this place is because people don't know how to eat it. Lol"
12/3/2017,5 star rating,"I love this place. First time I came was a huge wait and no waiting area. But I've come multiple times since then and it is always satisfying. It's the best seollangtang I've had in the states. The staff is awesome, and the wait time for your food is usually like 2 mins. Can't beat that. And the radish kimchi is to die for. Thanks for treating me well each time I come in!!"
7/21/2020,5 star rating,"This soup was sooooo good!! I ordered the Sul Lung Tang -Salgogi (beef brisket oxtail soup) it was $14.50 and worth every bite!!My friend who is from Korea, had taken me to Sun Nong Dan and I was SO skeptical getting soup or any form of food from a dingy looking Korean strip mall. It was good but then I saw this place which had about 1k more reviews and thought- ""I have to try this too""! The staff was so nice in trying to accommodate me to take my cc # over the phone so I can remain contactless upon arrival. She had a great sense of humor and totally got me paid up and ready to go. When I got there we both shared giggles over how we were trying to figure out how to get me paid up previously over the phone. Really great service again!! There's parking in the back just FYI. Make sure to wear a mask too! The meal came with the soup and it was big enough for 2 servings for me. Kkakdugi kimchi (radish) and yangbaechu kimchi (cabbage) is included as sides. My favorite surprisingly was the radish one. I ate it all!! And you get salt, green onions, chili paste, and a nice big to-go container of white rice. The soup itself had tons of beef brisket and glass noodles. The broth was milky too and soooo yummy! I'd say the difference between Sun Nong Dan and here is there's more fat and flavor in the one that they serve here. You can clearly see it in the meat as well. The reviews were SO accurate about how tasty and simple this comfort food really is.The outside looks insane like a total bad idea but I promise you it's not!!! Just try it. And get ready for a nap after. I hope you enjoy!!"
2/9/2022,5 star rating,Best sulungtang in ktown hands down. Their radish kimchi is the best!! I wish they delivered but they don't.
9/26/2021,5 star rating,"I have come here after every trip to Los Angeles. And some times I was coming just for this. Literally. A drive from the Bay Area to get this soup. It's so nostalgic and authentic. Growing up in a home with lots of home cooked Korean food and this being my favorite soup, this is surely my favorite place to eat!! Simple menu, love the Beef Tongue. And house made kimchi is always a win!!"
10/9/2021,5 star rating,The best sul lung tang I've ever had!! I found this place on Yelp while browsing and you know a restaurant is good when they only have one item with thousands of amazing reviews. It's literally a hole in the wall spot. There weren't many other dine in customers so we were seated right away. Parking was also plentiful and free! I would drive back to LA to have this again for sure.
1/22/2021,5 star rating,"I never knew shul lung tang could ever taste this good.I ordered the mixed meats with brisket, liver, and all the intestinal varieties. Everything was so tender and flavorful, and the guts were cleaned extremely well. And the broth, twas beyond my expectations. I've had this soup many times in Chicago, but this is some next level !The soup comes with the napa and radish kimchi, which of course stood out clearly. You know a Korean restaurant is good just by tasting the kimchi!Honestly, if you're skeptical about trying this place, just bring a Korean friend who never had Han Bat and they will swear this place is legit. A must visit for comfort k-food in k-town!"
3/6/2022,5 star rating,"A Los Angeles staple!Not many places do it like Han Bat Sul Lung Tang does, and they know it! Despite them raising their prices exponentially over the past couple of years, they know that their in a league in their own. As a semi-regular here, no matter what price point they land at, I'll always be a customer here. It really doesn't get better than this!I live around the corner so I usually do a quick pick up, but every time I go there, they're always crowded and have a table full of to-go orders on their way out. As a 5-year resident of the area, you can tell that this place gets love from locals and visitors. Service is quick, food is delicious... I think their kimchi is some of the best I've ever had. What's not to love?"
8/14/2021,5 star rating,Their beef broth is really delicious. I got the brisket option and found the meat to be tender and the broth to be very pure and clean in taste. It's a light dish so i don't think it's necessarily the most filling but it's really comforting. Also saw this place on worth it and had to give it a try!
9/8/2021,4 star rating,"Bit sad... it was always go to place since I was in college and the price raise from time to time... was okay to pay much but today I realized the portion size was changed too...... although it's great place, I think I should put it as second go to place now...bye.."

Then I remembered this place, so I stopped by at this restaurant. When I arrived at 7 in the morning, I was the first customer. I ordered two different kinds of soup. The beef soup was awesome . It really was soothe my soul. The elderly couple were so nice and it was really quick. I didn't have to wait long. Thank you for an awesome service and food!"

They opened at 7am and I arrived there one minute earlier. It took me only few minutes to order what I wanted. I ordered two different kinds of soup, the beef brisket and the mixed one. Both of them were outstanding. It was really good. I know I would visit the place again. From the outside, the restaurant looked hole in the hole but it was awesome. Highly recommended."
9/10/2021,4 star rating,"This restaurant is in a very closed area and has a small parking lot. There is a person who valet parks your car since the parking lot is small. The walkway to the restaurant is kind of steep, so be careful while walking down. When you walk into the restaurant, the place is cramped and small. Cozy on a regular day, but probably not the best environment during COVID times. The menu has a good variety, not too much and not too little. The servers gave us a full bucket of chopped green onions, some kimchi radish, kimchi, and bowls of rice. When the sul lung tang came, it smelled super fresh and gave me a very comforting feeling. The sul lung tang of course needed seasoning, but you need to add that yourself. They don't add it for you, so when you get it, you can adjust it to your own taste. Overall the taste of it was pretty good and gave a comforting feeling while eating it. I will be coming back here with my boyfriend when we go visit LA another time."
8/18/2021,5 star rating,Came here before covid-19 and loved this place. I used to work in Ktown and this place quickly become a regular spot before my office moved. The ladies who work there are incredibly sweet and always knew my order....which was ALWAYS TONGUE! It comes with sides of banchan (kimchi and pickled radish) and a bowl of rice. You can adjust the salt level in your soup (I don't put a lot) and as much green onions you want into the soup. Highly recommend on a cold and hot day.
7/16/2021,5 star rating,"Brisket Sul Lung Tang: MUST TRY if you like Korean cuisine!!! The brisket is so tender and the broth is served very pure so you can adjust the taste with their salt, pepper, and chili. The meal comes with a bowl of rice, kimchi, and radish which complemented the soup perfectly. If I lived close enough I could eat here every day!!!"
2/21/2022,3 star rating,expensive now came out $18 after tax order the ox soup brisket meat with rice and some kimchi. The food is still good but I probably eat less regularly
5/4/2022,5 star rating,We got to the restaurant 30 minutes before closing and they were kind to take us in. The sul lung tang was rich in flavor and tasted incredibly fresh with the green onions! It was certainly a comfort food. The price was a bit steeper than I expected but I would definitely go again!
1/11/2021,5 star rating,"I came here twice before COVID and this is hands down the best place I go to for sullangtang. I always order the beef brisket and it is super filling. They give you kimchi and radish kimchi along with green onions, salt, and chili pepper paste for you to add into your soup for more flavor because the soup itself is pretty bland. You could adjust the flavor of the soup to your liking. They also include rice on the side soup as well! They always have great customer service and always try to make sure that you're doing okay and if you need anything else. If they're too busy based on the shortness of staff then please be patient with them as well because the place is pretty small and they're always  moving around to help everyone. Definitely recommend trying this place on cold weather days because it's the perfect soup to warm you up. Also recommend this as a hangover soup because it's not as oily and heavy when you want some comfort food!"
2/7/2022,4 star rating,"Great experience and recommend, if you're a fan of seolleongtang. This was a cozy restaurant with friendly and attentive waitstaff--sort of a rarity these days. The soup was rich and flavorful. Perfect for a cold day or for when you're feeling the need for a bit of a refresher. Ordered the brisket and mixed options. The brisket was terrific and 98% of the mixed was also fantastic. If you're not a fan of spleen, then maybe direct yourself to the brisket. On the other hand, if you're a fan of spleen--difficult to find at most restaurants--then this is your place and you'll love it. Will return for the brisket, warm atmosphere, and delicious kimchi."
2/12/2022,5 star rating,"I love this joint. Very reliable, quick and soo good. They have a small convention parking lot but it is super easy to pass by if you are trying to enter via Western. It's a little pricy compared to 3 years ago but  it's worth it."
5/27/2021,5 star rating,"Great service, the ladies working here are super friendly. They give you pepper, salt, chili and green onion to make the bone broth even better than it already is. The brisket is super tender and melts in your mouth, plus the chewy rice and soft noodles melt in your mouth. Highly recommend for a warm and comforting meal, can't go wrong with this place if you like meat and broth soup"
6/26/2021,5 star rating,"What can I say, food is amazing. Ever since coming here a few years ago after being introduced by my fiancé who's korean, I am blown away by how simple yet hearty and fulfilling this dish is. That explains the long lines every single time we come for dine-in. There is a parking lot behind the store. The back entry is where the line starts to form when they get full. Still wishing Han Bat was closer to home lol"
1/27/2021,1 star rating,"What happened to good customer service? Nonexistent here.  I've tried calling to order takeout and was approached by a rude person on the other end.  Our call ended short and not being able to order anything.  So I called again and tried to order..as i was ordering he hung up on me.  Then i called a 3rd time and he picked up and hung up.  I used to love coming here, as this is across the street from my parents but after today's experience i definitely will not be back.  There are other sullungtang jips in ktown that have good service and soup."
4/24/2020,4 star rating,"Great sul lung tang.  Probably one of THE best in k-town.  However, knocking down a star bc i find it a bit ridiculous to pay $15 for a bowl of soup.  I understand everyone is enduring hardship esp small business owners, however, I was in shock to see how pricey this place got.All in all, their food is solid and their kimchi & ggak-do-gi is money."
10/19/2021,5 star rating,"Menu is limited to sul lung tang but that means they are specialists in the dish here! You add a bunch of seasonings and toppings to the soup since it's a pretty simple broth. A great meal if you're ever feeling sick, hungover, or the weather is cold!"
10/29/2021,5 star rating,"This is THE PLACE for korean soup. I don't think you can find anywhere better than here. The menu is simple, you can only pick what kind of meat you want for the soup, and that's it. The kimchi radish is also really good.  all around a wonderful soup that's perfect for a chilly day."
7/1/2021,5 star rating,"So simple yet so tasty This Korean Ox Bone Soup with beef brisket, tripe, intestines, flank, tongue, spleen is your go-to when you're feeling under the weather. Hot steaming rice dipped in this hearty soup while having a sour taste from pickled radish and kimchi will definitely complete your day!"
1/21/2022,5 star rating,"Although their price keeps on cripping up, there soup stays the same, always delicious and rich in flavor.  This is one of the restaurants that I always order take-out to bring home when I visit K-town."
7/6/2021,5 star rating,"I love the idea of selling very few items and make them great.Ordered the regular and the intestine soup. Both are very flavorful and heavy, which I like. The meats tasted fresh and moist. Now, the cabbage kimchi was good, but not the best. I like the daikon one better.Ordered to go, so don't know about the service, but the pretty lady who took the order was very nice and glade to give me extra kimchi."
5/22/2021,5 star rating,Han Bat always delivers consistent food! I have ordered take out multiple times and also dined in pre-COVID. There is a parking lot in the back and also metered parking in the front. The soup broth is seriously unbeatable and so hearty. Perfect for anytime! I love the kimchi and radish they also give which is another huge reason I love this place! The prices keep going up which is a downfall but otherwise look no further for your sullungtang fix!
4/21/2022,5 star rating,my sons and i's favorite.  sonia and yang and mr. lee are amazing.going back again tonight bro make it 3 nights in a row.  Salgogi with extra briscuit is a must.
7/4/2021,5 star rating,Always so good. They do just one thing and do it really well. I've come here for both dine in and take out and both are great experiences (they pack everything up rly well including the kimchi for takeout). Parking lot means easy parking too!
2/24/2020,3 star rating,"I've enjoyed coming to this place, and this place only, whenever I craved sul lung tang. But now I feel like I need to find a new spot. Their prices have gone up, but quality has gone down. That's what urks me. If the quality was at least consistent, my rating would've been a 4. It just tastes so much more watery...and the kimchi and radish kimchi aren't as good either. The long waits used to be worth it, but not really anymore."
1/1/2020,5 star rating,Warm lightly creamy broth with some noodles topped with generous portions of tender beef tongue and heaps of green onions. Now contrast that with umami rich crunchy kimchee every other bite. Now that is an amazing comfort food combination.Service was excellent. Food came out quickly on a saturday at round 3pm. There was virtually no line.
6/1/2021,3 star rating,"love the beef inside the soup, They are good at beef soup, but I think they could done better, it's good but not surprisingly good."
8/25/2021,5 star rating,"Came here in the middle of a hot day, which I know is not optimal, but han bat did not disappoint! We all got the beef brisket sulungtang. The stew looks very simple but has many levels of flavor. The soup is light, yet the rich flavor of oxbone is present and the brisket was extremely tender. It was korean comfort food at its finest. The free kimchi was also fresh and delicious, make sure to eat up as much as you can. I would highly recommend coming here if you are ever in koreatown and I cannot imagine a better place to go on a colder day."
9/17/2021,5 star rating,"The best sullungtang in Koreatown and probably one of the top 5 authentic korean restaurants in Koreatown, Los Angeles. Sullungtang is a korean soup. I've been coming here for years. Some people like the beef brisket sullungtang. But I love the mixed sullungtang that includes intestine and other stuff. The free side dishes which are the cabbage kim chi and the radish kimchi is so good. I usually pour the radish kimchi juice into my sullungtang to give it a spicy kick. Also, I dump a ton of green onion into the soup. When I have a cold, I always get this to go. I highly recommend this place if you want authentic korean food."
1/25/2021,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Korean dish I've ever had. Seriously. Despite COVID, the restaurant was still lively. The owners were so personable and friendly. I truly enjoyed the experience. Great amount of food will be served. And I can't stress it enough, but the owners really put in the love in each bowl. The price of the meals was very reasonable for the homemade meal you're about to embark on. I live in San Diego and I drive up for their food. Thanks to COVID, we had to eat our meals on the hood of my car. But let me tell you, for the 20 or so minutes it took to eat, my friends and I forgot there was a pandemic. The meal really just reminded us how good a phenomenal meal can make you feel."
11/29/2019,5 star rating,"Second time ever trying a dish like this and am amazed. The beef brisket sul lung tang was really good. Unlimited side dishes that you eat by itself or add it to the soup. For those like myself, clueless, I came here someone who has been here many many times. First, try the soup base first. Really taste what this place is known for. Start slowly adding in the table sides and add to your liking. I would suggest a heavy hand on the green onions, sprinkles of salt and pepper, add some of the kimchi to add some spice to it. Really good"
12/24/2021,4 star rating,"You may wonder why people love to go here. You have taste of five thousand years of culture, soul and heart that are melted in this beef soup! When you taste it, you taste your mother's love. Especially when you are tire, just got out of hospital, arriving at airport or want to taste something at hometown, this is a place!"
10/19/2020,4 star rating,"This place has good sul lung tang but I believe its a bit expensive. The broth is nice and flavorful after adding the green onion and salt it comes with but that is my own personal preference. I usually get the intestine, tripe, and spleen option and it is sooo good!!! It comes with kimchi, radish, and rice. It is definitely filling and a decent portion. I usually have a little bit of leftovers that I save for another meal. It tastes just as good heated up later.I usually order to-go as there was usually a wait there pre-COVID. It is super easy to pick up, they help you quickly and get you out fast which is nice since parking is usually a problem."
2/18/2020,5 star rating,"Heard this was featured on Buzzfeed's Worth It, so I came at 8:30am as a last meal before driving back to NorCal. Even at 8:30am on a Monday, I was surprised that there were 4-5 other parties there! I wasn't too hungry, so I shared a brisket sul lung tang with a friend. Even though the soup itself isn't very flavorful (they provide salt and pepper so you can season to your liking), you can taste the richness from the beef bones! The broth was both light and hearty, and the rice soaked in the broth was a true winning combo. The brisket was also tender, and they were more generous with the meat than I expected! The radish and kimchi were also super tasty. I can't say enough good things about Han bat sul lung tang, and no review can do their food justice! Definitely try this heavenly goodness out for yourself :) my friend enjoyed it so much, she ordered two portions to go!"
11/17/2020,5 star rating,"The best sul lung tang I've tasted!! My friend and I were inspired to try out Han Bat from a popular Youtuber's suggestion and we were not disappointed. The soup is very rich and clean, and compared to other sul lung tangs I've had, it's not as salty. The meat is tender and soft. The glass noodles do not swell too much in the soup, which I prefer. The rice is sfot enough that when you dip it in the soup, it doesn't get too soggy. The kimchi and radishes were also very fresh and flavorful; adding them to the soup elevates the flavors so much! If you're looking for a hearty meal that isn't too heavy, this is the best choice."
11/11/2020,5 star rating,"I got takeout from here on Sunday, and I can't complain about anything. After I called, the food was literally ready in 2 minutes so I had to ask them to wait to pack my food until I was ready to get there. And when I brought the food back home, I scarfed down everything in 10 minutes. The soup was so flavorful and warm, it totally made being in cold weather worth it! And the pickled radish is to die for."
11/4/2021,5 star rating,Any other sul lung tang restaurant can't beat Han bat. I wish they opened Torrance area. Here No sul lung tang at all. Super yummy. Heavenly taste. High quality. Yummy kimchi
1/10/2020,4 star rating,"Came on a Friday around 12pm. There were a few empty tables, but I waited a bit to be seated as there were only two waitresses. Banchan consisted of two types of kimchi, the typical cabbage and a radish one. They were good, a good level of spice for people who cannot handle much but still want to taste the kimchi. I ordered the beef tongue sul lung tang. The broth was just okay for me. Even after flavoring it with salt, pepper, and green onions, I wanted more of a beef taste. The tongue however, was amazing. It was so soft and tender and just melted in your mouth. The glass noodles were okay, and there wasn't a lot. It didn't matter though because I thought the soup and the rice were very filling.Broth was a 3.5/5, beef tongue was a 5/5. At $14.50, it wasn't worth it for me, but if you love soup I would give it a try."
11/10/2019,5 star rating,"I heard this place has the best sullungtang in LA, and honestly it is! Sullungtang is probably my favorite Korean soup. It is ox bone broth that has been simmered for a long period of time, giving the broth a creamy flavor. I ordered:Sal gogi sullungtang ($13.50): AKA with brisket! The broth is so creamy and refreshing. I want to be enveloped in it. There's a little bit of noodles and meat in it as well, but the star of the show is really the broth. With this soup you have to season it yourself with salt/pepper/green onions so be careful! They serve it with 2 kimchi banchan only- one radish kimchi (with giant chunks) and one regular cabbage kimchi. Both were fermented well and complemented the soup perfectly. The menu is very limited but that's probably why they're such experts in their craft. The food came out very quickly. Sit down to finishing our food probably took 30 minutes. It's a hole in the wall restaurant so it may be hard to find. There's a small parking lot in the back. I wish I could come here more often!"
4/5/2021,5 star rating,"If you are looking for a hearty/soupy meal this is the place to go~My BF took me to this place since its his go-to Korean Restaurant in K-Town.The shop itself is a small and parking lot is available in the back, indoor dining is closed due to covid. We both got the Sul Lung Tang with Beef Tongue ($15 with tax).Although $15 for a bowl of soup seems pricy, quality is worth it.Each bowl comes with a container of rice, kimchi, and korean radish.Soup was very light and slightly hazy, it comes with a container of salt and spicy sauce to adjust the seasoning to your taste.Beef tongue was thinly cute and fresh, glass noodz were perfectly chewy.  Kimchi and radish were fresh and full of flavor, can tell they are home made~The one gripe is the container, one of the soup containers leaked while we walked across the street to find seating.Would highly recommend stopping by here for some filling and authentic meal on an LA trip."
7/6/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here since elementary school, and I think their sulluntang is pretty much the gold standard for what sulluntang should be (rich broth, flavorful). The menu here is quite simple and straightforward - sulluntang (beef broth soup) and suyuk (boiled meat), choose which cut of beef you like. Side dishes are two types of kimchi (napa cabbage and radish); napa cabbage is a fresh kimchi heavy in garlic flavor and the radish is a fermented, sweet kimchi (both are the perfect compliments for sulluntang). Even the white rice is good here. Food comes out quickly, and food is always on point.  Can't wait to return!"
7/6/2021,5 star rating,10/10 sul lung tang. This is quintessential Korean comfort food and Han Bat does it well. Their kimchi and kkakdugi are A+ as well.

7/3/2021,3 star rating,"I'm definitely in the minority by saying I didn't think it was all that. I felt like the broth is a bit heavier than Sun Nong Dan. But still not bad. They raised prices a $1 so $15.50 for a bowl now. Like everyone said, this is comfort Korean bone broth soup and comes out a bit bland to those who haven't tried. Add in green onions, salt and the red paste for a lil kick and you have yourself a meal. The brisket is always the go to. Service was good and friendly for take out."
7/2/2021,5 star rating,"Been here a couple times now and it's always really good! Pickup during COVID times has been fast and convenient, and honestly it's one of my favorite places I've eaten in LA. Would recommend adding a good portion of the salt they give you, but the broth is so rich and meaty and good."
7/2/2021,5 star rating,"Brings me so much joy to dine in again, especially at Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. It's absolutely the best. For most people, they serve one thing - Sul Lung Tang (sal golgi), which is ox bone broth with brisket.     The meal is light as the broth is served with a bowl of rice and sides of Kim chi. If you're vegan, this place isn't for you. Unless you want scallion and water."

6/28/2021,5 star rating,"It is shockingly good. I have tried sullungtang in California, Hawaii, Georgia and New York, and nothing can top this place. I usually get the mixed bowl here and it is amazing. They serve you with a big green onion container along with salt and pepper  so you can add them as much as you want, and the warm bowl of white rice mixed in the thick white soup definitely make this a great meal."
6/28/2021,5 star rating,"Delicious, efficient, affordable. MENU: Very straightforward. You can either get the soup (sul lung tang) or the meat without the broth (suyuk). Then you pick your meats (brisket, flank, intestines, tongue, or mixed, which includes everything). FOOD: I went for the brisket soup as it was recommended as a good place to start. My boyfriend was more adventurous and chose the mixed soup. The soup comes out relatively unseasoned, accompanied by kimchi, radish, green onions, and rice. You also have access to salt and chili paste so you can salt/spice it to your desired levels. The chili paste wasn't as strong as I expected which is a plus for me (can't handle the heat). The soup was an excellent base and after some salt/chili manipulation, became a delicious meal. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our lunch here. SERVICE: Very friendly and fast. All our questions about the menu were answered in an affable manner. The food came out almost immediately after we ordered. PARKING: There is a parking lot in the back but it is rather small. We managed to find a single spot there (after driving around the neighborhood trying to find street parking). Check the lot first because street parking is hard to come by in this area. If you can't find anything, you can park in the lot for California Market (a grocery store / food court) across the street."
2/17/2020,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this spot for a long time, but honestly my expectations weren't SUPER high because.. it's just soup, how good could it be right?Turns out this is probably one of my favorite meals I've ever had in my life... not to be dramatic or anything lol. My friends and I ordered the beef brisket sul tang, and we devoured every bit of our dishes. They give you unlimited kimchi, pickled radish, green onion (!!!), and salt to add to your soup, along with a bowl of white rice on the side.The pickled radish here is amazing! It's sooo flavorful and has that satisfying crunch, and it goes perfectly with the richness of the broth. The kimchi is also really satisfying. The star of the show of course was the broth; it's rich, hearty, and SO meaty! The more you drink, the better it gets. We added salt and pickled radish juice to our broth which just took it to the next level. The meat itself is very tender as well, and there are also glass noodles in the soup.The sul tang here was so good that the whole meal all we could talk about was how yummy it was lol. The service is great as well, and the soup comes out really fast (less than 5 min for us). There was a line when we went (a Friday evening) but it moved fast so it wasn't an issue. If you haven't tried this place, pleaseee do yourself a favor and try it!!"
9/16/2021,5 star rating,"MUST-GO TO SUL LUNG TANG PLACE AFTER A NIGHT OF DRINKING. Literally the most soothing thing is waking up slightly hungover and filling yourself with the delicious, hearty, carefully stewed sul lang tang soup. The combo is usually my go-to, but you can select if you want the typical plain beef or intestines and so on. Seriously though, this sul lang tang place has the BEST sul lang tang I've ever had. It's so warm and comforting. If you haven't had sul lang tang, just know that the broth needs to be seasoned to suit your flavor palette. Start with a little bit of salt first and add slowly. You can always add more but you can't take it out after. I love to add a TON of green onions which they are so so so generous with. The kkakdugi and kimchi are great and dump the side of rice in at the end and MmMmMmMMm so satisfying. It's like an instant cure for hangovers but also has a side effect of food coma shortly after."
10/15/2020,4 star rating,"I love sul lung tang and I think Han bat has one of the best in LA. I purposely drove to Ktown to get Han Bat the other day and made my day when I came home. I ate it the next day which I recommend taking out the meat and and noodles out when you put it in the fridge. In my mind, I feel like the noodles will soak up all the delicious broth so I took out and added them back in when I was boiling everything. It was ask good as I remember. I called 5 mins before picking up and everything was ready to go when I got to the location.During pandemic-No sit down but take out is availableStill no credit card and cash onlyParking lot available.

1/13/2020,4 star rating,"I've heard a lot of good reviews about this place and decided to give it a try. I came in on a Monday for lunch and it was already quite busy. I tried the mixed sul lung tang and it came with clear noodles in the broth and a bowl of rice on the side. I wish there were more clear noodles, but the rice also accompanied the meal well. The broth was super creamy and flavorful, the meats were cooked well. You could also add in as much green onion, salt, pepper, and chili as you like. My favorite part was the kimchi-- definitely tasted like it was made in house, not too spicy with the perfect acidity and crunch. I also love that there was a simple menu (prices already included tax) and it seemed like everything in the restaurant flowed smoothly. The staff were all very nice and attentive as well.Tip: Enter from the parking lot side. That's where people will line up to wait."
12/19/2019,5 star rating,"A small hole in the wall place in KTown. Could be a little hard to find since it's not flashy or anything, but there is a bit of parking out in the back. I first visited this restaurant when I was a freshman in school. It was recommended by one of my foodie friends who had been living in LA for a bit, and man, I'm so glad he told me about this place. It was the first place I've ever had sul lung tang, and no other place has made sul lung tang better than Han Bat. They practically only serve this dish along with side dishes that include spicy pickled radish and kimchi which they make themselves! The side dishes are 10/10. They also serve each person a bowl of rice. Once the soup comes out, you can put in green onions and salt/pepper to your liking since it comes out unsalted. I typically order the brisket since I like just one type of meat in my soup. I usually add about 2-3 small spoonfuls of salt and about 2 scoops of green onions. It's absolutely flavorful and so heartwarming. The most heartwarming Korean soup I've ever had! The meat is soft so chewing it is not hard at all. The noodles are also a great addition. For the price of about $13 for a bowl, I highly recommend this place. I always walk out very full and content. It has also been featured in Buzzfeed the past year or so which has increased its popularity immensely. What a lovely restaurant!!"
4/14/2021,5 star rating,"Very friendly people, simple menu and super straightforward.The soup itself is so simple yet hearty. The beef was thinly sliced and melts in your mouth. The ultimate comfort food. Simply so good"
5/2/2021,5 star rating,"Fantastic Sul Lung Tang, kimchi, and spicy radish - humble peasant food executed perfectly!The soup isn't seasoned and may seem underwhelming, but that's the way it's supposed to be. Like other Sul Lung Tang joints, they let you season it to your liking. My recommendation is for you to taste the broth and season it lightly with the salt they have because their kimchi and radish adds the necessary sodium to the dish. Again, lightly salt the broth. If you truly know and appreciate Korean food, this place is a must try. Otherwise, try other Korean food beside our BBQ and train your palate before coming here and writing a negative review. This institution has been a staple in Koreatown for ages and must stay in operation indefinitely!!!"
7/13/2019,4 star rating,"Usually I try not to review restaurants after only one visit, but since this place only has two different dishes, I feel like I got a pretty good idea about the joint.You probably already know this place sells seolleongtang. That's all they offer really, just in different variations. We got the brisket and intestines kinds, and they were fantastic. The two kinds of kimchi they give you are great too, they're just really solid. One cool thing is they pass around a big container of onions, so you can add as much as you want to your stew. It might seem unhygienic, but you won't mind as you're pigging out on your seolleongtang that's full of crunchy chopped spring onions! One bad thing I have to mention is the restaurant smelled pretty terrible that day. If I had to guess, I'd say the toilet broke or something like that, so it might not be an issue when you visit. I didn't really notice after awhile though, I guess I'm just that much of a pig! You might be wondering why I visited such a homely place that so obviously caters to the local Korean population in the area on my first trip to LA. That's because my friend Eugene told me that this restaurant offers $2 valet parking! That sounded really impressive to us, but it turns out that all the Korean restaurants seem to offer this service, so I guess it's just standard practice in LA Koreatown. You can't even park in another plaza and walk to where you wanna go, because valet security dudes will accost you if you're not patronizing one of the businesses in that particular plaza. I guess it's just one of those things that reminds you you're not in Toronto anymore!"
7/25/2020,5 star rating,"I would have posted pictures if it weren't for the fact it was so good there was no time. My family and I always get Mixed Sul Lung Tang for everyone and ask for extra radish to go with it. The soup is amazing, tasty (put salt and scallions to taste!), and contains a good amount of meats! Can definitely get 2 portions out of this soup (tho it's good enough you might not have the restraint to save it for next time)Can I just also compliment the radishes? We absolutely love this place's radishes and to have them with the rice is heaven. Thank you so much for producing such quality food!"
6/23/2019,4 star rating,"Checked out this specialty Korean soup joint after seeing its phenomenal Yelp reviews - pretty good!AMBIENCE (3/5)Front and back entrances as well as a rear parking lot make this no-frills Koreatown soup-only spot relatively accessible - no need to search for parking! Inside, expect an unadorned series of tables both separate and communal.FOOD (4/5)Han Bat's sullultang (seolleongtang), or milky oxbone soup, is a meaty, pure broth with your choice of meat (brisket, flank, tongue, intestine/tripe/spleen, or mixed) and DIY add-ins (green onion, salt, pepper, chili paste). Bowls are compact but filling for $13.50 including tax and come with radish kimchi, cabbage kimchi, and rice. I ordered the popular brisket option which arrived with thin slices of brisket, reminiscent of ultra healthy pho. SERVICE (4/5)Efficient and friendly! Food came out in under 5m. If you're looking for a simple, healthy meal - this soup's for you (would hit the spot on a cold day!)."
10/5/2021,5 star rating,"Lived up to the hype. I like adding the rice into the soup. Would recommend brisket or beef tongue. Tripe was good, spleen was not for me. Also don't think the side of meat is worth the price. Would just order the soup next time."
9/16/2021,5 star rating,"I have had Sul Lung Tang once before at another Korean restaurant and thought it was delicious. I have had this specific restaurant bookmarked for quite a long time after seeing it on an episode of Worth It, and knew I had to try it someday...and that day finally came. They have a small parking lot with valet parking for $2. The restaurant was fairly busy but we were seated promptly. First, two plates of kimchi (cabbage and radish) was brought out with a warm bowl of rice. We placed our orders for the mixed meats and the sul lung tang came out soon after. I tried the soup on its own first, and then added the green onions, salt, and pepper. I kept adding and tasting to make sure that I didn't make it too salty. The combination of the soup with the rice and kimchi was so comforting and delicious. Just thinking back on this meal makes me crave it and I think it would be perfect during a cold day."
8/22/2019,5 star rating,"I watched a buzzfeed video that featured three different soup restaurants and I had to go try out Han Bat the next day.For 13$, you get an amazing oxtail soup that was stewed for hours filled with clear noodles and your choice of flank, brisket, tongue, or tripe, a bowl of white rice, and delicious homemade kimchi and pickled radish... what more can you ask?!I've had my fair share of oxtail soup in the past, but I think Han Bat's was the best one yet!! The umami flavor was very prominent probably due to the long hours they spent boiling the bones. I like to add a tad of salt and a lot of scallions to the soup, as well as a bit of the kimchi juice. This is going to be my go to comfort food place (especially perfect if you are sick and just want to have some hearty hot soup!!)."
8/13/2020,5 star rating,Amazing place to eat white soup. I would say the best place in korean town. It tastes milky and rich with bone broth flavors. Maybe because I didn't have for awhile it seems better then in Korea but who knows. You can ask for scissors if you need to cut meat.It's hard to notice this place outside cause it's one small door.Korean Soup
3/30/2021,5 star rating,"Straight up soul-long tang is what you should call this place.  Service can be a hit or miss depending on how busy they are but you'll get the pleasant but passively annoyed looks/voice if they're busy.But the food is the best for hang overs, rainy days, sad days, happy days, basically any day.  If you're looking for some legit Korean feels, this is the spot to go.  Also their radish kimchi (kakdugi) is on POINT."
11/14/2021,5 star rating,This serves the best Korean Beef Soup in the United States.  The beef bone broth is addicting. The staff are so incredibly friendly.  This is one of the best restaurants in Los Angeles.  You must try this.
7/13/2020,5 star rating,Best place for Sul Lung Tang in LA!!-Hearty soup that isn't overly fatty-Generous with their radish kimchi (which is thick & delicious in soup!)
9/9/2020,5 star rating,"This is hands down one of the best -- if not the best -- sul lung tang place ever. I tried getting sul lung tang somewhere else, and they really just cannot compete with them. I order three brisket sul lung tangs to go, and they told me it would be a 10 minutes wait, but I got there in 5 and they were already ready. Love that they're quick and the food is great."
4/29/2021,5 star rating,The best of the best. PERIOD!!It has never disappointed. The rich taste of the broth soothes your long day. The broth recharges your energy.Please stop by when you are around.
2/11/2020,5 star rating,"Literal definition of HOLE IN THE WALL TREASURE!!!! Han Bat is located on the side of a small street near some residential area across from a Carl's Junior. It blends in with the buildings around it so well that if you're not looking for it, you'd pass right by.The menu here is simple. There are literally 5 things on the menu, featuring different types of meat for your sul lung tang. That's right - that's all this restaurant serves. And it's the LITERAL best.I ordered the NaeJang Sul Lung Tang, which consisted of intestines, tripe, and spleen. They have a container of chili powder, salt, pepper, and green onions on the side for you to season your soup to your liking. I sprinkled mine with a few tiny spoonfuls of salt, some pepper, and a giant heaping of green onions. Then I took my first sip of the broth.I had a literal synesthesia moment from Ratatouille. The richness of the broth overwhelmed my tongue with its flavorful caress. My taste buds tickled in delight by the extra saltiness I added. Each sip was supported by a deep meat flavor - it's very clear that it was broiled carefully for hours out of love. Don't even get me started on the meat! The gopchang (intestines) were chewy and bursting with flavor. The tripe (normally pretty bland, in my experience) was also saturated with the oxtail broth, releasing juicy flavor in each bite as well. And the spleen; this was probably my favorite. I can't explain the incredible tender yet chewy yet textured consistency of this. It was unlike any offal I've ever tried, and I could eat a whole bowl of JUST THIS.Service is super quick and friendly! Even though there was a line going out the back, the turnaround is very fast. We didn't have to wait very long at all, even though it seemed like there were a lot of people in front of us.There is a small private parking lot in the back, if you can score a spot! Otherwise, best of luck finding parking in the residential nearing streets.I'm definitely coming back. This is one of the best soups I've ever had in Ktown, and I don't say that lightly!"
8/22/2021,5 star rating,Went for lunch with the family.My daughter and son are fans of sul lung tang.  Both have their respective approval.  One of the best sul lung tang!Quick service and food!Recommend: highly!
3/16/2020,4 star rating,"My partner and I were recovering from a cold (chill.. it was pre-COVID-19) so we found this highly-rated hole-in-the-wall Korean place on Yelp.  Apparently soup is their specialty and Yelp did not lead us astray!The menu is super simple with only a handful of options.  We opted for the mixed meat and clear bone broth (one order for each of us because we are both food aggressive).  Each order arrived with  some simple banchan and rice.  We were also handed a communal tub (think 5 gallons) of green onions.  Is this a health violation?  We were too hungry to care so we heaped the green onions in our soup.  As soon as we put the lid back on, the waitress grabbed the tub and passed it along to another table.The bone broth soup was so good!  You to season it yourself so you can control the saltiness level.  The mixed beef meat in the soup was a perfect amount for myself (the social meat-eater) but my partner would have preferred more.  Note that you can order a shareable portion of meat on the side if that's your preference.We left soooo stuffed and satisfied.  I can't wait to come here again on a cold and rainy day."
12/20/2020,5 star rating,"Loved my experience at Han Bat Sul Lung Tang and is the quintessential LA K-town stop. The place is fairly small but the staff are friendly and quick with service. Food is amazing - high quality, authentic Korean stews. Shout out to Buzzfeed's ""Worth It"" series for this find!"
7/8/2021,5 star rating,Hands down the best sul lung tang place !! Lots of meat and soups are so rich  must try Korean restaurant
2/4/2020,5 star rating,"Doesn't matter if you're trying to have breakfast, lunch or dinner, this place satisfies it all. Super straightforward menu, you'll see a picture frame at each table in both korean and English. I always go with the sullungtang with brisket. The broth is so rich and tasty, not even greasy and the portions are perfect including the brisket. Comes with the side dishes and the radish kimchi is fermented nicely. The table will have a container full of green onion, salt and utensils will be at the end of the table. If you've never had sullungtang before, taste the broth before adding salt and/or pepper with the green onions. The place is pretty quick with the service and so efficient. Only downside is with how busy it gets, can be tough to get someone's attention if you need something. But hey, I can sacrifice service for some bomb food any day. My absolute favorite spot to eat whenever I'm in LA."
1/11/2020,5 star rating,"$13.50 (including tax) was so definitely ~Worth It~ for a delicious, warm, comforting bowl of Sul Lung Tang on a winter's day. Since they boil the Ox Bone for a day, the broth is SAVORY. The overall flavor is mild, so you need to add green onions, salt, pepper, and/or chili sauce to your liking. I've also seen suggestions to add the sauce from the Radish or Cabbage Kimchi banchan part way through your meal and think that's a good idea too if you're into that and want to mix things up.For me, I initially added green onions and a spoonful of salt and thought that was sufficient because I really wanted to savor the meat flavor of the broth. It is unlike any other beef broth I've tasted and just melts in your mouth. I ordered the Flank and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Brisket soup. The Flank is wonderfully soft and fatty. I wonder if next time I can order half flank and half brisket to have the best of both worlds. The soup also comes with a little bit of rice noodles in it and a bowl of rice on the side. I can't stop thinking about my meal here and can't wait to come back when I get a chance (sadly don't live in this area).P.S. there is a parking lot in the back and you enter through the back door."
7/27/2021,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang around! They have the best food, fast service and really nice staff. I come here for sul lung tang and regardless of if I get take out or eat in the restaurant the food is always great! They also have the best radish kim chee! I have been coming here for at least 2 decades and the food hasn't changed!"
9/3/2021,5 star rating,Some friends took me here the other day. I love soup so I was in heaven eating here. Loved it
1/23/2021,5 star rating,I will make this review simple and straight to the point.  If you want a bowl of sullungtang and perfect kimchi(Kacktoogi). This is the place.  This is korean soul food. The korean comfort food. The hangover food.  Price is decent for the portion. I usually get two bowls for my family of 5. Mucho love!
2/27/2019,5 star rating,"Keeping this review short and sweet, I love Han Bat Sul Lung Tang and I will always visit whenever I'm in L.A. It's the epitome of comfort food, it truly warms my soul. Sounds intense, but so is my love for this restaurant (lol). Small menu so it's quick and easy to order. I always get the mixed meat which comes with brisket, tongue, tripe, spleen, flank, etc. Comes with rice and large sides of kimchi and radish. Doesn't get any better than this, highly highly recommend! I've tried other beef bone broth places back in the Bay Area and they just don't compare. P.S. there is a small parking lot in the back. Don't be like me and forget about this everytime and end up having to look for street parking which is sometimes a complete nightmare."
1/31/2021,4 star rating,"If Han Bat ever goes bankrupt, they can thrive on selling their kimchi alone. Compared to all other side dishes (ban chan), I clean out their plates and I ALWAYS ask for more. As much as I wish Han Bat was a kimchi store they are not, so let's talk about soups. Ever since moving into the neighborhood, Han Bat has been the comfort food that never fails to comfort. They are known for their ox bone soup (sullungtang) and I favor the naejang (intestines, tripe, spleen, tongue). The sullungtangs come non-spicy with a bowl of rice and glass noodles on the side. Customize to taste by adding in-house condiments: green onion, coarse salt, and chili paste. Tip: Kimchi is NOT for sale! Parking: Entrance to small private lot behind the restaurant on 5th St., with metered parking out front. Be careful not to miss as the lot entrance is a side alley with no signs. DO NOT enter off Western Ave. Payment: Credit/Debit accepted Price: $ has gone up since 2019 but still worth every penny"
12/5/2020,5 star rating,"A hole in the wall gem. Look I want to set the context on how amazing the soup is here. I only eat sul lung tang whenever I am feeling hungover or whenever I am feeling under the weather. Sul lung tang is not a type of meal that gets people excited like pizza, burgers, tacos, fried chicken, you name it . However, I sometimes go out of my way and crave the sul lung tang here for a weekend meal. The soup is so damn tasty and soul-warming that I don't even need to put the spicy paste to give it any more taste. I usually do this with other sul lung tang places since the soup is rather bland and needs more enhancement in its flavor. Do yourself a favor - try out this place. As a Korean, I highly recommend! Just don't try this for your first sul lung tang meal because you will only be disappointed with other sul lung tang places."
8/27/2021,5 star rating,"Favorite ever. I can eat this almost every day! Service is fast and great, and they always give extra kimchi if you're taking it to go."
1/20/2020,4 star rating,"Really good comfort food but now expensive. My boyfriend has been hyping this place up for me, as he always mentioned how this was his cheap comfort food spot ($10) during his U$C days. Then he watched the price go from $10 to $12, and now $15. That's crazy. $15 for a simple soup?! Yet there's still a line out the door... There's $2 valet between the restaurant and red brick building. The entrance or line starts behind the restaurant, the same side as the valet lot. The restaurant is small, so there's always gonna be a line. It moves pretty fast though; I think a party of 2-4 leaves at least once every 3-5 minutes. The menu is super simple. Just point to the sign on the wall that has a small v. big option and the type of meat to include. Everyone usually chooses Mixed but I chose just Brisket (no tongue, flank, intestines). The soup comes a little bland, but there's a jar of salt and another of pepper to season, which is a must. Then it becomes really savory and comforting. Although the bowl is large, it's mostly soup, so I found it very manageable to finish without feeling like I over-ate."
12/10/2019,5 star rating,"So soothing I could have this all day and all night and sip it throughout my work day.1- I recommend tongue for it's lean cut and absolute tenderness in the sul lung tang. 2- Absolutely the best kimchi I have tried in Ktown. It's ridiculous how good it is I feel like it is the second reason I would bring people here for. THE KIMCHI!!! which is free!!! 3- Lines can get crazy long. Come early! trust me, it's worth it. 4- Parking is free in the lot behind the restaurant. 5- Service is so fast, McDonalds can't keep up. Basic menu that is perfect and perfect it will stay."
4/29/2019,5 star rating,"This is the Beethoven's 9th symphony of Sul Lung Tang... there is nothing that is as rich and complex in flavor as the Sul Lung Tang here... I would suggest drinking the broth pure before you add anything else...The brisket is absolutely perfect in texture and tenderness. The all meats are for those who are a little adventurous... tripe, intestine, soft cartilage etc. I stick with the brisket! What makes it the next level (as with all Sun Lung Tang places) is the spicy reddish (). It is faithful to every bite and absolutely consistent EVERY SINGLE TIME...It is amazing for breakfast or especially with friends late at night! It brings friends and family together to create a moment. You never feel gross and greasy after the meal! Come and have an experience!"
11/22/2021,5 star rating,I'm just reviewing this to offset the dense humans who give this place under 4 stars.
3/4/2019,4 star rating,"Can't go wrong with this. Their menu is very simple. They have two items on the menu - Ox Bone Soup ( Sul Lung Tang ) for $12.50 each & Meat ( Suyuk ) for $30 each. It's a place where you can just eat and go within 30 mins. Broth is very tasty & rich. My only complaint is the portion is very small. I can probably eat at least a bowl & half. By end of my meal, i'm only full from drinking all my soup and i'll get hungry again within an hour. =/Line: Moves very quickly on Sat night. Waited for 15mins. Parking: There's a parking lot or street parking"
1/18/2022,5 star rating,Super homey restaurant with amazing sul-lung-tang. We ordered the soup with mixed meats and it was the perfect amount of food with good flavor. The sour radish and kimchi sides were really tasty and one of the best Ive tried. What really made our experience was how kind and friendly the waitress was. Can't wait to come back again!
1/22/2022,5 star rating,I love the speed.  You call and it's ready in ten minutes.  The broth is rich and the radish kimchi is some of the best in Koreatown.
7/10/2021,5 star rating,"Oh yeah! For straight up sullang tang stateside, this was a treat. So good!!!! All the basics are given and no other thrills or frills."
11/28/2019,4 star rating,"What sets this Korean soup joint apart from the others is that they offer the naejang (spleen, intestine and tripe). Whenever I come here, that's the one I order! I like that their soup has enough flavor so no additional salt is needed.It's still a very packed place but the turn around is quick so you won't end up waiting long for a table. And, the service is quick but friendly. It used to be cash only but now they accept credit card for over $10. Each bowl of their soup is $13.50 including tax.They have a shared parking in the back but you might have better luck finding street parking. Tidbit: They are open on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year!"
5/8/2008,3 star rating,"Compared to Young Dong:1) The broth at Han Bat has more flavor. No need to add additional salt.  Whereas the broth at Young Dong is lighter in flavor but has a higher quality taste.2) More condiments/seasonings are provided on the table at Young Dong.  I like the kimchee juice. Read my review on Young Dong to see what I use it for.3) The ggak-doogee (kimchee radish) has a bolder taste at Han Bat; More flavorable. Han Bat wins on this one.4) Quality of beef is better at Young Dong5) Quantity of beef is slightly more at Young Dong.6) Young Dong has a TV, newer furniture, and a more modern ambiance to it. Han Bat have more of a hole-in-the-wall feel to it. 7) Both have a private lot but Young Dong's is more visible and easier to find. 8) More selections on the menu at Young Dong.9) Prices are the same.10) Waitress at Han Bat are friendlier because they smile more than then waitress at Young Dong. Overall 3.5 stars.  The extra .5 is for their service. The waitress was very attentive."
12/24/2019,5 star rating,"I finally get it. I love sullungtang*. I always read people's rave reviews of Hanbat and thought, ""How much better can it be?!?!""It's that much better. Enough to make a difference. Maybe it's because they specialize in just their sullungtang and sooyook (boiled pork) but they get it right.*sullungtang, for those of you who don't know, is a beef bone broth, which is cooked down for a long long time, until it has a nice milky color to the broth. It's filled with beef, some sort of noodles, and eaten with green onions, kkakduki (radish kimchi). If you think it's bland, it's not you... it's the soup. You're supposed to salt it to taste. So at Hanbat, what blew me away was the broth. It was so beefy and the umami was incredible, even before adding the salt. I had the mixed meat and found that it came with more innards that other places... which I loved. I know that they can get to be too much for some people. So just keep that in mind!The secret key to sullungtang is their radish kimchi. Hanbat also gets this right. And for our table of 3, they gave us two dishes of them. The sweet, salty, spiciness goes so well with the soup. I dip my kkakduki in my broth and eventually the broth turns pinker from the chili flakes. I know some people prefer to scoop some of the kkakduki sauce into their broth as well.Really, you can eat your sullungtang the way you want it... to your taste. That's the best part for me!"
3/15/2020,5 star rating,"After eating a lot of greasy/fried/unhealthy food, definitely was craving something more ""homey"". My friends and I came for breakfast on a weekday and it was pretty empty. We ordered the beef brisket sul lung tang (brisket ox bone soup) and it tasted sooo good and hit the spot. It felt like all the greasy food we were eating were getting washed down and our stomachs were basically resetting (if that makes any sense). Their kimchi radish was probably the best one I've ever had and it went so well with the soup. The beef in the soup was soft and tender too. Loved it and highly recommend!"
12/17/2019,5 star rating,"Every time a friend visits LA (or any time my boyfriend and I crave a hearty rice soup), we make sure to make a lunch/dinner stop here. I love that this place has a small selection of menu items to choose from and that the food arrives in a speedy and efficient manner. A few minutes after you order, they immediately deliver a hot bowl of soup with choice of meat as well as a bowl of rice. Add in increasing amount of salt that's on the side until well seasoned, add scoops of freshly chopped green onions, and dump in the rice. I personally like to grab a spoonful of rice soup and top it with kimchi so your rice soup remains clear of any kimchi traces. The soup is really good even without the rice!Even if there are many parties ahead of you when you arrive, the wait isn't too long because of how efficiently this restaurant operates. If you're lucky and arrive with no wait, you may be in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes."
12/14/2020,5 star rating,"SO GOOD. This restaurant is truly a hole in the wall gem. The salkogi sullungtang is a bit more meaty than the one at juntong sullungtang, but I love both. Han bat is when you want more gamey rich flavor and Juntong is when you want more mellow rich flavor.ABSOLUTELY love the kimchi. They give you so much, you can have some for later. It is gold. Also they give you dadegi, which is the red pepper paste and it is a GAME CHANGER. ADD THAT TO YOUR SOUP FOR A FOODGASM."
1/26/2019,3 star rating,"Good price and comforting taste, like a home cooked meal. I wouldn't specifically drive to Ktown for this, but I would probably frequent the restaurant much more if I lived in the area. Our wait was quick on a Sunday at 11:45 am. While waiting at the table, we ate the free kimchi and radish banchan.The beef bone soup was white and opaque. Flavor was light and umami without being salty (you're supposed to add your own salt), and it had a lot of body to it. Adding all the rice to the soup made me feel full, but not like I ate too much. As for the brisket, it was nothing special - not particularly soft, meaty or juicy."
1/7/2022,3 star rating,"Very nice owners working hard to please customers. Side dishes are also very good. However, main dish lacks the punch and genuine taste that a native tongue would savor. I had various items like seolungtang, yookgaejang and kalgooksoo."
11/4/2018,5 star rating,"Provender: the oxtail broth. That's why you come here. It's life changing. Whether the weather is cold or you just need something to vanquish that hangover this is the spot. They offer the broth with an assorted variety of meats, but the brisket is my go to.Prices: reasonable, the brisket broth will run you about $12.Parking: there's a small lot behind the building, and metered spots on 5th street.People: fun for all. You know when you see a lot of ethnic people that the food has got to be good.Perks: it's open relatively early 7 days a week. The sullungtang is incredibly flavorful. Although there are a lot of tables inside I wouldn't recommend super large groups. It's more of an intimate setting."
10/30/2020,1 star rating,"I honestly do not understand why this place has good reviews. Ordered sullungtang and galbitang.Sullungtang lacks flavor a lot... It looks legit, like white think broth, but no.. it's not legit.. Taste nothing like thick broth.Galbitang tastes like salt, pepper, msg.Not enough meat on the bones for its price.When we reboiled sullungtang at home (ordered take out), we could see the white residue separates from water and there was a layer of clear water/broth on the top We have cooked sullungtang at home and never seen that before.."
11/3/2019,5 star rating,"We've been going here for years, yet I didn't even realize that I haven't reviewed yet. They are known for their seolleongtan. I usually get mine with brisket. It is a korean ox bone soup which has a milky broth topped with your preferences of salt, pepper, and green onions. The great thing about this soup is you know the broth is rich with a depth of flavor that can only come from bones simmering over a long period of time.They serve 2 types of banchan with radishes and kimchi. Service is relatively quick so you can be in and out with a breeze. Servers are always polite and quick whenever you ask for more banchan or water.Credit card accepted with $10 minimum. Parking can be hard to find at times on the street. There is also a parking lot on the side but it can get full pretty quick when it gets busy.This is great soup to have during those cold winter months when you just need some comforting warm soup."
1/8/2020,4 star rating,"Like a warm hug, Han Bat Sul Lung Tang will definitely hit the spot!We came on a Sunday night and there was a line out the door; ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes. There's a small parking lot out back, otherwise try your luck for street parking. It definitely has a hole-in-the-wall feel, but service is quick and friendly. The menu isn't too extensive, but they do what they do well. The radish and kimchi banchan are super tasty and complement the soup well. Pretty standard, salt and green onions, to taste, as well as a bowl of rice.If you're craving a comforting bowl of hot soup, try it out. This is bone broth at its best!"
2/13/2019,5 star rating,Wow this place is delicious. I had some extra time this morning so decided to come here and try it out. When I first arrived I parked in the back but it is valet only so it was $2. But when I walked in I ordered the salgogi which is beef brisket in ox bone broth. It was my first time trying it and I was amazing. I added two spoons of green onion as well as two small spoons of salt and it made the favor perfect. I definitely will be back.
12/30/2019,4 star rating,"As a born and raised Korean-American, my favorite korean soup of all time has always been seolleongtang. I like to have it when I'm sick and it's perfect recovery food after a night out in ktown! The only reason why I would not rate this place a 5/5 is because the kimchi and kkakdugi (radish kimchi) were not fermented enough. I am the biggest critic of kimchi and a good kkakdugi and kimchi is honestly half the experience at a seolleongtang house. But back to the star of the show, the brisket seolleongtang is the perfect choice for anyone who isn't a fan of all the different types of meat in the mixed seolleongtang, which has intestine and liver meats which I'm personally not a fan of. Before you start seasoning the sh*t out of your soup, def take a taste test because they season the broth so well already. I usually barely add any salt to mine, but def add those green onions for that pop of color. Also by eating kimchi and having the kimchi juice soak into the broth, the soup gets another layer of flavor, so please don't overdo it with the salt seasoning for it essentially ruins the essence of the soup. Overall I do agree that no other place has a broth so flavorful as this place, and I think that's why it is always so busy. This place is not overrated and I respect how efficient they are in cleaning and seating their endless costumers. The parking lot is small but using valet is convenient so you don't have to worry about parking in that madness. If you are a seolleongtang lover or are in the mood for some soothing soup, Han Bat is the place to try!"
6/28/2021,5 star rating,"It is shockingly good. I have tried sullungtang in California, Hawaii, Georgia and New York, and nothing can top this place. I usually get the mixed bowl here and it is amazing. They serve you with a big green onion container along with salt and pepper  so you can add them as much as you want, and the warm bowl of white rice mixed in the thick white soup definitely make this a great meal."
7/25/2021,5 star rating,This is exactly what I am expecting. The food is great with no complicated menus the side dishes is  . Locals are the ones who's actually going to the place that how you can tell this place is authentic. The price for the meal is not that bad as well considering how popular the place is. I've live in Korea for almost 3 years and I can say that this place has the same authenticity with all the restaurants I've been in Korea. I recommended this place for a try.
11/24/2020,5 star rating,"Whenever we come down to LA - this is one of our go to places. I always get the brisket sul lung tang and it comes with plenty of sides including green onions, salt, kimchi and radish!!  Generous portions - we ordered 7 bowls which ended up feeding 6 adults and 8 kids!Support this local business - hoping to find this place still here on our next trip!"
1/12/2020,4 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is a no nonsense mom and pop Korean restaurant where you'll see lots of locals who seem to know this is the place for some fantastic soup!For starters, you might be asking, ""What the heck is Sul Lung Tang?"" Just imagine the Korean version of Jewish chicken noodle soup... a warm, hearty, comforting dish that takes all day to prepare... but substitute chicken stock with oxtail bone broth, and swap the chicken for cow.The different varieties come from the meat that's inside.  I went for the brisket and it was nice and tender...although I might try asking for extra meat next time.With Korean food, along with rice, you usually get little side dishes called Banchan, which include things like kimchi, scallions, and radish.  These get refilled as you need them, which you will, as they're fresh and clean tasting.IMPORTANT: If you're a Korean food rookie, you'll taste the soup and disappointedly think it's bland...IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.YOUR job is to use basically everything on the table (salt, pepper, chili, radish juice, kimchi, your napkin...lol) to season the soup to taste.  Just be careful to taste it as you go, so you don't over do it.The price is right too... right around $14 a bowl!All they serve here is delicious soup, so after one visit, you'll definitely feel like spooning with Han Bat Sul Lung Tang again!"
1/5/2019,4 star rating,"Hat Bang Sul Lang Tang translates into hangover soup, aka Korean comfort food at its finest. Whether it's for post-stomach flu versus ETOH recovery, this soup will do the trick; no judgment included. This restaurant may be a bit difficult to find so look for an understated storefront just off of the busy intersection of Western and 5th and across from a fast food drive thru. The orders:- individual bone soups perfect for the individual hangry folk. Several options to choose from: flank vs beef brisket vs intestines/spleen vs tongue vs mix (of errything). ~$12Now to eat this you throw in your desired concoction of salt, scallions, and kimchi. Pro tip: go light on the salt initially. FYI parking in back (entrance on 5th) and a few metered parking."
4/30/2021,5 star rating,"Best soup I've ever had and I love how fresh my kimchi was. Perfectly seasoned, not too spicy, not too sour, the crunch is just right.  can I give this place 6 stars instead of 5???"
7/11/2019,5 star rating,"Super affordable, super quick, and super delicious. After you order, they will bring you the food immediately. Their oxtail soup is light and hearty. Drinking it will really warm up your soul. Since the original broth has very little flavor, you can flavor it to your liking with the green onions, salt, pepper, and chili. I suggest to taste it first before adding anything inside. I chose to have brisket in my soup and I really enjoyed it. The brisket was soft and so thinly sliced. It was just the right portion of meat for me. You also get a bowl of white rice that goes along perfectly. Kimchi and pickled radish are the only banchan, but that's all you need. This is the ultimate comfort food."

7/6/2018,5 star rating,"The best sullungtang Koreatown has to offer. Hands. Down. I've had this place to-go a million times but today was the first time I dined in. First off, valet was $2 in the back (whaaaack), so I street parked. Place accepts both cash and credit card. Each bowl costs $12.50 (tax included). You can pick your choice of meat or get mixed if you want em all. The soups come with glass noodles and a side of white rice. The soup itself is pretty bland so you can add salt to taste. They also have a bucket of green onions that go around so you can add that in yourself as well. They also give you two types of kimchi- their kkakddoogee is my faaaaaave. The cube-shaped kimchi is amazing and goes well with the soup.  I also love their hot tea (boreecha). This place consistently delivers bomb sullungtang and I don't know a single person who doesn't love it."
7/23/2019,5 star rating,"This is hands down the best sullungtang spot koreatown. The bone broth has a deep, authentic flavor that with a sprinkling of their chunky sea salt and some chopped green onions, is the most soothing meal whether it be a rainy day or a hungover morning. In addition, their kkakdugi (radish) kimchi is the perfect complement and always the perfect ripeness. For some next level flavor, you can pour the kakkdugi juice into the soup for an extra level of deliciousness. The prices have definitely increased over the years, but people still wait in line because you can't find quality like this anywhere else."

11/16/2018,5 star rating,"Yes! This is my kind of place. Home vibe, clean, simple, to the point service. The service is so nice and quick here. They have a simple and exemplary menu. The broths are rich and flavorful. The kimchi is really well made, tasty and fresh. I wish I could take some home. I think more than a few people know about this place as it had tables of all sizes and from all parts of LA. Not just Koreans or Asians. It's one of my favorite places and the only sad thing is that they are not open late. Love this place"
6/30/2019,5 star rating,"Feeling under the weather? Or just feeling like something homey and that warms the soul? Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is where it's at! They only do one thing and they do it extremely well, this Korean Bone Soup. You choose from a variety of meats. Personally I really like doing the Mixed + asking for extra Brisket on the side -- it provides the best value and if you're hungry, it hits the spot.As with other Korean Bone Soups, keep in mind that as is, the broth is fairly flavorless, you need to mix in their delicious salt by the spoonfuls, along with a good dose of the scallions they provide. Mix it to taste! Pairs perfectly with the rice they give and the kimchi/pickled radish. Everytime I go, this place this hits the spot. It's consistent. Feels homey. Hit it up!"
8/20/2019,5 star rating,"$13.50 for a bowl of Sul Lung Tang and rice, tax included. This place was featured on Buzzfeed Worth It. It was pretty empty when I was there around 5pm on a Tuesday. There's a parking lot in the back, which is a welcome surprise! I got the beef brisket sul lung tang (was recommended by the worker); the pork flavor is really nice. The soup has a subtle flavor by itself, but that's why you add sea salt and some green onions. The green onion is passed table to table in a giant tub, which means they take it away after some point in your meal so grab it while you can. You also get homemade kimchi and daikon. Solid food in a hole in the wall place."
1/21/2020,5 star rating,Time* around 5:30pm on Tuesday. Wait* None. Parking* Still a few spots in their rear parking. Food* Mixed ox bone soup. The best and most comforting food to eat in the cold.

6/12/2019,5 star rating,"This place is hands down my favorite Korean oxtail soup, or my FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN K TOWN (or LA even) if anything. Pho used to be my favorite homey dish for whenever I want comfort food, but that has been officially replaced by oxtail soup! My friend even told me that the oxtail soup here is better than the soup they serve in Korea - and that says something!!FOOD: 5/5The broth is just sooo comforting and flavorful. It's a wonderful hearty dish. I got the brisket soup, and I liked how it's not too bland but definitely not on the saltier side. I recommend putting a pinch of salt, and some chilli pepper into the sauce, and a ton of green onions, YUM. This is the kind of soup I'd imagine when I'm sick, my mom would serve me. It has NO artificial flavor, it goes along with rice so well. The brisket in the soup was also not too fatty and was perfect for the soup. You also get some side dishes, which were very delicious and flavorful as well. I personally really liked the kimchi!SERVICE: 5/5The sweet ladies working here were so nice and the dishes came out super fast! Even though it was crowded, I was surprised to have my soup in less than fifteen minutes - what a pleasant surprise :)One thing to note is that it's easy to miss this restaurant. The restaurant is on the side of this road, and it's definitely easy to miss as the outside and inside is white and it's kind of hidden. The food here definitely warms my stomach and my SOUL, and I will definitely be back."
1/11/2021,2 star rating,"I was a regular at this restaurant for about 10 years until the rate of the price hike far exceeded the inflation rate. At this rate, it's probably cheaper to eat at Lawry's than have a bowl of beef soup at this place soon."
10/23/2020,5 star rating,This is my favorite place in ALL LA!!! I have been going for 2-3 years now and I never got disappointed! And the service is great they are really sweet people.
9/21/2019,5 star rating,"I've only had Sul Lung Tang one other time and there's no comparison - Han Bat was levels above what I had before. And they were so fast. We barely sat down before we gave our orders and had our bowls in front of us. Probably were eating 5 minutes after walking in.For those who haven't had this before, it's an ox bone soup which you can get with different meats. They bring you a thing of salt and a tub of green onions for you to flavor yourself. The other time I had this - can't remember the place - I needed to add quite a bit of salt to give the soup taste. But here, you almost didn't need it. The broth was so beefy and good on its own - I did add salt and green onion but was surprised at how good it was even before that.The kimchi they bring is also quite good and acts as a nice balance with the soup. My Sul Lung Tang bowl was $13.50 - 100% worth it. There's parking in the back of the restaurant - pretty easy parking considering it's in Ktown. Definitely recommend you come and try it."
10/14/2019,4 star rating,"I went to check this place out from watching a Buzzfeed video and was so excited for this authentic Korean soup place. I never had Sullungtang before so I did not really know what to expect. Personally, I think the broth was rich from the bone but it's was too bland for my taste. I understand that this might have nothing to do with the restaurant because that's how it's supposed to taste but I wish it would be more seasoned. However, for those who enjoy this soup, I would definitely recommend checking this place out because it's super authentic and the price is reasonable ($13 tax included)."
12/28/2020,5 star rating,"I'm sorry for not posting pictures, but I will describe the food the best I can. Sul lung tang is ox tail soup, but it doesn't have ox tail in it. Basically, it's a beef broth soup with certain kinds of meat. At this restaurant, they offer mixed beef intestines soup or brisket soup. I usually go for the brisket. The beef broth soup is somewhat bland, but they offer a small container of salt with your meal. They also give you green onions. Your soup comes with 2 kinds of kimchi. The first is traditional kimchi and the other is called gottugi (pronounced got-tu-gee). Gottugi kimchi is a square radish kimchi which goes well with the soup.The soup comes with steamed rice. There's also clear vermicelli noodles in the soup, but it isn't much, and the brisket is not as abundant either. When you take the soup home, you mix the soup with the rice in a big bowl. You also eat the kimchi as a side. All together, the soup and rice costs $14.50. I know it sounds pretty simple, because it is simple. It's traditional Korean comfort food and it's great on a rainy day like today. Please support this business."
4/16/2019,4 star rating,"Well, 2015 Celine did not know to add salt and seasoning into the soup.After I figured that out, the oxtail soup became quite delicious! I would wait a few minutes before drinking the soup as it is scalding hot (aka you will burn your tongue). I wish they offered actual oxtail in the soup instead of brisket, but the soup itself is fantastic!"
5/20/2015,3 star rating,"Heard so many good things about this place, and was so disappointed! Came in and ordered their famous Sul Lung Tang and a plate of flank meat. Banchan comes with kimchi and radish, and it was yummy. I love how they give you a whole bucket of green onions for your use! The flank comes with soup on the side and rice and sauce, and it was good. The meat was soft and tender, and had a nice amount of fat for flavoring. The ox bone soup on the other hand, was really whatever. The soup was kind of bland, and had okay flavor. We got the brisket and tongue, and it was tender but nothing that amazing. Really nothing special from what I ate. I guess I didn't get the hype..."
3/10/2018,5 star rating,"Mystifying soup that went from bland to unbelievably savory. I ordered the Shul Lung Tang, which is an oxtail bone broth with some brisket at the base. The brisket in there was decently executed. It was sliced too thin to enjoy it in a substantial way. The meal begins with kimchi and pickled radish in two bowls with some rice. These were earthy and complex with a mild spiciness. They really stood out when placed into the broth. When the broth comes to the table it is unacceptably bland as many others have mentioned. However, something magical happens when you add salt, a bit of rice, and kimchi sauce. The broth became much more beautiful than the sum of its parts. The savory collagen from the oxtail came through. The soup was excellently slick on the palate and held the flavors of the kimchi very well. You definitely need to be your own cook at the table here. But, it is well worth it. This was a unique and complex bowl of soup that definitely satisfied me."
7/28/2021,1 star rating,"Have always loved the food here and it was the first place that we've visited in Los Angeles....again, but I'm sorry to say that this would be our last visitation.  Nope, the food was great, but we simply couldn't finish it due to sanitization issues.  The place was filthy!  Not to mention waitresses gossiping about how many roaches they killed that day and things like they should get paid for $$ for each kill.  That just did it!  The place actually needs a thorough degreasing....perhaps a complete overhaul!  Well it is just sad that I will be losing one of my favorite place."
11/6/2019,5 star rating,"We were at first wary of its grungy interior but quickly convinced that it must be legit - like those run down soup restaurants in kdramas where actors deliciously slurp the soup.Indeed, it was as though we were transported to Korea. The broth was piping hot, milky colored, rich, and no oil floated on the surface. I put in a spoonful of fresh green onions and washed some kkakdoogi (radish kimchi) to add some more flavor to the broth. The pot was empty in less than 10 minutes with not a spoonful to spare for my husband.The waitresses saw my baffled husband - how his wife could down a whole pot of sullungtang without sharing any - so they brought him a small bowl of soup, on the house, out of pity :). I was also super pregnant so they probably understood why I didn't share any. Loved the attentive & quick service. Will be eating here first thing whenever we visit LA from now on."
3/4/2020,5 star rating,"Definitely a hole in the wall restaurant!!!!I was suffering from food poisoning the entire day after eating at a ramen restaurant in the afternoon while on a food tour but when I ate at this place, the rich broth just brought me back to life!! The meat was just so tender and the broth with a bit of salt just warms up the heart and soul. I would highly recommend stopping at this place to grab a bite (slurp)!!"
9/27/2021,5 star rating,The kimchi kinda sucks but han bat has the best sulungtang in LA and it's no debate. Best after a night out of drinking to cure your hangover after a night out and your friends donkeypunch you and slip fingers up your butt. I mean what
1/15/2018,3 star rating,"I never had this kind of soup before but I was not impressed. From the bland broth (tasted like water and not at all any beef or Ox tail taste or silky) to the small stingy meat offerings (4 slices of brisket?... that's all?). I added the kimchi, onions and a bit of salt... it made it a little better like a kimchi soup... but I just didn't get the flavorful broth like everyone mentioned. I'm sure it's super flavorful at certain times, maybe we were getting a new batch and it needed to settle in. It was just okay... but I love soup and would love to try another place take on this soup!"

5/9/2018,5 star rating,"Love this place! If you're ever in need of some sul lung tang this is the place to be, best in LA in my experience. Their menu is really simple, all you have to do is pick which kind of meat you'd like in your soup. Helps indecisive people like me out a lot. The service is super fast and the servers are very nice and efficient. Food comes out super fast, usually within 5 minutes of ordering.I love coming to this place whenever I'm sick or hungover because the broth is very light and easy on the stomach. Makes me feel like I'm at home being taken care of my mom whenever I eat here. If you're new to sul lung tang, don't forget to add a little bit of salt and pepper since it can be a little bland. Also, be sure to dump a bunch of chopped up green onion. The container gets passed around but the servers are usually pretty good about getting it to everyone."
9/16/2018,4 star rating,"Their Shul Lung Tang is amazing. Very limited menu, so you come for one of two things basically and choose your meat.You don't get an array of banchan like other Korean places either, so if you're looking for that, this isn't the place. So if you're craving a nice hot bowl of comforting soup, come give them a shot!Parking lot in back and just a few meters out front."
5/13/2018,5 star rating,"The best place for Korean oxtail soup in Korean town. Don't disappoint by the simple restaurant and the menu. They only have one kind of soup and five types of ingredients.Step 1: oxtail Soup for sureeeee！Step 2: choose the ingredients. Mixed, beef brisket, flank, intestines&tripe&spleen, beef tongue. Highly recommend the mixed (basically you get everything beside tongue)Step 3: add the black pepper, salt, and green onions base on your preference.Step 4: enjoy the soup with housemade kimchi and rice. Awwww, the soup cured my tummy. :)"
9/3/2020,1 star rating,I honestly used to like them. But they seem to be selling sullungtang that is a mix of small portion of actual beef broth and powdered bone marrow flavoring to their soup. A good sullungtang should congeal completely when refrigerated but this one doesn't. At the end of the broth sometimes you can see some powders gathered up. Just go other sullungtang spots like Chakan or Young Dong around the corner.            .           ?   .      .
5/30/2019,4 star rating,"Found this place through Yelp and almost missed it driving by since it's a hole in the wall. The broth is bland, but as are a lot of clear tangs. This is why they have salt and pepper there for you. It's very light. I came here when I was really sick and it was great comfort food. I didn't feel heavy after. There are glass noodles in the broth, not a lot, but it comes with rice. What I liked about this place was that they leave green onions as a condiment on the table. It was nice to be able to put as much as I wanted. For Korean soups, I do like the non-clear broths. I like the red and spicy soups, so I don't know if I'd come here again. However, if you do like clear tangs, this is a place people like going to. The menu is simple and you're not going to feel super gross or guilty after!"
4/22/2019,5 star rating,"WOW, place is wonderful. Not only is the menu simple, easy, and delicious, but this place takes the cake on service, pricing, and accommodations... Parking is easy and FREE in the back parking lot. You can roll up, get seated, place the order and be eating fresh in 5 minutes flat.Although I've had everything on the menu, I'll say for starters, or easier stomaches, the brisket is a bit friendlier... I usually am straight to the brisket as it's perfect, every time. If I'm super, super hungry, oxtail it is. Everything else is a little bit tough for me in general, but if your accustomed to tripe, etc, then it's for sure in you ballgame.Best salt... Odd, but real... The flakey salt is seriously great. Load up with green unions, couple dabs of the chili paste, and your rolling.I've gone to this place three times this last week... Been taking friends out after work and stuff too. There's a reason this place has the best rating on yelp... Don't take my word for it."

6/24/2020,4 star rating,Still one of the best comfort food in Koreatown. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the hike in price to $14.50. They are only doing togo's right now because of Covid19.
12/28/2019,3 star rating,"I can't believe how packed this place was at 10AM on a Saturday. There was already a line forming. We had never been here before and had no idea that they only serve two things. The ox tail soup broth is one of them and you choose which meat you'd like and bam, it's there. They have raddish and kimchi. The soup was good, a little bland for me. Once we ran out of raddish and kimchi, it was really hard getting more. Getting their attention is super difficult and we were sitting in the back of the restaurant. I wish I had known about the parking in the back (it was full at 10AM regardless) because it was reeeeeally hard trying to find parking around the street. Neighborhood around there is a little sketch so be careful. Overall, it was nice trying it, but not filling enough for me..."

2/18/2019,4 star rating,"My friends have always brought me to the best restaurants when we get together for lunch after church, and this place was another good one to add to my collection of delicious Ktown restaurants I've tried. Han Bat is popular for their sul lung tang (ox bone soup) and the so-yook/suyuk (boiled beef). Their menu is not extensive by any means, but I believe that what keeps customers coming back is that they perfect every item on the menu. The beef soup is $13.50 (tax included) per bowl no matter which combination you order and the boiled beef is $33 (including tax) no mater which combination as well. Since it was my first time, my friend recommended that I try the brisket - I believe that's the most popular item and will ease first-timers in to the world of sul lung tang. But if you're a fan of Chinese or Viet cuisine, I'm sure you'll be fine with the flank, tongue, intestine, tripe combinations as well. So you get a rather large bowl of broth along with a bowl of rice. There's side dishes of kimchi and pickled radishes as well as a tub of green onions and salt so that you can customize your bowl of soup to your liking. If you come during a cold day, I guarantee you that a sip of this soup will warm up your entire body so fast that you won't even be aware of how cold it was. I added a minimal amount of salt and green onion, and did mix some kimchi and pickled radishes in. The soup itself doesn't have much inside except for several slices of brisket (or whatever meat combination you order) and some glass noodles. Some friends dumped rice into the soup while others poured soup into the rice bowl. It's up to you to see what suits you the best. I have to say that the ox bone soup was really really good. It tasted as if it had been cooking for quite some time, yet the flavor was not too heavy. It was pretty light and ""qing"", which is perfect for those who enjoy a lighter/cleaner taste. Brisket was soft and tender and tasted good in conjunction with the soft rice. The restaurant has a good number of tables, but even then there was a wait on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Since most people order the ox bone broth, food comes out quickly and customers are in and out within 30-45 minutes. There's a small lot behind the restaurant that I believe might be valet on weekdays. It was self-park on Sunday, and we had to wait several minutes before a spot opened up. There's also street parking as well if you don't mind walking a bit. tl;dr - Definitely a great place for something light yet filling, especially on a cold day. Price is alright (slightly pricey, but worth the visit). If I'm in the area, I will probably order the combination instead of the brisket. Feel like that's more worth it and I enjoy eating the various types of meat instead of just brisket."

2/27/2018,5 star rating,"woahhh... this soup is so flavorful. milky and rich. They have a limited menu of 2 dishes, but what they do right, they nail it. If you have any doubts, the fact that they can serve two things and run a successful business, shows you how great this is.They serve ox bone soup with your choice of beef, brisket, flank, intestine or tongue. I got the brisket and my girlfriend got the tongue. So delicious. It comes with a side of kim chi, pickled radish and a bowl of rice. And of course, a big basketball of raw green onions. I didn't add any salt in mine as I just wanted to taste the richness and flavor of all that bone marrow. The meat and noodles on the bottom were so good. The only issue I had with it was that I wish there was more of it to eat. I came feeling a bit under the weather and I thought the bowl of soup gave me back life. If you're sick and need something to help ease the sickness, this soup might just be the cure.WARNING: CASH ONLYParking lot in the back.

11/22/2017,4 star rating,"A solid Korean restaurant serving primarily different types of stew, soups, and other Korean style tapas.Pro-tip: ask for the scallions -- they're free with order-- but for whatever reason, my waiter neglected to provide me the hook-up.Ordered the famous brisket soup. Comes with side white rice, spicy radish kimchi, and also some spicy pickles. The sticky white rice blends particular well at the bottom of your side dishes with the molten assortments of spicy sauces.Now for the brisket soup. The broth is corn, bland and tasteless .... that is without the side Korean salts and chili spreads. You're gonna want to pour a sizable helping of that in there. You'd think this to be a minor nuisance, but the owners want the customer to dictate the spiciness /saltiness factor of the dish. It actually works better this way to be honest.With all the side dishes plus the soup, it's actually a pretty good deal at eleven dollars. Would definitely come back!"

It has been consistently amazing every time I've come.The menu is very simple, just a few options for different choices of meat with sul lung tang bone broth. It comes with kimchi, radish, and rice, and you add salt and scallions to the broth to taste. It's rich but not heavy, and portions are quite generous. Service is very efficient and orders come quick. Overall, highly highly recommend trying out this place. Especially if your stomach is feeling overwhelmed from KBBQ or alcohol, come here for some revitalizing magic broth, and you will come out feeling like a new person."
1/4/2018,4 star rating,"Solid place to get Korean food from a nice local mom and pop shop here in LA. Coming from Vancouver, I realized we are already spoiled with a very good and comparable selection of Korean food that can definitely rival what's available in LA. That being said, I definitely think that this restaurant is a good option if you are looking for a delicious home-made style meal. The hours are also pretty decent for a local business, with the store closing at 10pm everyday. I opted to get the Shul-Lung Tang (beef soup) which you can choose between five different types of meat. I got the mixed one that allows you to sample a little bit of everything (comes with brisket, flank, intestine, tripe and spleen...but not tongue). Also included is a bowl of rice, and some delicious kimchi and radish. Another cool thing is that the soup is not salted so you can add as much (or as little as you like) which makes your soup very customizable. And, you can also add your own customized amount of onions as well. Overall, for $11.50 this is a great meal to have in K-town and definitely reflects the good choices that locals have when it comes to getting an authentic meal!"
1/4/2020,4 star rating,Soothing and flavourful soup! I ordered the ox tongue Sul Lung Tang and the meat is tender and perfectly cooked. I especially loved the glass noodles in the soup. You salt your own soup to taste; go easy and try it as you season to make sure you don't over salt and ruin the soup! We went on Saturday around noon and it was a 5-ish minute wait.
2/15/2021,5 star rating,"This spot is so great for takeout during COVID. The food is amazing, and they give large portions of everything! My favorite is the brisket oxtail bone soup, and it comes with a bunch of rice and kimchi (and the kimchi is so good). I always buy extra, to eat the next day too because it still tastes great!!"
2/12/2020,5 star rating,"Holy wow, I've been coming here for 7 years. This place has the consistency of a Michelin restaurant, their soup and kimchi have not changed flavor in any of those 7 years I have been here. The only thing that has changed is their price *cries* It used to be $8.72 in 2013, now it's $14.50 in 2020 *face into keyboard* If my salary went up as much as the cost for their soup has I'd feel so good. That being said they're still good and they know it. Mark my words, in a few years this place is going to cost $20 then we're all screwed. At some point, this place will stop being an affordable-ish dinner spot. It's already halfway there, unfortunately.They at least accept credit cards now....."
6/11/2016,5 star rating,"Consistency is key to a good place and this place is consistent even after eating here for 3 years it's good flavor and quality hasn't budged. Except their price   :(There does seem to be a more funky smell in the building but that is attributed to the kimchi fermenting. The beef brisket soup is on point per usual. Hell, even my white non-Asian food eating friend wants to come back and he was devouring the radish kimchi too. This is a good place to introduce people to Korean food if they aren't familiar with it. I haven't met anyone who doesn't like this place."
12/22/2013,5 star rating,"This soup is phenomenal.I ordered the brisket beef soup. The menu is crazy simple, the soup is crazy simple, and the two kimchi's are also crazy simple. But for something so simple they do an expert job executing these simple dishes and every bite of kimchi and beef soup is just beyond exceptional. They don't skimp with the kimchi, either. They keep refilling your bowls with a very generous amount and whatever you have left you can take home with you. The thinly sliced brisket in the beef soup is still full of flavor, extremely fresh, and perfectly tender. The only thing I could possibly criticize is they're cash only.  I'll be back."
9/24/2017,5 star rating,"I think you have to love Korean food to really appreciate this kind of food. My hubby, a Chinese man didn't think they were that great, but me, a true Korean appreciates the authentic sulungtang. I  know how hard and how long it takes to get the soup base just right and the meat the perfect chewiness with out being overly cooked. I have to admit the meat was little gamy but that's what you'd expect from this type of soup. It's soul food of Korea!I also liked that they give you a big container of chopped green onions on each table so you can load up as much as you'd like. Looking forward to going back."
3/3/2020,5 star rating,"Can we just say how simple Han Bat's menu is, but by being simple, it's so tasty. Upon entering, it's a pretty fast wait and sit and order process. While the restaurant is busy, make sure that you take a look at the menu that is on the wall of every table. It's simple and make sure to get the soup! FOOD: Sul Lung Tang. Oh so good. I can see why some people say the broth has little flavor; however, it's actually quite deep and you need to add some salt and green onion (the giant tub of green onion) is provided to you to help enhance the flavors to your liking. While a lot of people I know like to eat more mild flavors, you can adjust it to match your pallete. You do get a side of rice and all of the kimchi you'd like, and that kimchi is oh, so fresh and tasty. Thinking about it is making me drool. SERVICE: Speedy, efficient, and doesn't waste any time. It's a no frills type of place that accommodates a good number of people for a solid bowl of Sul Lung Tang. Come here when it's a little chilly outside, warm your heart, and sip on mighty tasty soup."
12/28/2017,5 star rating,"** Simplistic yet tasty spot in Korea Town that isn't over crowded. Great for a lighter meal that doesn't feel to heavy or a late night snack.Not feeling like waiting hours for kbbq or taking in a heavy amount of oily food? Need a lighter meal after a long night of drinking or just something to fill you up if you aren't too hungry? You've come to the right place.At this place the menu is simple - basically pick the type of meat you want to go into your soup (brisket, tongue, flank, etc) and it will cost around $11.50 for the regular bowl. I ordered the brisket soup, which comes with a side of rice, radishes and kimchi. The first thing I noticed was the freshness of the radishes and the kimchi. The vegetables tasted really fresh and not overly fermented, which got me asking for seconds. They offer you a container of green peppers and salt / pepper as well so that you can customize the tastes according to your need, but overall the soup is very light yet tasty. A lot of the experience is being able to pick up subtleties in the soup. I could definitely notice the richness of the soup in the sense that it for sure tasted like it was slowly cooked with the bones for a long time in order to soak in the flavor. Service was also really friendly and made us feel at home. Great alternative to kbbq."

9/26/2021,5 star rating,This restaurant is always the go to place when you're looking for a Korean Soul Food. The seollungtang here is better than other seolluntang places in Koreatown. The wait is never too long and the food quality is always the same here. The restaurant is not too small or big but a perfect sized Korean feel restaurant to look for. I kinda wish that they open later into the night like sun nong dang does. People looking for a traditional korean food should try out here!
8/28/2017,5 star rating,"This is a very simple type of meal. It is based on soup and rice - and that's it. It doesn't SOUND like it would be very tasty, but it actually is quite satisfying. You can choose your soup base (I like to get the regular plain base) and adjust the soup according to taste. They have peculiar salt and pepper and condiments at the table. Don't hesitate to try them! What they give also doesn't seem like it would be filling, but trust me - the rice is just enough to complement the soup and leave you full and satisfied. Warning: if you're trying to go on a no-rice diet, this is not the place for you. You can't eat the soup with some rice!! (At least I can't.)The restroom was a little dirty, but I didn't expect much - it's in ktown."
9/15/2020,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang ever!!!!!!!!Even in Korea, I never been have tasty one!!I recommend this restaurant!"
3/18/2019,3 star rating,"Good ox bone soup but portion could be (a lot) bigger.The menu at this restaurant is as simple as the one at In-N-Out. You either get the ox bone soup with the meat of your choice or just the meat. We ordered two soups with brisket and one with mixed meats. The flavor of the brisket is excellent and you can always add more spices to the soup if it's too bland (which it is).Overall, it's a decent place to be if you're craving this kind of food. However, I don't feel the price ($13.50) justifies a return trip due to the small portion. There's parking in the back and also on the residential streets. Service is friendly.  Recommend if you're not super hungry."
8/11/2019,4 star rating,"This hole in the wall place is one of the best sul lung tang place I've ever tasted. The broth is so rich and tasty I can never get enough! Make sure you use a generous amount of salt and pepper and season it right! The meat is also abundant in each bowl and chewy! We went on a Saturday 9:30pm (30 mins before closing) and there was a wait of about two parties ahead of us. Due to the quick turnaround, we were seated within 10 minutes! My favorite is the spicy radish--I always end up requesting a second plate of it! I think the only thing is that they have only about 2 waitresses which results in the lack of attentive service. The waitresses also are not very eloquent in English but still greet you with great smiles.There is parking in the rear so make sure you take advantage of that in the busy streets of Koreatown!"
2/3/2019,5 star rating,"Such great comfort food, especially on a rainy day!! The portion size is perfect if you're not looking to walk out of the place with a food coma. The menu is extremely simple - it's all pretty much one soup dish with different combinations of meat that they can add into it. They also provide you with unlimited spicy sauce, rice, green onions and salt. I thought the salt was a weird touch, but apparently older Korean folks like to eat their soup super bland - so they let you choose the salt level on your own (according to my korean SO haha). Guess that's nice!Parking lot is small, but we were able to find parking easily. This is one of the few spots in Ktown where parking is free so woo!"
1/10/2019,4 star rating,"I came here after craving korean bone soup from sun nong dan. This joint is a little different -- they only have 1 item on the menu: the korean ox tail soup. The prices here are cheaper than SND, but the soup is also a lot less filling. If you eat normal meals and intent to eat a meal here, make sure to order the extra side plate of meat otherwise you'll most likely leave hungry. My dad doesn't eat much normally, but even he felt like dining here was more of a snack than a meal. personally, I'm a big fan of soups so i had no issues with the portion but I know most people will not agree with me :P Compared to SND, I must say the other branch does win but I'm not sure if they win enough for a 3 hour wait."
12/23/2018,4 star rating,"If you need a change of taste of not having the Korean BBQ or all you can eat, then this is a place for you.  It is a small restaurant located in Korean town. There is a parking lot at the back of the restaurant but difficult to find the entrance in the evening, especially if you are out of town! We just looked for street parking nearby. They basically have two items on the menu - ox bone soup (Sul Lung Tang ) for $12.50 each and meat (Suyuk ) for $30 each, including taxes.  The ox bone soup has 5 choices of meat are: Seokum (Mixed), Salgogi (Beef Brisket), Yangji (Flank), Naejang (Intestine, Tripe & Spleen), and Wuseol (Tongue). Each comes with a bowl of rice and two dishes of Kimchi nappa cabbage and Kimchi daikon. The meat has 3 choices: Seokum (Mixed), Yangji (Flank), and Naejang (Intestine, Tripe & Spleen). We ordered the ox bone soup with mixed, beef brisket, flank, and tongue. The broth was simple, rich, and tasty. One can add salt and green onions to the broth at his/her liking. All the meat was very tender and tasty.  However, if they add more meat to the broth, then it will be more satisfying! Overall, the quality of the meat and soup was very good! The menu is simple but adequate for a quick meal."
7/10/2021,5 star rating,Been coming here since I was a child. It's a staple comfort food in ktown. My favorite is the intestine and spleen. Their kakdugee is really good too.
11/29/2019,5 star rating,"The best Sul Lung Tang in K Town. I came here quite frequently and I like to order their Beef frisky. The hot beef broth is very soothing and their kimchi and daikon are always very refreshing.I would say Sul Lung Tang is probably one of the best ""Asian comfort food"" and very healthy for you.If you haven't try it, you should!"
4/22/2019,5 star rating,"I have to say that Han Bat is by far my favorite sullungtang restaurant. What is sullungtang? It's a Korean broth soup made from ox bones, briskets, and other cuts. The key to a good bowl of soup is to boil it for long hours. How do you eat it? They will bring you your soup and you season it and garnish it at your table to your liking. Most sullungtang will come unsalted, but I feel like Han Bat serves it slightly seasoned. Add salt and pepper to taste! (always start with a little since you can always add more but you cant take back what's already been added) lastly, garnish with some chopped green onions. Typically people will dunk their whole bowl of rice into the soup, but that's up to you. Enjoy with some kimchi!!Speaking of kimchi... a good sullungtang restaurant is not only rated for the soup but for the kimchi. Most other Korean restaurants gets fancy with their side dishes, because that's just a normal Korean meal. However, sullungtang only calls for good kimchi. Han Bat's kimchi is also delicious. What I love about this restaurant too is that it's very quick. Your bowl of soup should be out within 5 minutes."
7/6/2021,5 star rating,"I've been coming here since elementary school, and I think their sulluntang is pretty much the gold standard for what sulluntang should be (rich broth, flavorful). The menu here is quite simple and straightforward - sulluntang (beef broth soup) and suyuk (boiled meat), choose which cut of beef you like. Side dishes are two types of kimchi (napa cabbage and radish); napa cabbage is a fresh kimchi heavy in garlic flavor and the radish is a fermented, sweet kimchi (both are the perfect compliments for sulluntang). Even the white rice is good here. Food comes out quickly, and food is always on point.  Can't wait to return!"
5/11/2017,5 star rating,"Oh yes, the need for comfort food is real.Parking sucks.Prices are reasonable.They have a very small menu,  just go for the sul lung tang with your choice of meat. Brisket is my choice of go to when I'm there. So good. They provide you with the sea salt (just a little to enhance), kimchi (cabbage and radish), and green onions. Simple, comfort food."

True soul food!When I miss home or Korean food, I eat here. The soup just heals you.The taste is great! The service is poor. And got worse over the years. There are way too many people. It is very popular now compared to almost three years ago. Parking is a nightmare. Finding the restaurant is also not easy.BUT! BUT! It is still too good. I love the soup with lot of green onions!Instant healing!They are the best Sul Lung Tang place!PSI think they put less meat now :( Also, service is really gotten worse over the years-"
1/12/2019,5 star rating,"The BEST sul lung tang in ktown. Korean ox tail soup is a great hangover cure, good if you're sick, and on a cloudy/rainy day like today. I come here at least once a week because it's that good.I usually get the beef brisket option, but they offer other choices such as flank, tongue, and intestines. I usually come here in the mornings/lunchtime so I don't feel as adventurous and need a guarantee with the beef brisket. The broth is love at first slurp - clean, great oxtail bone flavor, and hearty. It may seem bland, but you have to enjoy it at its purest form before adding in the condiments such as salt, pepper, and green onions. I usually scoop a nice amount of scallions in there for a nice crunch and texture in every bite. The generous portion of brisket is soft and tender. They also have glass noodles in the soup as well which I find is a nice break in between the rice. I usually take a bite of the brisket and chase it with a nice scoop of rice with my spoon and dunk it into the soup.The kimchi and radish sides here are okay, they don't really have the fermented/fishy flavor I usually like in kimchi, with a more sweet/chili flavor. However, it's still a nice break to cleanse your palette in between bites and balances out the oxtail soup real well."
11/30/2018,5 star rating,"Before going into my usual telling you the story of my life in the guise of reviewing food, some observations:Just driving through parts of Koreatown, I noticed a ton of restaurants that are suspiciously named after already famous/established restaurants in Seoul; for example, on Wilshire you have Cheongjin'ok, whose logo design and menu seem to closely resemble its Euljiro counterpart, regaled among the middle-aged population of Jung-gu for their unparalleled Haejangkuk prowess in the area; also on Wilshire there's Myungdong Kyoja, which although romanized differently, apparently serves the same kalguksu, mandu, and garlic kimchi that its super popular Myeongdong counterpart does in Seoul; and just one more example, there's also a Shinchon Seolleongtang, whose inspiration I used to frequent while working as a researcher at Yonsei.But Hanbat Seolleongtang is pretty much as good as it gets for seolleongtang outside of Korea; you could probably make the argument that they'd probably do well even if they were located somewhere in an odd alley in one of Seoul's dilapidating ""historical districts,"" but I'll save that for later because I still want to talk about the food.Hanbat is to LA K-town what Yi'mun is to Seoul; they prepare their soup by boiling together not only the bones and the meat, but also the intestines, head meat, and from the looks of the menu a little bit of the tongue as well. Hanbat is also the first place outside of Yi'mun that I've been to which offers spleen as one of the ingredients--they curiously also offer a seolleongtang which just comes with cow tongue which the Japanese side of me was ready to jump into without second thought until I saw spleen on the menu.Each order of the seolleongtang comes with ye olde bucket of chopped spring onions, and some of the most heavily flavored geotjuri and ggakdugi you're likely to find on this side of the Pacific.For a brief moment this morning I had a near panic-attack because I was almost convinced I was back in Korea."
2/14/2017,4 star rating,"I've eaten here a couple of times. If you want a no-fuss place, this is it.The menu is very limited so there's not much deciding you have to do since it's mainly Korean soups that are served.  The dining area is small and cozy and can get crowded during peak hours but the tables clear fairly fast so you won't wait more than 10 minutes at the most usually.I've had the Sul Lung Tang with Salgogi beef brisket which is comfort in a bowl. The broth is served unseasoned so you have to add a few available condiments such as green onions that is in a large plastic container, some salt, pepper and a red paste which I usually load up on. Mix it all up to your taste and liking. It's really a satisfying meal. The brisket is tender and you get a decent portion for the price.Banchan is limited to pickled daikon (radish) and Kim chee but it fills you up rather well. You also get a side bowl of white rice which most patrons add into their soup.Service is what it is given the little English the ladies speak but they understand since you just point to the dish listed on the menu taped to the wall near your table. Once you are served, you're not really checked in on unless you request more banchan but they will come instantly to replenish your sides and get you anything else you need. They are very attentive when called upon.Parking is street so it could be a slight hassle in this part of town but with patience, you can usually find a spot in the residential neighborhood to the west. It's cash only of course. I like eating here and will definitely return again given the opportunity."

2/29/2020,5 star rating,"After reading reviews of people calling the broth flavorless, I was nervous to try this place. I am SO glad I finally made it here tonight.The sul lung tang is AMAZING. The broth is very rich and almost creamy -- it is divine. You can add salt to your liking, plus ALL of the sliced scallions, some chili paste if your heart desires (mine did not). It comes with rice, which I put in the soup. They also bring kimchi and pickled radish to the table, which hit the spot. I can't wait to come back; I'm already craving it."

I usually get the beef brisket one.If you want the eat the food quickly (ESPECIALLY on a Sunday - all the Korean ajummas come through after church or something and take over this spot), I suggest ordering the food to go.You'll thank me later (via Yelp ;)).They have a private parking lot too."

I might be a little biased because of my proclivity for Asian cuisine, but I think the flavors are unique and hearty enough that even a novice to Korean food would enjoy it. Not a whole lot to choose from on the menu. That means they have decided to focus on doing a few things and they are outstanding at it. Service was great and the food was at our table shortly after we ordered. Definitely a go to for Korean comfort food."
10/21/2019,4 star rating,"After seeing this place on Buzzfeed, and suhlungtang being one of my go to Korean soups, I was super excited to try Han Bat. We arrived to eat on a Friday night at about 7:00 and the restaurant was filled. Only at the time that we went, a line gradually formed behind us so we were lucky that we only had to wait about 5 minutes. Food: Warm, flavorful and comforting. The menu of the restaurant is very limited but that's because they're just being smart and sticking to producing the best of one thing. My friend and I both got the mixed option. The soup was warm, flavorful and comforting, filled with a generous amount of meat. They give you a huge bin of green onions that you can add as much as you want into the soup. They also provide their spicy radish and homemade kimchee side dishes and coming from a Korean, the kimchee was probably one of the best I have ever had. The price of the soup is ~$13 which is a bit steep for suhlungtang in my experience but I guess for the quality and taste, I can't complain too much. I really enjoyed my meal and as the nights in LA were a bit chillier than Hawaii, the warm soup was a perfect dinner choice.Service: Oftentimes, the servers of true Korean establishments appear rude and rushed but I think it's because of their dedication to producing quick service. The turnover at the restaurant was very quick. I do wish the Korean ""ahjummas"" were more hospitable but it didn't take away from the overall experience too much.Parking: They have a small lot in the back as well as street parking. Otherwise, you can park for free at the lot of California Market and just walk over."
4/30/2020,4 star rating,Came across this place randomly and had to try it.I'm a big fan of trying new things and the stuff they offered on the menu was very different than anything I've ever heard of.There isn't many choices on the menu but the soup that they specialize in is great! Their kimchi radish is amazing and their Beef Brisket Su Lung Tang soup definitely has it's own unique taste and was perfect for cold day that it was. It is a little pricey I spent about $35-$40 for 2 people. But it was a unique experience and worth getting the opportunity to try food that I had never tried.I'd definitely love to come back here soon to try it again!
6/6/2020,4 star rating,"POST COVID ReviewHaven't had sul lung tang since moving to LA, but was so glad I stopped by this place. I called while walking over (5 min walk) at 4pm on a Friday and the food was ready to go upon my arrival. The restaurant owners were so sweet and had blocked off much of the restaurant to allow for social distancing and had some chairs available if waiting for an order.Ordered 2 sul lung tangs, 1 with mixed meat, and 1 with brisket. Mixed meat included brisket, flank, intestine, tripe, spleen. Both soups were packaged with meat and glass noodles in the soup, a side of rice, green onions, salt, and a spicy paste. In addition, they provided 2 servings of banchan (radish and napa kimchi) and necessary utensils. The food carried well during my longer drive home (30-45 minutes) and we enjoyed a fantastic meal for the evening!"
1/3/2019,5 star rating,"Nothing remind Koreans of homemade food than a good Korea sou, stews, and casseroles.This place is very genuine and unapologetically authentic when it comes to Korean food.

Even at 9 on sunday morning, the restaurant was half full with people coming in for takeout. The soup is delicious and the meat was good with the kimchi. I wanted to get the meat dish but the lady told me it is better to order a sul leung tang and ask for extra meat for $6.50. I also liked that there was no wait when I went."
1/28/2019,5 star rating,"soooooooo gooooooodIt was a cloudy chilly day and sul lung tang was a great choice when we went to LA. We have been to this place couple times before and everytime we came here it was satisfying. Sul lung tang doesn't disappoint when you are craving soup, meat, noodle and rice all together. The inly bad side of today's visit was that valet parking was mandatory due to lunch rush hour."
12/28/2018,4 star rating,"Got the beef brisket sul lung tang ($12.50) and asked for an ungodly amount of green onion on the side because who doesn't like green onion. You season your soup with pepper, salt, and chili until you reach a point and decide it's tasty enough for you. If you're fluent and familiar with seasoning food and know what to add and adjust to get it better then hoorah this place is for you. If you're unsure and want to play it by eye and throw stuff in before deciding it's decent then that works too. Remember, you season it on your own it's meant to be pretty plain so read this disclaimer prior."
5/9/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious and one of a kind! The flavor of the soup is so deep yet isn't heavy. I like how they have salt and pepper on the table for you to adjust it to your liking as well as a huge box of shredded green onions. I personally drank it as it was and didn't need the extra seasoning. They weren't stingy with the meats as well and was able to get a little bit of everything (intestine, flank, etc.) in the mixed soup which was nice.The service was incredibly fast as well and the ladies were very kind and attentive! I'm sure the base of the soup is already made and they just ladle it in.The pickled radish and kimchee were also a great touch! Not too spicy either so even people who can't handle spicy foods could enjoy it.The shop itself is very small so we had several people waiting even though it was a Wednesday night."
3/11/2019,5 star rating,"So as a newbie to the sullung tang family, of course I had to try Han Bat. Truth be told, it's all that and then some. Can't believe I've lived in LA since... '77 and never tried this place.The broth was indeed very very ""clean,"" yet full of that... bone broth flavor, full of umami. Funny thing is, the broth was very close to that at Yangji Gamjatang. The big difference (and a damn important difference) is how much meat Han Bat gives you. Holy meaty goodness, Batman! Not only is it a lot of meat, it's also very very tasty, juice and tender meat. It took me... 2 1/2 meals to finish one order, so you definitely get your money's worth.  I called in an order early morning, so I was able to park at a meter right outside and the food was ready as soon as I walked in."

11/29/2016,5 star rating,"DOV: 11/26/16 | 5:50 PM-6 PMCASH ONLY! This is on par with sul-lung-tang in Korea! Simple. Southing. Delicious. And CHEAP! Pretty hole-in-the-wall, depending how well you know this area. Find the Carl's Jr, and it's right behind it!Parking: there is a parking lot right behind the store front! Or, street it. Menu: hella simple. Meat in soup (shul-lung-tang), or separate (Soo-yook)? Pricing as of 11/26/16: sul-lung-tang is $10.10 + tax (any kind), Soo-yook (boiled beef) is $22.94 + taxMy +1 and I ordered:1. Beef brisket sul-lung-tang //2. Mixed (brisket, flank, intestine, tripe, spleen, tongue) sul-lung tang //+1 Everything comes with a bowl of rice! You can either dump it in your soup (kind of like congee) or you can eat it separately. +1 Broth is so pure! Seriously, they don't add anything. Salt, pepper, chili sauce on the side for you to flavor to your tastebuds. +1 Fresh beef! Tender and delicious.Banchan: Their kimchi is HELLA good! Radish is yummy too. Definitely homemade! I love that the lady brings it to the table and cuts it for you. Pros:+Quick service!+Great pricing. For the health benefits, I would not mind!Cons:-Now I'm on a search for a sul-lung-tang shop in the bay...-When rush hour starts, there isn't really a line. People are just standing everywhere. Tips/Observations:-ATM machine inside! -Bathroom inside too!Overall, do yourself a favor and come here during the winter. It's so delicious and will warm your soul (seriously)."
3/3/2019,4 star rating,"This place specializes in Sul Lung Tang (a Korean beef based soup). We ordered the mixed Sul Lung Tang and it came with complimentary rice, kimchi and pickled radish. They don't explain how to eat the soup, but you're supposed to add salt to the broth to your tasting. Then sprinkle a bit of green onions on top and eat with rice and pickles. The broth itself is plain, so you need to add the salt on the side. I felt that the soup was very rich and flavorful, and the kimchi had the perfect balance of spicy and sour. This dish is one of my favorites growing up. The one downside is that the portions are relatively smaller compared to other places I've been to and it's a bit on the pricier side ($14)."
3/2/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite place in Ktown LA. Seriously their milky Sul Lung Tang will give you LIFE! They're located in an old (ghetto) building and their parking lot is a little too hard to find, but you will get there! Wait might be long on weekends especially on Saturday and Sunday, when people are hungover. But don't let this turn down on you. It will be worth it. Their kimchi is extremely fresh and tasty and you can always ask for more. Don't be shy. Add tons and tons of green onions, salt and some kimchi soup...... BOOM. That's how you enjoy traditional SulLungTang."
1/18/2021,4 star rating,Delicious beef stew. I'm always going back forth between parks and this place. The broth is so tasty. I do like to add in a pinch more salt. The beef is tender and so delicious. With each bite of beef I like to add some rice and kimchee. My mouth waters just thinking about it. You will not waste a single drop of the broth. The broth even tastes good over rice. I like getting an extra serving since there's so much broth. Very satisfying meal.
1/4/2017,3 star rating,"I'm not sure if this place is cash only, but since they have an ATM machine inside, just bring cash here just in case. The soup here is delicious, but I wouldn't say that the price is worth it.  For about $11, you're getting bland soup that you'll have to flavor yourself with salt, chili sauce, pepper, and green onions.  Even though you're also getting kimchi, radish kimchi, and a bowl of rice, I left the place still hungry and wanting more food.  Once we got in, there's a line right at the door so we had to wait before getting seated; there's no sign in sheet or anything.  There were about 4-5 groups ahead of us when we got in and we had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated.  I got the beef brisket Sul Lung Tang (~$11 with tax, not including tip), and inside you get whatever type of meat you choose, ox bone soup, and probably half a cup of noodles.  If it wasn't for the rice I'd still be at the same hunger level as when I came in.  The sul lung tang is super bland, so you'll have to flavor it yourself with what they have on the table for you.  I put in about a quarter spoonful of salt, a couple shakes of pepper, and a spoonful of green onions before I can get the taste out (using the spoons they supply you in the salt/green onion containers).  Once I put the spices in myself, the soup is actually pretty good.  It's really light so I can imagine that it's a good hangover meal.  Both the kimchi and radish kimchi are actually really good as well.  It tastes different than a lot of other kimchi I've had. I don't know if they even make it in house, but it doesn't taste like they have preservatives in it.  Service is super quick, of course because they really only have two things on the menu.  However, once they drop off your food, they ignore you for the entire rest of your stay, except to drop off your check.  I tried to ask for water while they dropped off the check, but they pretty much dropped the check onto our table and quickly walked away without even looking at us, so I couldn't even get her attention to ask for water, which you'll have to ask for yourself.  It's a really simple meal, but because of the price and how much you're getting, in addition to the distance that we had to drive to come here, I don't think that I would want to come here again unless I'm already in the area.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here to be left still hungry upon leaving this place."
11/3/2017,4 star rating,"I came here for lunch with my coworker because he said that it was his favorite spot for sul lung tang & that it was the best. The inside of the restaurant is very basic. We both ordered the salgogi (brisket) which seems to be the most popular item on the menu. Each soup is $11.50 each & I believe there are 4 or 5 different items u can order. They gave us a side of pickles radish & kimchi. The broth is pretty milky & delicious. Overall, I would still prefer sun nong dan over this place, but they have a pretty solid sul lung tang here as well & the service is pretty fast here as well."
12/25/2018,4 star rating,"Hole in the wall restaurant with fantastic ox-tail bone soup that's piping hot. This place has served my soup cravings well and I always come back! Their menu is very simple and the soup comes out very fast after ordering. Soup itself is bland, like other ox-tail bone soups. So you do have to add in salt and bit of green onion to make the soup ""tasty"". I'd imagine that parking would be a pain, so I always uber or lyft here."
2/23/2019,5 star rating,"True comfort food! Perfect to eat on a cold, rainy night. I always get the brisket. But the combination is also a good choice for those you want a variety of meats.Regarding parking, there is a small lot behind the restaurant. However, it's very small. So i suggest bringing quarters just in case you need to find street parking. On a side note, if you are taking your food to-go, I suggest asking for more green onions because they will just give you a tiny container of it otherwise!"
12/24/2019,5 star rating,"Came here for dinner driving to orange at 5:30 pm. Parking was quite a struggle to find. The place is a bit hidden and hard to find. Walking in the the place seems a bit small, however it's very nice. Noise was quiet to average. The menu was a bit difficult to read, but the staff was really nice and helped us out. Food was very quick to serve along with the complimentary kimchi, radish, and rice. The rice was really fluffy. However, the kimchi was lacking in flavor. It seemed a bit under fermented. That being said, it wasn't a big deal for me. On the other hand, the noodles were simply amazing. You get to salt your own noodles and add spice if you choose, allowing yourself to choose the amount of saltiness and spiciness you want. I got the ox bone soup intestine, tripe, spleen (sul lung Tang naejang). Everything from the intestine/spleen to the tripe and the broth and noodles were delicious. The tripe had a great smooth fatty texture and the broth was flavorful but not overwhelming. Overall the food here was amazing and would come back."
10/26/2019,5 star rating,"No-nonsense, hearty food that you could eat any meal of the day.This was my first time trying Sul Lung Tang so I cannot give any comparisons or ranking to other restaurants but needless to say, I left a happy customer. The way the restaurant works is very simple but efficient. Wait in line at the back of the restaurant, get called by a waitress to join a vacant table, order, and 2-3 minutes later out comes a bowl of rich, savory broth, a bowl of rice, a gaudy bucket of green onions, and a couple of platters of kimchi. There are no waitlists, reservations, or waiting areas which I appreciated because it allowed me to focus on the food. The wait staff is attentive yet not overzealous to the point where you feel uncomfortable or out of place. The restaurant is...homey.I ordered the Sul Lung Tang with the tongue while my girlfriend opted for the brisket. Overall, the consensus was that the tongue was a more tender cut which we preferred while the brisket, although still tender, had more of a bite and chew to it. The soup is downright delicious. You add your own salt and pepper in it which is something I can appreciate and the flavor of the ox bones just pops out at you. Delicious with rice and kimchi. Also, remember how I was saying they give you a gaudy bucket of green onions? WRONG! It is not gaudy. It is perfect! Load that bowl up with green onions and you will leave happy."
9/28/2020,5 star rating,"This is an amazing spot for sullung tang. The broth is very clean and the glass noodles are just the right amount. I only discovered this place post pandemic, so I've only gotten take out, but they package everything carefully (except there is quite a bit of styofoam usage that bothers me), and you get a lot of kimchi with your order. I keep coming back, because it is so good!"
12/23/2016,4 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is THE place to get your sullungtang fix in K-Town!  Although I was initially skeptical of their signature dish after being introduced to the restaurant several years ago, I've come to count Han Bat as one of my go-to spots in K-Town.Sullungtang is a soup made from boiling beef bones for a long period of time.  The result is a milky white broth that is light, nourishing, and heart-warming.  Be forewarned that it may seem bland at first, so definitely take the time to season your soup with green onions, salt, and any other accoutrements.    Having made sullungtang at home, I recognize the tremendous labor involved in making a small bowl of soup, so I have the utmost respect and appreciation for the quality of Han Bat's food.  Even as the prices at Han Bat have increased over the past few years, it's still not overly expensive.  At $10.10, you can get your choice of with various proteins (all cuts of beef).  With tax, the total comes to an even $11.The restaurant is small and unadorned.  You may have to wait during peak hours, but this isn't a lengthy meal:  turnover is quick and service is efficient.  Parking is a nightmare.  To-go is definitely a viable option - perfect for those sick days when you need a kind-hearted friend to bring you something easy on the stomach."
10/22/2019,5 star rating,"Talk about a literal hole in the wall. It was a cold day--one of maybe 3 in the whole year--and we happened to be at Daiso in K-Town. What better than to grab some hot beef soup down the street?Like I said, it's a hole-in-the-wall, so we completely missed it the first time around. Don't expect to find parking easily. If you don't see street parking, don't try to park in one of the lots. K-Town is known for having guards and valets at every surface lot. If you're not dining in that plaza, forget about it.The restaurant is small and very simple. Don't expect a wide variety of Korean foods like some of the bigger chain restaurants. This place has ""Sul Lan Tang"" in its name, so that's what you get. There are maybe 2 options for the broth. I chose the simple beef broth for $13.50. You get some side dishes and then the holy grail of soups: the Sul Lan Tang in all its glory. Just looking at the portions, I thought we wouldn't be full off of it, but I was wrong. Deep in the sea of broth are glass noodles and a decent amount of meat. You also get a good portion of rice. So basic yet soooo delicious! They don't add salt to the soup--you can add as much or little to your liking. I usually like to dump in a few of the fermented radish as well to give it a little kick. If you're in the area, come support this small business and enjoy some awesome Korean soup."
10/21/2019,5 star rating,"The best sullungtang in SoCal, maybe in the world!!!They also have very good side dishes that compliments the soup very well: kimchi and kimchi radish.If you like sullungtang, this place is a must! Actually, even if you don't like sullungtang, you should really give this place a shot. This place could change your mind.CASH ONLY"
7/16/2019,5 star rating,"It's been so long since I've had authentic tasting seollongtang. This place basically took me back to my time in Seoul. The kimchi is deliciously amazing and fresh: if you're a fan of fresher kimchi (less sour in taste) then this is the place to go! If you prefer the sour type, the radish is relatively more fermented compared to the cabbage so it was an amazing combination. My suggestion on how to eat it: season the broth with salt (you should taste it beforehand if you've never had this dish before so you can gauge how much salt you'd like), pour in multiple scoops of green onions. Mix that a bit before dumping your entire bowl of rice into the stone pot. If you like it a bit more spicy, I recommend pouring the kimchi juice into the soup. My favorite way of eating the meat is wrapping it around the kimchi :') By far, one of the best meals I've had in LA"
2/8/2019,5 star rating,"Being able to find easy parking in K-town already gives this place 20 stars- it's in the back.This is the comfort food place. The. While they do offer soo-yook as an option on the menu, most, if not all, comes for the Sul-lung-tang, the beef soup. For your first time, get mixed, and depending on which meat in the soup you particularly liked (ask the waiting staff as to what the specific meats in the soup are, and they will happily explain to you), get the ones with them next time. Oh, by the way, they also bring the soup in a minute. So, you don't have to wait 15 minutes eating Kimchi waiting for your food to come out- that's another 20 stars for an impatient hungry me."
3/13/2019,5 star rating,"First step inside smells funky, but keep in mind they are cooking the best oxtail bone broth for hours on end, and believe me, y'all: it's worth it. Customer service is always quick + friendly. This spot has been added to my rotations of favorite holes-in-the-wall. Kimchi is always fire as is sul lang tang. The ladies here are sweet and know I love their kimchi and ask me if I want more (even if I'm too shy to ask for more). I've tried sul lang tang at other k-town spots, and they're just not as yummy and don't hit the spot like over here. So simple and pure yet soo fulfilling. Also, I don't usually drink soda, but why does 7up in a can taste so good here?When I'm sick or need something comforting, this food will make me feel better. If my mom was Korean, this is what I imagine she would cook for me to heal me haha! Although this spot is busy, I am always lucky and able to find a parking spot and have never waited for a table..."

2/4/2020,3 star rating,"I was surprised by what we found here after the reviews on Worth It on YouTube. Was expecting something amazing. The kimchi was amazing. But the soup was just okay. Seemed to lack flavor no matter what we added. Also they got my choice of meat wrong and I really dislike tripe, so enjoying the meal to the full was out."
9/19/2017,4 star rating,"There's nothing better than a nice hot bowl of soup.  I am one of those people that can have soup day in and out and will never get tired of them.  You know Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is good when you see the number of awesome reviews on Yelp, and only realizing that they only have a few things on their menu.Han Bat specialize in Shul Lung Tang (Ox Bone Soup), and this is literally the only thing on their menu.  So... If you do not eat beef, this is not a place for you to come.  The prices of their soup went up over the years.  From $8.74 (2012) to now $10.58 (2017), some might think it is a little too expensive, but this is the average anywhere in Ktown.  Five types of Sullungtang available:  - Seokum (Mixed)- Salgogi (Beef Brisket)- Yangji (Flank)- Naejang (Intestine, Tripe, Spleen)- Wusoel (Tongue)Basically, the soup base is the same, the only differences between the five types of soup is the meat.  Haven't tried all of them yet, but my favorite is definitely the Beef Tongue.  And for those of you that are visiting Korean restaurant for the first time, don't complain about the soup being bland, you add salt according to your savory preference.There is free parking, but parking can be a pain at this location.  Try coming before or after the crowd."
9/18/2017,5 star rating,"AMAZING Sullangtang!!! Hands-down the best I've ever had!!! The broth is so rich and creamy~ you can taste the hours of boiling that makes this soup so much better than the rest... It's $12 a bowl (pricey for this type of soup) but well worth it IF you like this particular soup.But PLEASE note: if you aren't Korean & grown up eating this/have never had this soup before, I'm not sure if you'll appreciate how good this soup is compared to 99% of other versions out there...I've noticed most of the so-so reviews calling the soup 'bland' & not understanding all the hype surrounding this place are from people who clearly aren't Korean/were probably expecting something with bold flavors... This soup is bland with subtle flavors... When you get your bowl, you add in the green onions, salt (in the lidded brown jars next to the pepper), pepper, & hot pepper paste. Add & mix to your taste before writing it off as flavorless!This is a very homey, comfort-food type soup that would be great for a hangover or served on a chilly night. Fast service & their own parking lot in the back!"
1/22/2019,4 star rating,"This place hit the spot as my stomach has been feeling a little sensitive these days. I was very surprised how full I was.  I was starving and when I saw the little bowl of soup (compared to huge pho bowls i'm used to), I was nervous,  but I barely finished it!  I guess the sticky rice made it filling.  Normally,  Chinese porridge leaves me feeling hungry soon after,  but bc it's sticky rice,  or more glutinous,  it kept me full till dinner, and we ate at 1045 am. Our server was nice though she was super busy, as  there was a line out the door. She asked us if we wanted refills of ban chan, to which we said yes! It was the best kim chi I ever had."
8/16/2018,5 star rating,"One word: LEGIT!! Tucked a few blocks away from some of the more high spotlight K-cuisine in Wilshire, this place is everything to someone who has a craving for sullongtang. Came with a friend after a long two weeks of work pains to get our souls revived. No BS or fluff here - pick your meats if you want soup, or if you don't want soup. Add salt/onion to your pleasing. Enjoy crunchy, delicious kimchi cut right on your table. To be honest, I've never had a bad experience at a sullongtang place (maybe because those don't last very long), and this is no exception. The flavors in their soup and kimchi are AMAZING."
1/20/2020,4 star rating,"This place hits the spot whenever I just want a comforting hot bowl of noodles. You can taste the oxtail bone very well in the broth that I personally like to season with a generous amount of salt, pepper, and green onion. It does not detract from the taste of the oxtail at all. I've been here quite a few times and will continue to come here!"
2/22/2020,5 star rating,"4 stars, alone, for having their own private parking lot in the back. 1 more star for the amazing, no-frills bowl of sul lung tang.

9/8/2018,5 star rating,"I never knew shul lung tang could ever taste this good.I ordered the mixed meats with brisket, liver, and all the intestinal varieties. Everything was so tender and flavorful, and the guts were cleaned extremely well. And the broth, twas beyond my expectations. I've had this soup many times in Chicago, but this is some next level ****!The soup comes with the napa and radish kimchi, which of course stood out clearly. You know a Korean restaurant is good just by tasting the kimchi!Honestly, if you're skeptical about trying this place, just bring a Korean friend who never had Han Bat and they will swear this place is legit. A must visit for comfort k-food in k-town!"

2/12/2020,4 star rating,"4.5/5 stars for me! 4 for practicality sakes, 5 for childhood nostalgiaDO NOT BE DETERRED BY THE SLIGHTLY STANK SMELL WHEN YOU ENTER--that's the aroma of lots and lots of bones boiling to later transform into a rich broth. Service is WICKED FAST. From the moment you sit down, your order is placed within three minutes, and your piping hot bubbly Sul Lung Tang () arrived within five minutes. This place always hits the spot, and has the best Sul Lung Tang () in all of Ktown. Totally beats out some places in Korea too! The only thing--since the Americans () have found the secret of bone broth--the place is packed with more non Koreans than Koreans, and as such the price is rising and rising. Every time I go the price is higher and higher :("

1/22/2020,5 star rating,"We arrived for lunch at 12 PM and got the second to last open table. Lots of street parking on adjacent streets. When you sIt down, the menu is framed on the wall and yoU can grab your own utensils in the boxes at the end of each table. The waitress came by shortly after we got comfortable to take our orders and quickly brought out some spicy fermented Side dishes for us to munch on while we waited for our main dishes. Our soup dishes came out fairly quickly and were hearty, warmed up my soul with a lightweight broth. Very clean tasting. You can add your own sliced green onions, salt and pepper. The best part is when you add the kimchi to your soup bowl and get two broth experiences in one bowl. I  highly recommend this place. On the plus side, they take credit card."
12/31/2019,4 star rating,"Simple and unpretentious, Han Bat serves only one item--the Sul Lung Tang (Korean Oxtail Soup) with a few meat options. All orders comes with a bowl of rice, cabbage kimchi, and radish kimchi. Each bowl costs $13.50 + tax. A little disappointed they don't serve appetizers such as seafood pancake or gyoza, and their chopsticks are flat instead of round. Flat chopsticks cannot grab the thin slices of beef or noodles as well as round ones."

2/18/2019,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I are obsessed with this place. Such a great comfort food especially on a rainy day! Simple menu! We usually get the beef brisket and mixed. Soup is clean, great oxtail bone flavor. My boyfriend enjoys it without adding anything. I'm on the other hand like to add a tiny bit of salt for flavor. They also give you unlimited rice, scallions, salt, kimchi, and radish. I do put in a lot of scallions. The kimchi here is okay. But I do love their radish. Parking is very small. It can get really crowed on the weekends especially in the morning. Service is nice and quick! Highly recommend this place!"
2/17/2020,5 star rating,"This restaurant is definitely my most favorite Korean restaurant in Los Angeles. I really like how the Sul Lung Tang is different from any other Korean restaurants in LA. For those of you who thinks that Sul Lung Tang is so plain and tasteless, you need to have the right seasoning in order to enjoy the food. You need to put green onion, red sauce, pepper, and salt into the soup. Then, you ask for sesame oil and put some salt on it, dip the beef into the oil and you get a really nice meat - eat it with the hot white rice (the rice is so soft and nice). Some people just order the meat itself, it's really that good. You probably spend about $17-$20 here. It's definitely worth it. There is usually a line when you want to eat here but it's worth the wait."
1/7/2017,5 star rating,"Best place for sul lung tang in LA! I've been here multiple times and it's always delicious. The menu is limited, but I always get the mixed sul lung tang because it never disappoints. The soup may seen a little bland when it first arrives, but as soon as I add in salt the flavors of the broth come together so well. They have a big jar of salt at every table so you can add as much as you want haha The other thing that I like about this place is that they have a big tub of scallions at every table and you can add in as much as you want. I absolutely LOVE scallions so I always add in a ton. The kimchi and radishes that they bring you are also good, and I've never had a bad experience with the service. They're very fast and nice. This is a great place for a quick meal, especially if you're sick or hungover."

This place is like a little hole-in-the-wall mom & pop restaurant - I'm so glad I found it! I got the mixed sul lang tang minus the intestine.

Just add a dash of salt + chopped green onion into your soup & you're good to go!"
12/4/2018,5 star rating,"If you're specializing in one dish, you'd better be good at it - and hanbat seolleongtang does that right. The seolleongtang here blasted me with memories of childhood. There's only so much you can change up seolleongtang, but hanbat functions well on account of its quick and friendly service. The soup will come out in less than 2 minutes and they have however much green onion and salt you'd like to put in. Their kimchi was also the best I've had in a restaurant in a long time. For a $10 meal for an authentic korean dish, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone."
12/6/2020,5 star rating,I've been to this place for many years and it has never disappointed me. Serving size is the perfect amount and the food is great. Other places don't compare to this in its soup flavor. Food feels it's made with care. Getting takeout for this which is just as good in person. Always warm and service is very fast. Noodle texture is just the right hardness and beef is tasty.
1/17/2017,3 star rating,"TRUE STAR RATING: 3.5/5ACCEPTS CARD!--PARKING-- There is parking in the back! Otherwise, you can do street parking. --ATMOSPHERE-- It's a Korean restaurant that is much like any other Asian restaurant. It's simple and efficient. The place was very minimal on decorations. Very hole-in-the-wall place.--MENU-- short menu of 2 items and different meat choices (i.e., combo, brisket, flank, tendon, etc). Comes with kimchi cabbage and daikon (free refills yay). It's also served with rice.Shul-Lung Tang ($10.58): I got the brisket and my boyfriend got the combo. It's a healthy beef soup that is supposed to be homey. You can put chili or green onions to your liking. The brisket was so tender and thinly sliced. I thoroughly enjoyed the meat and the mildly present clear noodles. The broth, however, was OK. I found it be a lackluster soup. Kimchi: Bomb. It was tangy and spicy, and I literally scooped some kimchi sauce into my soup. --SERVICE-- Nothing to complain about. They're efficient and refill your water several times. They bring you the check. --OVERALL-- I did enjoy my visit, though. It was a first for me, so maybe it's just not my thing. I do appreciate how homey and healthy it is. It was perfect for my cold. The short menu is genius, tbh.The reviews hyped it up too much for me, so I'm sad I'm giving them 3.5 stars ):"

Sullungtang is a perfect dish for when you're sick or hungover, it literally just makes your life so much better. We ordered the mixed soup with only brisket and tongue. There are some other options like flank and intestine that comes with it but we decided to leave those out. The soup comes without any salt or chili, so you can adjust it to your liking. Start with a little and add as you go! I would say you don't need anymore than half a spoon of salt. They give you a giant tub of green onions so you can eat as much of that as you want. Everything about this sullangtang experience is seriously perfect. Not to mention the service is QUICK!!! We ordered our food and right after we were given radish and kimchi. Within 2 minutes, all of our food came out! Amazing. They also had no problem with us splitting the bill with 3 debit cards. The only thing is this place can get packed and parking may be a little hard to find. There is $2 valet behind the restaurant though. Definitely worth it. If you're a fan of korean food, this place is a MUST! I will be coming back!!!"
6/27/2016,5 star rating,"I LOVE sullungtang. It's pretty much comfort food. First thing's first. I always like to explain what sullungtang is. It's pretty much a soup made from oxtail bones and it's boiled/simmered overnight. And that is how the soup gets a milky white coloring to it. On top of that, the soup is not meant to be seasoned by the kitchen. It is meant to be seasoned by you. Which is why they give you a tub of green onions and there is salt on the table for you. If that's something you can't handle, then I would suggest getting some galbitang or gomjatang or even soondubu. Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is my FAVORITE place for sullungtang so far. I mean, other than Han Bat, I really really like Kunjip in San Jose but I think Han Bat wins just on their sullungtang alone. Their sullungtang has a special aroma to it ... it almost seems like they put a chicken in there with the oxtail bones because it has a DELICIOUS aroma. Once you add in the green onions and your desired amount of salt, it tastes AMAZING! It goes GREAT with rice! You can pour your rice in or keep it separate. I tend to like to keep mine separate. If I lived in the area, I think I'd be willing to have this every single day!! They have different types of meats with the sullungtang so you can choose which one you prefer. I typically just go with the brisket. They only provide two different side dishes -- kimchi and kkakdugi (kimchi radish), which is typical of a restaurant that specializes in sullungtang. However, I don't like the taste of their kimchi or kkakdugi. Kunjip in San Jose definitely wins over the side dish category. Kunjip has amazing kimchi. Overall, Han Bat is great. Give it a try. It's simple, delicious, and gives that comforting feeling. I can't wait to go back!"
6/30/2018,5 star rating,"This place blew my mind.  I chose this spot based on some Yelp intel.  A friend and I arrived just before the lunch rush around 1130ish.  I've had Korean food all over the country and plenty in NYC/NJ.  I have never eaten sul lung tang however.  I ordered the mixed meat choice which included some organs along with flank, brisket, etc.  The flavor of the broth was amazing.  Simple, subtle, but a richness to the milky/cloudy texture.  I added a bunch of the green onions they give you and only a little of the salt and pepper.  Actually, I added a pretty generous serving of what seemed to be housemade  gochujang.  The broth was pretty fantastic on its own but since the condiments were there and I saw other Koreans adding some; I did the same.  The daikon was the best I've ever had (also the biggest and crunchiest sized pieces I've ever had) and the kimchi was up there.  So, you get soup, daikon, kimchi, and that's it basically.  Excellent value at around $12.  I hope to get back there sooner than later!!"
8/21/2018,5 star rating,"This is the one sul lung tang restaurant that will forever have my heart. If I lived in k-town I would literally go here every week. You know their soup is good when it's really the only thing on the menu. I recommend the beef brisket as a ""normal"" meat, but you can get adventurous and try the mixed meat option!Although the broth might seem plain at first, add salt, pepper, chili paste, green onions, and maybe even some kimchi! My friend added some of the extra sauce from the radish side dish. I personally like making my broth super red!You will be in and out super fast even though it's a bit small. Park in the back parking lot or on the street outside. On weekends, come before 11 am and there won't be any wait. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"
7/12/2018,5 star rating,"The kimchi and fermented radish is sooooo fresh.  My friends from NorCal are repeated customers and they introduced me to this place.  There's street parking if you're willing to drive down a block or two, and it's a relatively safe and populated area.The food itself was amazing.  I used about 4 teaspoons of salt, 3 teaspoons of the chili paste, and 3 spoonfuls of green onion.  The menu isn't very extensive but it's efficient.  This is such good comfort and hangover food.  It's not too heavy as well - I'll definitely be back.  Service was great, and there wasn't a wait on Sunday afternoon, much to my surprise."
11/13/2016,4 star rating,"Specialty: Sul Lung Tang (ox bones soup)This is the most popular sul lung tang restaurant in Koreatown and it appeared in LA Weekly's article ""Jonathan Gold's 60 Korean Dishes Every Angeleno Should Know"" (laweekly.com/restaurants…).Parking: There's a small & free private parking lot (enter through the back alley on 5th street), but DO NOT ENTER THE LOT VIA WESTERN AVE OR THE SECURITY GUARD WILL TELL YOU TO TURN AROUND!!!Menu: You only have two options - sul lung tang (ox bones soup) or suyuk (boiled beef). Each order of sul lung tang comes with a bowl of rice and two side dishes (cabbage kimchi and kkakdugi [cubed radish kimchi])***Sul Lung Tang (seokum or mixed, $10.10): The bowl had few pieces of beef brisket, flank, intestine, tripe, spleen, and tongue. Without adding any salt, the broth tasted very bland (I added about a quarter teaspoon of salt). The broth tasted very refreshing and not very greasy (in fact I drank the entire bowl of soup). Good meat quality, but not everyone will like the texture for certain types of meat. You also need to add your own green onion.***Solid Korean comfort food with just the right portion to fill your tummy up.P.S. - I know there's a ""cash only"" sign, but I believe they still accept credit cards."
11/17/2018,5 star rating,"This is the place that made me fall in love with sul lung tang! Its plain broth packs so much flavor and you can add green onions from jars on the table. They also give you rice and kimchi to eat with the soup. The meats are super tender and I saw many ordering brisket, which I ended up doing and was not disappointed. Parking in the back!"
1/9/2020,5 star rating,"Anyone else discover this place from Buzzfeed's Worth It series? My family and I visited on a Saturday around 2pm and it was packed! We waited about 20 minutes until we got seated. We all ordered the beef brisket and it was delicious! We liked how there was green onion, salt, and pepper on the table so you could season it yourself. There were also complimentary kimchi and radish kimchi side dishes as with most Korean restaurants, and one bowl of rice per order is included. Did I mention how quickly the food came out? We waited longer to be seated than to receive the food. It's also quite filling so come hungry or consider sharing with a friend!"
8/28/2018,5 star rating,"As a Korean who has eaten countless bowls of Sul lung tang over the years, I must say this bowl here is one of the BEST, if not the BEST I've ever had. My mom makes this every now and then and it takes about 72 hours. It's better than most, but honestly Han Bat is a little better!!! The boyfie and I were super hungover and came here early in the morning and it was a packed house! We both ordered the brisket Sul lung tang and both ate every last drop. Don't forget to put loads of green onion and chili sauce in it :). Also, the kimchee here is SOOOOO good here... especially the radish one. 10/10 would recommend. I can't see how anyone would rate this place anything less than 5 stars."
5/20/2018,5 star rating,"No complaints about this place! If you're craving a hardy, flavorful, and warm bowl of soup, this restaurant offers just that. We came on a Saturday night at around 7pm, and there wasn't a wait! However, more people started trickling in at around 7:30pm, so expect waits. They have a parking lot in the back, making it really easy to access. The restaurant is somewhat a hole in the wall, and they only serve Korean bone broth soup. Their menu is very simple, and you can get bone broth soup with brisket, beef tongue, or intestines (or a combination of all meats if you're adventurous). I went for the brisket bone broth and it came instantly to the table. The soup comes unsalted or seasoned, and they put a bucket of chopped green onions in front of you to add to the soup; they also provide kimchi and rice. The soup is a milky white color and you can definitely taste the quality of it! Super simple, yet so delicious. This is a great meal if you're under the weather or in need of some soup! I'd highly recommend a visit!"
10/27/2019,5 star rating,I know this have been said many times but I just have to say it again... best sullungtang in town... I've been here countless times over the past few years and was never disappointed. The menu is very simple and I always get the mixed sullungtang. At any given time of the day the restaurant seems to be always pretty busy because of the food quality. Will keep frequent here for more healthy and yummy sullungtang for sure!
1/5/2019,5 star rating,Super yummy comfort food on such a cold day! This restaurant totally reminded me on my Seoul days! Super simple and delicious. I highly recommend the Beef Brisket soup. It's blend but super rich but don't worry as you are given salt and other condiments on the table to create a flavor that works for you! Really delicious and nutritious meal :) Will definitely come back again! There $1/$2 valet behind the restaurant and it usually gets crowded at 1130 (lines and all) so plan ahead!
5/15/2019,5 star rating,Pretty darn delicious cause this is all they do and this is not something that can be made at home.   Hole in the wall but soooo good.  Get take out or eat there.   Can't wait to come back for the tasty beef brisket soup.   My fav.
10/9/2019,4 star rating,"This was my go-to place when I was feeling sick and I recently came back to check it out when I was pretty sick.The soup was amazing as always but they have raised the price by quite a bit since the last time I came (maybe 4 years ago) from under $10 to about $14. Highly recommended - they do one thing at Han Bat Sul Lung Tang, and they do it well."
2/12/2020,5 star rating,"One of my favorite hole in the wall places to get ox knee soup with all the trimmings. Keep in mind it's a cash only operation, so come prepared. Soup starts at $12.2-12-2020: I must love it, because I keep coming back, even after a price increase. It has turned into comfort food for me, and that's not a bad thing at all."

I feel like I'm being wrapped in a blanket when I drink it.This will be my go-to place when I get sick or if it's a chilly day!"
12/1/2018,4 star rating,"I kept hearing good things about this place, and finally my friend took me! This is really a no frills mom and pop type of establishment. You can expect a more seedy looking entrance from the parking, but don't be steered away. They only serve two items: (1) sul lung tang - ox bone soup and (2) suyuk - meat/innards. Everyone orders a bowl of sul lung tang and you can't go wrong. The ox come soup comes with beef brisket or innards or a mix of   both if you prefer. There is a bowl of scallion on the table for you to put into your soup and salt for seasoning to your liking. Mix in the scallion and salt and enjoy! You are also given a bowl of white rice and kimchi to go with your meal. This is a simple and satisfying meal to warm you up! It is also only about $10 for a bowl of soup, so it's a steal!"
10/29/2018,5 star rating,"This might be my favorite restaurant in LA! It has the best oxtail soup, it is soooooo good!! If you love oxtail soup you really won't be disappointed. The price is great and the food is fantastic! It can occasionally be super crowded, but the food comes out really quickly so the wait normally isn't too bad! The menu is very simple and you can pick what meats you want in your soup!"
1/12/2020,5 star rating,"Similar to Pavlov's dogs, whenever I feel an itchy throat coming on or feel the urge to buy a heated blanket, I come to this restaurant. The food is soul warming. Service is always fast and responsive. Language barriers tend to not be an issue when there are only a few menu items. I tend to come early afternoon or early morning and have never waited or paid for parking as a result. One quick note, the price did just increase to $14.50 (1/12/2020). I think this literally just happened before I walked in this morning at 7:30. Still easily worth it."
5/4/2018,5 star rating,Omg this was sooo amazing. Definitely a must stop whenever I go to LA again. Their broth has so much flavor and the perfect amount of creaminess to it! I love that they offer 2 types of kimchi to eat with the soup. Some places only offer radish kimchi. Their brisket was actually soft also and not chewy. Definitely recommend!
6/20/2018,5 star rating,"When you see Chinese people as majority crowd in a Korean restaurant, YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.  (Because Chinese people love good soup).  This place is so simple yet so awesome.  Only TWO things on the menu, their SOUP or the MEAT platter which comes boiled from the said soup.Get the MIX, you get a whole tripe of everything from the cow's inside, which gives it great flavor.  The broth is creamy in taste, which makes me believe they literally rendered the bone to a freaking flour like paste, which is sooooooo hearty and good.Kimchi comes in two kinds, the napa variety and the all time favorite (and NECESSITY for enjoying sul lung tang), radish cubes.  I loved it so much I ordered three plates of it.  My wife, baby and myself finished 3 bowls together.  I will come back here again to get my Shul Lung Tang fix anyday when it's cold.  Price is a bit high for the soup but IT'S SO WORTH IT!!!"
5/10/2016,3 star rating,"Not too impressed with the bland ox bone soup for $10.10 + tax. Our orders came out almost instantly after we ordered. It came with our choice of meat and a few pieces of glass noodles and was piping hot. A tub of chopped green onion was also bought along with the soup to our table. Salt, pepper, and red chili paste are provided and much needed to add flavor. The meal was clean and simple, but it's probably not something I'd come back for. Cash only. Lot or street parking available."
3/24/2018,5 star rating,"My most recent encounter with Han Bat was to pick up my take out order. I called my order in 10 minutes before arrival and everything was set to go when I entered the restaurant. One of the waitresses swiped my card (yes they take credit card now!) and I was literally out of there within a minute! They packed me a bucket worth of kimchi and radish kimchi, and when I asked for more scallions, they replaced the small container with a huge tub without batting an eye. I truly appreciate the efficiency and generosity with the side dishes. Beef brisket sullungtang is my go-to order. The soup tasted just as great eating it at home - your to-go package will include rice, salt, pepper, and chili paste - everything you would need to season the broth precisely to your taste. I like to dunk some of the kimchi in my soup too, for extra flavor. Happy to say that the food quality has stayed highly consistent over the years.There is a parking lot behind the restaurant that fills up pretty quickly. For take out, I hit my emergency lights and went in and out under a minute (not exactly legal so I wouldn't encourage doing this)."
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"Authentic, simple, and KIMCHI.My first visit here got me lost. This place is a dinky little thing located next to a salon, with a rear parking lot that you must drive through a narrow entrance to reach. One can easily miss it as the sign is written in Korean, with English in fine print below. But once you make it inside, it is surprisingly more spacious than it looks from the exterior. The place is always busy but I never had to wait for an open table. The food and service is QUICK - you go in, enjoy your bowl of sulungtang, and come right out. Sulungtang is a Korean comfort food that I occasionally crave, and Hanbat consistently hits the spot right in the bullseye! They provide tubs of diced green onions that I love to sprinkle all over my broth. I throw in a pinch of salt and pepper and chili paste to season to my liking, and also add in some of that kimchi juice to spice up my bowl. I pour my white rice to the whole concoction and finally indulge.While the sulungtang itself is so delicious, their kimchi is what keeps me coming back. They got the original cabbage kimchi and the radishes (ggakddugi) that are both fermented to perfection! I can eat plates of these, and the pungent garlic breath that ensues is worth it.Please do not forget to bring CASH as this is the only form of payment they will accept!"
3/23/2016,4 star rating,"So I finally got a taste of the famous sul lung tang here. If you are a fan of bland, comforting soups, you will like this stuff. It really is a hole-in-the-wall  and street parking is nonexistent almost, but do not fear, they do have a mini parking lot behind them. ;)The menu is super simple...SULLUNGTANG with all the toppings (intestines, spleen, tripe, brisket, etc.) or single topping only and the bowls are individual servings. I chose BRISKET ONLY. It comes with a side of fluffy white rice, spicy radish & kimchee for your banchans and green onions to sprinkle and thin noodles inside the broth. You can tell the soup is filled with healthy bone juice...its whitish and lightly flavorful without the added ""saltiness"". I loved it. My friend hated it. Will come back again!"
9/28/2019,4 star rating,Tried it for the first time. It's a good breakfast place. It was my first try at Korean breakfast. It has the hole in the wall family owned feeling that I generally like.
2/16/2020,5 star rating,"Perfect spot for any meal and serves as a comfort for all. The Sul Lung Tang, for which this spot is known for, is warm and served with rice and the best kimchi in La besides my grandmas. Recommend putting the dadaegi( red paste on table) and a ton of scallions"

4/28/2018,5 star rating,"I fell in love with sul lang tang here. When I think of going to LA, I think about how to incorporate this as one of my meals. I should really branch out to other places in LA for this soup, but it's SO HARD to risk it & not come here. I will probably have to try to carve out two meals for this sul lang tang test, but until then, my fond memories of amazing, comforting Korean soup will be from Han Bat.Really wish the Bay Area offered sul lang tang on this level.Cash only, & there's a limited parking lot in the back!"
4/15/2021,5 star rating,"FYI - they are open EVERY DAY, so disregard their ""Thursday - Closed"" status on Yelp's hours. We love their Beef Brisket Bone Broth Soup and get takeout every other week (sometimes weekly)!"
9/19/2016,4 star rating,"If you're looking for comfort food you've come to the right place. This restaurant is tiny but the demand is huge so get ready to wait. You might get lucky and not have to wait too so there's that prospect.Sul lung tang doesn't get better anywhere else. If you want good sul lung tang, you go here. Order, overload on green onions (or not), and enjoy. Side dishes aren't very diverse but I assure you that will be the least of your worries when you have your first taste of the soup. It's almost as if your soul itself is rejuvenated. It's a little confusing but they do accept credit card even if there's no indication that they do so. I know this because they wouldn't let me withdraw money from the atm in their restaurant which was very kind of them because withdrawal fees are no fun. Anyway, come in, eat, pay, be on your merry way."
4/13/2020,5 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is hands down my favorite place to eat sul lung tang. Their Beef Brisket Sul Lung Tang is my go-to dish on a cold/rainy day or if I'm sick with the flu. It always hits the spot and their kimchi and radish kimchi goes SO well with the meal. I love how I can just order 10 minutes before I go to the restaurant when ordering to-go and the food will be ready by then. Their price has gone quite up now (currently $14.50 including tax) compared to how much it was back in the days, but it's still worth it! They have a private parking lot in the back and plenty of seating as well (although you can only do to-gos at the moment until this covid-19 lockdown is over)."
1/9/2020,5 star rating,A small place for some good hearty traditional Korean cuisine. The straightforward menu means business. I felt so satisfied after the bone soup and rice.

No matter where you go I doubt youll find a better sullungtang than hanbat. They usually have a line early mornings on weekends and at nights. Service is usually okay but keep in mind theyre so busy. When its not as busy theyre super nice ladies. Anyways this place is literally the best on rainy days, cold days, sad days when you need comfort food, or for hang overs LOL. Make sure you eat their kkakdooki!! (Radish kimchi) its super yummy."
9/25/2019,4 star rating,"I love sul lung tang and I was excited to try Han Bat since there were so many raving reviews. We came for an early lunch on a weekday and most of the tables were available. The menu is quite small (only sul lung tang or bossom) but you can choose which cuts of meat you want. I ordered the sul lung tang with beef brisket while hubby ordered the mixed meat sul lung tang (brisket, beef tongue, intestines, tripe).  After we ordered our food literally came out 5 minutes later. The soup was both flavorful and rich. I enjoyed it so much that I drank all of it down to the very last drop."

3/14/2018,5 star rating,"I tried few Shul Lung Tang Places in LA, and I think Han Bat offers best Shul Lung Tang in LA.If you never had Shul Lung Tang, It's close to Pho.  ( Beef-Based Broth, Milky Color ) The only difference is you eat with rice instead of Noodles.1. The parking lot is in the back.2. Add Salt and Green Onion and Pepper to your taste.3. The only option you have is which beef cut you like to include in the soups I tend to opt in for Brisket, and Skirt Meet."
11/12/2019,5 star rating,"If you live in ktown or eat often in ktown there's no way you haven't heard of HanBat Sullungtang. A classic restaurant of the city and one of the best at that.I have had sullungtang at many other restaurants but HanBat is as good as it gets. The flavor is so much more richer and deeper than any other places I've ever been. if you are looking for a diverse menu, you aren't going to find that here. HanBat only makes sullungtang, but are the masters in that specific Korean dish.The parking is slightly small at the back of the restaurant so if there is no spots there you'll have to find street parking.The line can also be long sometimes but you'll see that it moves quickly and you'll be seated before long. The price has also crept higher over the past couple times I've been as well.Overall HanBat is a must try if you are in koreatown and in the mood for good Korean comfort food."
7/1/2018,4 star rating,"This place is always a goto for me when I come to LA because I always crave a good bowl of oxtail bone broth when I arrive. I have been to this resturant every time I come to LA and never fail to not come. The only reason I am giving this place a 4 stars is because for some reason every time I come, the prices keep going up. This time I came it was 13 dollars for a bowl which was sad because the first time I came it was 7. Now I am not sure if it is worth 13 dollars but maybe once in a while is okay.I got the beef brisket ome because I usually don't like intestines that much and last time I came, my sister got it and the broth tasted so meaty it was not the best taste to me. Last time I came, they provided a good amount of glass noodles but this time I barely got what I felt was 2 to 3 noodles which was upsetting. They always give you green onions in a big tub so you can add as much as your heart desires and usually they would give kimchi and radish kimchi in big jugs but this time they gave it in small bowls and you had to ask more if you wanted more. I absolutely love the radish kimchi here because it compliments the soup so well. You just gotta add the right amount of salt, enough green onions and if you want, the red broth of the radish kimchi to your bowl and drink it down. Haha. It was so good I ate the entire thing and left maybe like 2 peices of rice at the bottom.I wish the prices weren't so high but it is good so I will probably be back next time I come to LA."
8/30/2019,5 star rating,"No lie, I must come here on average at least once a week. I live about two blocks away so when I'm too lazy or tired of eating my terrible cooking, I'd do my week's worth of cardio and walk to pick up a brisket sullungtang from here. McDonalds used to be my choice of quick eats but ever since they started using real chicken in their nuggets, this place has been my go-to. Order will be ready in less than 10 mins from time of call. If you're doing take out, make sure you throw away the kimchi and radish ASAP though, they'll have your apartment smelling like the whole place has been fermented."
10/17/2019,5 star rating,"The first I heard about this place was from the Worth It videos from BuzzFeed on Youtube. On the other hand, my in-laws who used to live in LA a few decades ago seemed to know of this place - and when Korean adults love a place like this, you know you're in for a treat.This place is one of those places that does 1 thing exceedingly well and makes a killing off of it. The broth is the best I've had, probably even including any I've had in Korea (though admittedly I haven't been to any places that specialize in Sullungtang there). The Kkakdugi (radish kimchi) is perfectly made as well.There's parking in the rear but we missed it and ended up driving by and parking a block away on the street. Oh well."
10/24/2016,4 star rating,"Enter the 1990s, Koreatown. Heck, Korea, even. Wooden tables, one basic menu item, buttons to push. Park in back. Order. Food comes out quickly. Again, its like there is only one menu item with 6 options. And its so damn good.It comes out, green onion on the side, add some msg. Have some kimchi too. For a hole in the wall restaurant, this place fits the mold perfectly, the decor a throwback to an age that welcomes guests and friends to a sort of special feeling. Like you're their cool, cool guide showing your friends around the hidden parts of Koreatown. Come here, you wont regret it. And for an older place, there's one positive surprise: they take credit card."
2/1/2018,5 star rating,"If you're reading this, it's too late. You need to get your ass to this hole in the wall, sul lung tang fountain of dreams already.Ok I might be exaggerating a bit (unless your dreams consist of Korean comfort soup goodness, like mine), but the sul lung tang here is supreme.It's the only thing on the menu, and I get it, sometimes you want some variety in your life, but this is hands down the best sul lung tang I've ever had.They do give you some options on meat selection, but I usually roll with the beef tongue. When you think of Korean beef tongue, you usually think of the thick, chewy kind they serve at kbbq right? I know I do, cause that ish is bomb diggity, but the beef tongue here is completely different cause they simmered it to the point where it's completely soft and melts in your mouth. So damn good.Alright I'll stop raving, but this place is an absolute must for hangovers. I'm basically here every week. Heck, I even started coming when I'm not hungover. It's just that good.Ps. must add salt and green onion, but don't overdo it."
2/13/2018,5 star rating,"I might be repeating what a lot of people have said, but I can't not leave a review for one of my favorite places in all of K-Town. The flavor of their soup has so much depth yet still tastes refreshing, especially on rainy days. It's a very simplistic meal compared to others that I've had, but I definitely crave this more than other places. My go-to order is the salgogi (brisket) sullongtang, but the mixed is also delightful. The service is great, and they are very quick to serve as well as provide refills for more side dishes. I love their radish kimchi and the option to pour as much green onions in to my soup as I want. I pile it in there! *tip: with sullongtang, I always believe that the soup gets saltier as you eat, so don't oversalt the soup in the beginning. Even though they move pretty quickly and give you the check before you finish, I never feel rushed to eat quickly or to leave immediately after I finish eating. On the other hand, even when there is a long line, it goes pretty fast. I've never had to wait more than 25 minutes during the prime dinner hours. Parking is kind of hidden, but it's in the back of the restaurant. I sometimes opt for parking at the supermarket lot across the street and just walking over if the lot is full. The only downside is that I wish it was opened 24/7 so I can go when I'm wanting soup at midnight :("
5/7/2019,5 star rating,"Simple menu! Korean comfort food!! Small hole in the wall restaurant featuring their ox bone soup. Step 1: pick your meat, Step 2: pour salt based on your taste, Step 3: place your green onions to your liking, Step 4: enjoy your hearty meal. Meal comes with some side salads and rice which will definitely make you full. I selected the beef brisket and it was very tender. Who would've thought soup would make me full? I'm definitely coming back on my visits to LA."
8/25/2019,5 star rating,Buzzfeed over killed this place.They should have never came to this sacred place as this was one of the best sul lung tang in townI am a huge advocate of sul lung tang as it has been one of my favorite meal of all time.One of the best memories I have with this soup is when I get sick I know that sul lung tang will help me heal quicker according to my mother.I really enjoy the beef tongue soup and every time I go one of the ajumas always ask if I want more as a joke because I always finish bottom up.Coming here after a cold winter day even though California never gets too cold makes me feel warm inside.Come here with an empty stomach and big appetite
10/15/2020,5 star rating,"Korean town staple. This is a must for comforting soup. The broth is so rich in beef flavor while it being season lightly(you get a side sea salt to adjust to your tasting) the meat is fall apart tender, best hangover meal I reckon."
4/30/2020,5 star rating,This place has great pork bone soup. Perfect for after a night of drinking. They give you a bunch of green onion on the side. The location is great for a easy and quick pick up
3/21/2018,5 star rating,"Before I walked into Han Bat Shul Lung Tang, I've never had the soup before. Now, I can only imagine how different my life would be if I had known about Shul Lung Tang all along. The menu is simple: long simmered oxtail bone soup served with your choice of cow meat - you can choose mixed, flank steak, brisket, tongue or the intestines and tripe. What you get seems unbelievably bland at first,  but wait for it.  After a couple of bites, everything becomes blissfully delicious and unbelievably good. I like to get the brisket and tongue which, like all soups, comes with sides of radish and cabbage kimchi and a side of white rice. I scooped out some white rice into the soup, added salt and kimchi paste to the broth along with green onions to taste, then added pieces of the radish and cabbage kimchi to make the complete soup. I can only explain how good it is by saying that I've eaten here 3 times in 3 days and I'm now starting to plan my days around when I can come to eat here."
2/25/2020,2 star rating,Too expensive why it said 13.50 or 14.50 so I am kinda confusing which menu it said 13.50 dollar or 14.50? I guess people said uhhh what which price that beef soup 13.50 dollar or 14.50? Sheesh I can't believe the owner seem change price up or price down? I guess maybe will be there not sure we'll :/

1/19/2018,5 star rating,"Pretty simple place! Parking around the area or in the lot, but it's a small place that doesn't have an apparent sign until you're at the door. You're asked to sit down at any open spot, and then there's a menu placed at the side. Whenever you're ready you flag down someone that works there and place your order. While you're waiting you can get your chopsticks and spoon ready in the box next to you and then they'll offer you water and other condiments for your food. Got the brisket meat shul lung tang, came in a standard sized bowl (4 or 5 inches in diameter) filled with this yummy ox bone based broth, thinly sliced brisket meat, and glass noodles. It's your job to enhance the flavors by adding Korean chili paste, salt, pepper, and green onions. *tip* be sure to taste as you go, don't eyeball what you think will taste good because you can go overboard with the seasonings. Also comes with a side of rice and banchan like kimchi and pickled radishes. Super yummy as you eat the broth!"
10/6/2018,4 star rating,"*cash only*Perfect spot for post hangover, colds, or just feeling like getting a nice warm bowl of soup when it's cooler outside.My friends have insisted I try this place because it is the best seulongtang they've ever had.I have already been here twice and it's pretty good. The main oxtail soup comes with different types of meat, both times I've gotten brisket. The soup itself is meant to be pure tasting. I like it as is, just adding the green onions on top. Most people like to add salt to taste. They come with side of kimchi and rice.The place is tight so expect a wait if you come with a big party or during rush hour."
2/27/2016,5 star rating,"Best Sul Lung Tang in LalaLand. Super flavorful, super creamy but not greasy, the beef and the green onion.. heavenly delicious!One of the best comfort food ever. So go there on a rainy day... go there when you are sick.. go there if you are a beef lover, or when you are hungry. JUST GO THERE!"
11/27/2015,5 star rating,"Came here for breakfast.  This is a true hole-in-the-wall place in Korean Town that specializes in brisket soup.  Perfect hangover food - easy to digest and very comforting.  I wished we'd come here after some of those crazy rides from Universal Studios.Their beef brisket soup comes with a very savory ox bone broth.  You basically pour in the steamed rice and then the scoop of chopped onions.  You gotta do it quickly since they will pass the onions to the next table!  Mix well, add a pinch of salt, and enjoy with a spoon.  The brisket is sliced thin and is juicy.  Unlike pho or ramen, you actually slurp up the soup here - its not super salty and is quite good!Its a cash only business and is worth trying.  Service is quick and efficient."
12/30/2019,5 star rating,There is parking in the back and it can get very busy with a line out of the door. The soup is light and you season it to your liking with salt. I enjoyed adding a lot of green onions and the kimchi is great alongside it.
11/26/2017,5 star rating,"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for this place yet. Definitely deserves 5 stars for their sul lung tang! For anyone who hasn't tried sul lung tang, the broth is plain but you can add your own salt and onions for additional flavor. I usually add a few teaspoons of salt and a generous amount of onions. The milky broth is so INCREDIBLY good. Simple yet comforting and hits the spot. They serve different meats in the soup but I always get the brisket sul lung tang. Meat is thinly sliced and tender! Food comes with a bowl of rice and banchan. The kimchi and kkakdugi (radish kimchi) are so good and fresh! Tip: dip the rice in the broth and eat it with some kimchi. Enjoy! Parking: very small parking lot in the back"
8/20/2019,4 star rating,"Very comfort food-style. Literally a hole in the wall. Everyone in here is Korean.. place and operations are authentic. Menu is taped on the wall by the table. I feel like price is a bit steep for what it is, but it's good. Credit card accepted."
4/30/2018,5 star rating,"This place serves the best sullantang I've ever tasted.We had a group of 6 people and ordered 3 soups to share, because we had an early dinner that day. They did not give us an attitude or anything, and gave us seconds on the banchans (Kimchi and radish) and I really appreciated that. I got the ox tongue sullangtang and it was so so good. I really wish I got my own bowl. I will definitely be back next time I am in town!"
10/1/2016,4 star rating,"It's a toss-up between Han Bat Sul Lung Tang and Young Dong for me, when it comes to Sul Lung Tang. I think not only, the broth and meat quality, but the kimchi is a very big deciding factor. I would say that both places have really clean, less-fatty, broth and meat quality; the kimchi both cabbage and reddish are delish. However, the ambiance is different. Han Bat has a very hole in the wall type of feel vs. Young Dong. I do feel that Han Bat is packed more often than when I go to Young Dong. I always noticed Young Dong with 1 usual server; Han Bat has 2 or 3. Parking: small lot in the back. Don't go to the market after eating; the security guard will scold you... just saying'.This place displays a "" cash only"" sign but they take credit card (so don't freak out if you forgot to pull cash prior)."
12/12/2017,3 star rating,"3.5 stars.My friend and I both had this place HBSLT bookmarked, so we decided to go check it out last night.The Korean aunties working are great, but the whole place just smelled so bad that it was unappetizing. It was just a pure funk in the air. I don't know if it is the smell of organ meat cooking or if it's a dirty mop that went around the entire store and then some, but I wouldn't put myself through that again. (Shit, and I'm no rookie- I tolerate the smell of boiling tripe when I'm making menudo at home.)The soup is delicious once you doctor it the way you like it, but portions are too small for $11.50, and I'm not a particularly big eater. You get a bowl of rice, cabbage and daikon kimchee, and your bowl of soup with a few meat slices in it. I'm really only here for the soup since I can get the other 3 accoutrements anywhere, and the soup is small :(Checked the box, but it's time to go look for more Korean soup somewhere else."
1/3/2016,4 star rating,"With the description of ""Korean soul food"" and 1,000+ reviews, I had to try this place.   When you first step into this place, it is tiny.   Perfect!  I love hole in the wall joints. There is a bucket of green onions on every table to add as much as you want until your heart is content and red paste that looks spicy because it's a dark red, but it tastes like nothing.   Just makes your soup more satiable maybe a bit saltier.   Don't be afraid to try it, it is not spicy at all.When my steaming hot and smoky bowl of Shul-Lung-Tung (beef soup w/ brisket) finally appeared, it looked amazingly delicious but I was a little disappointed at first bite.   I was expecting more flavor, I even added more green onions and red paste.   Meh, I experienced better were my first thoughts.   But with each bite, and as I continued to sip, I slowly loved it more and more with each spoonful.You will too..."
8/6/2018,4 star rating,My coworkers have been raving about this place for so long I finally made it there. I love me some Asian soup. And if lives up to the hype. The place is an authentic Korean joint with a super simple menu just focused on the soup. Soup was super tasty and per my friends I didn't forget to add in the salt and pepper and lots of the onions. Super tasty broth and hit the spot.
3/29/2021,5 star rating,always need to get my han bat when i go to koreatown.  love that you can just call in 5 minutes before and your order is ready.  i know there are a lot of new places popping up but this place really is still the best...and their takeout packaging is awesome because you don't have to worry about things spilling.  not the cleanest of places but that adds to the overall experience. miss being able to eat inside but the takeout is really just as good. and their kimchee is probably the best kimchee in all of ktown.
3/15/2021,5 star rating,"Best Sul Lung Tang in the LA area. The broth is very rich and flavorful & warms your heart ! The kkakduki is also great and pairs well with the soup. I got the seokum (mixed) soup because i like the variety. If you are a fan of intestines, you should opt for the other option. The portion size is very generous as well. If you are looking for a hearty, warm meal, han bat is the way to go :)"
2/28/2021,5 star rating,Hands down the best Beef brisket soup! The prices have gone up a bit but well worth it. Not a fancy place just a mom & pop spot serving good food. Must try if you haven't!

12/28/2017,5 star rating,"This is a legitimate mom and pop shop to come get your Korean comfort food for the winter or when you are feeling hungry as well! Located near Ktown, it definitely is a small hole in the wall, but nonetheless, this place is worth coming to!  This is a very small place but gets very busy, so expect to wait for a little once you get here.The menu is pretty simplistic, you order the style of meat soup to accompany your rice, kimchi, and radish.  I got the brisket beef soup and it was so delicious, simple, and warm.  You can add your various condiments like salt and chili paste as the soup comes quite bland at first.  They also provide you with diced green onions so that you can put as much into your soup as you want.  The sides were very good and I would highly recommend doubling up on the kimchi here when you come!  You can also order extra meat on the side if you are feeling hungry.They have a parking lot in the back but there is also street parking if you are lucky.  Due to the limited amount of seating, they do give you the bill prior to you finish eating, but there is no rush for you to pay immediately.  This place will not fill you up but it is great for a cold day!"
4/17/2018,5 star rating,"SUL LUNG TANG IS THE ULTIMATE KOREAN COMFORT FOOD. I always try to make my way over here when it's cold outside or even when I'm feeling a little under the weather.Sul Lung Tang is basically an ox bone broth. You pick the cut of meat you want with your soup, choices include flank, brisket, tongue, etc. They also give you a giant tub of cut up green onion, so you can add as much as you'd like to your soup! It also comes with some rice and simple banchan: pickled spicy radish and kimchi. Collectively, the whole meal feels very wholesome and light. This place used to be cash only but not anymore-- they accept credit card now! They also have a parking lot in the back but it's often full, so you have to either wait around a little bit for another customer to leave or find street parking elsewhere."
4/29/2019,4 star rating,"This place is small and gets pack. Great comfort and hang over food. Definitely recommend this place. Even though it's pack, the service is fast. You don't really wait long and the food comes out fast. Service is great even when it's fast. I love their mix bone soup. Oh yeah... very important. The brother is purposely under season so customers can customize how salty they want it. Salt flakes are available on each tables to season your own soup. Some people give low ratings for that reason which I think they should understand the custom of the soup first before writing something they don't understand. Overall we enjoyed it."
1/2/2016,4 star rating,"I've bookmarked this place for a while and decided to check it out since it is a cold winter night.++parking in the back. It looks hella shady with graffiti on the walls, but there is a security guard there. So no fear!!++You may enter the restaurant from the back parking lot. Right when you enter, this is where the line starts. You don't put your name down or anything. Walk in, wait in the line, and wait for the next available table.++The menu is very simple. The soup base is all the same - ox bone broth. You just pick your meat. I chose the mix meat, which includes bugolgi, spleen, intestines, etc.. After you order, the server will bring you a bowl of steamy, hot white rice and side dishes - radish & kimchi. The broth comes with absolutely 0 flavoring. You are in charge of adjusting the soup to your own liking. You can either put nothing in the soup and indulge in the natural flavors of ox-bones or you can put some msg in it, some salt, some chili, green onions, and even the kimchi  and radish. ++cash only. There's an atm inside if you need it."
12/25/2017,5 star rating,"Favorite go-to place for sullantang-- a true hidden gem in the wall! The workers are super fast and efficient, and they get you your food in no time. My favorite is the mixed Ox bone soup, and it comes with kimchi, raddish(?), rice, and the best of all, a tub of green onions! Will always be back for more- can't stay away! Tip: if you want a lot of green onions, scoop out some extra into the lid of your rice tin- that tub of green onions gets taken to the next table quickly!"

1/6/2018,5 star rating,"So simple, yet so good! I haven't found another place yet that even comes close to how creamy and rich the broth is here. The ox bone soup comes with your choice of meat and noodles. Just add salt and green onions to your liking and voila. Also includes a bowl of rice and kimchi and radish.There's always a steady stream of people coming in and out, but the turnover is quick. Park in the back or street parking."
1/27/2018,5 star rating,"Sul lung tang is one of my favorite soups, and Han Bat does it amazingly. Pros:-Very quick service -Straightforward menu (not too many options, which is great for indecisive folks like me)-Soothing taste (esp. on a cold day)-I went with a group of about 7 people, and they were able to clear a large table to seat us all together.Cons:-Long wait time during prime meal periods-Limited seatingTip: my group of 7 went around 11:30am, and were seated immediately, but a line started forming around 11:45/12pm."
2/3/2016,5 star rating,"Had heard about this place for quite the while and had this place bookmarked for the longest time. Finally got to come here for the first time in October with my mom, left a lasting impression... and came here again on the next trip in December bringing my best friend.Specialized restaurant located on the outskirts of K-Town in Downtown LA with a small menu of 2 items. Sullungtang (ox bone soup) with either mixed, beef brisket, flank, intestine/tripe/spleen, and/or tongue. - $9.64 +taxSuyuk (cold platter) of either mixed, flank, intestine/tripe/spleen - $19.27 +taxFirst visit, had taken my mom here since we needed to be in the area for something later in the day. We had a heavy hot pot meal the night before so something nice and light as in order. We had both ordered a beef brisket + intestine/tripe/spleen. This is my first time taking my mom to try this type of soup and SHE LOVED IT ! The soup is very clean and flavorful. Big container of chopped green onions available for you to put as much as you want (want some soup with your green onions? Lol jk but yeah they give you THAT much. The usual salt is available on the table for you. They give you a side of kimchi and pickled daikon. Both yummy with the sullungtangCame here a second time with best friend. She loved the soup. Even better than the one she continues to rage about (until her most recent trip to the bay) and now states this place is better. HEHE... Nothing in vegas compares. Can't wait to try one in korea too. See how this place fairs up to their homeland XD CASH ONLY. Friendly staff even with their limited skill of speaking english but it works out. Its enough to get through. You are directed to stand in the ""back"" of the restaurant to wait for your table."
1/15/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing hole in the wall place to get sul lung tang. This is one of my all time favorite comfort foods and I get it quite often, but this one has to be my favorite. They keep it simple- sul lung tang, rice, kimchi. The broth is so so good and makes for the perfect dinner. I will definitely be back for more."
11/22/2017,5 star rating,"I think you would have to know this restaurant is there since it's easy to miss and really is a hole-in-the-wall. My friends wanted to try this comfort food soup. The broth, an ox bone soup, is really creamy looking, smooth, and tasty and you can have your soup with beef brisket; flank; intestine, tripe, and spleen; mixed, and tongue with clear noodles. That's pretty much what they have and with such a limited menu they do that very well, so it should be easy to order. We had the brisket, mixed, and tongue and it was pretty good. You can season it however you like with salt, pepper, or green onions. If you want, you can add your bowl of rice in the soup. If I'm in the mood for soup, there's pho, ramen, and then there's sul lung tang."
10/29/2017,2 star rating,"Yes... so here are the couple of reasons why I'm giving 2 stars instead of the usual 4 for a place like this. The soup itself was excellent.  That rich deep earthy slightly metallic and nutty flavor of the broth was probably unmatched in terms of surl lung tahng  (Koreans still do not know how to spell their food phonetically. I'm here to help). The problem was that there was very little for me to chew on. I ordered the mixed, which consists of different meats and tripes/tendons and such along with clear glass noodles. Eyeballing the amount to put in by the chef is the beginning of such problem...they really need to come up with more consistent way of putting in generous amount of ""stuff"" in the bowl. Plus I didn't see the red pepper/garlic/onion that usually accompany the soup. I would love to give this place another try and give them a chance to redeem themselves. Maybe I can just simply ask to add a little more next time....  I did like the soup itself but the overall dining experience (maybe because I was by myself and thereby causing the restaurant to be a bit careless because I don't matter as much as other customers??  I don't know.  But this is a typical pattern observed in Korean restaurant when catering to solo customers...don't like it.). But I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again next time I'm in LA and may even give them 4 stars. In the meantime, they must be more consistent to deserve 4 1/2 stat they are earning at yelp."
9/24/2019,5 star rating,Simply amazing! Never disappoints! Perfect hang over cure and its been my hangover tradition for awhile now. Probably the best sulung tang ive had. I always get the tongue one. Its like very tender and yummy! They have parking $2. Gets busy during some lunches over the weekend. Def a must try spot
8/16/2015,5 star rating,"Specialty food is a wonderful thing. Exclusivity through the splendor of simplicity, establishments with a few things on the menu can focus on the things they do well instead of selling options in which they don't. In LA's massive KTown, no Korean comfort food is better than the oxbone soup (aka sullangtang) than the one at here at Hanbat. A local favorite for many years, it is without a doubt their claim to fame.Sullungtang is a tricky endeavor. Too many places add unnecessary bits to the pot, and never simmer it long enough with the bones to merit much flavor. In some ways it's similar to Vietnamese pho, which requires long periods of cook time and plenty of TLC. Hanbat's Sullangtang broth is heavenly; clean to the slurp, beefed up flavor, and dare I say perfect at close to all temperatures.This is no ordinary soup. It is the perfect hangover cure, the consummate sore throat slayer, the immaculate finish to a long night or start to an early morning. I prefer my sullangtang with brisket ($9 now -- boo inflation!), but a mix of flank, tongue, intesting, etc. might be the way to go. One can mix the broth with a little rice, but I prefer to slurp the soup straight up before moving onto the noodles and beef bits.Speaking Korean is always helpful in these parts, but not a requirement (some dives would differ). I would highly discourage take out of any kind, it just isn't the same. I enjoy the simple interior, pseudo-group friendly tables, and relatively easy parking situation. Even if none of that panned out, I'd still be here waiting in line for this soup ... hopefully hungover."

5/6/2018,4 star rating,This is my go to spot whenever I'm craving sul lung tang. It's a very simple comfort dish that really hits the spot on a cold days in LA. Their side dish is also just a very simple two kinds of kimchi's. Nothing special. Nothing is outstanding as it's kind of hard to mess up a sul lung tang so I dock off a point there. Nonetheless it's still delicious and love coming here when I got my cravings. Service is fast and they used to be cash only but now accept card so no hassle there! New comers should remember to put in salt and pepper to your liking Bc the soup itself comes bland so you can customize the level of flavor for yourself!
8/12/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious Oxtail Soup location in K-town! Recently EaterLA released an article listing the best Korean restaurants in ktown for August 2017. Since my bf and I were gonna be in the area we decided to check one of them out and chose Han Bat. The menu is very simple since they special in sul lung tang. You just decide which meat you want inside: beef brisket, intestine & tripe & spleen, flank, tongue, or mixed. The food comes out really fast and is served with 2 banchan: kimchi and daikon as well as a bowl of white rice. You get a bucket of green onion that you can add into your soup and off to the side there is salt, pepper, and spicy paste. The soup itself is very plain and bland which I enjoyed. My bf added more into his to get more flavor. You don't get a whole lot of meat but I think the price is worth it since it does include rice and sides. Btw, they recently increased the price to $11.50! I'd come back; food was filling and light, service was friendly and quick. No complaints. Oh yeah, and free parking in the back! Check you Han Bat if you're in the mood for sul lung tang :)"
6/20/2019,5 star rating,"I don't really have anything to add here that hasn't already been said but...This place is legit and is my favorite restaurant! It tops it all for me. This place's sul lung tang is food for my soul. If you have ever tried to make sul lung tang from scratch, then you can truly appreciate all of the time and effort that went into this soup. Some of my friends even say this place is better than places in Korea. Word."
4/2/2019,5 star rating,"Some delicious Sul Lung Tang! It's a traditional Korean Bone broth soup which you can salt to your preference. Add green onions (or not, if you're like me)! They've got spicy korean radish (or kkak-dugi) or korean kimchee as sides to complement. Very simple menu with simple and traditional sides. Delicious! We came here twice in a three day span. Won't be surprised if we come again before we leave town! Kids: it's a simple dish that any child would love. Rice and soup."
1/5/2020,4 star rating,Sul Lung Tang - I got mix beef. They give two ban chans. Kimchi and pickled radish or daikon. They also give side of rice. I recommend 1 scoop and half of salt in the soup. Maybe two scoops of green onion. I didn't add chili because my body doesn't handle chili well. The also have  chili if you want to be a bit spicy. I basically just dumped the rice in there because I was too lazy to eat side of rice with soup. The soup was good after the additions. There is parking in the back free. If you can get it.
1/25/2018,5 star rating,"This place used to be CASH ONLY, but it seems like they recently started taking card transactions!!HALLELUJAH! After what was the most ridiculous birthday dinner I've ever attended at Road to Seoul Korean BBQ, I woke up with the most crippling and debilitating hangover of my life so far. I had no energy to do anything, my head was hurting, everything so too bright, you get the drill. It was something that even Pho wasn't able to cure, which is ridiculous because I think Pho is the soup of life. Han Bat Shul Lung Tang was the only thing that I ate that day, and it was glorious. There is no medical proof that this can happen, but I swear on my life all that oxtail bone broth goodness paired with white rice and some kimchi and salt absorbed all the toxins in my body and re-invigorated my soul. The saltiness was assisting my body to finally retain water and it was also light enough to soothe the stomach all while providing enough substance to feel like you've nourished your body instead of putting it through the wringer the previous night.  It was very fitting that this took place on Sunday. It was almost a religious experience and I feel sorry for the people around me who weren't able to pay attention to the miracle happening right before their eyes because they were too busy tending to their own food.Each soup was approximately $10, which is amazing considering the healing powers it has. There are individual tables if you don't want to be bothered by the company of others, but there are long tables and you'll get sat with another family if that's all the room they have. You might have to share toppings too (salt, green onions, etc.).I was able to get street parking and also I dined at a super off hour since getting the strength to function as a normal human being took all day, so I'm not sure how it is during the rush. It's a super small hole in the wall, so be sure to keep your eye out. There's no vibrant and visible signage alerting pedestrians of its existence so you will probably miss it if you're not looking for it."
4/25/2018,4 star rating,"Parking is hard to find. Restaurant seating is limited. Good food and service. Affordable.Ordered the sul lung tang mixed, and it was really great! I liked how there were chopped green onions and salt in the containers on the side so u can season the soup to how you'd like it. The broth was rich and flavorful. Meat was tender. Side dishes complemented my soup nicely. I recommend coming here!"
2/15/2018,5 star rating,"My boss and I had the pleasure of walking into this restaurant on our way down to Hyundai's California Proving Grounds. I had picked him up from the airport and we wanted a bite to eat on our way down to the Mojave desert. So I looked through the trusted Yelp app to look for at least a five star rated, quick, Korean place to eat. So we decided to eat here. I do think their five star is legit- if you're craving beef soups with kimchi on the side. They only sell a small variety of beef soups. Service was very fast. Place was packed, however we were seated pretty quickly."

They only make one thing but they make it damn well. This is definitely one of my go-to places when I'm sick or hungover.Service is always fast, easy and straightforward, much like their soups. The only thing that would make this place better is if they offered delivery for those days when I'm too hungover to leave the house."
3/1/2019,5 star rating,THEY TAKE CARD NOW. No more ATM.I don't ever crave sul lung tang. I think it's kind of a weird food to crave. Until I ate here. There's just something kind of X Factor at work here and I don't know what it is but whenever I want something warm and brothy this is the first place I think of. Give this place a couple Michelin stars plzIt's always busy. Be ready to wait. It's worth it.
8/7/2017,5 star rating,"Thank God for this place and the miracles it performs. When I lived in Korea for a few months back years ago, after every weekend of drinking those sojus, I made it a routine to get my sul lung tang game on after long nights have those heavenly green bottles. Sadly I have not been able to find a single place in the US that matches this on part or brings back a sense of nostalgia. I may have just hit jackpot on the dream. I did not expect this place to be good at all especially when I saw the joint from outside and inside but boy are looks deceiving.  This is absolute comfort food heaven and I found myself wondering why it took me so long to find this joint.After a long weekend of adult beverages, I woke up to a hankering of sul lung tang and was told about this place and its magic ingredients. I felt that it was too good to be true but wanted to give it a shot as there is nothing better than a delicious bowl of this Korean comfort food. The service is no frills and very quick in and out the door. The menu is simple and straightforward with variations of sul lung tang and suyuk. I of course went with the sul lung tang and went with the brisket. They also offer different options of Flank, Intestine/Tripe/Spleen, Tongue and then mixed which bakes in all of the above for those looking for the options. You simply raise your hand and order the option you want. Shortly after, they bring you two types of kimchi (radish & cabbage) that are just jam packed with flavor. Literally I found myself inhaling multiple plates of this with my sul lung tang and it was because it was just that delicious. The heavenly bowl follows quickly with a bowl of rice. I would recommend trying the broth before adding salt because they just make it so tasty while keeping it extra clean. Green onions are a must and put a bit of that kimchi on there and heaven on a spoon. Literally every time I am here, I inhale all the food and immediately feel like my spirits are lifted and that I am on cloud 9. I am so glad I found this joint and there is nothing better in the states that brings back the feeling of being in seoul. This is the epitome of food for the seoul."
11/20/2017,5 star rating,"First off - there are plenty of reviews about how the soup's super bland - it's supposed to be that way. Okay, on to my actual review.Sul lung tang is one of my favorite types of Korean food. The broth is initially bland, but after you pour in your green onions from the enormous bucket they give you, the everything comes to life. I personally like to put two scoops of green onions and a tad bit of black pepper (there's also salt on the side, but I can do without). I ordered mine with just the brisket and the meat was so tender it just melts in your mouth. It also comes with some clear noodles inside and also a side of rice with kimchi. It may not seem like a lot of food, but the heartiness of the soup hits the spot and will leave you more than satisfied. Everyone here was also really nice! They were also really quick so it was perfect since we were in a rush!"
9/6/2018,5 star rating,"Definitely the best Sul Lung Tang I've ever had!!!The last two times I went there was not a long wait. They served the food super fast! Like in one minute fast. Seriously, if I live around there, I can have this everyday."
1/16/2019,5 star rating,I can see why people come here on Sunday mornings. To repent for your Saturday night regrets. It's so comforting and I never had sul lung tang so coming here to try it was super exciting. It definitely subsided the headaches I had. I got the mixed ox tail bone soup option. I love that they provide a huge tub of green onions. They also give you salt and pepper on the side so you can flavor your own soup to your liking! It came with a good amount of beef and you get to try a little bit of everything. The tongue flavor was a bit strange for me so I would definitely aim for the beef brisket next time I come here.There is a mini parking lot at the back and I would highly recommend coming here as early as you can! We came around 11am and it was pretty busy already. They also supply you with kimchi and radish for your soup.Happy recovering!
8/11/2017,5 star rating,"The Ox Bone Soup (Sol Long Tang) was THE best. My boyfriend is from Korea & he said it tastes authentic. The food was flavorful & the portions & meat portions were worth your buck. This is a delicious meal to eat if you're feeling sick or it's just chilly outside. Just a side note- this place is definitely a ""eat and go"" place. The food comes out literally within 5 minutes of sitting down & once you're done eating it's time to go. The place is so small & gets really busy so every table is needed. I've worked in the restaurant business before so I can say that it may seem that the servers are rude, but they are actually really hard working & extremely busy since it's only two servers. I did not see them take a break at all. Overall great experience & would definitely go again."
5/5/2020,3 star rating,I'm all for supporting small businesses during these times but prices have gone up even more to make up for loss revenue for sure... spent $78 on four bowls of soup!!
8/11/2019,5 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday, during brunch time for some sul lung tang (my mum was having this crazy crave for it haha), recommended by a friend.We both got the yang-ji sul lung tang (flank). The meat is so tender and soft while the broth is so nice and warm down your throat, at the same time being very rich and hearty -- exactly how a sul lung tang should be like. It's $13.50 (tax incl.) for a bowl, which is definitely a fair price. More than their sul lung tang, their kimchi and kkakdoogi is amazinggggg!! The sauce is not as sweet as other restaurants, assuring you that they don't use that much sugar in their pickled side dishes. We both left with full stomachs and hearts. Will come again!"
11/18/2018,5 star rating,"Probably the best place you can get traditional Korean Bone Soup! Parking is easy with 2$ valet and service is super fast. This isn't a place for fine dining. You just sit, order, eat, and get out. I seem to end up here every time after a long night. It's like having someone's grandma cook you a meal and invite you over. The order comes with rice, kimchi, and radish kimchi and taste amazing! Getting hungry just thinking about it."
9/26/2017,3 star rating,I don't get why this place has a wait all the time. It's mediocre sul lung tang and it's rumored that they put coffee creamer in to get the white color of the broth - instead of actually boiling the beef bones for hours to get the color. Tables are sticky and the restaurant is cramped.3 stars because food comes out quickly and you get in and out of there quick. Kimchi is pretty good. Not cheap for ~$12 a bowl.
7/13/2015,4 star rating,"K-Town is always fun to come and hang out in this area and one of the spots that I do enjoy even though it is summer time is Han Bat Sul Lung Tang...that is a tounge twister for sure but it has amazing and delicious food here. Parking can be a little bit of a hassle most of the time I will just park it at a meter and walk a few blocks. Get some exercise in before I enjoy some soup.The inside of this place isn't grand nor does it look good but that doesn't matter. The only thing that really matters is the soup. I love the Ox bone soup here, it is simple and tasty. I don't know why but even when I am out or even if it has been a long day I enjoy this very much. The simplicity of the meal makes it perfect. If you want you can just dump your rice into the soup and it could be porridge which is what I am a fan of and I'm not too sure if everyone does it like this. But it is very enjoyable but try it out with a spoonful to get a feel for it first before you decide to take it to the next level!"
5/24/2019,3 star rating,Our experience was ok. I understand why people would hype over the broth but I think it was alright. Price was higher than other sul lung tang places I've been to. Menu is simple and side dishes are just kimchi. I expected more noodles in the soup but it was mostly meat ( I ordered the mix soup). I wouldn't drive over fifteen minutes for this place but if I were around the area I would visit again.
10/3/2017,4 star rating,"Soooooooooo good. Sooooo fast. So satisfying.Sul lung tang cost ~$11 when I went this past weekend, so the prices have been going up. I got the brisket, and it was exactly what I needed on a Saturday morning~ Service is quick, so even if the place looks packed, you'll probably get a seat / your food soon!"
11/18/2017,3 star rating,"There was a long line by the time we arrive 6pm for dinner.  The line begin at the door to their back alley.  After waiting 15 minutes we were able to get a table.  We ordered beef brisket soup and mix meat soup.  Food came with radish and napa cabage kimchi.  The radish was crunch but the Napa cabage was soft and soggy, not good.  Their broth is average with a little bit of meat and potato clear noodle inside.  Service was kind of bad, it was very hard to get service since they are so busy.  Price for 2 people came out to be $23, not too bad.  They have parking in the back but it was full so we parked on the street."
6/8/2017,5 star rating,"THE BEST place to get Sul Lung Tang! I always get the Salgogi (Beef brisket).  This soup is amazing to eat when your hungry, sick, or HUNGOVER.If you see a line, don't turn away, it goes relatively fast.  People literally just eat and go.  Turnaround is quick.Make sure to add some salt/pepper or the kimchi juice and the green onions for taste.Cash only. Parking in the rear or street parking."

9/18/2017,5 star rating,"The OG place for Korean beef broth (sullungtang) soup. They've survived all these years in KTown for one reason and one reason only! They make the best beef broth soup in town!!What is so special about this beef broth soup?It is made with ox bones simmered slowly with briskets & other cuts (intestines+) over a long time.Sounds simple enough but that concentrated beef broth from the bones & meats give you a milky white broth that will warm up your heart & soul.This simple yet complex flavor of the broth is what makes people go eat at Hanbat. They have maintained the quality and flavor all these years.Menu is very simple - broth with meat (brisket or mixed with intestines) & noodles. They also offer sooyuk platters (boiled meats).All you get for banchan is the kimchi (cabbage & radish) and that is all you need. Beef broth soup and kimchi is like peanut butter to jelly!Seasoning is done at the table. You put your desired amount of salt, pepper, hot peppers (dadegi), & green onions.You get the hot bowl of rice and that's all she wrote!Dunk that bowl of rice into that soup bowl - get a spoonful of rice and broth, maybe some of the meat that's been cooked to perfection! Put a kimchi on it and your stomach and soul will be warmed up~Sullungtang is for your soul!Service is fast~ fast ajumma services! Parking in rear - do not be tempted to park at Carl's Jr lot. You will get your car towed!"
9/20/2017,5 star rating,"There's not a ton to say about Han Bat - it's a small, nondescript restaurant serving one thing and one thing only. That's right. They sell a sul lung tang that would make even the most stoic halmuni (Korean for grandma) cry tears of joy. As you might guess, the menu is super limited. If you don't want a steaming bowl of Korean bone broth, with beef, rice, a small amount of sea salt, and green onion, you're out of luck. All that said, because they only sell sul lung tang, your order will only take a few minutes to come from the kitchen, and that is a thing of beauty. The kimchi and ggakdeugi that came with the meal were simply spot on. Coming from San Francisco - a land of 0 stand out Korean restaurants - Han Bat was the perfect first meal after a day of traveling. Highly highly recommend!"
5/22/2017,5 star rating,"Please, please do not just jump into expectations and hopes that this place will suit your taste buds just because of the reviews. I say this because if youre not familiar with Korean cuisine, this place can be a very extreme hit or a miss. This restaurant isnt too big but it is always crowded during prime time for meals and even late nights as well as early morning from 9-10 am on. If you find a long line and wait then dont be too surprised! They have their private parking lot with vallet but space is very limited. The menu is basically limited to two main dishes (so dont expect varities) : the Ox Bone soup and the ""su yuk"" or basically steamed meat. Now the ox bone soup doesnt have any ox bones in them so dont freak out. How its made is that they boil these bones with other things to bring out the rich, white creamy like color for their soup base. Lot of people are disappointed because these soups dont have much ""flavor"". And yes thats true but thats because how youre supposed to eat these are add some salt to your liking, red pepper paste, add chopped up green onions/scallions and use kimchi side dishes. This is the best way to eat this meal as flavorfully as possible. Now even after this it doesnt taste good, this food just isnt for you. Lot of people will also come here for hangover meals as well. The soups come with the choice of your meat and little bit of noodles but thats about it.Their price is now around $10/bowls and $25 for steamed/boiled meats without tax but I dont mind paying that to eat this. You can always ask for more rice for additional cost.Overall, this restaurant in my opinion has the best ox bone soup and I can put that on my Korean background taste buds."
6/26/2017,5 star rating,"I've never had ox bone soup and whenever I go to a Korean restaurant, it's usually KBBQ or the usual kbbp/tofu stew/bibimbap kind of thing. But this restaurant was different-- they only had ox bone soup and you get to choose what you want in it: mixed, brisket, flank, intestine, or tongue.My boyfriend and I both got the salgogi (brisket) one. They gave us a plate of kimchi and a plate of what I think is radish and a bowl of rice each. They were super generous with their banchan! Our food came out REALLY quick, less than 5 minutes after we ordered.The ox bone soup itself was very flavorful yet light. It had a really clean taste and didn't feel heavy at all. There was also a very generous portion brisket inside the soup and it was very tender and delicious. :)I thought it was cash only but it turns out they also accept card. I'm a huge fan!!!!"
3/14/2016,4 star rating,"This is the perfect place to start your morning if you've just gotten off a plane or you downed too many soju bombs the night before (it's okay, we've all been there). Soup is always your go-to remedy for these situations, and this place really makes it special with that ajumma touch.The moment you walk in and are seated, pick out the soup that you want. Each variety comes with different meats in oxtail bone soup. Keep in mind that these bowls are huge. They're meant to keep you full throughout the meal, so don't feel bad if you can't finish it. Each bowl will set you back around $10, but it comes with a lot of food!Once it arrives five minutes later, be sure to throw in the kimchee, spices, and seasoning to give your soup that extra kick! That's what the banchan is meant to do- help you flavor up the soup to your liking in order to wake you up/cure your hangover.Thank you Fanny H. for showing me this spot. It was a happy reminder of how amazing Ktown is and how much this Californian misses it."

3/25/2019,5 star rating,"The service is quite friendly and fast. I can here around a Saturday morning and there was a line at the door, so we had to wait a bit.You get to choose what meat you want in your broth. I got all of it. The broth is very rich and savory, it really hits the spot if you're looking for a very warm soup with rice. They give you salt to add in it, so if you think it needs more salt, you can add to taste.They offer the normal side dishes, like kimchi and radish. The kimchi is very good. It has a nice savory flavor and was just very flavorful in general."
7/23/2017,5 star rating,"Simple place, simple food, simple service, and it's all wonderful :) This place has 2 types of items to choose from: Sul Lung Tang (ox bone soup) and Soo-Yook (boiled beef). The only options you have for the two are to change the type of meat you want in your dish. If you're new to this place or don't want to experiment too much with types of meat, I would recommend getting the Brisket Sul Lung Tang because it's essentially the classic soup with slices of beef. You can't go wrong with that :) The Soo-Yook is like if you took out the meat from the soup and just had a big quantity of that. This is also delicious if you're not feeling soup at the moment. Because the menu is so simple, ordering is pretty simple too. The waitresses get your order in, get your food out, and give you the check in record time. At no point do you feel rushed, but things are continuously moving and it's probably a good place to go if you need to eat or pick something up real quick. Overall, this place is a hidden gem, and I would definitely go check it out if you're ever in the area :)"
2/19/2019,5 star rating,"This restaurant converted me to sul lung tang. I use just be soondubu and galbi tang You can tell they have been cooking this broth for probably days! Just a deep rich flavor. It doesn't come seasoned so make sure to add a lot of green onion, some salt (to your taste), pepper, and some of the radish or kimchi juice. So delicious Pretty small restaurant can also get pretty"

7/23/2017,5 star rating,"Came based on the hype and it lived up to it. PS: YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS, you won't be disappointedI'm still salivating over the Ox bone soup.  $11.50 with tax included.   I've tried ox bone soup in the Norcal and none of it can come w/in comparison to this place.Beef brisket, intestines (lungs!!!! My fave), or mix. Korean soups comes unsalted so the customer can personalize their soups. If you love salty like me, 2.5 spoons of salt. If you love bland like my brother, 1 spoon.Then you can also place in the red pepper paste on the side. Some people if they want it spicer they add in the radish sauce (ban chan aka side dishes) But oh lordie their kimchi was out of this world! I loveeeee it. ****** Parking: we were extra lucky with it. But it's worth the walk if you have to park far. Location: right across from Carl's Jr.Service: it's a traditional Korean restaurant, don't expect to be treated like you will at kang ho dong.  They always got us water when we asked and more kimchi, that's what counts :)"
7/27/2017,5 star rating,"Oh my goodness. Talk about comfort food. Perfect place to go when you're looking for a great bowl of soup. I love the simplicity of the menu. There is the Sul Lung Tang (ox bone soup) and Soo-Yook (boiled beef). My favorite is the Sul Lung Tang with Brisket. The broth has is clear and tasty. Don't be afraid to add salt into the broth that is on the side! It would definitely be bland without it. But I love how you can control how much salt you want in your soup. There's also a red chili paste on the side if you want to add a little spice.  All of dishes are accompanied with rice, kimchi, and a pickled radish dish. Everything compliments each other so well!"
6/7/2017,5 star rating,"Their soup definitely hits the spot! It's perfectly prepared and what I love most is that once you place your order, it comes out almost instantly! My boyfriend and I ordered their brisket and tongue and we both thought it was good as is! We didn't add much salt, but we definitely added a gracious amount of green onions, pepper, and kimchi! We literally finished our meal within 15 minutes... it's THAT good! I'd definitely recommend this place. Quick and easy meal!"

8/2/2017,5 star rating,"Korean comfort food at it's finest. Don't let this hole in the wall fool you. Their menu is very limited, but it is incredible. There's the ox bone soup, and you can choose what you want in it: mixed meats, beef brisket, flank, tongue, or intestine, spleen, and tripe. There's also boiled beef with three options: mixed meats, flank, or the tripe, spleen and intestine. I just got the ox bone soup (Sul Lung Tung), and whenever there's an intestine option, that's what I go for. The broth itself is flavorful, and I love that you can just add in however amount of salt and green onion to your soup for that extra umph in your soup. The meats were soft. The soup is just sooo comforting that my soul feels at ease. It also comes with rice, kimchi and radishes. Their kimchi and radishes definitely taste like they're house made, and of excellent quality. It is just one of those meals that make you feel at peace. It's cash only, and there's an atm in front. The ladies who work here are very sweet, but they are mostly Korean speakers. You'll be able to communicate with them through menu pointing. Han Bat Sul Lung Tung will definitely leave your stomach warm and happy."
5/23/2017,4 star rating,"Hodang, this is one of those places that mainstream KBBQ lovers will not expect to be so popular. But Sul Lung Tang is OG Korean food, and if you want a taste of the motherland, this place gives it a close shot. You cant go wrong if you're having one of those cold nights and you want a warm marrow-y soup. But be warned, if you're not into Sul Lung Tang then you probably wont enjoy the very limited menu!Food: - Sul Lung Tang (~$10.49): I chose the beef brisket option since that's what I grew up with and I'm not a fan of other parts of a cow. The silky smooth marrow soup has the perfect mixture between comfort and bold (it's not neutral like Pho can be). This brought back my childhood memories of eating this every so often and really cherishing the concoctions you can make. Solid flavors and they definitely dont skimp on ingredients used. The brisket was thin and perfectly seasoned as it should be.  - Kimchi: Of course this comes with it but they gave two options, radish and cabbage. Delicious choices. Not too fresh and not too fermented. Make sure you try putting some of the kimchi sauce into the soup to really liven up the broth!Pros: - Looks like a mom and pop shop. You cant get any more authentic than this.  - DELICIOUS broth and meal. If you like Sul Lung Tang, this place is a must-try. - There's a line, and it's mostly made up of Koreans. We know our food. - You can ask anyone for waitress help. I remember those days... - Parking in the back of the restaurant is dedicated for the restaurant. Give it a try first before looking elsewhere and walking. Cons: - None really. It smells like Sul Lung Tang once you open the door. Some may not like it but it's how it should be! - Price can be a little higher than one would like. I agree, it's a little steep for this dish. But it's worth itSadly I dont live in the area to patron this place often, but I'm so glad we have a solid place where we can get Sul Lung Tang. I hope many other KBBQ lovers will give this food a try--it's healthy, comforty, and gives you a glimpse into authentic traditional Korean meals!"
7/29/2017,5 star rating,"Menu is short and simple, so you won't need much time deciding what to get. I got the beef brisket soup and it was soooo good!! They give you a huge box of green onions along with kimchi and radish side dishes; put all three together and the soup was bomb af!!!"
8/12/2015,5 star rating,"Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is a no frills restaurant that specializes in Sul Lung Tang - a traditional Korean broth, a.k.a. ""the hangover soup,"" made from ox bones, brisket and other cuts. Seasoning is done at the table according to personal taste by adding salt, pepper and chopped green onions. It's almost like the Korean version of pho, with rice and no cilantro, sprouts, basil, and anise. Their menu is short and simple. You select the type of meat for your soup (brisket, flank, tongue, mixed, etc) and/or you could opt for the Soo-Yook (broiled beef). Judging from the rich flavor that's extracted from the bones, I could tell that they simmered their broth for several hours. Their kimchi and kakkdugi tastes really authentic. It's the perfect and ONLY accompaniment necessary for my Sul Lung Tang.Han Bat is easily the best place for Sul Lung Tang in SoCal.Note: this place is cash only"
6/8/2020,5 star rating,"They have THE BEST bone broth soup in all of K-Town. Great quality and flavor. This is the only place we go for suh-lang-tang. When my mom was sick, we were here daily. They have raised their prices a bit over the last year so we may have to limit how often we come, but nonetheless delicious."
9/16/2017,5 star rating,Mmmm so yummy. I love the milky beef broth here. I ordered the brisket sullungtang and the meat was perfectly tender and fatty.  You can add salt and green onion to taste. They also have some really good radish kimchi to go with the soup. I drank all of the soup. A perfectly satisfying lunch :)
11/21/2017,3 star rating,"Their sul lung tang is good, but I personally don't think anything sets it apart from other restaurants. If I'm craving a bowl of sul lung tang, I'd probably just go somewhere else and pay less for the same taste. Everything else was great though: the servers were friendly and the restaurant has a warm, cozy/homey ambience. They have a small parking lot behind the restaurant, but there's also street parking if that's full. Quick tips for those new to sul lung tang:- order what kind of meat you want in your soup (brisket, mixed which has other organs, etc.) - taste the soup when you get it, and THEN add salt/green onion (which should be on your table, if not, just ask) to adjust to your desired taste - you can ask for a spicy chili paste, which you can mix into your soup if you want a nice kick"
5/14/2017,5 star rating,"Woohoo! Finally tried this Korean soup place. My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place since we moved to Korea Town. It is always on the top of our Yelp searches boasting high reviews and it is a few blocks from our spot. It was both our first times trying this type of Korean dish. As the reviews prior say, the soup is a broth that has little flavor other than the creamy rich texture. You season it yourself however you like and boy does it dramatically change. I got the mixed and it came with a variety of meats. I loaded my soup with green onion salt and pepper to taste. The soup was wonderful! This may be my new go-to when needing soup after drinking or when I am sick. The sides of radish and kimchee are a HUGE plus. So good. The place seems to get crowded but the service is quick. They do accept credit cards!Enjoy. Cheers!"
1/27/2021,5 star rating,Love the food and especially useful that they open early since I am early riser.  I can go pickup the beef soup and tongue soup and bring home for wife and kids for lunch on weekend.
3/12/2018,5 star rating,"This is a small cash-only inconspicuous restaurant that looks like a hole in the wall. They only have 2 items on their menu but they do them to perfection. We had the shul lung tang, one with brisket and the other with mixed meat (includes brisket, tongue, tripe, intestine, and liver). They first serve unlimited kim chi, and the flavor of it is earthy and amazing. The soup itself is a nice white color from the minerals from the bones used to make the soup. It's delicious with a very meaty taste to it. You add salt to taste, but try not to add too much so you can taste all the subtle meat flavors. The soup is simple and absolutely perfect."
9/30/2019,4 star rating,The soup here is perfect for a cold rainy day. The boiled meat broth leaves your body feeling clean and light while also filling you up.  The Kim Chee cabbage and radish is refilled so feel free to eat up. The mixed bowl is the most popular but my personal recommendation would be the beef brisket.
5/18/2015,4 star rating,"This place is delicious! Probably the most authentic sul lung tang I have ever tasted. Their soups are about 10 bucks which isn't cheap but not too expensive either.This place keeps it pretty simple, you get two sides the kimchi and the radish kimchi and you have a few soup selection. I got the mixed bowl but I probably will get the regular brisket one next time because the mixed one had a lot of unidentified items in there that I ended up spitting out. Oh make sure you put the kimchi sauce inside your soup and don't forget to season with salt and green onions!!! :)the only downside is that they open so early and close super early. I thought this place would be open til 12am to 2am considering how many drunk people would come in here for a nice bowl of soup on a cold night.this place is CASH ONLY!!! and they have free parking in the back, don't pay for the street parking."
1/30/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down the best sulungtang in town. Han Bat has been around for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I would eat here with my family and would always be excited to do so since we lived an hour away. Now that I live in LA, I'm fortunate enough to be able to drive less than 15 minutes to eat here. This place really has sentimental value for me.The service is quick as it's always been. You sit down, order, and receive your food all within around 5 minutes. I ordered the seokum (mixed) sulungtang which comes with brisket, beef tongue, intestine, and flank. They also give you a bowl of rice, kimchi, pickled radish, and a tub of green onions.The broth is and always has been on point. I sometimes eat it as is and sometimes add the pickled radish marinade into the broth, which is also quite tasty! It's one of those dishes where all the ingredients go well together.If you're looking for delicious Korean comfort food, look no more."
1/23/2021,5 star rating,There is no better Sul lung tang in socal!  The kim chee is the beat in ktown also.  There is always a wait but it goes by fast as you will have your order within minutes of sitting down.  Great experience with great food!
2/26/2017,4 star rating,"PARTY OF ONEIf you walk in the front door and there's no table available the lady will yell at you...""You wait there!"", while she is pointing to the rear of the restaurant. Yes this totally happen to me. There's a door in the back but it leads to the parking lot, which is small and full. In fact, nobody ever entered through the back door the whole time I was here. I'm not even sure it works. The regulars must know this policy because the three couples that walked in behind me all knew the program. None of them got yelled at like I did. Each one walked to the back of the restaurant and stood behind me. I'm offering this advice so you know the program. The same lady also made sure everyone knew I was dining by myself. When my table was ready she yelled, ""You! Single! Table ready! There!"" Yes everyone was on a date here and it didn't help that I was the only Caucasian in the room. Apparently Saturday night is a huge date night here. I wasn't worried because I love authentic food and I wouldn't want to eat anywhere else. That's how I roll. I sat down and she immediately said, ""You ready!!!!"" No I wasn't. She kind of then threw the menu at me which was in a picture frame on a shelf next to my table. The menu was simple with basically two soups. One for $10.85 and the other for $24.98. I looked around and assumed everyone was going for the $10.85 soup and I decided to go that route plus I didn't need 25 bucks of soup for a single guy. I ordered ""Shul-Lung-Tang"" which is a beef soup. I ordered it with brisket cause I wasn't feeling for tongue, stomach, spleen or intestine. As I look back,  I'm wondering why I didn't order that? Hmmm! The sad part is I spoke with Chef Andrew Zimmern from Bizzare Foods earlier in the day and he encouraged me to order the intestines. I had not eaten anything all day and I just couldn't do it. I needed something in my belly that wasn't going to freak me out. The food comes out fast. A bowl of kimchi hit the table first and my waitress pulled out her scissors and started cutting it up. I'm amazed they use scissors. It's truly authentic because I've witnessed this in South Korea on my trips there. I also received a spicy pickles, a container of green onions, rice and finally my bowl of soup. The soup says its beef but I've read it's a broth made with Ox tail bones. I can not confirm any of that because my waitress was not about to give me an interview. She wanted me gone. The broth was not as flavorful as I expected it to be, so I decided to toss everything inside. The rice, kimchi, spicy pickles and green onions all went in. This really added to the flavor of the broth. If I didn't toss everything in, I would have been upset. I finished up my soup and I was ready for a good nights sleep after working a 16 hour day in LA. The soup really hit the spot because it was cold and rainy in the city. In fact, it was warmer by 6 degrees in my hometown of Chicago in Februrary. I'm sure I won't be able to say that again next year. So if you're looking for a new experience, then this place is a must. It has fantastic reviews and I would totally come back. It's always good to search out new places that aren't comfortable or safe because those make the best stories."
11/25/2018,5 star rating,"This is like the In N Out of Sul Lung Tang (aka. oxtail broth), I guess. It's about simplicity--you came for great  Sul Lung Tang (there isn't much else in the menu), and you get just that.The hearty broth is flavorful, meaty, and creamy.  It's all that you hope it would be.  The meat is very tender.  If you like Sul Lung Tang to begin with, this place does it justice--a good deal of that old school hearty flavor.  The side dishes are quite fresh and I loved all the kimchi. Interior is small and definitely gives the mom and pop shop vibe.  Friendly mom-and-pop style service.  Things come pretty quickly--you come in, eat, and then go off doing your thing."
2/5/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down best ox tail bone soup place that you can get in KTown!I came by on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed, but we only waited about 15 minutes before getting seated. One thing that I love about this place is how fast the food comes out despite it being so busy. The service is always super speedy which only adds to the overall efficiency! I ordered the brisket soup and the broth man, it just reaches into your soul and warms it up. Best soup to get on a cold rainy day.They have parking available in an alley in the back. I think it is valet, but when we went, there was no valet. Otherwise, you can try finding street parking or try parking at the California Marketplace across the street since they have free parking there. Overall, I would highly recommend checking this place out for their amazing sulungtang! Pricey but definitely worth!!!"
5/26/2018,5 star rating,"This little hole-in-the-wall diner is tucked away in the main Ktown area. Very low key and easy to miss. Yet their soup is so milky, rich, and natural that it's a shame to miss out!! Absolutely the ultimate comfort food you could find around town. They only offer two different soup base but you could choose the kind of meat you want. I go for the mixed and it's definitely amazing. They don't add any seasoning for u and u need to add salt according to your own preference. And green onions! I add a whole ton to my bowl and it brings the soup to another level.Rice is offered alongside with your soup, as well as kimchi and pickled radish. Satiety guaranteed."
10/1/2019,5 star rating,Best bone soup out there. A place to go to. Good price and quality would vote 5/5 to price to quality
4/22/2015,4 star rating,"I liked their sullungtang well enough, but it didn't wow me. The broth was milky, as proper sullungtang broth should be, but it felt a bit watery and bland, even after I added salt. I liked that you can select from several meat options. We opted for brisket.The service left something to be desired. They took away our container of green onions to give to another table, and we had to flag them down when we needed something, although I guess that's to be expected at most Asian restaurants.Their kimchee (both radish and traditional versions) is REALLY good. Street parking is hard to find in the area since it's near busy Western."
6/18/2017,5 star rating,"When there is only one thing on the menu, you know it's going to be good! Sul lung tang is a soup simmered for hours with ox bones and various cuts of beef. The soup comes with rice and your choice of beef cut or a combo of all cuts (includes intestines...not for the faint of heart). Banchans are simple, kimchi and radish cubes. Salt, pepper, and scallions on the side to flavor your soup to your own tastes. Don't come here expecting something out of this world. People like this place because it's simple yet delicious and just hits the spot.Everyone waits on one line (regardless of party size), when you get to the front, staff will call next and you tell them how many then. Can be a bit intimidating at first but all the staff are really nice. The ahjummas noticed we finished our banchan and just kept them coming. We were starving and must have had at least 3 rounds of banchans."
1/2/2021,5 star rating,this is the best soup I ever had! love the flavor and plenty amount of meat in it. my favorite winter soul food  now
1/9/2018,3 star rating,This place is ok for Korean comfort foods.  The best item is the beef broth.  Got a little of bird nest soup taste.  The tongue is a good cut of meat.I like the spicy raddish.  not the kim chee.It is ok a bit pricy at $11.50.It is Koreantown though.it is ok.
12/8/2017,4 star rating,Han Bat Shul Lung Tang is the perfect remedy for a cold day.. but that rarely happens in Southern California lol. My buddy took me here because I wanted a light dinner before going out so this was perfect. There are only two options so it's great for those who are indecisive as you don't have much to choose from. The Soup is very very light and you can add your own MSG which I love. I like to mix it up with Kim Chi to give it a little bit more of a spice to it. Highly recommend adding an extra order of meat for those that are hungry.

8/9/2015,4 star rating,"Before I say anything. My friend requested for tofu and his girlfriend Yelp-ed this place without reading any reviews. We were definitely not drunk or hungover, which would have been the perfect place. Fail #1 Apparently, they have parking behind restaurant. Fail #2I can totally see why people would love this place. It's OG. Your parents took you here, you got blasted last night, or it's cold out. This is the cure all. For us, not so much. But I don't get bad reviews for new places or food I'm not accustom to. So, Han Bat Sul Lung Tang, keep doing it your way. You have great customer service and all my Koreans gave you mad props on my Instagram. ""The best place for Sul Lung Tang."""
2/14/2017,5 star rating,"This is -- by far -- the best spot to go for sul lung tang in Koreatown. Don't get me wrong, Koreatown has great places for sul lung tang; it's just that all of them fall behind when comparing to Han Bat. Han Bat has been around for a very long time, and you can tell, right off the bat, by the quality of their soups.My only gripe would be that Han Bat is no longer the hole-in-the-wall sort of place it used to be...it's no longer a ""hidden gem,"" resulting in longer waiting times, crowded quarters (Han Bat is not a big place), and just a poorer dine-in experience.Thankfully, you can now get Koreatown's best sul lung tang delivered! You can use the mobile app, RushOrder, to avoid all the hassle of going there to eat. It's such a time-saver. Also, I'm not sure if it still works, but the code, HUNGRY3, gives you three bucks off."
8/7/2019,3 star rating,"Wow prices has gone up in this place, definitely a OG soup spot Don't think the flavor is as good as it wasStill busy though Probably cause yelp reviews and it's tenure There's better ones nowI won't mention here Competition is high for this soup is all I'm saying There is valet parking though behind"
1/9/2021,5 star rating,The OG sullungtang place come here and see what all the hype is about you won't regret it!!!
1/4/2019,5 star rating,"You can never go wrong with Han Bat. No matter the weather or mood, it always hits the spot. When I do come here, I always order the brisket one with extra meat. I could skip on the rice as long as I get extra meat and if you ask, they might give you a bit of extra soup. Give this shop a try if you're ever craving good Korean soup, especially during the rare and cold LA nights."
8/26/2019,5 star rating,"I got an oxtail soup for $13.50 and it was perfect. Since you add your own salt, pepper and spice you can flavor it however you like. The soup tasted super clean and delicate. After drinking the whole bowl I didn't feel heavy or bloated at all. The kimchi was also really good and was grest with rice. This is perfect for when you have a cold want something warm and filling."
11/12/2017,5 star rating,I love this place!! This is the definition of comfort food. Han Bat Sul Lung Tang specializes in ox bone soup. It's basically soup with rice in it. It sounds very simple but it's very tasty and so good for the soul. There is a parking structure in the back so you can try checking it out to see if there are spots. There might be a bit of a wait but the line tends to go by pretty quickly!!You can pick what kind of meat you want in the soup and it comes out plain. You can add green onions and adjust to your liking with salt and pepper. I love that you can customize it to your preferences because I was able to make mine the ideal saltiness for my taste! Definitely a great place to warm up your tummy or to recover from a night out drinking.
12/21/2017,5 star rating,"One of my favorite places in ktown. It really brings a sense of korea. The ajimas (ladies) greet you loudly and have you sit down. They bring tubs of kimchee and green onions to put in your soup, and once you taste the soup. OMG! I typically mix my rice and soup together. Ill also put kimchee in the soup and just use the spoon to eat away!"
1/21/2015,5 star rating,"Sul Lung Tang (ox bone soup) with pick of meats $9.64. Comfort light food. Hole in wall, difficult to find from front. Reminds me of Korean version of pho. They have back door and parking lot, crowded. Quick movement of tables. Awesome kim chi!! Staff is nice. CASH ONLY.I love clean plain food. These places are harder to find. But definitely not for the friend that craves fatty, greasy food. Maybe for the friend that likes to juice, eat really really plain, like comfort light soup."
4/4/2015,5 star rating,"Been coming here since I was s kid.  Their menu is pretty simple of soups with different meats. As for side dishes, don't expect the usual wide array of ""banchan"" at this place.  But what you do get is perfectly fermented kimchi (cabbage) and ggak do gi (radish kimchi). Prices are reasonable and it gets crowded especially on weekends.  There is a small lot behind so if you are lucky enough to score a spot, kudos!! If not, no fear, there are some meter parking spaces on 6th and on Western and residential parking on the small streets."
10/13/2018,5 star rating,"Han Bat Shul Lung Tang changed my life. I have been eating here since I was 10 months old and I will never stop. Bomb. Dot. Com!!!!!!!!! The only place anyone should ever eat at in the Greater Los Angeles Area. IT IS NOT CASH ONLY. If this establishment ever needs a waitress, I will happily work for no pay, just soup. Amazing."
12/2/2017,5 star rating,"I'm obsessed with this place--one week I came four times, that's how much I love it. The broth is light and flavorful, the meat juicy, even the kimchi is amazing. This is the best place to come for filling, hearty soup."
1/2/2020,4 star rating,"Small hole in the wall storefront with limited parking in the back. Incredibly fast and soup broth is rich and flavorful. Only downside? They portion their side dishes like the kimchi radish. I asked if i could get an extra side of it they said no. I asked if i could pay for an extra side of it they said no. I guess radishes are a luxury side dish in this shop =_=? I just didnt get it, everything else was great theres not much service needed its order-eat-pay and leave but the side dish really got me scratching my head. Anyone know why? All korean restaurants give out& replenish side dishes especially kimchi. Doesnt take away from the food but i just really dont get it."
2/22/2017,5 star rating,"This place is legit!it's hard to find good sul lung tang in the US. it takes a long time to prepare, and especially outside of LA, there is either lack of expertise or lack of incentive to do it well. and when you do find it, it's not great, and it's super expensive.well not Han Bat! the sul lung tang is ahhhmazing, and very affordable to boot! the soup is so flavorful and deep. it's a bit hard to find, and they only take cash, but it's well worth the trip."
1/3/2017,5 star rating,"I never had anything like this back in NorCal. I wonder if we have something similar. I must go searching. So my friend recommended this to me while I was visiting with friends. She said if we were hung over, we should get this in the morning. I can see why they are open at 7am now.So the parking is in the back a little hidden but luckily when we got there, it was still pretty empty  (10:30am). My friends and I got seated basically immediately. They only serve the beef soup and this other dish but everyone is here for the soup. Since we didn't know which variation of beef to get, we all got the mixed. It had brisket, intestines, etc. It is served with pickled radish, kimchi, and rice. The soup was very stocky and rich. We put in a little salt and lots of green onions and dived in. It was so good! It went perfectly with the rice and the flavors are super comforting. It was so good we got it for breakfast again the next day! I can't wait to come back to LA to get some again."
8/24/2019,4 star rating,"I'm traditionally raised, so I'm a traditional man. With traditional tastes. Sorry about that, I couldn't help but crack a few jokes here and then.Anyways, I went along with a friend to this location in KTown and honestly I was pleasantly surprised by its setup. It's not that I found the place outdated, but more like I felt comfortable. I was recommended the mixed version of the beef soup and boy it was great !As for the menu, it should adhere to your tastes. Small selection of items but more than enough as they serve with side dishes and rice. I'd recommend shank if you cant compete with the games taste of liver. Also for flavor enhancement, I added the kimchi and approximately 1.5 spoonfuls of salt. Original taste is quite rich also so pepper should be enough!I will definitely try my best to visit again, to give a more thorough review. But until then, let me finish my soup, because it's made to keep the heart, body and soul warm. Don't forget that one."
12/21/2019,5 star rating,"One of the OG Ktown restaurants that have been around for decades, and I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon. I've been going here for 25+ years, and it's extremely consistent. I think they have a vat of broth just simmering 24/7 in the back, which means food comes out quickly. Their menu is limited, illustrating their specialty in sul lung tang. The service is Ktown typical. They have a tiny parking lot in the back that gets filled during peak hours. This is not a restaurant where you linger with friends. It's a get in - eat delicious food - and get the heck out kind of place. I admire and respect this restaurant because it's one of the few lasting restaurants from the 1980s (maybe 1970s?). I hope it never changes."
7/19/2017,3 star rating,"Apparently Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is a special, and somewhat 'historical' establishment in Ktown. They serve pho-like noodle soup, and have only like 2 menu options. However, I was a little disappointed by the meager meat/noodle serving in the tang for how much I paid. Broth was very subtle so you need to come not craving a high-sodium meal. My parents have definitely made variations of this type of comfort food to which I'm accustomed so the noodle soup really didn't stand out to me. Personally, I don't see my self coming back here but it's definitely a very casual spot to eat at with your family if you are into more subtle flavors. Also maybe my non-koreaness is rendering me unable to taste the nuanced flavors of such diluted broths."
12/22/2017,5 star rating,"Good soul lung tang. Broth is milky with concentrated oxtail flavor. At $11.50 Tax included, it's reasonable. Season the soup to your liking. It is not filling though, portion is on the skimpy side but good for breakfast. Leaves more precious stomach space for my day trip in LA.The female owner is super friendly and kind. She helped me charge my phone. Definitely come here to this s mom and pop establishment for a warm comfort breakfast. You may need more food if it's for lunch/dinner."
11/11/2017,3 star rating,"I've never had sul lung tang before trying Han Bat's, but I've had my fair share of korean food and I found this dish to be particularly lacking in flavor and underwhelming. My parents' clear bone broth has more flavor than the opaque milkiness of this sul lung tang and I don't know how that's possible. For a soup that appears to be very rich, it ended up tasting very watery. I added a good amount of salt, scallions, and kimchi to my soup hoping to give it more umph but it didn't unveil whatever deliciousness every other Yelper seems to have experienced here.Granted, it was fairly cheap for the amount of food - I was stuffed and left without seeing the bottom of my bowl, and it wasn't terrible, just not as good as I'd expected. I wouldn't recommend Han Bat to anyone else but I wouldn't object to it if I were invited here, so this place is okay."
11/27/2016,5 star rating,"If I'm thinking about grabbing some suhlung tang, this is the first place that comes to mind...even while I'm in Irvine haha.It's a well-oiled machine. The turnaround is pretty quick since the menu is simple and just soup. You sit down, they bring out the spicy radish and a cup of water, get your order, and your food's out in less than 5-10 minutes. I usually grab the brisket. For those trying it for the first time, you'll need to add green onions and salt to taste or else you'll wonder why people crave this bland, slightly milky disgusting broth :PThe price has been slowly creeping up over the years. I remember when it used to be $8. I think the last time I went it was in the $10-11 range. If they get any steeper, I don't know if the price for quality ratio will keep up. Part of the sell was definitely getting a great meal for a steal..."
11/8/2015,4 star rating,"First things first, I'm not Korean so I don't know how it's ""supposed"" to taste.Flank Seollongtang- you can tell the broth is made from hours of stewing beef bones. It's light, yet heavy/satisfying at the same time. Definitely season with salt and green onions (otherwise it WILL be bland). The meat was decent and I kind of hoped for more glass noodles in the broth.I personally like spices/bolder flavors, so I probably wouldn't choose to go again unless I really needed something you'd eat on a cold day and homey/comforting. For that though, it's a solid choice."
2/14/2019,5 star rating,"This is my husband and my favorite restaurant in all of LA. We drive from the beach, where we live, all the way to Korea Town to eat here on a regular basis.The soup is amazing. I get the brisket and he gets the mixed (all the meats and innards). It's so soothing. We regularly go there after a fight or bad day to make us feel better."
7/6/2020,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Best Korean soup I have ever had, can't get enough of it, we drive 30 mins each way just for the soup and kimchi here. Only two things I can ask for, open a location here in the valley, it will do great and start selling the kimchi!"
9/14/2018,5 star rating,"My absolute favorite shul lung tang (SLT) spot in Ktown.You know a spot is good when their menu is limited.As far as I know.. that's the ONLY thing on the menu! Service is quick and to the point. Restaurant is simple and not that big. Not ideal for a big group. Ideal for small groups, single diners, and a quick meal. There is a small lot in the back of the restaurant. That's a BIG PLUS for a spot in Ktown.You don't come here for a gourmet experience. You come here to cure a hangover, or warm up with a delicious bowl of beef bone soup. WHOOOHOOO! As good as it gets!"
12/9/2016,5 star rating,"Sweet holy mother of Korean Jesus -you done stroked my soul ever so tenderly.The algorithm gods have responded to my curious and hungry queries, summoning me towards Han Bat Sul Lung Tang.The beauty is in the simplicity. And the silky, tender grains of the choice brisket, lubricated by a delicious streak of marbled fat as it slurps its way between your delighted lips.  The broth, a magical nectar, embodies the beefy heaven that is voluntarily enhanced with punches of fresh chopped green onion and other accoutrements.I feel really good about life after this meal.. as if I have been held in the arms of my non existent Korean nana and she whispered to me ""Everything gonna be ok...""Hole in the wall. No fancy shit. Just bomb soup. And fire banchan."
3/19/2019,2 star rating,Stopped by since I was in the vicinity. I realized to my surprise  price jumped....it's now $13.50?! To be honest it's not worth $13.50 for sullungtang. Today somehow wasn't that good.
5/24/2017,5 star rating,Hands down best place to get sul lung tang (Korean beef soup) in koreatown or anywhere else. This place has been around for a long time and I've been coming here for a long time. Taste of sullungtang is amazing and side dishes of kimchi as well. This place is a MUST try.
2/21/2017,4 star rating,"You know a place is great when you are willing to drive 1.5 hours through traffic from Chino Hills for this stuff.  The hardest decision about this place is what meat you want in your soup because that's all they serve - sullung tang. However, it's not JUST sullung tang that you're ordering. You're taste buds are about to get a real good kicking with this rich, creamy, flavorful bowl of awesome. But the fun doesn't stop there. What's a sul lung tang place without the kimchi and kkakdugi (radish kimchi). As these are the only banchan's (side dishes) that are served with the meal, expect great things from it. I've been here two times and both times, the kimchi and kkakdugi were on point - perfectly seasoned, perfectly ripened, and not too spicy.As most other's have noted parking is limited, but the place is small so not a big deal. Considering that this is LA, I personally think the parking is great (don't have to pay). Parking is accessable through a small alley just to the left of the restruant. They now accept credit card! I think price is $10.48/bowl.Do yourself a favor and give this place a try. I guarantee you won't regret it. Especially after a night of drinking ;)"

I love to put some of my rice into my soup and drink the soup that way. Unfortunately, the price has been steadily increasing over the past year. It has risen from about 10 dollars a bowl to 13.50 (for now). As great as the soup tastes and tender the beef, this place is slowly reaching the point where it's no longer worth my money."
2/9/2019,5 star rating,"Dude. Now one of my favorite Korean restaurants. Granted, I've only done takeout here-- so I can't speak for the service. But the soup is amazing. Best soup ever especially if you've partied hard the night before ;)"
1/22/2019,5 star rating,"One item menuthat guarantees legitthe store is small and kinda hard to find, but they have their own parking, which helpsthe soup... really really good. you don't open a restaurant with ONE dish unless it's really good. there's salt and green onion on tables coz the soup is meant to be made bland and adjusted to each person taste. As most korean places, there're kimchi on the side, and Han Bat make their kimchi just right. highly recommend for a light meal. add meat if you wanna be full :)"
6/23/2017,5 star rating,"Simple menu - they focus on making their Sul Lung Tang (Ox Bone Soup) right. Don't expect variety of side dishes, like you get most other Korean restaurants, but do expect some good kimchi. The soup has so much flavor, yet has a clean aftertaste! There can be a pretty long wait during dinner time, but you shouldn't have any problem getting seated during lunch time. There's parking in rear, $2 valet parking."
4/21/2017,5 star rating,"I love restaurants that only sell 1-2 dishes because it's their specialty. Walking in, you can expect that the food will be undeniably amazing. We came here for to get take out for breakfast at around 7 am, which was so shocking that they were open that early. Try Sul Lung Tang for breakfast, it will blow your mind how much it will wake you up. Who needs coffee when you got soup. For four people we ordered I think the perfect amount. Sul Lang Tang Salgogi (Beef Brisket - $10.10) x 3 - They definitely increased their prices from what I can tell by the taste, but still pretty good amount for your money. Usually when you eat Sul Lang Tang, there's usually not much taste, so I usually add in some salt, tons of green onion, and add a lot of kimchi and kkakdugi (radish kimchi) to give it flavor. I was surprised this time though. The ox broth soup definitely had a lot of ox(?) flavor (not sure how an ox is suppose to taste like haha). It was so rich that I didn't feel like an urge to dump the whole kimchi plate and the sauce into it. The glass noodles were very sparse, so definitely dump the whole rice in, which was actually a lot. The brisket was super thin and tender, literally just ripped off by itself. The ""banchan"" was super delicious. Kimchi and kkakdugi was amazing. I don't know what it is about Southern California, but their kimchi is so much tastier than Northern California. Each house is so different unlike the normal stuff you get up north. Also they legit give you a whole bucket of it, even it take out. Highly recommend this place, even for takeout. They still give you loads of green onion and kimchi, also red pepper flakes. I think the next time I would want to sit down to get the full experience and get all that kimchi refills :)! Also it's super affordable for some quality Sul Lang Tang."

Simple Steps Towards Being Hangover Free:1. Drive to Han Bat Sul Lung Tang and find street parking (yes, I know easier said... esp when you're hungover).2. Order the sul lung tang and choose your meat. Brisket is the most popular.3. Add a shit ton of green onions, chili, and as much rice as you please. 4.

However, they have the best food and service. I ordered mixed ox tail soup. There is salt, pepper, and scallions on the table for you to add. It comes with kimchi cabbage and radish. The soup was delicious. The lady was very friendly and nice. It made me feel like having a homemade meal there. It was a simple meal but I enjoyed it to the last bite."
1/18/2020,5 star rating,"Authentic hole in the wall Beef Bone Broth Soup aka (Sul Lung Tang). When you want that hearty, healthy taste of Sul Lung Tang, Han Bat hits the spot. Kimchi is right on and compliments the soup like no other. Server ajumas are nice. Nothing fancy, but people wait in like for this place. My father recalls going to this place back in the 90's and he hasn't been back to Ktown in 30 years!"
7/20/2019,5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite places to get sul lung tang, it's amazing and has a very flavorful rich broth. I love getting the salgogi (beef brisket) and adding a few spoons of salt into it and green onions. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny, abt 13.50 per soup but it comes with a bowl of rice, kimchi and radish. After I tried this place with my friends I crave it so often, it's quickly become a comfort food for me personally. The kimchi and radish that are given on the side are  delicious with the rice. The parking is a bit small, doesn't seem to be overwhelmingly busy when I go in the evenings. I definitely recommend this place if you love soup!"
12/25/2020,2 star rating,"They don't seem to really understand how a line works. Obviously people in front of the line goes first, followed by older Koreans regardless of where they are in line. Postmates get to skip as well lol"
9/8/2017,4 star rating,"Don't come here expecting a full on Korean menu filled with endless dishes. They specialize in one thing only but they make a seemingly simple, humble dish into something so soothing and comforting you will want to come back for more. I went the safe route with the beef brisket ox bone soup and it was exquisite. The beef brisket was sliced thinly and cooked to tender perfection. Add some salt and pile on the freshly chopped green onion for a deep, rich flavor and beautiful color. For side dishes they only provide two: kimchi and radish. I thought the crunchy radish added a nice textural balance to the soup and brisket, in addition to a spicy kick. It was so good I asked for seconds! It's also nice that there's free parking in the back of the restaurant."
5/7/2020,5 star rating,this place is my ultimate favorite in k-town! they have the tastiest soup and that's all they do and specialize. I like that they have convenient valet parking in the rear for just $2. Even taste super good togo!
9/5/2017,5 star rating,"The best. For some reason I come here most often around breakfast time, and the food here makes for an excellent breakfast. The soup is amazing. Great depth of flavor and body: just make sure you add salt and green onions to taste. With your choice of meat (I usually go for brisket), glass noodles, the soup is hearty and filling. It pairs perfectly with white rice, kimchi, and radishes. Just an amazing meal that comforts my soul. Love this place."
2/26/2019,5 star rating,"Best sullung tang in LA!  Sullungtang is basically korean bone broth.  The broth here is milky to the point of being creamy, just from the bones!  I usually get the mixed sullungtang which has tongue, tripe, flank, brisket, spleen, etc.  They dont skimp on the meat here and I always leave here feeling super full and satisfied.  Amazing broth!"
5/4/2017,5 star rating,"Discovered this place on accident the first time, and then kept coming back for more. Probably ate here twice a week for 3 weeks in a row when I got sick. It's definitely a great place to go if you're not feeling a heavy meal and don't have a great appetite. It's also very fast- from getting seated to getting the food. It's a tiny place but runs very effectively."
5/3/2017,4 star rating,"I came to Han Bat Sul Lung Tang ""HBSLT"" after craving Korean bone marrow soup. It's not exactly Korean bone marrow soup.. I don't think, but it's still really good! There's a parking lot in the back if you are struggling to find parking on the street.I was reading reviews and saw that there's always a wait. It's also a 4 and a half star restaurant so I was really surprised when I came on a Friday at prime time and there was absolutely no wait. I ordered the soup with beef briskets and it came with rice and kimchi. Initially I thought that the soup was a little bland, but I later found out that you were supposed to put in the green onions and sea salt. I like that you are able to adjust the flavors to your liking and it's not too strong or too bland. I want to say that its realllly good comfort food. The soup is around $10 and is only enough to feed one. The menu here is limited I think there's only about two different types of soup to pick from. Overall I'd def be coming back when I'm craving soup!"
1/1/2017,4 star rating,"Excellent, solid beef soup. So stocky and homey. We ordered mixed, so it came with all thin slice cut of beef and intestine stuff along with transparent noodle.I just dumped the rice in the soup and added a little salt and a ton of green onion and go to town. Perfect to start a day. Small, hole in the wall restaurant but super fast and friendly service. Whatever we asked for, came out momentarily. Cash only. Parking in the back."
1/3/2019,5 star rating,"I've been coming to Han Bat Shul Lung Tang for almost a decade now and every time the soup has been consistently delicious.Everything from the soup to the side dishes is amazing. I like it with an abundance of scallions and both with no salt and a bit of salt, so I would recommend trying it with no salt first just to get a taste of how rich the broth is. I also usually ask for extra noodles since I'm not a huge rice fan!Must try!"
5/28/2020,5 star rating,This place has been around for a long time. The meat soup with glass noodles tastes so good with the radish kimchi. Simple and filling...can't go wrong.
12/27/2018,4 star rating,"Take this review with a grain of salt as I'm no expert in Korean food.  They only have two dishes with different selections of meat on their menu.  Me bring me, I ordered the mixed meat.  Food comes out literally in 2 minutes.  We get pickled radish and and homemade kimchi with a bowl of rice. The soup comes out pretty bland.  You have to add a little salt to bring out the flavors.  All in all it's a decent meal.  The place was full of who I guess are ""Koreans"".  Not something I would eat regularly but if the Koreans love it and give it 4 1/2 stars I can't be too bad."
8/16/2017,5 star rating,"Their kimchi is absolutely amazing!! The broth is very obvious that it has been boiling for more than just a couple of hours. I absolutely love how you have the option to adjust how salty or not you would like your soup. What amazed me the most is the speed at which they served. Within a couple of minutes, your meal is out! Definitely satiated a hungry tummy  would definitely come back here again"
6/24/2017,4 star rating,"Took 5min to pick up a call-in order. Total wait time: 15 min. I live next door so this was awesome.As they say. It is simple. Its perfect if you're craving for something not so overwhelming. Also, they give you salt to add yourself. And love the amount of kimchi they give for takeout. Would be back"
9/4/2018,5 star rating,"The best sul lung tang in LA!! It's so milky and rich and comforting and mmmm I want a bowl of it right now. I love that they give you a big ol' bucket of green onions you can scoop from. I love love love their kimchi, minus the fact that there was a hair chopped into smaller pieces in it. I didn't care too much though, it's so good and the place is run by a few stressed older ladies who I didn't want to bother so I just picked em out . Plus, it was a one time thing. My kimchi was hairless the other times I've went HAHA... There can be a wait, but the food and service is super quick so you shouldn't have to wait too long. Anyway, I feel like I don't have much else to say since this place is already so famous and highly acclaimed, so I'll stop here!"
12/17/2018,5 star rating,"If a restaurant only has 2 menu items, you can guess it's going to be legit. The service was warm, friendly and efficient - especially as it was a Saturday night and there's no official waitlist (it's based on the honor system of who arrived first). Had the brisket sullungtang and it was probably the most flavorful sullungtang I've had in my life. Heard the quality used to be even better so I can only imagine what it would have been like.....Come here if you want no frills, authentic Korean food. Don't come here if you like variety of menu items or banchan but trust me, what they give you will be more than you could ask for."
2/21/2017,2 star rating,"For whatever reason, I had this place bookmarked, was only aware that they served soup, but nothing more. We were a block away and starving, so we stopped here. I hadn't read the reviews but it seemed to be a favorite. Well, what a waste of our trip to Koreatown. The soup is totally tasteless and small. The brisket was good enough quality, but very little of it and not much noodles either. I spent the entire time trying to flavor my own soup (Is that the point?). I added a handful of scallions, kept adding salt, I even poured some of the flavor from the kimchi in there. I finally started to taste a bit of the ox bone broth. It was an interesting flavor, however it took a lot of work to get there. I appreciated the different cultural food experience, but it absolutely was NOT worth it. Maybe I just don't get it. It was over $10 + tax, cash for one order. Some reviews here say it's nice to have on a cold, rainy day. There aren't many of those in LA. Skip this place and grab some coffee or tea instead. Or go find some spicy Korean soup, pho, or hotpot. Anything else. You have many options. Find something else and don't fall into the trap like we did! If you're not convinced.. this place is not as cute and fun as some other places in the area. Customer service is also worse than most places. They also forget to serve you drinks."
2/2/2017,5 star rating,"Perfect comfort food!! This place is tucked into a small part of K-town. There's a good amount of seating inside. There were plenty of workers to get food out and people seated quickly. The menu consists of different meats for your ox bone soup. The options are; mixed, beef brisket, flank, intestine tripe spleen and tongue. You start off with 2 banchan. One is spicy kimchi and the other is kakdugi. I ordered the beef brisket one because I wasn't ready to get adventurous quite yet LOL the soup plain but there is salt, green onions and pepper paste for you to flavor it according to your preferences. It was sooo good, I need another bowl soon! Next time, I'd want to try one of the mixed soups!! I'll be back for ya!"
9/14/2017,5 star rating,"BEST thing for cold days!Need your soup fix? This is the place for you. Menu super simple, sul lung tang for the soul. If its your first time there, I would get the brisket - super simple and no complications if you don't like tripe, tongue, etc. It's like pho, when you would only get the flank. One order of soup comes with a side of rice and side of kkakduji (radish kimchi) & kimchi for the table. Their kimchi is not as fermented as my liking but for those who loves fresh kimchi, you'll love it!PRO TIP: add a heap load of green onions, a tad bit of salt, and white pepper cause the soup is unseasoned and will taste bland if you don't!"
1/28/2020,5 star rating,"This is place is so delicious , I've lived in ktown for 9 years and  have been coming here since. This place is legit a hole in the wall and The broth is very simple  but amazing!Customer service is great as well! At first I did feel a bit out of place, since it's a Korean restaurant so it's to expect to see Koreans , ya know? Nonetheless been going for years and If you're going for the first time I recommend getting the brisket soup, simple but delicious."
3/19/2018,4 star rating,"If you want to try a really traditional Korean beef soup then this is the right place for you.The menu is very simple only have 5-6 choice, I choose the mixed which basically have everything in the soup, and I think this is really the best one for me."
1/24/2019,5 star rating,"Best spot for traditional Korean oxtail soup. Why go anywhere else when that's their specialty and the only thing on the menu? You can choose from different meat add-ons. I personally do the brisket. It's comfort food for me, so I'm willing to deal with the crazy parking and lines for this place. I've tried this soup at other spots but they just don't hit the spot like this place."
10/28/2018,5 star rating,"My new favorite place for shul lung tang! This restaurant is kind of a hole in the wall, but it is really popular! We went (party of 3) on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait surprisingly enough. The menu is really straightforward, soup with a type of beef of your choosing. We all went with the beef brisket, and it was definitely the right choice! The brisket was melt in your mouth soft. The soup was very flavorful (tip: add lots of salt!), and the kimchi was super yummy and came in large portions at a time. The waiters were also very friendly and constantly restocked our kimchi. This is an amazing place to get shul lung tang! Highly recommend!"
10/23/2014,5 star rating,Wow! It doesn't look like much. Food Wise and the look of the place look old but thats where it will fool you. Wow! The food was really really good.I had the beef tongue soup. Its just basic beef soup with glass like noodles and slices of beef tongue. But wow was it good. I will be coming back. I dropped my rice in the soup added some sea salt and a little bit of chili paste all available on the table. I saw some of the regular do this and it turned an amazing soup into an even more amazing soup.

8/5/2016,3 star rating,"I had high expectations coming here since my Korean friend recommended this place & stated that this was his go. Overall, I was underwhelmed by the food and would prefer a bowl of Pho instead (this is the Vietnamese in me talking). I really appreciate how quick and attentive the staff is here! Our food arrived quick and I love that they offer an endless amount of Kimchi! The soup was too bland for my tasting and I found myself adding a lot of Salt & Chili Sauce to spice up the flavor. This place is worth checking out if you need something to cure your hangover. Cash only as well!"
1/2/2018,5 star rating,The rich BROTH was the real deal!  They only serve Shul lung tang and they do that extremely well with efficiency and excellent service.  Hole-in-the-wall place with $2 valet parking but we went around noon and left the place in 30 min.  Would be returning for sure!
2/25/2019,5 star rating,Best choice in cold rainy weather. Best beef soup. Will recommend it to anyone loves soup

8/26/2019,5 star rating,"You can never go wrong with this place. The concept is so simple, you pretty much pick which meat you want with your sul lung tang. Service is really fast. After you order the soup will come out within 2-5 minutes. I ordered the soup with everything in it and the one with brisket only. The soup is bland, but there's salt on the table, so make sure you use that. If they don't give you green onions then make sure to ask and put a buttload of it. Trust me it'll make the soup taste even better. They only give you 2 banchans (kimchi and radish) but both are so good. Make sure you eat your rice, soup, and banchan at the same time. The portion is good only for one person. Do not share, unless you're planning to eat somewhere else after. The line gets pretty long so make sure to come before or after their peak hours. If you come during peak hours, don't be disheartened, the ladies that work there move pretty fast so just stay put and they'll get to you in no time."
3/8/2019,5 star rating,"If you're looking for a hot, healthy, deep soup, this is a good place to try. I ordered the Brisket Soup and it was filled with a decent amount of brisket, very little Japchae noodles and a lot of soup served in a stone bowl. It's good as is but if you like it a little salty and spicy like I do, you can just add some sea salt and chili paste. Only minus for me and not really a big deal is that you only get 2 banchan (side dishes) and the kimchi was a bit sweet for my tastes. Next time, I will order an extra portion of brisket and bring my mom, too!"
11/12/2016,4 star rating,"The soup here is sooooo good. I've been eating college dining hall food for like 2 months now and this was just what I needed. UCLA food is great but I miss food that tastes more homemade. I added like 5 spoonfuls of spicy paste and a pinch of salt, and it was made the soup flavorful enough for me to enjoy. It is on the more bland side though, so it's not everyone's thing. While I really enjoyed this experience, I probably won't come back for a while since I live far away and I do prefer more flavorful Korean food. Either way it was still a great experience!!!"
10/28/2019,5 star rating,I'm ALWAYS in ktown whenever I come out to LA and I can't believe I've never been here before. I think I found a new hole in the wall! Definitely one of the best sul lang tangs I've tried. The soup was bomb and food came out fast! Definitely can't beat that when in ktown.
7/2/2018,5 star rating,"Sul lung tang has been and continues to be my favorite Korean soup.  Basically, I grew up with sul lung tang being the answer to all sicknesses as a child and to all my hangovers as an adult.I've heard so much about it from family and friends and have been wanting to try this spot.  I was finally able to stop by on a Sunday before noon.  There was a line but it moved quickly as most people devour their food and leave.  This is not a good spot for a large group trying to hangout because there isn't a lot of space and the food comes out almost instantly.There is a lot in the back of the building.  It isn't big, but make sure you check there before you try your luck with street parking."
3/7/2017,5 star rating,"What a gem - this is the best sul lung tang I've ever had (and I've had a good number before already)! Very cheap for AMAZING soup!The sul lung tang broth is incredibly fragrant and you can tell it's been cooked forever. You get a good amount of meat inside and the meat is incredibly tender and soft. I love their side dishes of kimchi and radish (the radish is my fav!). The soup came out within 5-10 min of us ordering, which is super quick.Absolutely perfect on a cold day! Worth every single $, and I will def be coming back next time I'm in LA!"
3/3/2019,5 star rating,"I don't like it at all but all my Asian friends say this is even better than back home so I guess it's good. Ugly inside, staff not the friendliest"
1/12/2020,5 star rating,"This is what you call hole-a-wall comfort food !!! I've been going here all my life.. they serve soup,rice, green onion, two types of kimchi. They also serve different meat plates. If you want real comfort food this place is it!!!"
6/26/2017,4 star rating,"HAN BAT SUL LUNG TANG is Korean's answer to ramen and pho. We love the seokum (mixed) soup of tripe, intestine, spleen, and tongue. This hearty ox bone  broth comes with the little side dishes of kimchee, extra salt and green onions. The ambiance is simple blank white walls and table. Maybe some would call it a hole in the wall kind of place but don't let that put you off. It's all about the food and it's very good! There is a small parking lot behind the store, street metered parking in front of the store, as well as in the neighborhood. It's in Koreatown, so expect to spend some time circling around for parking unless you're one of those people with awesome parking karma."
6/16/2016,3 star rating,"To be honest, I had higher expectations for this place, but I thought it was just ok! Maybe because I am comparing it to my favorite sul lung tang place in Boston, or maybe it was just the particular night we went.. but the soup wasn't as rich and delicious as I've had it before!Don't get me wrong, it still definitely satisfied my ox bone soup craving, but I have had better. They specialize in only soups here, so don't come looking for any meats/bbq!Their menus are posted on the wall, and you choose your soup and your meat. Very simple and to the point! We got a brisket and a flank sul lung tang. They give you a big container of green onions, so go crazy if you want! There is also salt and pepper on the side, for you to season to your liking.The milky broth comes with glass noodles and your meat choice. And each comes with a bowl of rice. I love eating the soup with the rice and sometimes dump the rest of my rice in it. Also unlimited kimchi and radish kimchi. SO GOOOD**CASH ONLY and parking lot in the back!"
5/15/2019,4 star rating,"Pretty light food, a different way to try Korean foodRice and boiling meat. Don't go there if you are expecting BBQ lol"
2/24/2017,4 star rating,"This place is a solid 4 star (2017/1/16). It was exciting to visit a place with a focus on one dish. As I've grown up in an environment where nobody goes to a restaurant if it serves a little bit of everything all ""mediocre"", this type of restaurants always gets my attention. As soon as you see the milky soup and smell the flavor, you'll be thankful. This is it. You are supposed to add some salt/kimchi/jian to it based on your individual preference. I didn't grow up with this dish, but I thought this was a true luxury comfort food. You don't get this soft taste with depth without hours of careful cooking. I'll definitely come back."
1/26/2019,3 star rating,"My friends and I walked in around 7:00pm and there was a line, however they know how to get their patrons in and out, quick. They are known for their ox-tail soup, and that's what you'll get (as does everyone else). Within 5 minutes of putting in our order, we had our food. The soup is completely bland, you will need to customize it by adding salt, pepper, and spring onions. It is bliss to have this heart filling dish on a cold, chilly night. The also give kimchi and pickled spicy radish as side dishes. I give this place a 3 out of 5 stars because of the food to price ratio. I wasn't completely satisfied leaving because I still felt a little hungry. You walk into this mom and pop shop with an expectation for what you want and you leave with that expectation fulfilled.Located in Koreatown, notoriously known for bad parking. This little restaurant has a FREE parking lot behind with a decent number of spots!"
1/25/2019,1 star rating,"Used to like this place. Was excited to order 3 soups to go when I was visiting LA. They gave me a tiny container for green onions. Guess what when I asked for if I can have another one since I ordered 3 soup? They said I need to pay $1 just for a tiny container of green onions! I never really wrote reviews and this is my first ever 1 start review. ""Great Job"" Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. Guys if you want to have a good mood while eating, avoid this place!"
7/29/2018,5 star rating,"My partner and I were looking for a healthier options post our workout and we stumbled on Han Bat Shul Lung Tang while looking on yelp so we thought we'd give a try. Like many other reviews have noted, parking can and probably will be an issue. Luckily, we were able to find street parking fairly fast. Once you walk in, you'll be greeted, asked how many are in your party, and if you're on the wrong side of the restaurant, they will ask  you to go to the other side where the waiting area is located.  The menu is fairly simple and is posted at every table. We ended up ordering Salgogi (Beef Brisket) and Yangji (Flank) which was very delicious! I've only had this type of soup from another Korean restaurant and can confidently say that Han Bat Shul Lung Tang compares far better. The soup is well developed. Their kimchi and fermented radish are amazing and goes very well with the soups and rice. The price point is great for what you get. I definitely plan on coming back and recommending this place to friends. I can't wait to come back especially when the weather is cold."
4/30/2018,5 star rating,"This place has the BEST seollongtang ever. My boyfriend, who is korean, took a bite of this seollongtang and said that was the BEST he had ever tasted. And he spent most of his childhood in Korea so he has them high standards that I trust. It was so good we came here for dinner one day and shared one bowl. Then the next day for breakfast we came back and each got our own bowl because it was so good we didn't want to share with each other LOL. We tried the mixed the first time but ended up liking just the brisket from that, so we went with the brisket the second time. I ate here sick with a sore throat and headache -  cured. I ate here hungover from drinking soju - cured. This soup is a complete miracle worker. I would hands down choose this option over pho to cure any sickness or fatigue, and I am heartbroken that sd does not have anything like this. + Free parking in a lot behind the place **UPDATE** they got valet parking service now...rip+ Unlimited green onion from a huge tub, make sure to pour in while the soup is hot+ Season your soup with 1-2 spoonfuls of salt+ Radish & reg kimchi provided (both really good) can also use to flavor the soup+ Service is friendly, attentive, very quick, but you are not rushed+ Not sure what was going on for me but they took card"

I was traveling solo in my recent trip, and I decided just to go there myself (end up sharing a table with a ajjussi). You would be surprised that there were still people lining up at 9pm here-maybe not, but hey, that's how good this place is! Here is parking in the back and the line also starts at the door on the side entering from the parking lot, if you are coming from the door on facing the street, make sure to cross the restaurant and line up there (if there's a line). I love everything about this place, I love the soup, I love the kimchi, I love the raddish, I love the green onions, I love how ajummas are super friendly, also I love how this place accepts credit cards :D"

9/12/2018,5 star rating,"Han Bat Shul Lung Tang is a prime example of an Asian hole-in-the-wall that serves up awesome food. In this instances it's seolleongtang. Yes, they take credit card!First thing to note, this soup is not sundubu jjigae (spicy tofu soup). It doesn't come spicy and salty to the table. This soup is mild and milky. You are supposed to use the sea salt, black pepper, chilli paste/powder, and chopped green onion at the table to enhance the flavor. In my case, I use a ton of green onion.Although the napa cabbage kimchi is good, the kkakdugi (radish kimchi) is amazing here. Trust me when I say, seolleontang, white rice, and kkakdugi is all you need after a hard night of drinking.You're welcome."

10/29/2019,4 star rating,"Best Sul Lung Tang I've ever had. I got the combo ($13.95) soup that comes with beef, tripe, some blood, and other random assortments. The broth is nice and creamy and basically unseasoned. There's salt on the side of the table that you can put in. They also provide you with a nice bowl of yummy green onions to your hearts content. There are also bits of clear glass noodles in the soup as well as a bowl of rice. The meal comes with kimchi radishes and regular kimchi. I love when the kimchi is strong and flavorful which contrasts the creaminess of the soup well. I do wish there was a bit more variety of side dishes but I guess I can't complain. My only knock on this place is that the portions aren't huge. As in if you eat a lot, you'll be full from the soup but then get hungry again. I'm glad I tried this place as it is the best but i can't leave a place feeling like I'll be hungry shortly after. I don't know if I would come back unfortunately but like i said, no regrets. The ladies serving us were also very friendly too so that was a nice plus."

2/1/2019,5 star rating,I always go here often when i get sick.  After eating i always feel much better.  The heat and the filling bowl really hits the spot.
12/2/2017,5 star rating,Great comfort food very simple. And TKOs a cold. The brisket is my go to unless i want to change it by ordering the mix.
7/18/2020,5 star rating,"If you're looking for food that will hit the spot during a cold day, this place will do it. Serving the most milky tastey bone broth soup with brisket and on top add their side kimchi's it's will satisfy any cravings. Make sure to order extra takeout as they're good for several days."
8/14/2018,4 star rating,Can't go wrong with this place! Soups are amazing and very authentic. It's one of my faves for Korean comfort soup.. service is fast! I was out of there in 30 mins satisfied...
8/23/2018,5 star rating,"Best daikon! So crunchy, delicious, and amazing! The kimchee was good, a bit of a tangy, citrus, spice. Wished they allowed you to purchase the daikon! We went through 3-4 dishes of the daikon it was that good! The broth is also amazing, plain, but good. Definitely something I crave and would go back to. I had the beef brisket and the meet was tender, broth - flavorful, and loved the bean thread noodles inside!"
1/26/2019,5 star rating,"Hands down the best sul lung tang ever. I got the mixed and my bf got the oxtail sul lung tang. You put your own seasoning of salt and pepper how ever you want. I usually also put in the radish kimchi sauce, and it makes it soooooo good. It's a very filling meal, and we both chowed it down so fast. Putting a lot of green onion is also sooooo good. Their service is very very fast and really nice. They understand enough english to get everything down. Absolutely love this place."
2/17/2017,5 star rating,It's probably the best place to get a bowl of sul lung tang in Koreatown. It's definitely a no frills place and only has 2 types of kimchi - cabbage and daikon to accompany your soup. Probably one of my go to's on cold rainy days.Cons - There's a small parking lot in the back. Cash only.
2/22/2020,5 star rating,Always come back to this place on a rainy day and need something comforting! Best beef bone soup in LA!
11/18/2018,5 star rating,"Tiny little place that makes sullung tang and it's soooooooo good. Service was fast, the radish was delicious, we got the mixed sullung tang and it was good! They hooked it up with a free bowl of soup and rice for my toddler first so we could feed her before our food came out. I'd definitely come back when in Ktown"
9/2/2018,5 star rating,"I tried out this hole in the wall a few months ago and we probably eat there once a week now. A simple setting with a delicious and soothing bone broth. We put 1 teaspoon on salt, 3 big spoonfuls of green onions, 2 teaspoons of chili paste and pepper. It's so yummy. It never disappoints.The kimchi is delicious!"
8/25/2018,4 star rating,"Really good authentic Korean food, that's perfect for when you have a cold or hangover! I got the beef brisket soup and my boyfriend got the mix. Our food came with fresh kimchi and a bowl of white rice. There's salt and green onions at the table that you can add to your soup which is a MUST! We liked to dip the rice in the soup too. Great little place in ktown, and will be coming back soon!"
10/18/2020,5 star rating,I can't believe it took this long for me to finally write this review..I have been enjoying their food for about 15 years...this has to be the best korean sul long tang place of all time. Their broth is rich and so flavorful...also comes with rice and 2 kinds of kimchee. I always get double on the radish instead of the regular kimchee..it's delicious!  During pandemic they only do takeouts. Service is fast..so I order 10 minutes before and it's always ready when I get there. If you are in the mood for korean sul long tang..beef soup..try this place. I hope you will love it as much as I do..
6/9/2018,5 star rating,"How have I not reviewed this place before?! My friend first took me here back in college and it was my first time trying sul lung tang. I came back recently and it's definitely a favorite among our friend group, especially for post hangover blues haha There's a small parking lot in the back which I've been fortunate enough to get spots every time. I always get the brisket soup. You have to add in your own salt, pepper and green onions so you can customize to your taste. Some people also like adding in the radish juice from the panchan but I prefer it without it. Their kimchi here is also spot on. LOVE IT! There's nothing flashy about this place but the ladies are so nice and it makes you feel very homey. The soup is hearty because the broth has a lot of flavor you but definitely never leave feeling sick. One of my favorite spots in LA. 100% would recommend."
1/30/2017,5 star rating,"The PERFECT hangover cure.Nothing like a bowl of delicious, warm sul lung tang after a night of drinking.Their kimchi and gakdoogi is the perfect compliment to the simple, comforting bowl of soup.The food comes out crazy fast since it's the only thing the restaurant specializes in.It's fast, delicious and consistent, what more can you ask for?The only bad thing I can think of about this place is that it's cash only but I totally understand it since it is so cheap and family owned :)"
10/29/2020,5 star rating,I love this place!!  Their sulrangtang reminds me of home!!  I especially like their radish kimchi.  it's my favorite place in ktwon.
8/15/2017,5 star rating,"This is a small hole in the wall spot with quick service, a simple menu, and quality food.We came here with a party of 5 on a Friday afternoon at lunchtime, painlessly parked in the lot at the rear, and were promptly seated and served. I ordered the brisket ox bone soup and it was superb. The broth is light yet flavorful. It comes unsalted -- allowing you to add flavors to suit your own taste. I personally load up on the scallions, then add a bit of sea salt, some black pepper and a scoop of chili paste (which isn't too spicy imo). I also add half my rice in there and let it soak up some flavor from the broth. What a nourishing meal that left my tummy super content."
4/11/2016,4 star rating,"Felt like eating something healthy yesterday and decided to come here. They have a parking lot in the back, which is super convenient in Ktown! Sul Lung Tang is good at any time of the day. I love their rich broth and the high quality meat. Honestly I don't even need to add additional seasoning to the soup (although most people do prefer to add it), I really appreciate the rich bone taste in every sip. My favorite is the Mixed one so you get to try different kinds of meat. The intestine was delicious!Their kimchi is not bad since it's absolutely home made. I love love love the radish though, it's also good to add some radish juice in the broth to make it even more amazing. Service is great, it gets busy sometimes, but they're really fast with everything."
7/2/2016,5 star rating,"All the hype that you hear about this place is REAL. I've come here about 6 times in the past year, and every time, it's worth the drive from wherever I'm at. The place itself isn't that great looking. They could make a big splash if they hired an interior designer, but all that doesn't matter when their food is AMAZING.Han Bat does one thing, but it does it incredibly well, and that's make Sul Lung Tang. Nothing else I've ever had beats it. I always get the Tongue order, and to me, that's the best thing on the menu. It's interesting how this place can actually be that good, because half of the flavor the customer decides themselves. Tip: Don't bother getting the $20 worth of extra meat. The meat that comes in your bowl will be plenty, unless you have actual starving bears for restaurant-mates."
6/12/2016,3 star rating,"Last time I visited, I noticed their health grade got downgraded to a B. This always makes me feel instantly icky. Also, in the last 3 years I've visited, they increased their price twice. I just feel like the humble, hole in the wall place I fell in love with is losing its charm. It's yummy, but there are plenty of other great sullungtang places in K-town that are cleaner, cheaper with better parking."
8/22/2018,5 star rating,"We happened on this hole in the wall in KTown when we were crawling through traffic, got hungry, and Yelp'ed this a block away from where we were. It was everything we needed at the moment. Warm home cookin', sweet waitresses who saw that we were struggling and helped us figure out how to eat the ONE thing on their menu (they only make ox bone soup with your choice of beef), and a relaxed, unpretentious environment that welcomed our exhausted bones. Everything about it was quick, soothing, and heartwarming. There's parking in the back! And we were in and out in 30 minutes."
4/9/2018,5 star rating,Fast and efficient serviece and delicious sul lung tang. One of my favorite spots for sul lung tang.

Overrated?I'd comeback, but probably only if I were to be hungover or sick to be honestTips: park in the backService is quickEnglish is poorYou get soup with meat or meat with soup for double the $ you pick..."
2/8/2019,5 star rating,"The go-to place for Korean comfort soup. They have parking in the rear, which is super hard to come by in these parts of town. Fast service. Great food. Clean restroom. Friendly environment. Only downside is the price."
5/31/2016,4 star rating,"We found this place via Yelp. I have to say that I'd never have walked in otherwise. It was a hole in the wall, not super clean looking, and poorly ventilated. We were greeted with the pungent smell of kimchi ..which ranks right up there with durian. Funky.They basically do only one thing here, and they do it damn well. Broth. Order whatever, but make sure you drink the broth. It ranks among the best ox bone soup that I've ever tasted. It might taste bland to some, but this is ox bone soup in it's purest form - unsalted, clean and light. I have to say that it could have come with more ingredients in the soup, but I was very happy with the broth itself, and that was enough to negate it.It was roughly $10USD a bowl, but it appears that the prices have gone up a couple of times...looking at older photos in Yelp, the menu prices were different. Don't you just love inflation?"
12/11/2018,5 star rating,This place is a tiny treasure that can easily be missed. It's absolutely delicious. No BS.
11/25/2016,4 star rating,"When you go to a restaurant and they have less then 10 items on their menu in addition to +1,000 reviews of high star ratings.. You know its going to be bomb. I came with a party of 4 on a Tuesday night.. And believe it or not... There was a wait. We were seated asap as the servers were all older korean ladies that did not waste any time, which was a definite plus. We ordered 3 sullungtang with brisket and 1 sullungtang mixed. The food came out fast.. We ate it faster. The broth and meat was good. I couldnt really taste that much difference compared to a local sullungtang place back in the OC. The radish kimchi and kimchi was good as well. Service was better than most places as older korean lady servers are not known for the ""best"" service according to American standards.Not all of us were fully satisfied and this place wasn't amazing, but overall I enjoyed my experience here. It wasnt worth $10 though as I know other places that are cheaper that has a similar taste.."
12/9/2018,5 star rating,"This is probably the best Shul-Lung-Tang I have ever had. The broth is rich and creamy with oh so much depth! (Add salt to taste).The service is quick and to the point. You basically come here to get one thing but the difference is what selection of ""meat"" you decide on. I went to for the ""mixed"" selection. The kimchi was legit as well which is a huuuuuuuuge plus!Parking can be challenging on a busy night as the small lot of about 20 spots is in the rear. If not careful the alley can be easily missed. There was also a security guard posted on the lot.Overall - This spot is highly rated for a reason. The food is legit! The service is awesome! And it always hits the spot! If you're looking for the Korean's hang over cure equivalent to Mexican style Menudo or Vietnamese style Pho, this is it. Rainy days or hung-over mornings have no chance!"
2/24/2020,4 star rating,Really enjoyed the sul lung tang here. Didn't know what the hype was all about because the line was crazy but for reals it was bomb.
12/7/2018,3 star rating,Tried the place for the first time and really liked it. Small and food comes out quickly. Definitely have to add a lot of salt because it is under seasoned (as it should be). Very friendly people and the do have parking in the back although I found a place to park right in front. Tip: easy to miss so drive slowly when you get close to the addressTip: you can mix a bunch of meats for the same price which is nice.
1/29/2019,5 star rating,"The best hangover soup in my life. I have been going there since I moved to LA five years ago. Their taste never change and It is only soup I think about when I am dying from hangover lol. Their servers are so experienced and friendly. Also, their menu is so simple you don't even have to think about it. Sometimes it is little busy and I have to wait little but I don't really mind."
7/18/2020,5 star rating,Best Sul Lung Tang around. It's a great lil mom and pop joint that I've been going to for years. I love that it's quick and convenient and makes me feel good when I'm feeling under the weather.
2/20/2018,2 star rating,"I'm in the minority on this review. The soup was very bland. I understand the beef soup base is supposed to be a blank canvas, allowing you to adjust the sodium level to your liking as a means of adding flavor, but I thought the soup was coming up short on the beef flavor. For all their soups, it's the exact same soup base, the only difference is the type of meat ranging from brisket, flank, tongue, intestine/trip to mixture of all meats. The size of the bowl is on the smaller side, as well as the amount of brisket. We ordered 3 soups for 4 people since my mom was going to share with my sisters, but they only brought out 3 servings of rice. They charged us $2 for an extra bowl of rice, which I thought was a bit greedy, but not a big deal as I don't plan to be back. There is a parking lot in the back."
1/14/2017,4 star rating,"I am a fan of Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. Coming from Toronto, there are not many places in Canada that can replicate this authentic Korean dish.dugi (rI ordered the salgogi (beef) and it was delicious, simple, and heart-warming. Great soup for a hangover!It comes with a side bowl of rice, and various kimchis. Kakkdugi (radish kimchi) was crunchy, fresh, and not too spicy.If you are adventurous enough to try the mix sul lang tang with lung, heart, and other organs, go for it! My friend said it was delicious !Prices are fair, around $10 for each soup."
1/27/2019,2 star rating,Used to be great. Unfortunately much like ktown this place has followed suit and is just over priced and just mediocre. The soup has gotten watery and the meat quality has seriously dipped. What used to be tender and flavorful is now chewy and bland.
12/28/2018,5 star rating,"This place is as straightforward and perfect as it gets. For out-of-towners or people looking for a date spot, know what you're walking into. This place isn't fancy, but it does have this hole in the wall, ktown rustic, romantic feel.  So come here if you want a feel for that Old school Koreatown.  It's not a big place, but actually there's a good amount of seating.If youve never had sullungtang, you gotta add salt to taste and green onions.  It's not meant to be eaten without those added by you.  when it comes to kimchi options, it's preferable to go with the radish kimchi rather than the cabbage kimchi when it comes to this meal."
1/24/2020,5 star rating,Best soup ever. However I did not like the fact the server chased me down for a tip. Not cool.
1/24/2019,3 star rating,"I was very excited to try this place, but it didn't do it for me. The flavor was lacking in the broth. The brisket, kimchi and rice were good. The service was definitely great and very fast. Parking in rear was $2. Overall not enough for me to go back though since LA is full of other places."
5/1/2018,5 star rating,Broth is on point. Hearty comfort korean food and their food is consistently good. Perfect for getting over sickness or a hangover. Highly recommend.
12/24/2019,4 star rating,"came here last night with my best friend because it was cold and rainy and we were craving something hot and soupy -- han bat sul lung tang hit the spot! We came in and it was already quite crowded; it's a small restaurant (only one bathroom and there was a queue for that as well) but service was quick! despite the line, we were seated fairly quickly and the food came before I even came back from the bathroom. The food itself was good; thought it was a lil pricy for the portions (as quality broth normally is) -- like people have mentioned; the house made kimchi here is a strength. also, there was no sign up sheet so the lines for the bathroom and the line to eat got a bit confusing at times."
2/15/2020,5 star rating,"Love this place. Worth the drive from San Fernando Valley! We get the brisket soup, and always get extra Kimchi! Service is fast, great customer service, and will always be comfort food."

5/26/2018,2 star rating,"I don't really understand why they have so many reviews. I was so excited to come here for lunch. I was seated immediately upon arrival, placed an order and food came within five minutes. I ordered the beef brisket soup. I was so disappointed by this. There was no flavor in the soup and there was barely any substance/ meat inside. Only until you reach the very last few bites did it taste substantially better, but then you're out of soup. It was like all the flavor just sank to the bottom. I left dissatisfied. I probably wouldn't come here again and am sad I wasted a trip to ktown for this."
7/10/2019,5 star rating,"Great food, it warmed our souls. I'm not a huge Korean food fan but this spot seemed authentic. Service is friendly. Staff was smiling and gave us helpful suggestions. Parking was a nightmare bit that's hardly their fault. 5/5"
1/16/2020,5 star rating,"No nonsense place, maybe 8 to 10 items on the menu.  We got a few different meats in the soup to go, and it was freaking delicious.  Clientele appears mostly Korean (good sign), and there is limited parking out back."
8/4/2014,4 star rating,"My parents wanted to grab breakfast here, somewhere I had found on them for Yelp awhile back. We got there shortly after they opened on Saturday (7:45 AM!). It's in a bit of a dumpy plaza (typical for K-Town) with a bum sleeping out front. As we walked in through the back as the parking lot is located there, I saw the waitress with a fly swatter. Oh dear. There was only one other party occupied in the fairly small restaurant (probably holds 40 people max). We sat down at a table and given a huge pot of sliced green onions. The menu is minimal, for what they are known best. Sul lung tang and soo yuk (another type of beef stew). You have an option of types of meat you want. My parents got a little bit of everything, while I got the brisket meat only. Each bowl is $9.84 plus tax. We were given 2 dishes of the radish kimchee and a dish of regular kimchee. Tasty, and not too spicy! Our bowls of rice were quickly followed by the sul lung tang. For those that want to enjoy the soup at its fullest, no salt is needed, but I need more flavor so I added salt, pepper, and some of the spicy paste to make it to my liking. It was really good, broth was rich with flavor from all the meat, and could've used a little more noodles to make it perfect. I ended up not eating any of the meat and gave some to my parents, but they made it look so yummy, I had a few pieces. It was perfectly tender and full of flavor.The only annoying thing was these dang flies would not leave us alone. The one waitress finally closed the doors and turned on the AC, but they continued to bother us. A lot of people started to saunter in for to go orders or to eat in the restaurant as we were near done with our meal. I offered to pay but when I noticed they were cash only (and NO atm machine inside) I couldn't pay. Hopefully people know they take cash only so they're prepared when they come in for a late night meal or early morning breakfast."
2/1/2017,5 star rating,"I was craving Korean food because I had landed in LA from NJ earlier in the day so my friend brought me to Koreatown and recommended this place to me. Forget In-N-Out: I wanted Korean food that evoked memories of home. He told me that this place is known for its ox tail soup so I was very much looking forward to dinner.We took advantage of parking in the lot in the back and when we walked inside, the place was packed but there was no line. Fortunately, a group of 4 was just leaving as we arrived and the wait time was not even 5 minutes for my party of 5. The waitress was very accommodating and made sure the person on the end was not caught between the waiters/waitresses going in and out of the kitchen.I ordered the ox tail soup with only the brisket because I'm not a fan of the more exotic cuts of meat. The soup comes with noodles, a generous portion of meat, and was very rich. There is salt, pepper, and chopped scallions on the table so you can season your soup accordingly. I, being a lover of scallions, dumped a huge amount into my soup and at one point, my friend questioned whether I was eating ox tail soup with a side of scallions or scallions with a side of ox tail soup. Nonetheless, It absolutely HIT THE SPOT and I was a happy person after finishing my rice and soup. The kimchi and kkakdugi (cubished radish kimchi) that is served as banchan (side dish) were delicious too. Because we were a party of 5, we consumed these side dishes quickly and asked for a refill 2 times. Both times, the waitress was extremely friendly and smiled as she put down the new set of kimchi.Overall, I recommend this place if you are looking for something soupy or something to cure your hangover. I will definitely be back if I ever am in LA again."
12/15/2019,5 star rating,Hands down the best comfort food. They're open earlier in the morning too. A must after a night out or when you're sick. Kimchi's so bomb too.
9/17/2019,5 star rating,"This was my first meal in LA after landing, and I was super excited to try it out, since I saw the place on ""Worth It - Korean Soups"". The menu is super simple, but the hardest part was picking out the meat you want in your soup. I chose the Salgogi, which is the beef brisket. The service was super quick and friendly on a Tuesday Afternoon. It wasn't much long of a wait for the food, and the food came out super fast. The side dishes - Kimchi and Pickled Radish were AMAZING. I was truly shock on how fresh it was and it had a crunch and a little sourness to it! It was the best kimchi and pickled radishes I have ever had, since I'm from Seattle, and the side dishes here are okay and not too special. The soup of the Sul Lang Tang was super rich, and creamy. The broth was a little on the bland side for me, but after putting in kimchi juice, green onions and pepper, it worked out perfectly. The beef brisket was tender, and the soup had some glass noodles inside of it. I wish I had ordered the Seokum, which is the mixed, since I slowly got tired of the beef brisket. A HUGE plus for me was the meal was only $13.50!"
7/14/2016,5 star rating,"I have been wanting to try this place for so long and I'm glad I finally did!! They have a free parking lot in the back so don't worry about finding parking on the streets. The menu is fairly simple. You get to choose the kind of meat you want like the brisket or mixed. I went with the safer choice which was the brisket. Definitely did not disappoint. The soup was full of flavor and the brisket was nice and tender. My favorite part was the green onions. They give you a container on the table so you can add however you want to your liking. The only negative things would probably be the portion size. I thought $10 would come in a bigger size and more rice. And I do wish they would have more side dishes besides the kimchi and kimchi radish. Other than that, this place is worth the visit if you're looking for authentic comfort food!Oh and this place is cash only!"

You get the benefit of minerals and collagen and lots of water in soup. Other than that, beef bone soup is known to cure your upset stomach. This is a perfect hangover soup also. The soup come with rice, but you can tell them not to bring one. Also, since they pre-cook the soup long before it will be served, once you order you get your food within two minutes!!"

I like how they give you a giant plastic tub of chopped green onions that you can put into your soup. And I LOVE green onions!! And it comes with a bowl of white rice, chopped spicy daikon, and yummy kimchee! All for $8.72 + tax.Parking: You can park in the back for free.

It felt just like korea where famous restaurants only serve 1 thing (and really well)- this is what im talking about!We walked in and they asked us what type of meat we want in the soup and then 2 side dishes came out QUICKLY followed by our soups. They also brought my daughter (4 year old)- free soup with rice. The flavor had so much depth like they had the bones simmering in the soup for hours! Although I live 40 mins from here, this soup is def worth the drive.. especially when one has a cold. So glad I found this gem via yelp! Thanks, yelp!!"

2/17/2019,4 star rating,"I've never tried something new like this, i'm huge asian foods fan (who's not?) but Korean foods are the least kind of asian food that i've always craved for. But LA was wicked windy and we wanted something that is hot and soupy. Found this on yelp, looked legit so we went. People came here for the soups, i ordered the beef brisket & tongue soup (yummm). It came with white rice. The broth is very authentically broth tasted only, i don't think they put any salt or pepper in it, it tasted very healthy. But they have salt and pepper on the table so you can add as much as you want, it was good once you put it your own. The place wasn't too big and usually waiting isn't that long. The services were a little bit too long though. They could've paid more focus attention so that we can move out fast and the others that were waiting could have their seats. But yeah it was good."

1/21/2018,5 star rating,"I was in Beverly Hills by myself on Saturday and wanted to grab a bite and was craving for some korean food so I searched for a korean restaurant around the area. Han bat Shul Lung Tang popped up with amazing reviews so I decided to give it a try.There was a Carl's Jr. right across the street with parking so I decided to just park there even though there is parking in the back of the restaurant. When I entered, the restaurant was full and I can tell that it is an authentic korean with korean women as the servers. They asked me how many ppl and I said for 1 so they had me stand on the other end of the restaurant to wait for the table. The wait was about 5 minutes.This place is very very fast paced. Basically you get seated right when a table is open and cleaned and you order right away.From looking at yelp, I ordered the Brisket Shul Lung tang, seemed the most popular.Right away, they bring you some kimchi, daikon, white rice, and green onions. A couple minutes later, the soup comes out. I put as many green onions as I want and then they take the box of teen onions away and place it on the next table. As I tried the soup for the first time, it was pretty bland but there is salt on the table if you want to add the salt. They also have some chili paste as well. I decided to just eat it the way it was. I really enjoyed the whole meal, and I pretty much finished everything. It was comfort food for sure! When I was finished, they gave me my check and I paid right away and got up to leave.This is a very fast paced restaurant and there is no ""service"". You come here, order, eat, get out. So just know that when you come! I like definitely  come back!"
11/4/2016,3 star rating,Parking - private lot but generally full. weekdays you dont have to payWarning - this place has 2 main categories for menu. $10 for the soup and the 4 different flavors underneath and then a large boiled meat plate for $25The soup is more on the bland side and good if you are looking for something softer and if you are sick.  I really thought they would give you more food variety....Also you get unlimited kimcheee. BTW service was good though. just not the type of food that i liked.
7/17/2016,5 star rating,"Hands down, this is my most favorite sulungtang (ox bone soup) in the world. It is so simple yet so perfect at the same time. I always get the brisket sulungtang and ask for the radish kimchi multiple times. Both kimchi is delicious and goes perfectly with the soup. Make sure to mix the soup with a scoop of green onions and a little bit of salt beforehand.Their service is really really fast - perfect for this impatient, always ""hangry"" Korean. The only bad thing is that they only accept cash! Even if you don't have any cash, they have an ATM machine inside the restaurant now."
2/12/2019,5 star rating,"What is there to even say about this place? If you don't have HBSLT in your regular rotation, or even more frighteningly, haven't tried it before, you are seriously missing out!Let's start with parking - two words: free + lot. A rare attribute, especially for Koreatown. After parking, you'll join the perfectly straight line formed outside the door (no need to write your name down), and be seated in short order.HBSLT has essentially one item on the menu (soup, with beef of your choice), and executes it to perfection. After ordering, you'll be brought your food within 3 minutes (go ahead and count). This consists of your bowl of soup, beef, and glass noodles, and a bowl of rice. (The side dishes aren't worth mentioning, but it doesn't even matter). A tub of green onions will be brought to your table, and you'll use this, and the salt and pepper on the table, to season to taste.I like to make a ritual out of adding mounds of green onion, followed by the bowl of rice, then salt & pepper, and finally mixing it all together to form a beautiful bowl of bliss and harmony. The simplicity of it all, from the parking, to the ordering, to the service, to the food itself, means you can easily be in and out in 20 minutes if you happen to be short on time.All in all:Food: 5/5Service: 4.5/5Overall: 5/5Projected Return Frequency: 1-2x per month"
6/15/2016,5 star rating,"OH MY GOSH. This place is awesome! You need to go.Their sul lung tang is so good. Sul lung tang is ox bones that have been simmering in water for hours until the broth becomes milky. I've heard of some places that add milk to the broth to get the milky white consistency. Not that I've been into the kitchen of Han Bat, but I'm pretty sure they don't do this.The menu is very simple, and I hope they don't ever change. The name of the place has sul lung tang in it. If they start offering other things besides sul lung tang, then that's just wrong.You can choose from mixed, brisket, tongue, flank, and tripe/intenstine/spleen. Each soup comes with a bowl of rice and each table gets two side dishes: kimchi and kkakdugi (radish kimchi). The radish kimchi is my favorite to eat alongside this simple yet delicious soup. I've seen people dump the kimchi/radish kimchi/kimchi juice into the soup to flavor it up since they do not flavor it for you. Sul lung tang comes flavorless and you add in the salt and green onions that are on the table. Be careful not to overdo it on the salt. You can always add salt but you can't take away salt.Overall, if you're craving something that's comforting and delicious, check out Han Bat Sul Lung Tang!I'm craving this now that I've written a review for it..."
11/27/2017,5 star rating,"SOLID place for shul lung tang.  The food comes out quickly, tastes awesome, AND they give free portions to kids.  Parking can be a bit hard depending on when you go, but this place never lets you down."
12/28/2015,5 star rating,"Sul Lung Tang all day everyday! When we arrived, there was already a long line of people forming outside the back door. However, to my surprise, the line went by quickly and we were seated within 10 minutes.I ordered the mixed beef. FYI - the soup is bland, so you'll need to add your own salt, pepper and green onions. I enjoy the simplicity of this soup, so no complaints here. - CASH ONLY!- Small lot in the back for parking.- Line up in the back to get seated."
8/31/2019,5 star rating,"Came to pick up some sul lung tang to go. By the time we got home, the soup was still hot and flavorful. It is the perfect soup when you're sick. The Korean ""chicken soup for the soul"" basically. They also pack a lot of kimchee side cups and rice in the to go order so it's really a complete meal for just over $11."
1/18/2020,5 star rating,Very Good!! If you like Sul Lung Tang. You will get what you expect. The portion is  a little bit short because I tend to end up wanting slightly more soup.
12/21/2016,3 star rating,"Walked into the store and was seated immediately. As crowded as it was during 2:30 pm, I noticed that food arrives quickly, people eat quickly, and leave right after. It's quite nice to have some comfort food without having to wait long, at all. Salt, scallions, utensils, chili pepper paste, pepper are on the table, which we add into out soup according to our tastes. From looking at these previous reviews and posts, the white flaky particles are salt, not MSG lol. It just looked different! Felt lost and was wishing they had instructions on how to eat this (like at ramen places), HAH, since most of the time when I eat out, food seems to be just right in flavor already. I was hoping soup had more flavors but hey, I might just be a noob that does not know how to eat this, as this was my first experience. Although I do realize this ox bone soup is a specialty, something that takes time to make and has quality in itself, it's not something I would particularly go out of my way and die to have again. It might be an acquired taste that I have to achieve, sort of growing to like durian fruit which many people consider as terrible, or being able to eat pho  soup without adding Sriracha or hoisin sauce and finding it to be just right. Maybe over time, maybe..."

12/20/2016,5 star rating,LOVE LOVE this place!My bf and I first found this place when we visited LA back in 2014 and we had to come back again.Yummy food and good service.Pricing is good too. I love their BEEF BRISKET sul lung tang. Don't forget to add salt to it to give it extra little flavour.Also this place gets pretty busy. They do have a medium sized parking lot.
10/23/2015,5 star rating,"I had really good sul lung tang in Ktown New York and I have been always trying to find a good one in Los Angeles. Since I was sick this week, I was craving a warm bowl of sul long tang so bad. Found this place on Yelp, I was surprised how can a small place like this received so many good Yelp review and decided to give it a try. For people who don't know what is sul lung tang, it is Korean soup made from ox bones. The parking lot is in the back of the restaurant and you have to enter from a narrow street so it was kind of hard to find. Since I ordered togo, I did not see my food until home and I was surprised how big the portion is with $10 when I opened it.I ordered mixed (brisket, flank, intestine, tripe& spleen and tongue) sul lung tang and extra radish. It came with spicy sauce, green onions, kimchi, radish, rice and the soup. The soup was so rich even without adding any salt. Please noted that the soup is unflavored so you will have to add salt and red pepper sauce if you want to taste some flavor. The radish was to die for. It was so crispy and spicy. This was what I learned in Korean drama, they placed rice on the spoon, dipped with soup, added the spicy radish on top of the rice and ate the whole thing. I can definitely do this every week. I also add all the scallions to have more flavor. I will definitely come back here for some warm soup and refreshing radish. You get more than what you paid for here!"
11/12/2013,5 star rating,"Food: 5 starsPrice: 4 starsService: 4 starsBest Sul Lung Tang I've had! Around $9 for a bowl; portions are on the small side if you're coming here for dinner. It's a cute little restaurant located in Korea Town. The inside is very traditional looking and gives a comfortable casual vibe. Service is good enough, but they're often very busy so you might have to wave them down. I usually get the brisket sul lung tang, but the mixed is good too. Soup is very, very well flavored and you can tell by the creamy white color. Brisket is SO INCREDIBLY TENDER. I usually cannot finish meat in my soups, but here I was able to because it was so delicious! They also have a huge container full of green onions & another container full of good quality (sea?) salt that you can add yourself. What a bonus- I am a big fan of green onions and more times than I can count, restaurants are too stingy to give you the option of putting in as much as you want. I hear that Sul Lung Tang is an ""Ahjussi"" meal, but I bet it's because they know how good it is for you. :) I always feel super revitalized and healthy after a meal here. CASH ONLY!"
1/12/2020,4 star rating,"Good for the price, but even after adding in salt, green onion, and pepper, the broth was not beefy enough for me."
12/5/2015,4 star rating,"As I delve deeper and deeper in the world of Korean food, I came here with an open mind and an empty stomach. They bring you the broth and meat, and you take care of the rest. We had to salt our own bowls and add the onions. I, of course, added the hot sauce first and then the rest. The place has been here for years and is in no way, a good looker but the food is authentic and good. They take cash only and they do have valet parking in the back to bring extra cash for the guy out there."
3/11/2018,5 star rating,Other Shul Lung Tang places may be sleeker and cleaner and hipper and younger but this is the place if you want the real deal. So good. Such an incredible broth. Been going here for years and it never disappoints.
12/14/2019,5 star rating,"I don't get the chance to drive to Federalway too often, however when I'm there, I always try to eat here for it's one of the better Sul lung tang outside of LA and Seoul. Value is good and I love the hole in the wall type of atmosphere."
2/5/2018,5 star rating,"This place gets 5 stars for what it is: a hole-in-the-wall, quick, eat-and-go, good-for-hangovers, sulungtang place.Service is extremely fast, and the food is out in literally a few minutes of ordering, so this isn't the best place if you're looking for a place to socialize while eating. It's more of a ""I need soup now or I'll pass out"" kind of place.As for the food, the broth is extremely flavorful, though it does need a bit of salt to bring out the taste. Their kkagdoogee is amazing. Sulungtang-wise, it's one of the best in Ktown."
9/6/2018,5 star rating,"What can I say that hasnt been said about this hole-in-a-wall restaurant? Han Bat is one of the best traditional korean soup restaurants in Los Angeles and their specialty is white beef soup (Sul Lung Tang). They provide a small variety of meats that you can choose and you can flavor the soup to your desires with salt, kimchi, green onions, and pepper paste. This place is a classic and its always fun to see the older and younger generations of Koreans enjoying their soup. My mom and I are huge fans of this place. The customer service is consistent; fast, friendly and easy. Price is pretty reasonable between $10-$20 depending on your order. I love this place and I recommend it."
5/23/2016,4 star rating,Just like the soup I had in Seoul. Even though it's not the best soup I have ever had but it was very good soup. We added a lot of onion- They are really busy but they are very attentive. Loved the kimchi and radish there as well. Will go back there again for sure.
1/18/2016,4 star rating,"Sul Lung Tang is a staple Korean dish and Han Bat makes the best sul lung tang in Southern California.For a sul lung tang to taste good, the kimchi and the radish have to be amazing (it's simply a pivotal combination). This place does a good job!Service is fast and the wait isn't too bad if you come at the right time. They have a spacious parking lot which is a +1 in ktown."
11/10/2019,5 star rating,"Sunday morning at 8:00 with husband and two little kids. Lots of very convenient parking. Dining area about 2/3 full. Very nice server spoke to us in English and grabbed high chairs for the kids. Served the toddler a smaller bowl of rice and broth. Food was served quickly. First time trying Korean ox bone soup. As a Chinese lady who loves the healing, soothing goodness of good broth, I was very pleased with my soup. Really enjoyed the radish kimchi. Perfect contrast to accompany the soup."
12/6/2019,5 star rating,We went on a cold and rainy day and this place was just what the doctor ordered.  The soup was piping hot.  With the addition of a little salt and green onions we ate to our hearts content.  We even asked for some extra soup which they readily gave.  We will definitely be coming back!
9/20/2017,4 star rating,"I don't really get the hype. .I do like the hole in the wall type of place. Kind of hidden for the front door. But there is a sign still so look for that. .Wasn't too busy when i was there but then a crowd showed up when I'm done. .So the menu is on the wall. Limited selection. Since after looking at pics i decided to get the intestine, tripe..So the soup is bland. Not very much flavor til you add sea? Salt, red chili paste which is on the table, and kimchi and the radish comes on the side..So how do you enjoy this bowl of deliciousness? Well it comes bland and the soup is cloudy milky which takes 2 days to make from all the beef and oxtail bones. Once you add 1 and half tea spoon of salt the taste and flavors come out. As well there is a jar of spicy paste for you to add into the soup so spice things up. Personally i added both but not enough salt, so my bowl didn't come out too perfect leaving me not wanting more when i was done. The soup does come with a tub of green onions for you to put in as much as you want, which i really loved! .So after you flavor things up, you eat a piece of kimchi or the radish which came on the side to clean the pallets and add a different flavor and texture. Also the soup comes with a bowl of rice which you can eat a spoon of soup and radish and rice afterwards or you can just dump the rice into the soup to make porridge. I like mines separate. ..Overall it was a good experience. They were quick with bringing out the food. It is comfort food all around, but didnt leave like wow the hype is real. But i do like it and maybe when in town, i give it another try. Thanks for reading and keep on kimcheeeee!"
7/26/2018,5 star rating,"Little hole in the wall in Koreatown. You wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it. They have a very simple menu without frills, you basically choose the oxtail soup with your choice of protein. The broth is so good and you can taste the flavor infused into it since it's no frills. Really tasty and although I had it in the summer, I can imagine it'd be even better in the winter."
10/30/2018,5 star rating,"This is definitely my favorite sul lung tang restaurant of all time. I accidentally spotted this one while wandering around Korea town. They have th simplest menu I ever seen, only 2 items, but that makes thm perfect. Side dishes are kim chi and radish kimchi only, but wait, they are bombs. Foods are delicious, side dishes are good, and staffs are more than friendly. Must try if you're in Korea town. P/s: they have plenty parking in the back of the restaurant for those who hate street parking like me."
11/1/2015,4 star rating,"Apparently no one does it better--not even your theoretical Korean g-ma.This small little mom and pop oxtail soup joint in Koreatown was absolutely jam-packed on a Sunday morning. I probably shouldn't fail to mention that it was the morning after Halloween, so the crowd was a strange mix of late night ragers seeking a tonic to ease the post-rage nausea, and older Korean couples simply seeking their solid Sunday pick-me-up.The menu at Han Bat Shul Lu Tang is simple and straightforward--so much so in fact that it's literally printed and posted above the entryway. People come for one thing and one thing only--the oxtail soup. Granted, there are variations on the dish--you can have yours with just brisket, flank, intestine-tripe-and-spleen, tongue, or with a mix of all of the above.If I have to tell you what I went for, we're probably not as close as you'd like for us to be. My mixed soup came piping hot in a black ceramic cauldron shaped bowl ready for my personal customization. The table was well stocked with salt, hot pepper paste, pepper, and a beyond generous tub of green onions. After a pinch of salt, a drop of chili paste, and a glutton's serving of green onion, my soup was ready for consuming! Simple, soothing, and surprisingly hearty, it's easy to see why the oxtail soup is a part of a drunkard's salvation and a Korean wiseman's Sunday routine. Pure, classic, and honest. What more could you possibly ask for.Aside from another bowl or two of that insanely delectable daikon radish? Nothing."
12/14/2015,5 star rating,"A small hole in the wall restaurant in Korea town, awesome and fast service, affordable cost (~$10) and mostly, absolutely FANTASTIC FOOD!A very simple menu - pick the type of meat and soup. I picked brisket which is a pretty safe choice but you can be as adventurous as you want to be :P The service was extremely fast. You get to add your own salt, pepper and green onion. It is served with two types of kimchi which you can add to the soup for perfect spiciness like I enjoy! The radish kimchi was extremely delicious, crunchy and just perfect with the sullungtang! And they were so nice about giving more when I needed more too! The food is bowl-licking good, I didn't even speak to any of my friends while eating... It really was THAT good. Can't wait to go back to this place! Oh and its CASH ONLY!!"
2/23/2018,3 star rating,"Decent sullungtang, a good selection of other stews. I like coming here because it's affordable, the food is very consistent, and they have their own parking lot (HUGE PLUS). It doesn't ever get too crowded either, which works well when I do not have the energy or patience to wait in a line just to eat my rice and kimchi after work. Definitely recommend if you like a simple, no-nonsense sullungtang menu."
2/3/2016,5 star rating,"Where was this all my life??Simple meal but oh so filling and comforting. This place is kinda on the outskirts of Ktown and it isn't at all a flashy place. It is a place where you eat a good meal to start off or end your tiring day. The place is small and if you can read Korean then you'll be able to find it. Parking is whatevs as always haha. The menu consists of your choices of meats for the soup. I went with the ssogum which is a mixture of all the ones they offer (brisket, liver, tripe, spleen). I think the aunties can speak a little english but luckily I can speak some Korean so it was no biggie ^___^. They have two simple banchan and it comes with rice. It is your typical kimchi and kkakdugi which is bomb as well. The soup comes out piping hot and it is served plain. There is salt, pepper paste, and green onions for you to make it to your liking. I like mine with extra pepper paste, one spoon of salt, and LOADS of green onions. I personally loved the mixed meat option because I like all the textures etc. I just end up dumping my rice into the soup and oh my freaking kimchi I was so satisfied. It is probably one of the best comforting meals I've had. And with this nice cold weather we are finally experiencing in LA, take all the opportunities to eat it! My korean friend told me this is more of a ""man's food"" in Korea but its dang good! Go go go go go go to this place please! Explore what other Korean foods are out there besides Kbbq and bibimbap hehe :P"
2/25/2018,5 star rating,"How can something so simple taste so good?! There decent suhl lung tang places near Seattle, but they do not compare to this place. This spot is pretty small and unassuming. We ordered our soups and everything arrived in 5 minutes or less. The broth is so very, very flavorful and just tastes and feels like home. The kimchi is also on point. Which is a must for places that specialize in suhl lung tang. They open early, so I would recommend for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner!!!"
9/29/2018,5 star rating,"Always come here for a bowl if I'm in k town. Its best for colds, cold nights, and just comfort food. The simpliest food you can eat. Best kimchi and raddish kimchi to pair with ox tail soup! Oh man, my mouth is watering imagining it. Oooh man, better get another bowl.  I usually get the mixed sul lung tang. But if you want to try something more familiar try the brisket beef.  Grew up on this~ some bias with good childhood memories. Hole in the wall place with a soothing beef broth aroma and comforting vibe.The entrance is where the back parking lot is."

8/16/2015,2 star rating,"Maybe it's because I'm *not* Korean and didn't grow up with this ""comfort"" soup, but my parents and I found this soup to be incredibly bland, unappetizingly cloudy in appearance, skimpy on ingredients, and served in a cheap inauthentic wannabe hot pot (prob made in China?) which lost its heat within a couple of short minutes.We were surprised and disappointed, especially given this establishments 4.5 star, 1000+ review Yelp profile. If you close your eyes and taste the soup, you'd think someone stuck a few thin pieces of brisket in some hot water. I am *not* exaggerating. Too bad, because I really wanted to like this!I started asking the waitstaff and fellow customers what I should do to make the soup taste ""even better"" and I followed their direction, and by the time I finished messing with it I realized it wasn't getting any better. Just cloudier. (gross) And it was getting cold because the hot pot was cheap.I couldn't believe how busy this place was - brimming with Korean locals, and the sul lang tung is the *only* thing on the menu other than straight up meat on a plate.Best thing on the table was the complimentary kimchee, but the kimchee alone isn't worth the $10 per person minimum. Don't come here expecting to like this soup just because you enjoy Korean food. This soup is a totally different deal. If you have no emotional attachment to sul lang tung, I bet you'll have the same perplexing experience I did!(And to make matters worse: Cash only, sucker! This place is pure profit - their margins have got to be crazy.)"
8/31/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious! I had the brisket Sul lung tang. The broth had a deep and rich beef flavor that could only come from a broth that had been cooking for hours (my grandmother makes something that tastes similar). This really satiated my craving for Korean food and I hope to come back to LA soon to eat it again. One of the best sul lung tangs I've had, even compared to some one the ones I had in Korea. If you're craving some Korean food that isn't Kbbq give this a try!"
12/9/2019,4 star rating,"One of my fav restaurants! I ordered beef brisket with extra meat on the side. It seems like the amount of meat you get for one soup got smaller.  Overall, it tastes good."
6/9/2014,4 star rating,"My friend recommended that we eat here, and he kept on telling me that I might not like it, because some people think it's bland.  Way to downplay it; I enjoyed this meal immensely.  Sure, the unadulterated bowl of sul lung tang is a little lacking in flavor, but you are able to customize it to your taste with green onions, salt, and sauce.The menu is very simple: you can choose from bowls of Sul Lung Tang with different meats in each.  They don't offer much else, so you better have come here specifically for that!  Sul Lung Tang, based on my first impression, is the love child between pho and congee.  I tried the Mixed bowl for $8.72, but I would recommend Brisket if you're not accustomed to eating things like intestine.  The broth was so delicious and rich! Perfect comfort food that I would crave on a rainy day.  Some things to take note of: CASH ONLY, there is a parking lot in the back but it's really tiny, and don't expect the best service.  Our server totally forgot to give us waters even after we asked.  Overall I had a good experience here, and would definitely come again.  Food: 4, Service: 2, Environment: 3, Price: 4"
11/11/2019,4 star rating,"Super heartwarming for a cold LA ""winter"" day. Not super into intestine and other organs that are cool and chic, so I didn't 100% love the Mixed.

8/5/2019,5 star rating,The real deal. Solid sul lung tang at a great price. Great kimchi (2 options) + the usual toppings of green onion and salt. Bring a friend.
8/25/2018,5 star rating,Very good sul lung tang for hangovers or when you're not feeling well regardless of the LA heat.The sul lung tang comes unseasoned so you need to season it yourself.There is a small parking lot in the back with spotty parking on the main streets in the front.Seating is very quick regardless if there is a line. Most people come in to get their sul lung tang fix and bounce. No need to linger like those brunch places.
1/9/2016,5 star rating,"Once a while, your stomach will be calling for Sul Lung Tang. I was told its Korean hangover food. I think there's definitely some healing power in these soups. Sea salt, bucket full of freshly sliced green onions, a spoonful of hot paste, I can feel my body and soup slowly healing.... its that magical!"
10/4/2019,5 star rating,Very delicious soup in the los Angela area. Tase authentic and the server is really polite. Side dishes are above average kimchi. A little bit pricey but well worth it!
10/8/2015,4 star rating,"My go to place when I'm sick. I loooove the flank sul lung tang much more than the brisket, though the brisket seems very popular. Easy on the salt, you want to make sure you can still taste the bone broth. So yummy. I love specialty shops! Reminds me of Taiwan. The radish kimchi is very popular here. So crunchy and Yums. I am a fan of the regular kimchi as well. Parking in the back for a dollar.Cash only, but there is an atm inside the shop."

4/14/2018,5 star rating,This place is good for those who like Korean comfort food. It was my first time and really love the soup. I wish it was pre season soup instead of having to season our self so my soup was okay. But I did double brisket with the Ox tail soup.  Definitely coming back when I'm hungover.

10/24/2019,5 star rating,Best soup in Koreatown. They provide great quality food and quick service. If you bring your kid they also give free soup for kids. I love their kimchi because it's always fresh. Definitely deserves five star.
3/19/2016,5 star rating,"So I've studied abroad in Seoul and have eaten Korean food everywhere from Hawaii to Ukraine. Without a doubt this place serves the best sullungtang I've ever had.I liken that first spoonful to watching Lebron in his first game against the Kings, or watching Usain Bolt in the 100m in Beijing, or even hearing Kendrick's good kid maad city for the first time; you knew you were witnessing greatness.And if you do go, do yourself a favor and get the beef tongue.

4/20/2018,5 star rating,"When I knew that I was coming to LA, I diligently researched the offerings in Koreatown in search for something I could not get in the Bay Area (basically, everything except soon dubu and kalbi).  My first experience with shul lang tang was about 8 years ago in Oakland.  I didn't know how to eat it, I was in an anti-salt phase (idiot, i know), and dieting like it may actually do something for this 2-doughnut I call a waistline.  It tasted like glue and I spit it out.This time, I made sure to figure out how to eat it, how to season it, what the eff do the natives do to elevate this dish such that whole restaurants devote their entire menu to this one thing.  I ordered the brisket because I was a newbie and I didn't want to scare myself.  Also I am 15 weeks pregnant so I was still getting over the food aversions.  In my soup went: big scoop of green onions (you can't go wrong with this because it brightens everything), a level spoonful of salt (start with a little bit and add more to taste), a few leaves of kim chee.  Stir with a spoon.  Taste.  Scoop a spoonful of rice, dip in the soup, top with a bit of radish.  Nom nom nom nom.  Nom nom nom.  Nom.  Nom nom.  For $11.50 including tax, this was the best thing I've eaten all year.  It was a cold night for LA, I was going back to an empty hotel room, and this warmed my soul.  The radish kim chee and regular kim chee were delicious and refilled.  I will come back here when I am in town again."
4/17/2018,1 star rating,"not sure if it means anything but i wasn't left thrilled with food and service here. i tried the brisket soup and it was just soup. nothing flavorful that would make me go back. i honestly was just annoyed as well by the rush to get you out during the afternoon shift. first of all it is hot soup so i'm guessing it's made already anyway and so as soon as you order it comes right out like fast food almost. then there's no soup spoon so with the regular spoon it's not a fast eat even though you're rushed to eat, pay, and leave."
4/17/2018,5 star rating,"SUL LUNG TANG IS THE ULTIMATE KOREAN COMFORT FOOD. I always try to make my way over here when it's cold outside or even when I'm feeling a little under the weather.Sul Lung Tang is basically an ox bone broth. You pick the cut of meat you want with your soup, choices include flank, brisket, tongue, etc. They also give you a giant tub of cut up green onion, so you can add as much as you'd like to your soup! It also comes with some rice and simple banchan: pickled spicy radish and kimchi. Collectively, the whole meal feels very wholesome and light. This place used to be cash only but not anymore-- they accept credit card now! They also have a parking lot in the back but it's often full, so you have to either wait around a little bit for another customer to leave or find street parking elsewhere."

4/14/2018,5 star rating,This place is good for those who like Korean comfort food. It was my first time and really love the soup. I wish it was pre season soup instead of having to season our self so my soup was okay. But I did double brisket with the Ox tail soup.  Definitely coming back when I'm hungover.

Han Bat is the fountain of youth for after a night of drinking. A place where the guilt of the prior night can be hidden away with each bite. This place is straight up badass! Some of you wrote about bad service.... here's a tip.... Don't wait for the waitress,  just yell what you want. It's korean homie."

No complicated long menus.Never had to wait here and I'm glad this is a well kept secret still. Parking is available behind and up front tooThe place isn't pretty. I'm aware of that. Not somewhere I'd take on the first date but def bring her back for her to try the goodness.Put lots of onions, get some salt and add some hot sauce and you'll have what they call the korean hangover cure"
6/5/2019,5 star rating,"So ridiculously good, but not sure why.  Looks weird, should taste weird, is in fact so delicious.  I was hesitant to try it because as I said, from the description it sounded weird and I already have so many Korean soups to eat!! Also it feels so nutritious and satisfying!!!"
9/30/2017,5 star rating,"They take card now!They sat us right away on a Saturday lunch hour, and food came out within 5 minutes. I loved the broth - you can season it with as much salt/green onions/pepper/red chili paste you want. Brisket was delicious, noodles were glassy, and the soup hit the spot just right. I would have liked more meat+noodles in the soup, but with the rice and the radish kimchi on the side, I was satisfied by the end of the meal. $11.50 for sul lung tang and you can get it with beef brisket, intestines/flank/tripe, tongue, or mixed.There was a bit of a line up halfway through our meal, but the service is quick and the menu options are very minimal so the turnaround shouldn't take too long."

5/20/2015,5 star rating,"The best comfort food!! If you don't know what suhlungtang is, it's oxtail bone soup. You boil the bones with water for hours and hours and the nutrition from the bones converts into a hearty, thick and delicious soup. They give you rice on the side, as well as green onions, coarse salt and red seasoning. You're supposed to eat the soup with kimchi or radish kimchi and you get a heaping pile of both on the side. My favorite way to eat suhlungtang is add lots of green onions and a tiny bit of red seasoning and salt, put the bowl of rice into the soup and put some kimchi juice into the soup as well. Definitely good hangover food or food for whenever you're sick. They open at 6:30 am so it's also good for breakfast whenever you're craving something hearty. Cash only! About $21 for two people. There's street parking or a parking lot in the back!"
7/12/2019,5 star rating,"My first time trying seollangtang, but I think I'll be making the drive up to Ktown a lot more. It's so simple, and I like how you can customize the salt/spice/green onions in your soup. Both my friend and I ordered the brisket seollangtang, and we were surprised that the brisket was thinly sliced and sooo tender!! They also give a bowl of rice, cabbage kimchi, and radish kimchi on the side. (Their kimchi's are THE BEST omg) For $13.50, I'd say the quality and the amount of food they give is worth it."
8/4/2016,4 star rating,"The sul lung tang here is fantastic! Very simple menu. You're basically ordering soup and meat. The soup comes with rice kimchi and radish kimchi. Like most people have said, the radish kimchi was really good. Service was quick and that's all that really matters at this shop anyway. I can definitely see myself coming back here."
11/27/2017,5 star rating,"A childhood favorite. My family and I have been coming here since infancy! You really have to go early in the morning when they have fresh batch of the beef stew. I always get the one with brisket. The broth is really beefy and all you need is salt, pepper, and green onion. Flavoring is left to customers satisfaction. Add a side of spicy kimchi or radish and your dish is complete. Their menu is simple and they stick with what they know and do well. I probably will be going here for many years to come!"
11/11/2017,5 star rating,"Some of the best sul lung tang I've had in my life. The broth we flavorful and had a lot of body, not watery or loose. The meat and guts are super flavorful as well, soft and tender like it should be.It's a pretty small shop but the staff is very kind and welcoming, and you are served quickly. This is the kind of spot you go to for some real comfort food, especially on a cold day.Highly recommend!"
4/28/2019,5 star rating,"A hole-in-the-wall relaxed and often packed joint that serves Korean Soul Food at its finest: sullungtang. Menu is simple, food is amazing. Every time I'm even slightly sick, I crave this place. The soup is literally like medicine. Can get very packed on the weekends and when the weather in LA is ""colder."" Since my sisters and I frequent this place, the women who work here recognize us and always have consistent good service. During a non-busy time, they even served us complimentary barley tea. I have lived in Koreatown for most of my life and have tried sullangtang at other places nearby but nothing has compared to Han Bat."
2/20/2017,4 star rating,This place is one of my favorite go-to's on a cold/breezy for soup and some bomb kimchi. It's a simple menu and you choose what kind of meat you want in your classic Korean ox bone soup. Only downside is that the establishment is small and can get really crowded. Busier days means of course waiting longer to be seated.
10/15/2019,5 star rating,"I love this place because they literally have the smallest menu ever so you don't have to spend time deciding what you want. Service is extremely quick and their soup is sooooooo good. I'm telling you, if their sul tang can warm my cold hearted soul, you will not be disappointed."
5/13/2013,3 star rating,"SEASON YOUR FOOD!!!!!!!They should put that in big bold letters all over the restaurant or at least disclaimers on their menus.  With only two items on the menu, it's pretty easy to add a few more words to it.  It's kind of cool that the menus are posted on the walls right next to each table.Sul Lung Tang.  This was my first time ever experiencing this Korean dish.  It's like a warm noodle soup with pieces of meat (and/or offal).  I opted for the mixed bowl, which was probably a bad choice on my part.  Fan of most offal but not spleen or small intestine.  Good thing I looked around or I would've been some bland beef bone soup.  I took a good helping of salt and green onions and mixed it in my bowl.  Followed by dipping my kimchi in my soup.The taste was good, but it didn't wow me.  Maybe there is nostalgia that I'm not getting because I didn't eat this every other day in my childhood.  It's good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat this.It really is hole in a wall kind of place and it's CASH ONLY!"
8/21/2019,5 star rating,Nothing like Han Bat when I'm sick or feeling down. I tried to make my own but I can never quite get the richness of their broths. The prices unfortunately have risen 30% over the last 3 years but I still come once every month or two. This place is almost always packed. I've seen people eat in here during a power outage. I typically get the brisket or mix. I really like their kimchi and radish sides.
3/30/2018,5 star rating,Sometimes there's nothing better than simple comfort food! This place obviously specializes in Korean oxtail soup and they make it taste so rich and flavorful. Sometimes I'll put in the red sauce from the kakdugi ( pickled radish) and other days I'll  just put in a pinch of the sea salt they have on the tables. The soups have a perfect amount of meat and clear noodles in them. Their kimchi is also good! Book this place for when you get sick and need some soup.
3/18/2016,5 star rating,"It's just the best simply put. There isn't much else to say, it's always busy even 10am on a Monday. I've only ever had the brisket sullung tang and it's the freakin best.

1/2/2016,4 star rating,"Nothing better than a bowl of hot soup during a cold winter night (thankfully it wasn't that cold).  The wait for 5 wasn't too bad on New Years Day.The menu is really simple.  It's all the same broth but you get to choose what kind of meat you want.  I opted for the mixed meat which has a little bit of everything.  After you order your table is quickly set up and you have your bowl of soup within two minutes of ordering it.Your bowl of soup comes out pretty bland so you have to add salt and green onions yourself until you're satisfied with the flavor.  I enjoyed the rice better when it was all dumped inside the soup.  I do wish that there was more meat though as well as more sides.It's good comfort food, but I was still extremely hungry after my meal.  Service was ok, they don't really check up on you but I guess it's cause they're extremely busy."
9/8/2015,4 star rating,"There's no way I'm going to turn down a big, steamy bowl of bone soup; especially, from the famous Han Bat Sul Lung Tang.My first impression was how fondly this place reminds me of eateries in Asia. It's a hole in the wall and isn't too pretty to look at, but you see the food get whisked out with a big bucket of chopped green onions and immediately your attention goes to that like a child with ADD.I ordered the mixed bowl so I get a little of everything. The broth was good, but not great. I expected something a bit creamier like Hannah H. had mentioned. I also felt the soup could be a little more chunkier, but it could be I went light on the green onions. The radishes they give you with the bantam are fantastic. So refreshing and crispy!Overall, this is a wonderful place to come over if you're hung over or looking for some delicious comfort food. The best part is they're open early. Hello, soup breakfast.Tips: Street parking is limited. Cash only!"
9/6/2019,5 star rating,"This place is as OG as it gets.  It does one thing and it does it with impeccable aplomb.  Their Sul Lung Tang has a deep umami flavor and is rich without being greasy.  Service is fast and the vibe is relaxed and down-home.  I recommend getting the brisket, although I love the offal. Sul Lung Tang is comfort food in a deep primal sense - it soothes and reassures, satisfies and invigorates.  The world outside may be crazy and complicated, but Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is simple and good for your soul."
8/10/2017,5 star rating,"I know this place is famous for their sul lung tang, but can we talk about their kimchi?! I have tried SO MANY Korean places, and this place has the best cabbage kimchi ever!! I don't even live in LA, but anytime I'm in Ktown...I must go here. I get the brisket sul lung tang which comes with a bowl of rice and only 2 sides: cabbage kimchi and radish kimchi. So simple, but so delicious. It's perfect for when you're feeling under the weather and when you're happy and just want to be even happier. Please try it."

5/17/2015,4 star rating,"My fiance and I have been here a couple times now, and it seems like this may be our go-to- spot for when he has his cravings for sul lung tang.You get to choose what types of meat you'd like in your broth. I always stick with beef brisket and my fiance sticks with mixed. Since they've been simmering the soup for hours, it gets served very quickly--no waiting time! Each bowl is now over $9 ($21 even for two people after tax), which is still a decent price.Another thing we like about this place is that there's parking in the back. FYI this place is cash only.We will be back the next time we're in the area."
4/4/2015,5 star rating,"Review #200...it was a very tough choice to choose which business deserves such a high privilege.  But who else would deserve this honor other than my new found favorite sul lung tang spot...I never even knew this place existed, if not for my new Yelp buddies.  A huge thanks to the 4 Korean women who recently accepted my friend requests and reviewed this spot with such high ratings, and their ratings are well deserved, indeed.Parking is pretty convenient as they have valet parking in the back of the restaurant.  They also have a good amount of parking meters out front as well.I showed up alone at around 2:30 PM on a Friday and was seated right away.  The restaurant was pretty quiet, but there were a few tables that were finishing up their meals.  I love the fact that my body doesn't get hungry until it's way passed normal people's lunch time because it makes it so much easier to eat when everyone else has already gone back to work and I don't ever have to wait to get seated.I ordered the naejang sul lung tang.  It showed up about 5 minutes later with a bowl of rice, a side of Napa cabbage kimchee and a side of the radish kimchee as well.  They brought a big jar of green onions, which I never add, because me and onions go together like water and oil.  I added about a half teaspoon of sea salt and the broth tasted perfect.  Most places, I would have to keep adding and tasting and adjusting until it finally reaches my satisfied flavor, not here!I was starving so I pretty much finished my meal in less than 20 minutes.  I'm a pretty slow eater in general, take into account that I have to take my food photos for Yelp, check in, and whatever else...20 minutes is considered very quick!Although the radish kimchee was a little too sour and the Napa cabbage kimchee was too fresh for my personal liking, I couldn't complain because the soup was just that good!Sorry Han Yang in Buena Vista, but I have to replace you whenever I'm staying in LA.  But I promise to go visit you whenever I'm staying in Anaheim."

2/26/2014,3 star rating,"I've never had Sul Lung Tang before so I thought I'd give it a shot with some co-workers. This was popular on Yelp, so if I was going to be adventurous this place would be perfect.The area: Fairly sketch. A homeless person was being vacated from her nook by cops. 2 homeless crack addicts in the alleyway where we parked. The valet was full (but at $1, that's no wonder). We finally made it into Han Bat.I was greeted by a friendly woman who immediately asked the number in our party. We sat immediately. Nothing amazing to look at--well, that's not what you come for. The chair I sat on wasn't very clean, there was definitely something sticky on the seat. A simple menu in a frame was hung on the wall adjacent to every table. Not much here but the Sul Lung Tang soup with various options: Brisket, Flank, Mixed, Intestines. I went with the Brisket.The place smelled really good. Fresh scallions wafted the air and the yummy, inviting smell of soup broth was definitely a plus. Especially since it was cold outside.We were brought bowls and bowls of Kimchi cabbage and daikon. Both were excellent. Tasted fresh and had just enough spice. The deep red of the kimchi sauce paired with the tangy, zesty smell made my mouth water. They were tasty.You're also given a bowl of rice to enjoy your soup with.And now the soup: By itself, not super great. But when you start adding all the accouterments, you're good to go: Sea Salt, Pepper/Bean paste, scallions, kimchi, and pepper. The broth was milky -- the direct result of boiling beef bones for hours -- some of that yummy marrow flavors the soup so well. I thoroughly enjoyed the soup. The place could use a little cleaning, though."
3/15/2017,5 star rating,"Found out about this place on a YouTube channel that was featuring Chris Oh (Seoul Sausage,  han jip, etc) and they had an interview right here at Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. As i'm watching this interview on YouTube I've realized it has been ages since i've last had some sul lung tang (Ox Bone broth) and since we were going to LA fairly soon, I bookmarked it here on yelp and was all set to try it out. My partner pointed out that they open at 7am which was perfect because our flight landed at 7am and we could stop by and try it out for breakfast and before all the rush.This restaurant only serves or specialize in one dish, sul lung tang. That's it, if you're looking for other options this isn't the place you want to go. I personally love these type of restaurants that specializes in one thing and makes the decision so much easier and since the menu is so limited (one dish) the food has to be good since the cooks have to only perfect one thing instead of multiple dishes. Food Review/explanation:You have your choices of meat that is added to your sul lung tang (or if you want suyuk instead of sul lung tang which is just boiled meat that you can wrap in kimchi and eat it) along with korean glass noodles. The banchan you get is kimchi and delicious kkakdugi (radish kimchi) and a bowl of rice you that you can dump into your broth or eat it separately. They also give you a whole bucket of green onions that you add to your broth.Now, sul lung tang isn't the most flavored soup you'll have in Korean cuisine. it's just boiled Ox bone (mainly the leg bones) thats been simmering over night (reason for it's milky texture and graininess towards the end of your bowl) that's it no season is added, nothing. Many people who have never this dish will always complain about the flavorless broth but, this is what you do. The table comes with condiments, this tray have sea salt, black pepper and chili sauce. No one have the same tastes buds so what you do is add as much of these condiments to your liking until the flavor is right. That's it. You adjust the taste to your liking.I got the salgogi (beef brisket) sul lung tang, added 2 pinches of salt, loads of black pepper and loads of green onion (i don't use the chili sauce) and my broth was all ready to slurp up. I dump my rice into the broth and started digging in dipping the kimchi and kkakdugi into the broth for extra flavor. This is as homemade tasting sul lung tang you'll get. Everything tasted perfect (because i adjusted the taste to my liking using the seasoning condiments) after i cleaned up my bowl i wanted more and wish it was winter instead of the LA heat we were in that morning.The glass noodle was a little skimpy along with the meat but, it's okay because the main star is the milky bone broth you get that was made with perfect attention to detail for a perfect consistency broth.End food explanation/review The service was great and though they forgot to give us water we flagged down our server and was given water immediately. i did forget my backpack when we were leaving and realize i forgot it when my partner and I was about to walk across the street. i ran back to get it, to have our server coming out the door saying in Korean, ""you forgot your back pack, I thought you left from the back so, I ran but, couldn't find you and i was going to find you up front and here you are"" She was so sweet :) Great service and great Sul Lung Tang. Will be coming back to get my Sul Lung Tang fix on my next visit!"
5/17/2017,2 star rating,"My friend and I came here after reading the Yelp reviews, and at first it looked so promising. The long wait! The sweet elderly gentleman who directed parking traffic! The sparse menu! These are usually indicators of a diamond in the rough, food-wise.We both ordered the beef brisket soup, and were first quickly served white rice, kimchi, and... I'm guessing radish. (The latter two were generously spicy!)Then came the soup itself. And I was... underwhelmed. There was little brisket, and even fewer noodles, but lots of white broth. We seasoned our bowls with salt and pepper, as well as green onion. We even used the extra sauce from the fermented radish. But honestly, it was disappointing. And I really wanted to like this place! Everyone around us was happily slurping away, and I couldn't help but feel like I'd somehow missed the memo on how to order from the menu. The line waiting to get in was longer than when we'd left, so clearly they're doing something right. I just wish I knew what that was!"
6/25/2015,4 star rating,"They call this hangover soup? Mel L. has taken me here twice and I've loved it every time. It's so simple, but so comforting and delicious. The ox bone soup is savory and you pick your cut of meats from a preset menu. They give you kim chi and pickled radish that is well flavored and a tub of pre-cut green onions and (what I am assuming is) MSG to flavor the already wonderful soup. Along with the bowl of rice, nothing hits the spot better after a night of drinking or when you're feeling under the weather.The staff is friendly, the service is quick, and this place is always busy. You can park on the street near Carl's Jr. They want you to enter through the back, I believe and exit through the front. Check this place out any time you need a pick-me-up and you won't be disappointed."
1/27/2018,5 star rating,"Ox tail bone broth from heaven.Huge fan of the fact that you can salt these dishes yourself as some kitchens can be so heavy-handed.The broth is so rich and velvety with glass noodles, green onions and your choice of a variety of proteins to add (tripe, brisket, spleen, steak, etc).The kimchi might also be some of the best in town."
1/14/2018,5 star rating,"Their menu is super simple, ox bone soup base with whatever meat you choose to go with your soup. It takes a lot of confidence to open an restaurant with a such simple menu! They made it! The soup is tasty! It's a mom and pop shop with really good light soup!"

Who cares if it's 90 degrees.I've had this soup many many times and even in Korea and this one really matches some of the best I've had. You can tell the base of the soup has been cooking for days. The kimchi and radish is also FIRE. It isn't the most Glam atmosphere. But if you wanna get a true Korean staple, head on over. Don't forget to add a little salt at a time and pour da green onion in."
4/20/2018,5 star rating,"When I knew that I was coming to LA, I diligently researched the offerings in Koreatown in search for something I could not get in the Bay Area (basically, everything except soon dubu and kalbi).  My first experience with shul lang tang was about 8 years ago in Oakland.  I didn't know how to eat it, I was in an anti-salt phase (idiot, i know), and dieting like it may actually do something for this 2-doughnut I call a waistline.  It tasted like glue and I spit it out.This time, I made sure to figure out how to eat it, how to season it, what the eff do the natives do to elevate this dish such that whole restaurants devote their entire menu to this one thing.  I ordered the brisket because I was a newbie and I didn't want to scare myself.  Also I am 15 weeks pregnant so I was still getting over the food aversions.  In my soup went: big scoop of green onions (you can't go wrong with this because it brightens everything), a level spoonful of salt (start with a little bit and add more to taste), a few leaves of kim chee.  Stir with a spoon.  Taste.  Scoop a spoonful of rice, dip in the soup, top with a bit of radish.  Nom nom nom nom.  Nom nom nom.  Nom.  Nom nom.  For $11.50 including tax, this was the best thing I've eaten all year.  It was a cold night for LA, I was going back to an empty hotel room, and this warmed my soul.  The radish kim chee and regular kim chee were delicious and refilled.  I will come back here when I am in town again."
5/7/2015,5 star rating,"Good place to go if you are craving something healthy, greaseless, and comforting. Not everyone will like this soup, can taste a little bland at first, but it's one of those staple korean foods that one can get accustomed to eating more and more and grow on you. They only have 1 item, their beef broth soup that comes with steam white rice and two different kinds of kimchi: the Napa cabbage and the radish kimchi. Inside the soup you can choose to have beef brisket (normal beef), intestines (small intestines, lung, beef tongue, tripe), or mixed (beef brisket with intestines). To the mixed you can request to have them add in some beef tongue so you get the best out of all worlds. The soup has no seasoning, I usually add a whole bunch of chopped green onion (that they will bring to your table for the first 5 minutes you get your soup), sea salt, and a little bit of chili but it's up to you. And put the rice inside the soup if you want a chance to be able to finish all the rice. If you eat the rice separately and concentrate on just finishing the soup you'll probably end up eating only half a bowl of rice at the most, and get hungry quickly after the meal. If the meat inside the soup is not enough, you can also order a plate of meat (just plain boiled) for an extra $20 (again your choice of beef brisket, intestines, or mixed). They will serve with soy sauce and wasabi to dip in.Depending on how they feel, they sometimes have valet ($1) or self parking in the lot behind the restaurant. Cash only"
5/10/2014,5 star rating,"The leanest cleanest beef brisket broth. Which you can then add your own condiments such as chopped green onions, sea salt, and chili paste.Chinese tradition calls to eat whatever you need to replenish more of. Need more power in the liver? Eat liver lol. I've tried the intestine and spleen soup as well, because as omnivorous as I am, I still eat out of functionality :) Comes with a good kimchi and radish kimchi, among some other side dishes. I like their kimchi here, it has a bit more sugar in it so it balances out the taste of fermentation, but that's coming from a non korean. Cash only. Free valet in the back"
10/17/2017,4 star rating,"Finally had a chance to introduce my kids to straight-up, old school Sul-Lung Tang, Han Bat style.  Broth was excellent.  Kim-chee and Kahk-du-ghee were on spot.  Hole-in-the wall decor was on spot.  I took off one star because two kids had a minor allergic reaction - so just wanted to give a heads up.  The kids are allergic to shellfish and nuts.  Don't know if there was some cross-contamination in the kitchen and we could not ask because of the language barrier.  I would go back in a heart beat, but just wanted to give a heads up for folks with severe nut or shellfish allergies."
6/28/2019,5 star rating,I love this place. I crave it often when I am craving comfort! My Korean friend shared this restaurant with me. I get the flank and brisket combo. OMG. So delicious.
3/9/2019,3 star rating,"This place serves one dish, sulungtang and knowing that I expected a lot unfortunately it wasn't as good as some people hyped it up to be. It was alright. The broth was pretty dam flavorful but the intestines did have some weird smell to it (I got the mixed soup) and it was lukewarm af. But for people who are new to the sulungtang game, I would recommend getting the beef brisket soup. The kimchi on the other hand was very good. The service was alright as the food was served very quick but one of the ladies hands us the bill when I'm not even done, like wth? While others are handed the check when they ASK for it."
4/18/2017,4 star rating,"I went at 6:55 on a Tuesday to get their Beef Brisket, and their service was extremely fast. The only thing was that I had to pay in cash. But the food was really good and they gave a lot of kimchi. I had a lot of extra rice and kimchi left, but no complaints about extra food! I would definetly come again!"
7/4/2017,4 star rating,"my first time trying this soup. i didn't know what to expect.i either never noticed it before or never went to a place that carried it.this place specializes in sullungtang and by that i mean that's pretty much all they have + some bbq meats w.out soup.you can pick the kind of meat option you want in the soup, brisket being the most safe and standard.at first I was a bit confused by the soup. it seemed so flavorless. then i read up that you need to flavor it yourself with salt and pepper and that the milky bone soup is supposed to come like this. sadly, i only figured this out halfway through my meal while scratching my head as to why this place is so popular. once i flavored the soup up, it was a very delicious meal."
4/11/2018,5 star rating,Soooooooo good. Such a simple menu and the food came out fast. Nice and hot and the meats were so tender!
6/11/2017,4 star rating,"This restaurant offers a very simplistic menu: sul lung tang or ox bone soup. The beef brisket is the most popular one but I got the beef intestines, spleen, and tripes (nae jang) just to try. The meat is super soft and doesn't have that intestinal smell. Otherwise, not much to say since the soup is pretty bland. The restaurant provides you with plenty of red pepper paste, salt, and green onion to add in your soup to taste. Service is fast and free parking in the back."
6/26/2016,3 star rating,"Because of the reviews, I went there with a high expectation but I think I like our Irvine Tang places better. The soup is very plain and you have to season it. They only gave you one side dish per person and never add the side dish when you finished. They didn't serve the water either. With taxes, it is about $11 per bowl which is few dollars cheaper than irvine but the portion is also smaller. Parking is hard. We parked cross street on Carl Jr and just went in to purchase a drink. The store does have its own parking. It is behind the store and you have to go in through the small street and they were full when we got there.The area doesn't seem very safe. We didn't stay very long once we finished our soup there."
5/20/2017,4 star rating,"My cousin took me here a really long time ago as her go to hangover spot and i've been trying to find it ever since. I finally found it and its better than I remember. The place is SUPER hole-in-the-wall and you might miss it the first couple of times. Enter through the small alley in back and you'll find a parking lot. BEWARE, the soup is not super flavorful and it's not meant to be. It's one of those warm your soul, surprisingly rich, good when your sick foods. Add a lot of green onion and a little salt for taste if it's TOO bland. The meats in the broth vary from flank/steak to liver and intestine which can be surprisingly fatty and hit the spot when you feel low energy. The kimchi was good and i hear it's even better if you add the kimchi to the soup! I didn't do that but it's highly suggested that you do. Also, I like to add the rice into the soup as well."
3/27/2018,5 star rating,"Han Bat Shul Lung Tang has been on my bucketlist for so long, I'm glad to have finally tried it today. I ordered the instestine shul lung tang and dumped copious amounts of onions and two salt spoons into my soup. Delicious and hearty. I could feel myself slipping into a food coma as the meal progressed. Delicious place to grab a quick bite and get out. I wouldn't come back simply because KTown is wayyyy out of my reach. Traffic was killer for a 20minute meal."
4/14/2017,5 star rating,"The fact that I can come here and pick up the best sullungtang in the country for 7 dollars/quart (for just the broth), AND be in and out in 5 minutes, is unreal.  I used to make my own bone broth...now I live 15 minutes from here, and my life is better for it.  Never change, Han Bat."
4/27/2017,5 star rating,As soon as you sit get ready to order. Add a lot of scallions and a dash of salt and pepper.Ask for some red radish water and pour that in your soup.Best cure for a hangover. You can thank me later.
8/7/2018,4 star rating,"Comfort food to the max!!!This place is awesome because of several things: quick service, fixed menu, the waitress are quick, and always tastes the SAME!Sul lung tang is the classic korean bone soup that will fill your stomach, easy to digest, perfect when you feel sick or tired.I also take it ""to-go"" but the whole experience is to eat it there. I love the beef brisket choice and the kimchi side dishes (although i like the fermented radish aka ""kaktooguee"" is my fav!If you have tried it, you know it! If you are korean: you gonna love it. If you have never tried it and like any type of soup: give a try!Be aware that you must add salt and pepper to your taste and green onions will leave you with a ""not-so-sexy"" breath, but it makes the soup flavor muuuuch better!"
12/6/2017,5 star rating,"Our favorite place for sullungtang, and nothing has changed in the decades worth of visits. Quick service whether you eat in or Togo.  Just recently found out they sell soup only (no meat, noodle, kimchi) for $6.50. I usually add rice for $1, and this is perfect hot meal for my toddler.  For TWO dinners.  It probably can feed her 4x, and even though she gobbles up her ""gook bap"" (Korean for soup rice), she's over it by the third day. HahaWhen you eat in shop, the kimchi & condiments are unlimited :)"
3/7/2019,3 star rating,I was expecting some better sul lung tang from reading all the positive reviews. I feel like the soup was mediocre. I was disappointed because the soup wasn't even that hot when it came out. People come in and leave fairly quickly so the wait for a table was pretty short. I also thought it was very rude when the waitress handed us the check 5 minutes into the meal while we were still eating.
1/8/2018,5 star rating,"Wow, such good soup. As rich as it is soothing. I highly recommend coming here, ordering whichever soup you like and just stuffing that soup with green onions. Like really just absolutely mess it up. It's great that you can add however much salt you like and kimchi if you like. Good price, too. I'd honestly pay more for it, but that's a secret shhhhh. Get here, that's all."

2/11/2015,5 star rating,"I LOVE HAN BAT SULLUNGTANG!! This is the best place to get sullungtang (ox bone soup) in Ktown!!! If you've never tried sullungtang before, it is a MUST TRY. It's Korean comfort food at its best. If you're feeling sick or hungover, or just want some warm and mild comforting soup, this will definitely HIT THE SPOT! It's perfect for a cold day!I like to get my sullungtang with salgogi (beef brisket). You can pick other meats as well such as flank, etc. The broth comes out unsalted so be sure to add a little salt and green onions to taste to your liking. They'll have those on the table for you. The beef broth tastes so good with rice and their side dish of crunchy kkakdugi (spicy cubes of pickled radish). Seriously, you can't have sullungtang without kkakdugi! This place is super casual but their service is amazing! The ladies working are super nice and polite and they don't discriminate if you're younger or non-Korean. They'll treat you just the same. :) ***Keep in mind this place is CASH ONLY***Parking: At night, it's free in the private lot in the back. You can enter the restaurant through the back door."
1/1/2018,5 star rating,"Best sullungtang I have ever had in the US. Beats the NYC and NJ options I've had, hands down."
7/4/2018,5 star rating,Love hole-in-the-wall places that make and specialize in only one thing and do it exceptionally well. Came here for Sul lung tang for breakfast and it was epic. Go get some.
4/6/2015,5 star rating,"Possibly my favorite Korean spot in Ktown! Friendly service, free parking in the back lot, and cheap, delicious food.They only have 2 items on their menu, so that makes it easy on you. Let me make it even easier: get the sullungtang. It's in the name, it's what they specialize in.SULLUNGTANG:Sullungtang is the perfect comfort food. It's a simple bowl of ox-bone soup served in a hot stone bowl. The only other things in it are pieces of meat (whichever you choose between beef brisket, flank, intestine/tripe/spleen, tongue, or any combination of the above) and thin, white noodles. There's salt, pepper, and green onion on the table that you can use to customize the sullungtang to your heart's content. I like mine with a spoonful or two of salt and some heaping servings of green onions. The set also includes a bowl of rice and two types of kimchi (cabbage and daikon). All this for only $10! What I like to do is put some sauce from the radish kimchi on my rice to spice it up, then dip spoonfuls of rice into the hot broth. It's seriously one of the simplest and most comforting foods I've ever had.Han Bat's sullungtang is milky and opaque, unlike the broth at some other places. I love this because it means the broth is richer and has a more intense beef flavor than the broths that are clear and ""clean"" tasting.I think the service here is great. Even though the place itself is a hole-in-the-wall, the waitresses are genuinely friendly and accommodating. I always feel like I'm being fed by my non-existent Korean aunties!Used to be cash only but they take card now!"
5/18/2015,5 star rating,"Perfect remedy for hangovers! Forget about pho, its all about Sulungtang! and this place is one of the best in Koreatown!  Sulungtang = Ox tail soup! The broth is made from ox bones and meat and cooked slowly for long hours to achieve its flavor. The soup base itself is a bland but that's why you add the salt & pepper to your liking! Also put in green onions! If you want it a bit spicy, you can use the juice from the kimchee and add it into the broth! You also choose the meat you want for your broth, I usually stick with brisket. It also has rice noodles and comes with a side of rice!Sulungtang is much healther option than eating pho! next time when your hungover? or craving something soupy, check this place out!CASH ONLY!"
7/28/2019,5 star rating,Highly recommend this place as a go-to Sul Lung Tang spot in koreatown. Broth is light but still maintains a great meaty and umami flavor. There are a few different meat options but the brisket is always a safe choice. Don't forget to add in green onions if that's your thing. Service is quick and on-point.
2/29/2016,5 star rating,"They raise their price! Again! and the meat is getting less. BUT I still love this authentic meat soup. Nyam! I remembered when I first came here , I don't like it but i gave it another chance and somehow I hooked up with it."
7/28/2019,4 star rating,Never really dine in because I order Togo but I would say the food here is really good. The kimchi here is excellent.
8/22/2018,4 star rating,Overall good but tripe is a little yukky. Love the green onion. Pickled cabbage was good.
4/12/2015,5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for the past 2 years I've been in LA, and finally, today was the day I went! I was very surprised at how small it was, and there was a line but it went by quickly. I got the beef brisket sulungtang, seasoned it with green onions, kkakdugi, and salt. First sip, I was hooked. The broth is rich and delicious, perfect pairing with the kkakdugi and kimchi. All I kept thinking about was how delicious this soup was and why I waited so long to try it. I'm definitely bringing my mom here when she comes to visit! Cash only!Quick update: I've been coming here AT LEAST three times a month now. And every single time, it has been so f*cking delicious, I want to give this restaurant an award for consistency. Also, there's a big parking lot in the back -- I believe there's valet on the weekends for $2 (for dinner), but none on the weekdays."
9/6/2018,5 star rating,"Found this place based on a friend's recommendation years ago, and the first time I came here, I was not knowledgeable about Korean food so I couldn't appreciate it. I thought the soup was bland.Fast forward years later, I learned that you should appreciate the broth and add green onions and salt as you wish. It's a comfort food, especially in chilly weather. The restaurant is small and parking could be difficult. It is perhaps best to come during non-busy hours."
1/27/2019,5 star rating,"Came here to recover from Saturday night and was not disappointed at all. The bone broth was tasty and comforting. It's a little hole-in-the-wall joint and can get crowded very fast. Soup comes with rice, kimchi, and radish banchan. The place is a bit old and the menu is simple. Service was quick and ladies working there seems nice. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap and comforting meal."
4/23/2017,5 star rating,"I ordered the brisket oxtail soup.  The soup is indeed pretty simple, but it's very rich and nutritious.  You can tell they cooked the stock for a long time because the milky color of the bone soup.  After adding some salt and onion to the soup, I personally enjoyed every bit of it.   I finished half of the soup before putting chili paste in mine to make the second half a spicier version.  I appreciate small shops like this that serves you food with no bullshit.  I don't think I will ever make a trip to downtown just for this, but I do get my hair done in Ktown every few months, and this might just become a new tradition for me."
5/7/2017,5 star rating,Has AMAZING kimchi. I don't think I've ever had kimchi this good. The soup is FABULOUS (season it yourself). There's parking at the backEverything is great
12/29/2017,5 star rating,"I've been here twice now for their incredible ox bone soup! There is nothing more comforting and satisfying than a bowl of this on a cold LA day. I love how clean the soup tastes. It's incredibly sweet! I've gotten the brisket both times now and they always give me so much! I also appreciate how we can season the soup ourselves, as I feel most soups always put too much salt. The complimentary kimchi tastes great and really fresh too. Service is fast and friendly. Most recently we ordered two soups for three people and the waitress showed no judgement! Even brought out an extra bowl and serving spoon without us having to ask.   Will most definitely be back for more!"
5/25/2019,4 star rating,"The perfect combination of  flavor and richness without being too heavy, this is going to be my go to place for soup from now on, not sure how it took me so long to discover this place, highly recommend the beef tongue option!"
1/1/2015,5 star rating,"Today is Jan 1st, or better know as, National Hangover Day. The only and best known cure for this hangover is sul lung tang (Korean ox bone soup). And where else but this joint?Walked right on in for dinner after napping all day and was seated right away. Menu is on a picture frame and it's pretty effin simple. My bf ordered mixed sul lung tang and I ordered brisket. It came in seconds and with all the fixings on the side including rice. I add a spoonful of the salt and a large heaping of green onions. I don't eat the kimchee so the bf devoured that. I burnt my tongue but I am cured! Yessss!Cash only. They're open 365 days/year so no need to call and ask. Happy 2015!"
12/31/2014,3 star rating,"My family and I came here during the lunch rush, but we were actually seated within 10 minutes or so.  Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is considered LA's favorite suhllungtang jip, so I was pretty excited to check them out.  The place itself isn't too big, but it seems as if people go in and out constantly, either for dine-in or for a carry-out.  The menu is small - they offer 5 different types of suhllungtangs (seokum, salgogi, yangji, naejang, and wusoel) as well as suyooks (seokum, yangji, and naejang).  Besides my dad, everyone had the salgogi (beef brisket), while he had the naejang (intestine, tripe, and spleen).  The suhllungtang came piping hot, and it definitely had a beef-y broth-like flavor to it.  My dad was a fan and so were the others; I, on the other hand, was just okay with it.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as fantastic as everyone made it out to be :P  I guess I'm more of creamier/milkier type of person?  I know that most suhllungtang places add milk to make it 'creamier,' but I also know that if you boil the oxtail bones long enough, it will become thick and creamy.  I really appreciated the big tub of scallions, as I dumped literally half of it in my soup (love scallions!).  Course salt was available to also season it up.  I really loved the ggakdukies, as they were perfectly well-fermented and lovely with the soup.  The kimchi, on the other hand, were kind of naked and not fermented at all T__T  Service was very straightforward and efficient; if you wanted extras of anything, just call out to the ahjummas and they will take care of you :D  Each suhllungtang is less than $10, minus tax, so it was pretty okay in price.  It definitely left you feeling full!+more 'beef broth-y' in flavor (less creamy)+great ggakdukies! :D+love the kind kind KIND ahjushi, clearing the tables :D+fast and efficient service from the ajummas"
3/13/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing! Best sul lung tang I've ever had. I've tried several of their soups and everything is great though beef tongue is my favorite. Portion is generous, you get the soup ( with some glass noodles in it) with side of rice and two Kim chi flavored sides-don't even like kimchi but even that's super bomb here. Don't forget to add salt to the soup (necessary step)! It smells a bit weird inside the restaurant, a bit like cleaning solution, but the food is so good so I don't mind."
5/1/2016,5 star rating,"Ox bone soup is very tasty. Proper way to dine is to add a little salt, red pepper sauce and green onion to taste.We are at disadvantage not able to speak Korean but the owners are so nice and kept on bring us their great tasting Kim chi :)Too bad I don't live in the area otherwise I would come everyday!"
4/17/2017,4 star rating,"I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for a flavor packed meal! This is probably one of the simplest Korean meals I've ever had. Simple menu, simple taste, simple side dishes, simple interior.The menu consists of two things: a soup and a boiled beef. From there, you choose the meat you'd like to go with your order, and that's it. Each order comes with rice and two side dishes: one cabbage and one radish kimchi.There's tubs and tubs of green onion for you to throw in your soup if you choose to; if you like your soup spicy, ask for the chili paste. The overall taste is very light; perfect for hangovers or if you want to take a break from heavy foods. The soup still has a very pleasant umami taste from the ox bone and brisket that I chose, so it's not like a complete abstinence of flavor. Customer service is good and very brief. The ahjummas are nice, get you what you need, and greet you warmly, but not much else. Customers are also very quick to come and go here as well; they come knowing what they're getting, eat, and go. Simple is the theme here, after all.I can see the appeal of this place. It's nothing fancy or amazing, but it's super filling, no-nonsense, and direct. Come here if you're tired of complication or need some comfort food!"
4/26/2018,5 star rating,"I'm a big fan of people and places that specialize in doing ONE thing only, and one thing WELL, especially when it comes to food... especially when it comes to food in K Town. This place does Sul Lang Tang only, and does it well. I suspect this place has boiled thousands of hours worth of Bone Broth long before it was a ""thing"" at overpriced natural foods stores. True to it's mystical healing powers, the Brisket Sul Lang Tang always fixes up my soul, whether I am nursing a hangover, a cold, general sh*ttiness, or life. So, I go here at least once a week. I have to admit that I am becoming a bit of an ornery ""regular,"" a little dismayed by a recent surge of hipsters stumbling in, pointing at the menus on the wall, and asking too many questions. There is parking in the back, but it can get crammed, and the neighborhood can be a nightmare during peak hours, like most places in K Town. However, If you are lucky, you may encounter an older Korean gentleman sitting on a bucket, smoking a cigarette, and guarding a coned-off parking space or two. He may let you park in a spot, he may just throw you shade. It's a real game of chance. He lifted a cone and let me park right by the door once, so you never know.The orders come out super fast, but always piping hot, so the turnover is pretty quick. I prefer the Brisket. I'll eat almost anything, but I have not quite acquired the taste of Spleen in the Mixed Sul Lang Tang...working on it."

7/13/2019,5 star rating,This is my go to comfort food place in Ktown. I love how down to earth and authentic this place is. The soup is delicious - rich yet not heavy at all. It goes very well with the rice and the kimchi that comes with the order. I have tried the same kind of soup at many other Korean places and nowhere else so far can beat this place. The menu is simple but the soup is really all you need!!

(they will split it half half for you).. this is fast food Korean food (think the Korean version of mcd's).. service should be friendly, brisk.. food will come out fast.. and the menu options are limited. Soup.. with your choice of meat.. and the two forms of kimchi come out.. done..Frankly some of the best sol lung tang I have had in my life.. reminds of what gam mi uk used to be in manhattan.. and frankly better than my moms (sacrilege if she ever got on yelp).."
3/20/2019,5 star rating,This restaurant is the ultimate comfort food for Korean Cuisine. They are known for their succulent Oxtail Soup.

It's perfect because I don't have much of an appetite when I'm sick but the deep beef broth and spicy delicious kimchi fixes me up.Best to order ahead and pick up. Just as good reheated and better cause you can eat in your PJs.

It's not only a hangover cure, it's actually very healthy for you.  They're a specialty restaurant so don't expect to go in there looking for variety.  However, because they are a specialty restaurant, they've definitely perfected the dish they specialize in."
12/3/2018,5 star rating,Wow i finally found my most favorite korean hot soup restaurant. The soup is so flavorful and the price is cheap compared Sun Nong Dan. Small cozy restaurant. The lady always has a huge smile on her face. Highly recommend guys.
4/7/2018,5 star rating,"So simple, yet so perfect.After moving to NY, I had a newfound appreciation for this place. It used to be cash only when I lived in LA, but they've upgraded to credit cards!I got the mixed ox bone soup and was incredibly satisfied. The kimchi tastes super authentic - I'd go back just for the kimchi! I love that they put an entire bucket of green onion on the side so you can add as much as your heart desires.The service is actually pretty great for an Asian restaurant. As a tangent point though, I've found service at Korean restaurants to always be above average, and this place is no exception.This will always be one of my go-tos in LA and now I'll be on the hunt for a place like this on the east coast!"

7/27/2019,5 star rating,"By far one of the best restaurants in LA hands down. Especially growing up in an asian family, han bat knows how to really clean out their soups and also pack a punch of flavor from their tons of bones they boil for hours in their human size pots. I'm lowkey mad that they ended up on the news because now they have an influx of more consumers but also very glad that they are getting the respect they deserve as a hole in the wall restaurant. Service and food always top notch!"
8/31/2017,5 star rating,"This was my first sul lung tang ever! The menus are posted on the wall and they have about 8 items on the menu. I ordered the beef brisket sul lung tang and it came out really quickly which is always a plus! You need to add green onions and salt it yourself. I always worry about over-salting so I added a little salt at a time. It definitely tastes a lot better once you add more salt because it brings out the flavor of the broth more. I loved how the dish was so light but also so flavorful.Overall, this is a great place to grab a light but flavorful meal!"
2/12/2018,5 star rating,"I'm immersing myself in the wonders of real Korean food and this place is the tops. The Shul Lung Tang is so rich and buttery and authentic. I got the soup with beef gogi, and it's changed my life. The kimchi was so spicy and flavorful. The best kimchi I have had but my experience with kimchi is very limited. It's great hangover food, sick food and especially comfort food. You feel good after eating here. Check out this hole in the wall if you get a chance. There's is even parking. Such a great place."
4/10/2013,5 star rating,"Years ago I first tried this place with my husband.  I remember liking it, but we didn't return b/c there was an ant issue and they were crawling all over him.  We gave it another go years ago and since then it is our favorite sullungtang spot.  The broth is perfect...seriously, I haven't had one better yet.  I overdo it on the scallions, but I can't help it, I love that fresh crunch that comes with this soup.  Love their ggakdoogi but not a huge fan of the kimchi.  Service is fast and food is delivered just as quickly.  It gets pretty busy here so I like to go at off times.  There's parking in the back, sometimes there's a valet there.  I try to park at a meter on the street."
12/25/2017,4 star rating,"Simple place. Nothing fancy here, but no need. Just great oxtail broth with different choices of cuts of beef and daikon kimchi & rice on the side. Perfect for what it is, exactly what you want when you're craving soup (as long as you're not vegan or vegetarian)"
5/2/2015,5 star rating,"I've been here twice now, and both times were A-okay! Authentic and quality sul lung tang.Food comes out quickly!I recommend the brisket, because when I had the mixed one, some of the meats were too intense for me.... I think it was the intestine or something. White rice only.If you are driving there, it is pretty hard to find. It's literally a hole in the wall. Just look across the street from Carl's Jr. And there's a small alley that you can drive through to access the parking lot."
1/5/2017,5 star rating,"Talk about home-cooked comfort food. If you've ever grown up with simple, light beef stews, you are going to LOVE this place. I came by with a group of 12 (yes, you read that right) on a holiday weekend after finding out that Ham Ji Park was closed. We were craving their savory pork neck stew and I'm happy to say that Han Bat really hit the spot! Like light, simple meals? This place is for you! :)OVERALL: 5 STARSFOOD: 5 STARSSERVICE: 3.5 STARSSURROUNDINGS: 3.5 STARS--OVERALL | 5 STARSEating here honestly made me feel like I was 6 again, fending off a cold and sipping on my mom's homemade pork stews. If I had to describe their soup it would be this-- pure. comfort. A single sip feels like you're dipping into a soothing hot tub. Simple? Yes. Needs a bit of salt & seasoning? Yes, but that's part of the charm. If I'm ever in LA again and craving a no frills, fuss-free meal, THIS will be the first place on my list.FOOD | 5 STARSFor those curious-- there are two options on the menu: Sul lung tang (which is a soup) and Suyuk (no soup). Don't be dumb-- get the cozy soup.When it comes to my asian soups, I'm a sucker for beef brisket, so the selection was a no-brainer. However, there are 5 options to choose for your sul lung tang. Feeling adventurous? The mixed bowl might be for you! You can even make a game out of it-- which type of meat am I eating right now? Whooo knows-- it's all delicious anyways!A couple things to note-- the food comes out almost instantly (and surprisingly, they do NOT have HUGE vats of soup swimming pools in the kitchen, as per my imagination-- the kitchen is quite small and can be seen from the sidewalk outside, where the cooks are constantly stirring large pots of soup ready-to-eat). For those that are used to the flavorful fushion foods or more commonplace Korean foods, the soup will be a little blander than you're used to. However, all you need is a spoonful (I used 2.5 flat scoops) of salt, which adds a nice richness to the soup. You can also add spices and green onion to your tastes. Overall, the meal has a feel of being very light & clean, as well as healthy. If I had a Korean mom, I feel like this is what I'd grow up eating.Another quick tip-- each sul lung tang comes with a bowl of rice. Do yourself a favor and just dump the rice into the soup. Mix and voila-- you've got yourself a nice rich porridge. For those with larger appetites, feel free to ask for a second bowl of rice to fill you up.SERVICE | 3.5 STARSService was pretty average for any restaurant, although I noticed that the servers are suuper efficient. Your food and side dishes come very quickly. Water is refilled quickly-- EVERYTHING is quick. And yet, it doesn't feel too rushed, like they're trying to kick you out. Overall, rather average, but an extra half star for the superhuman speed. I did also appreciate that even though it was such a small place, we were seated within 15 minutes. They also were willing to convert a regular 4-seated table to seat 6 people by squishing on the edges. Thank you! :)SURROUNDINGS | 3.5 STARSThis place is located in a small little shopping plaza and to be honest, would be easily overlooked if you didn't know what you were looking for. Based on its location, parking might be a little difficult, but not an issue if you're taking Uber!"
6/23/2019,5 star rating,Been coming here since the early 80's. Best Sul Lung Tang in the world! Even better than sul lung tang in Korea! This place has the most unique taste that hasn't been duplicated by anyone. They also serve the best kimchee bar none as well.  I always order the intestines and don't leave a drip of soup in the bowl. Highly highly recommend!

5/3/2018,4 star rating,"Love love love! It's about a half a mile walk from my apartment & I had never had ox bone soup before so decided I would give it a go. I was really sick with a cold and heard how comforting it is and the hype is real. I truly think it made me start to feel better. It def has a hole in the wall vibe & is not a place you would take someone for atmosphere or trendy sights lol. It's on an unassuming street & has a very laid back and friendly feeling. The food comes out pretty quickly & you get two big bowls of cabbage and then radish kimchi plus a tub of green onions, a side of rice, & the soup. They only serve the soup & one other dish so you know it has to be good. I got mine with brisket and after I seasoned it with kimchi, salt, green onion,"
6/3/2017,4 star rating,"Really tasty soup! it's good on its own, but way better if you add some of the spicy paste and other condiments. This place is fine for people who can't eat spicy, but it's definitely better if you do. also there's parking in the back, just fyi. If it's full and so are the streets, park in the parking garage of california market 1 block down b/c it's also free"
8/31/2017,4 star rating,"Come here to find Korean mom and dads and a menu that consists of ox bone soup. The ac in here is nice for the hot la weather and the food is tasty. They have two sides that come with the order. Kimchi and radish. If you're used to eating Asian food I recommend the intestine, tripe, and spleen. Tip: take a bit of red chili paste while eating your meat."
12/20/2017,5 star rating,"Simple, pure comfort food at its best. While bone broth is all the hype in the US now, it has been the key component of Asian cooking for centuries and is known for its heeling power. There could be a line at busy times but turnover is fast. Wish they had kept the smaller portion and lower price though."
12/19/2017,5 star rating,Staff is really friendly and the place has a calm atmosphere to it. I got the chicken noodle soup and thoroughly enjoyed it.

12/12/2017,3 star rating,"3.5 stars.My friend and I both had this place HBSLT bookmarked, so we decided to go check it out last night.The Korean aunties working are great, but the whole place just smelled so bad that it was unappetizing. It was just a pure funk in the air. I don't know if it is the smell of organ meat cooking or if it's a dirty mop that went around the entire store and then some, but I wouldn't put myself through that again. (Shit, and I'm no rookie- I tolerate the smell of boiling tripe when I'm making menudo at home.)The soup is delicious once you doctor it the way you like it, but portions are too small for $11.50, and I'm not a particularly big eater. You get a bowl of rice, cabbage and daikon kimchee, and your bowl of soup with a few meat slices in it. I'm really only here for the soup since I can get the other 3 accoutrements anywhere, and the soup is small :(Checked the box, but it's time to go look for more Korean soup somewhere else."
12/11/2017,4 star rating,"This is one of the oldest original sullungtang place left open in ktown.  All others have closed and disappeared but this place still stands.  The interior design and taste has been the same since 1999 when i was a kid.  Only thing that changed is the price, but what can you do right? The broth is milky and dank and the meat is tender.  Also, their kimchi and radish makes every bite perfect."
12/9/2017,5 star rating,"Came here at 6:30 on a Saturday night and was seated immediately. I got the brisket soup for $11.50. The kimchi and radish kimchi, along with the rice and condiments, arrived first pretty quickly, and like 30 seconds later, the soup arrived. It was so good! There weren't a lot of noodles, which I appreciate, bc I personally like rice better with my sul lung tang. I thought there was a good amount of meat and cabbage, so overall, it was pretty perfect to me. I suggest putting hella green onions and kimchi in the soup!"
12/9/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious, authentic Korean food for a good price. Tastes just like how my mom makes it! Soup came out quickly, staff was friendly, and the place was bustling. Just a bit of advice: pour as much green onion as you can into your bowl from the get go! The little tub of green onions gets passed around, so you might not have access to it later without a little awkward interaction."
2/20/2013,5 star rating,"This place was hard to find! You can't see it from Western. It's on the opposite side of 5th street across from the Carl's Jr. FYI, CASH ONLYI've always been content with my mom's sul lung tang, so I never bothered to look up places that make this because I can get it for free at home. That, however, has changed since I came here for the first time a few weeks ago. This is on par or may even be slightly better than my mom's cooking! I love this place! This is the best sul lung tang in Ktown!The menu is very simple: Two types of Sul lung tang. The Sul lung tang may seem a little bland for people who haven't tried it, but it comes out that way, so you can put the appropriate amount of salt, green onions, and hot pepper taste according to your taste preferences. I'd have to say that this soup beats all the other competition. yelp.com/biz_photos/han-…The kimchi and kakdoogee were delicious too!yelp.com/biz_photos/han-…Parking:Free lot behind the restaurant and a few spots of street parking."
9/20/2015,5 star rating,"Even though they have a small menu, their soup was super delicious. I came with a friend on a Friday afternoon and it was semi-packed. The soup taste really homey especially with the onions and salt to taste! Their kimchi and korean daikon is quality.. So good I will come back again! The only issue is parking which could be quite hard to find a spot."
11/17/2017,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang I've had!! This place is like a little hole in the wall shop that only serves this specialty and it gets quite busy. I usually get the brisket or the mixed sul lung tang. It is the epitome of comfort food - best for when you need a little picker upper, when you are sick, and especially when you are hungover! The milky ox bone broth is so good and only requires a little pinch of salt to bring out the flavor. Add some spice to it if you like but I eat it plain with the rice and free kimchee and pickled ban chon. Always crave this and will be back again and again!"
9/22/2014,5 star rating,It's been a while since the last time we have been to Han Bat and nothing has changed except for the price. The last time it was $8 a bowl and inflation it's $9.64 per bowl. The Sul Lung Tang is as good as ever. There is only one thing on the menu and that is beef soup. The only variation is the meat or innards in the soup. The soup comes with kimchi & kimchi daikon radish cubes and rice. The is parking in the back. Service is minimal. Language is Korean or some finger pointing. Cash Only. Great simple bowl of hot beef soup.
2/17/2017,4 star rating,"There is nothing glamorous, fancy, or decorative about this place or the menu, so when you know a place like this has high reviews, you know it's all about the FOOD. My favorite place to go for sullungtang, paired with some bomb kimchi. What I also enjoy is that you can eat all you want and know you are not eating anything that is horrible for you and still be satisfied! Just some oxtail soup, meat, green onions, and fermented cabbage/radish. Salt to your own tasting!"
7/10/2015,4 star rating,"I came on a rather hot day which was not the smartest move on my part, but the soup was still delicious. The sulungtang is simple yet elegant and really hits the spot. I'll definitely be coming back for more especially on a cold rainy day or when I'm looking for comfort food. The menu is simple, and the service is quick. Remember to bring cash because it's a cash only type of establishment! They also give you diced green onions on the side (add liberally!), and cabbage/radish kimchi. The radish kimchi is AMAZING. Please note that the soup comes ""unflavored"" so they provide salt and red pepper sauce on the side to season to taste. They have a small parking lot in the back (maybe 10-15 spots) that is shared with a hair salon next door and a couple of stores in the same complex. **read: parking may be difficult** However, there are some meter spots on the streets so keep an eye out for those."
1/8/2015,5 star rating,"I've never had Sul Lung Tang before coming here, but I'm glad I did!  Sul Lung Tang is comfort food at its finest and can hold its own versus the other more ""mainstream"" soups, pho and ramen. What's different about Sul Lung Tang is that the broth comes relatively bland in comparison to pho or ramen, but really shines when you add salt and spring onions to taste!Han Bat gives you several choices of meats to add to you me soup from their tiny wall menu. The soup comes quickly after ordering, along with a bucket full of chopped spring onions. Don't be bashful with the amount of onions you add, because when you're spooning in mouthfuls of rice, beef, and broth, the onions quickly disappear. Even after the rice is gone, you can keep on munching on onions and soup. Don't forget to add salt too!Now some caveats: the place is tucked in a small plaza on Western and the parking lot is accessible via a small opening in the street or an even smaller alleyway opening on the cross street. Also the place is cash only. Regardless, I give this place 5 stars because it makes Sul Lung Tang like mom does, or at least i think this is how my mom would've made it if she was Korean."
1/30/2017,5 star rating,"The restaurant is kinda hard to find, but there is parking in the back. Food tastes great and comes out in a timely manner. Banchan is limited to kimchi and radish. The ladies who work here are all very friendly and speak English. Also, I think this place is cash only, but there's an ATM inside the restaurant."
9/12/2017,5 star rating,"Beef bone broth soup $12 and so much yum. It's a slightly cloudy soup with a little bit of glass noodle, veg, and brisket served with a side of rice. Pile on the green onions and put a spoon of salt and you have yourself a nice, delicious bowl of soup. Oh and did I mention the kimchi? They make their own and it's the BEST kimchi I've ever had. I wish I could buy a large container of it and take it home. Throw that grocery kimchi out the garbage and eat the one here."

3/31/2019,5 star rating,"The best place in ktown for sullungtang. It's hearty, tasty, and generous in portion. Their kimchi and kaktuggi goes perfectly with their sullungtang."
5/8/2017,5 star rating,I love this place! Their kimchi radish is so addictive that every time I go I have to get at least 2 refills.  If you like soup then this is the place to go.
4/16/2017,5 star rating,"My all time favorite place to go for Korean ox tail soup.  I always get the mixed meat with tons of green onions inside.  The kimchi goes great with the soup but the best side dish for the soup and rice is the radish kimchi.  Every time I am there I get at least 3 dishes of the radish kimchi.  If you are hungry, cold or hungover this is the place to go to. Must try!"
1/25/2019,5 star rating,"Not really a big fan of soup that I have to season myself but this place, I definitely wouldn't mind.  The broth has amazin, deep flavors, the cabbage kimchi had the right amount of sour and spiciness and the radish kimchi is good too but even more amazing with the soup.  I do come here every now and then, and will still keep going."
1/7/2018,5 star rating,"Totally hit the spot. I was dining solo for a late lunch and still had to wait - it's that popular! This was just what I wanted. Solid sullungtang with both kinds of kimchi on the side. Saw a bunch of people doing take away and lots of Chinese diners too, not just Korean. Word of mouth must have spread far and wide. The ladies who were working the front of house were harried but still managed to wish every person a happy new year when they paid.I wish I lived closer because I'd be here often."
3/4/2015,4 star rating,"OMG the Sul Lung Tang here is the BEST! For those that aren't familiar with Korean food, sul lung tang is a beef bone soup that takes hours and hours of brewing for a bowl of magic. If you are not a big fan of intestines, stomach and other weird parts, make sure you get the soup only with the meat. It will cure any hangover! I personally drink my soup without any salt, but they have a little bowl of salt that you can add yourself."
4/21/2019,5 star rating,Oh my god this soup is so good. This place feeds the soul! It is super barebones so don't expect anything fancy but this way the food shines over all. We get the soup with brisket and extra noodles. It comes with kimchi and delicious rice that you dip into the soup. The service is friendly and warm. Will return regularly to satisfy our Korean soup cravings!
4/21/2018,5 star rating,Omfg Korean Comfort food at its simplest and finest. Get one to go too bc you will want more. Also get the hot barley tea ... it's not watered down! Small portions belies the $12 price tag but it is that worth it. Line moved quickly bc they serve the one thing quickly and basically everyone tucks their head down after throwing a shit ton of green onions from the vat into their soup and scoops away.
11/17/2017,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang I've had!! This place is like a little hole in the wall shop that only serves this specialty and it gets quite busy.

11/12/2017,5 star rating,I love this place!! This is the definition of comfort food. Han Bat Sul Lung Tang specializes in ox bone soup. It's basically soup with rice in it. It sounds very simple but it's very tasty and so good for the soul. There is a parking structure in the back so you can try checking it out to see if there are spots. There might be a bit of a wait but the line tends to go by pretty quickly!!You can pick what kind of meat you want in the soup and it comes out plain. You can add green onions and adjust to your liking with salt and pepper. I love that you can customize it to your preferences because I was able to make mine the ideal saltiness for my taste! Definitely a great place to warm up your tummy or to recover from a night out drinking.
11/11/2017,3 star rating,"I've never had sul lung tang before trying Han Bat's, but I've had my fair share of korean food and I found this dish to be particularly lacking in flavor and underwhelming. My parents' clear bone broth has more flavor than the opaque milkiness of this sul lung tang and I don't know how that's possible. For a soup that appears to be very rich, it ended up tasting very watery. I added a good amount of salt, scallions, and kimchi to my soup hoping to give it more umph but it didn't unveil whatever deliciousness every other Yelper seems to have experienced here.Granted, it was fairly cheap for the amount of food - I was stuffed and left without seeing the bottom of my bowl, and it wasn't terrible, just not as good as I'd expected. I wouldn't recommend Han Bat to anyone else but I wouldn't object to it if I were invited here, so this place is okay."

This is the kind of spot you go to for some real comfort food, especially on a cold day.Highly recommend!"
11/10/2017,5 star rating,"Oh Han Bat. How I love youOn days like this when it's cold and all I want is something soupy, I think of you.

11/7/2017,4 star rating,"This hideaway restaurant is simple and authentic. I always get the mix because I want everything and I'm never disappointed (because it's everything). The dishes are made with the essentials and seasoning is left up to you as giant bins of green onions and salt are left at each table for you to use to your heart's desire, along with the typical small bowls of kimchi, bean sprouts, etc. This place offers the perfect comfort food, especially when it's cold out (if you're like me and get cold out here)."
11/6/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down best Su long tang place EVER! Very authentic and as a Malaysian that's unbiased, I've been to Korea myself and must say that his place beat most of Korea's restaurant! 7 stars! Keep it up guys, regular customer here! :)"
11/5/2017,5 star rating,"I judge every Seolleongtang against this place. They're still number one. What's makes this place special is the quality of ingredients, and their ability to emphasize flavors. Very simple, and extremely tasty.The kimchi is also A+, and complements the soup."
6/30/2017,5 star rating,"This is kind of like In-N-Out - a place you need to visit again and again every few weeks. I love the hearty broth they serve. It warms up your soul and your body like a Christmas fire. They don't give you a lot of sides though. I love that the soup doesn't taste too heavy. If you're ever feeling down, this is the place to be. If you're tired or hungover, please do come here. The service is extremely quick too."
8/4/2017,4 star rating,"mmmmmmmm bone beef soup.  I almost always get the brisket (but every now and then the flank steak is good too)   I just love that you can customize the saltiness to your desire.Sometimes i also dip the kimchee in too to give it a little kick.  Ugh,just great. So quick and tasty."
3/22/2017,3 star rating,"I'm so glad we found parking across the street when we arrived around 12:30pm on a Saturday. Our friends reserved a table for us since they arrived 10 mins before us so we did not have to wait to be seated at all. This place only sells oxtail soup and also meat platers that have liver and intestine kinds of meats. For the soup, you can decide what meat you want in it, so I chose beef brisket. After you order, the waitress brings out kimchi and dikon to eat. Since it is a busy small shop, the workers get upset if you want something changed, so make sure you know what you want when you order. The broth bring lightly seasoned is really an understatement. I don't think there's much to the flavor at all. You have to season it yourself at the table like putting in your own chili sauce and salt. Chili sauce was not spicy at all. It was difficult to season it just right. They also had a big box of onion that you scoop into your soup but they take it away to give to other tables. Overall this place wasn't the greatest experience. I probably wouldn't come back here again. Also, you have to ask for water before they give it to you!"
4/28/2019,3 star rating,"I just think I'm not a fan of oxtail bone soup. As a person who favors concentrated taste, oxtail bone soup definitely didn't suit my needs. I couldn't taste anything but water. But if you haven't tried oxtail bone soup before, then definitely give it a try! I just don't like this kind of soup but I know there are people who do."
3/3/2019,4 star rating,"The kimchi was alright, I liked the radish. I think I'm just not a huge fan of sul lang tang, I found it not tasty at all. My friend liked it though. Overall a good place if you like sul lang tang!"
4/28/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite food in Los Angeles currently. Their soup is very warming to the soul. They give the best kimchi ever (For those who want to try Kimchi try theirs because their kimchi is not too intense as it is not fermented as much). The people working there are nice. Side Note: If you like food with clean taste you'll like this, but if you like strong tasting food you might not like it."
9/28/2014,5 star rating,"I finally gave sul lung tang another shot and I actually enjoyed it much more!The only that was missing was ginger, rice noodles, jalapeño, mint leaves and a lime.  Oh!  And hoisin/sriracha sauce to dip that amazing beef brisket.  It should also cost 1/3 less and come in a bigger ceramic bowl and deeper soup spoons so that more of the broth is captured in one bite.My last recommendation is to move it to Garden Grove.--Im just kidding folks.  Sul lung tang is not Korean pho - it's just Korean comfort soup.  Though my Vietnamese genetics will never find it satisfying, I can imagine how wonderful it is for folks who grew up with it and this place does it well with great ingredients and humble service."
4/30/2017,4 star rating,I was having a really bad day and stomach was hurting. I liked up soup and saw that this place specializes in the soup that generally makes me feel better.  I got it to go and it lasted the hour ride home.At home I got a really good helping of Kimchi and the soup was still warm. If really warmed me up and was a good end to the day.  I hope I can go enjoy their food in person next time!

6/19/2017,5 star rating,We ended up there after a long day of driving and it was the perfect place to have a nice bowl of soup. The ultimate comfort food!
1/19/2019,5 star rating,New go to place for sul lung tang. Always craving after one time. Especially during rainy weather. Fast service. I see why it's been my friends' favorite place since they were little. Definitely wanna go back and try the variety.
12/7/2016,4 star rating,"It's Alexander W. at the bat after a night on the town. Han Bat's Sul Lung Tang is perfect for Los Angeles's non-existent cold weather and nursing a hangover. The milky white ox bone soup is light and comforting. You can add green onions and salt to suit your taste. The wallet friendly meal comes with your choice of meats (in the broth), rice, and well-flavored kimchi."
3/25/2019,5 star rating,"The best Sul Ling Tang in town.  The radish kimchi is also very good.  This is the good that I don't mind driving from Pasadena to K town to have.  My kids also love the soup.  The servers are nice they would split one order of the soup into two separate bowls for my two little girls to share.  There is always a line at lunch or dinner time.  If you want to just pick up and go home to eat, you can call in advance and they will prepare for you."
4/21/2020,5 star rating,Best comfort food. Usually a wait but worth it. Radish kimchi is the best part. We always get seconds.
11/2/2016,5 star rating,"Oxtail broth -- the shining knight of comfort food. Add spoonfuls of green onion, slurp up the delicate light soups, and chow down on a bowl of white rice with sides of pickled radish and kimchi while using flat silverware chopsticks. Legit establishment that I plan on frequenting whenever I am in the area. Yums!"
5/16/2020,1 star rating,I would prefer eating sullingtang kookbop at HaeMaRu because the price is reasonable with breakfast special.  Han bat no breakfast special and very pricey
1/31/2011,5 star rating,"This place is Korean food royalty! If you want to treat yourself to the best seolleongtang or Korean beef brisket, ox bones and entails soup, this is the only place you need to go. The soup is revered, it is so good.For only seven bucks, you will be treated to a rich, beefy, tasty broth that is like no other. Even in Korea town - Los Angeles, this place has no peers. And you will be hard-pressed to find a person who has tried the soup that would disagree with me. Han Bat is simply the best!"
4/25/2008,5 star rating,"Owww...my favorite place for Korean beef brisket soup!  The best Seolleongtang I've tried outside of my mom's.  It's really still a hole in the wall but well known for its soup, so parking is always a challenge.  I think it's worth the effort.  After you've found a seat and tried the soup, I'm certain you'll agree. :)"
5/4/2015,4 star rating,"Anyonghaseyo! The only Korean phrase I know but I was able to get by. The menu had English translation so thank goodness and the concept is pretty easy. Menu is concise, which is good because they do what they're good at. My fiancé and I got the mixed and brisket sullungtang, which came with unlimited kimchi and radish. So the soup base is pretty bland, and you basically add salt, pepper, onions and kimchi to add flavor to your liking. I realized I like a lot of flavor in my soup bc I dumped the whole bowl of kimchi in lol. It was very tasty and all the meat was yummmm. I think I ate brisket, intestine, tripe and spleen? *shrug, whatever it was, it was good. I wish they gave more meat though... Service was super fast! We got our food literally in less than five minute of ordering! You can get street parking or go through the alley way to the parking lot behind the restaurant. The place is small though so it's easily missed. But it's right across the street from Carl's Jr"
12/8/2011,5 star rating,"I've been coming here for over 25 years, and among Koreans, this is the only place in LA to get real authentic sul-lung-tang... Although for some reason, Han Bat spells it ""shul lung tang"" which absolutely is phonetically incorrect. Seriously, take out the fucking H for crying out loud (See Photo). Han Bat has only two items on their menu, sul-lung tang and soo-yook. Sul-lung-tang is beef soup that is prepared by slow-cooking bones and beef over a long ass period of time. If done in the way that the ancestral Koreans prepared this dish, the broth should have a milky color and a hearty taste. What I have been told from my wife's ajumma friends (ajumma = Korean women aged 30 or above), some lesser sul-lung-tang places add milk to their soup to fabricate the milky effect of the authentic soup. Because, to put it bluntly, not everyone has the time to cook soup for hours. Therefore, never order this dish at Korean restaurants where they have more than 20 items on their menu (i.e. that 24-hour place on Olympic) because sul-lung-tang isn't fast food. Soo-yook is boiled beef, which is also the beef that goes into the soup. Except if you order the soo-yook dish you get beef without the soup. I've never ordered the soo-yook here and to be honest, I have never seen anyone else order this dish either. In other words, stick to the fucking soup.  Going back to the sul-lung-tang, you choose the type of beef that you want in the soup and then you add a bowl of white rice directly into the soup that consists of beef and clear noodles. Although, I suppose you could eat the rice separately, but that is so un-Korean. As for the soup, there are a total of five meat options to choose from: brisket, flank, tongue, offal (intestine, tripe, and spleen), and mixed (all of the above). Depending on the mood I personally like the brisket or the mixed. However, beware, the offal meats are rich so if this is your first time, stick to the brisket or flank.By itself the broth is bland so you will need to add salt. Moreover, you can add black pepper, scallions, or a red paste marinade to the soup. Also, you may notice that some Koreans, the ones recovering from hangovers, actually pour in the broth from the kimchi that is served with the soup directly into the dish. Personally, I like to keep my soup milky white.Speaking of kimchi, that is all you get as banchan here, so please don't come here expecting a million side dishes like those AYCE places. Han Bat serves two spicy kimchis - cabbage kimchi and daikon radish kimchi. Both are delicious and well-fermented. In fact, I think in general, kimchi that is served at Korean soup restaurants are deliberately over-seasoned to compensate for the blandness of the broth. Definitely bring some Trident to cover up the ensuing garlic breath. I guess the best way to describe sul-lung-tang is to call it Korean Pho. However, unlike pho where you can customize it with millions of add-ons, sul-lung-tang just needs salt and pepper and some really good kimchi. So ""shul lung"" as I live in LA, this is the only sul-lung tang restaurant that I will be dining at. * Han Bat is one of the oldest Korean restaurants in Los Angeles and there is a reason why it is still around. ** Being old school however, they accept cash only. *** With tax and what not, an order of sul-lung-tang comes out to exactly $9."
6/10/2009,5 star rating,"Sul Lung Tang is Korea's best answer to pho, though you can hardly compare the two on an equal playing field.  Pho would be equal to having a handful of silver after a day of drinking, and sul lung tang would be diamonds, people, DIAMONDS.  Suh Lung Tang, if made right, is boiled with ox bone for hours upon hours, whereupon the color of the soup turns a cloudy white, after all that wholesome goodness from the bone and flavor is boiled into the broth.  The bowl comes out hardly salted, but you can taste the natural flavor of the boiled contents.  Broth, brisket, and glass noodles are all that come.  Then you get to choose your own adventure, and add as much green onions, sea salt, chili paste.  My favorite is to add that delicious, delicious kkak doo gee sauce.  Yes, people, add that kimchee juice.  It makes the soup BOMB, flavor explosion in your mouth.  Add the rice or eat it along with your rice.  Drink, savor, enjoy, bask in the glow of steam rising from the bowl.  Don't skimp out on eating the kkak doo gee (radish kimchee) and regular kimchee (cabbage).  It is some of the best I've stumbled upon in these parts of town, and believe me, I've stumbled quite often in this town.  While in the moment (I was so ecstatic), I said it was better than my friend Ted K.'s mom's kimchee, but I have to retract that statement at this point in time.  Nothing trumps a jar of fresh kimchee made from that mother, sorry!  The best part of the broth?  You don't even have to be hung over to appreciate the flavors.  And when you are hung over, well, it may just be a sweet slurp of heaven."
8/6/2017,5 star rating,This place is simple and straight forward! I love it! It's my place for Korean soup! You get a huge bowl and unlimited green onions! I love the green onions!! I usually fill my whole bowl with them. Great place for some old fashioned soup! Pro tip: ask for sides if you want!
10/30/2017,4 star rating,I was visiting from New york and I saw that this place has amazing reviews so I decided to check it out. The food here is extremely authentic and the broth is very comforting. Their Kimchi is delicious. I've had a lot of kimchi and this one was one of my favorites. It is flavorful but not in a strange pungent way like some of the ones I've had. There was a lot of people going in and out and since they only serve soup the menu decision making process was really quick. I got the mix beef soup and originally it was a little bland. There are lots of cut up scallions for you to put in the soup to give it more flavor. I like to put the kimchi in my soup to give it some more flavor. Overall I can see why they had such great reviews as the soup is fantastic but they were in a rush to get you out of the restaurant. I wanted to enjoy my food but they were in such a rush that it wasn't as enjoyable as I would have hoped.
12/18/2017,5 star rating,Definitely best comfort food ever.. simple menu list.. super savory soup.. partner with rice and kimchi.. you'll never get wrong.. i love how simple their dishes but it is soo good.. before they only accept cash now they accept cards too.. fast service.. most of the time their full but its ok.. this place is a must when you go to koreatown
1/31/2015,5 star rating,"Best Sul Lung Tang that you can get in Korea town. Also, I think it tastes better than most Sul Lung Tang in Korea. Price is reasonable and service is ok. The restaurant could be a little cleaner. You can wait some time during dinner and lunch time but not longer than thirty minutes."
4/5/2018,5 star rating,Nice service and good foodParking is located behind the restaurant.Price was good and their kimchi and kakdogi was perfectTiP- If you need more rice just ask it is free =)
7/31/2017,5 star rating,"This is my favorite Sul Lung Tang, ever.  The broth is so simple,  rich and delicious. I love that they have the option for you to go safe (beef) or adventurous (intestines). Better yet, get the mixed option and it comes with a little bit of both. Add a little bit of salt and a LOT of scallions, and you're in heaven. If you haven't been to Han Bat, please do yourself a favor and go."
9/10/2017,4 star rating,"As someone who has grown up in a Korean household eating sul lung tang at least once a month, I don't know how biased my opinion is about this place. I am a huge fan of soup and rice....it can be any nice, warm, soup with some rice and kimchi and I'll be very content. So of course I love Han Bat!! I would say what sets them apart from other sul lung tang places is the fact that they have clear noodles (as opposed to the white ones at Young Dong) and their bomb dot com kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi). My only complaint would be that I wish they had a bit more noodles. But then again, that's not the point of the dish so I understand.I usually get number 2, just brisket. When you get your soup, you can put in as much green onion, salt, and pepper as you want. Make sure to add the salt a little bit at a time and taste it so that you don't accidentally put too much! I've come at times when they're super busy, and the line is just out the door. At those times, it's hard to find parking and the wait is really long. I'd say it's not really worth the wait....but maybe that's because I can come often. If it's your few days in LA, and you want to try one really good sul lung tang place in ktown, then yes it's worth the wait. Hopefully you come on an emptier day though! In my experience, Sundays at 1pm have been the best so far. The service is very fast. Once, the total time from when I walked in to when I walked out was about 30 minutes. That's including getting seated, choosing what to eat, ordering, etc. The waitresses are nice enough, but sometimes it's hard to get their attention for more kkakdugi/water.I would come here for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late night. LOL. Sul lung tang is always appropriate."
3/14/2019,5 star rating,I'll come to this place often for a traditional breakfast. Love it! Fresh ingredients and Quick service and very much what you expect! Nothing much else other than that I love it here.

1/3/2017,4 star rating,"Very solid standard of food for a reasonable price. The mixed bowl comes with all the cuts of beef mixed together and I liked all of them except for the spleen (but I tend not to like spleen, liver, or any innards with the more grainy consistency).Very good value at $10.87 + tax"

10/7/2014,5 star rating,"I remember when I was a young I use to come here with my parents, so this is a part of my childhood. Things haven't changed much maybe the interior had some updates and they still have the same delicious sul lung tang. Since I was a little kid my parents ordered the mixed deliciousness so it is engraved in my system to do the same. The sul lung tang mixed with intestine, tripe, and other goodies is my go to comfort food. Make sure to put in tons of green onions & some salt don't go to crazy, everything taste better with a bit of msg lol. I love sprinkling some pepper in my soup. Oh the kimchi is out of this world :-) the radish kimchi is my favorite!!!! I love putting the sauce in my sul lung tang :-)This place have gotten so popular and the turnaround for a table is quick. If you can't stand waiting just take one to go. Parking can be a nightmare though, good luck finding street parking and the back parking lot may be full. The nice guy can valet your car or you can risk parking at Carl's Jr. I strongly recommend you don't ;-)"
9/5/2015,5 star rating,"Trust my Korean taste buds--it's safe to say that this restaurant ROCKS. Service was SUPER fast, I think we got our food within 5 minutes of ordering. And the sul lung tang!! LOVED IT.The restaurant is a little difficult to find, and the parking lot pretty full as well. But that won't stop me from coming back for their sul lung tang again!"
1/2/2017,5 star rating,"This place has been here for over 20 years. Been eating here since the 90s. No restaurant stays in business that long unless it has mastered an aspect of a niche. For Han Bat, it's their soup(s), and yes, they have mastered it.Fast service, great food and a relaxed eating environment. For $10 you can't go wrong... period.Also, this place has some of the best kimchi in K-town. I always leave happy after eating here."
7/17/2017,5 star rating,"Really good authentic Korean food. My friend took me here and I tried the flank and the tongue. Although Korean food was new to me, my friend has had Korean food is Asia and assured me that this is as good as it is overseas. I am definitely going to go back."
6/11/2016,5 star rating,"YUM. This was my first sul lung tang ever! So we came on a Friday around 5:30pm and it was empty. Hat Bat is very mom and pop which I really like. The menus are posted on the wall and they have about 8 items on the menu. I ordered the beef brisket sul lung tang and it came out really quickly which is always a plus! You need to add green onions and salt it yourself. I always worry about over-salting so I added a little salt at a time. It definitely tastes a lot better once you add more salt because it brings out the flavor of the broth more. I loved how the dish was so light but also so flavorful. I am now a big sul lung tang fan and can't wait to have it again! It was ~$10 and came with kimchi and picked radish/daikon? Overall, this is a great place to grab a light but flavorful meal!"

5/6/2015,5 star rating,"HBSLT does not mess around - it does a few things spectacularly well and that's ALL. I love the purity of it :) PARKING: Shared lot north of the restaurant. There's restaurant access from the lot. FOOD: brisket soup: this is perfect for a cold day. you customize the saltiness of the soup with salt from the table. don't forget the green onions and the kim chee! you can essentially create your own meal because you're given the soup (which contains the brisket and glass noodle), a bowl of rice, and a free for all of toppings (radish, green onion, salt, and kim chee). SERVICE:Korean aunties always have the best and most respectful service :) there's a slight language barrier, but some of the menus do have english translations.LOVE ktown and its hole in the wall gems!"
7/10/2017,3 star rating,"I walked into a tiny little place with an unpleasant unidentifiable smell that eventually faded as we sat down. We entered through the parking lot so I didn't know there was a rule to stay back by the door until we were called, but we weren't yelled at. We were seated quite quickly and the turnaround is very quick, but don't expect great service. Our server came to take our order of the Salgogi and never smiled as our menus were taken away. (She only returned to drop off the check and collect our money) The kimchi and radishes along with white rice and a container of green onions were dropped off first. The condiments are left on the table to flavor your broth, which I had no idea you had to do yourself.Our soup arrives, and I immediately dumped in the green onions and kimchi as there was no flavor to the soup. Again, you need to add the condiments yourself to your liking. Adding salt, the paste and kimchi made it better but I found the radishes made the broth and enhanced the brisket quite nicely. They give a good quantity of beef but the noodles were non existent. The meal will fill you up and it was nice to experience a new bookmark, however I just wasn't a fan."
10/1/2017,4 star rating,"Like my mother's - and that says a lot.  Hole in the wall place - dont expect anything fancy.  Perfect soup for people looking to warm themselves up on a cold night.  All they serve is sul lung tong, white rice and kimchee.  Their kimchee was okay, but their radishes were much better!Wish they serve whole grain rice or brown rice, though."
5/21/2011,4 star rating,"Came here with extremely high expectations after reading the amazing reviews on here and was a tad bit disappointed when we walked in and the restaurant was essentially empty (I guess we did come at an off hour) and there were flies flying around near the entrance/kitchen. The restaurant did have a very authentic feel to it though-- I felt like I was back in Korea. I ordered the beef flank and brisket sul lung tang, my friend ordered the combination with everything in it (including spleen, intestines and tripe). I tried both and personally liked the flank/brisket broth a lot better! The combination one had a very distinct intestine flavor to it! The sul lung tang here comes unsalted so you have to add your own sea salt to taste! At each table, there's a container of salt, container of chopped green onions and a container of spicy paste. I added a TON of onions and spicy paste to my soup and barely any salt. It turned out to be delicious and extremely flavorful! Overall, although the restaurant did not seem as clean as it probably should be, the food was great!Lastly, this place is cash only so come prepared!"
9/13/2016,5 star rating,"A restaurant that has only two things on the menu - sul lung tang and suyuk - has to be an expert in these two items, and Hanbat is definitely THE place to go to for sul lung tang. I can't express how overjoyed I was to find out that there's a naejang option (naejang = internal organs = intestines, tripe, tongue, lung = a BIG YES for me), in addition to the standard/default brisket. This broth is so delicious, it has depth and not overly seasoned (you can add more salt and pepper as per your own taste preference). I love the big tub of chopped scallions on every table, add however much you want. And every table gets a complimentary banchan of cabbage kimchi (it's good) and radish kimchi (watch out, this is very strong and pungent). Simple, straightforward, absolutely delicious. It's THE BEST sul lung tang that I've ever had. So good that after the first few sips I made the decision to order an extra one to go because I knew I'd be wanting more of this for my next meal.At $10.10 a bowl though, the portion served was smaller than I'd anticipated but it filled me up adequately anyway and I finished everything down to the very last drop. Definitely will come back again the next time I'm in K-Town. OH, CASH ONLY!"
3/14/2017,4 star rating,"My first time having this and it was really good! I got the beef brisket soup. The soup is plain so you have to add whatever you want to it. There's chili paste, salt & green onions provided for you. The soup also came with a bowl of rice, kimchi & pickled radishes. The kimchi and radishes was SO GOOD! I couldn't stop eating the pickled radishes. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Koreatown & craving this!"
8/13/2016,4 star rating,"Really tasty authentic sullungtang. Every table is stocked with green onions (necessary) and a thing of salt. I've come back for the food but they really should expand. Restaurant is really small and due to its popularity, there is always a group of people huddled by the door, staring at those who are eating in a subtle but not-so-subtle attempt to get them to hurry the fawk up.Parking is pretty cramped too.Other than that, service is quick, and you can't beat the traditional sullungtang they serve here."
1/4/2016,5 star rating,"The sul lung tang here is exquisite. You really can't ask for more. I came with a party of 3 and we were seated instantly and the food came within 5 minutes of ordering. The service is fast, dependable, and efficient and I didn't have to ask for anything more regarding the meal. Decent size portions even for me (6'1, over 200 pound guy). You got the kimchi, pickled turnip, bowl of rice, and the glorious sul lung tang, filled with your preference of chopped green onions and salt. The quality of the meat is awesome and the broth is flavorful with each spoonful of sul lung yes tang. All for a reasonable price of $10. Excellent spot to go to lunch with your friends, excellent spot in general. Only downside is that it can be a bit crowded, but I think that's a testament to the success of this place.Definitely will come when I can!"
11/6/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down best Su long tang place EVER! Very authentic and as a Malaysian that's unbiased, I've been to Korea myself and must say that his place beat most of Korea's restaurant! 7 stars! Keep it up guys, regular customer here! :)"
9/16/2017,4 star rating,Probably my favorite sul lung tang place. The broth is really deep. You can tell it's been boiled for hours. The portions are perfect. They give you more meat compared to other places. Make sure you add salt and pepper to your liking. And be careful don't over salt!Not the nicest customer service but also not rude. Just seems very busy. The one thing that can use improvement is the restrooms.But who goes to restaurants to use restrooms anyways.
12/30/2017,5 star rating,"I first found this gem on one of my trips visiting LA. It is hands down, the single best sullung tang experience I've ever had in my entire life. Now that I live in LA, I come here as often as I can.If you're wary of sullung tang, due to prior bland and watery experiences, this place will blow you away with its rich and flavorful broth and hearty, authentic meat options.A standard order of sullung tang comes with rice, kimchi, radish kimchi.Their ban chan selection is small, kimchi and radish kimchi. However, it's some of the best kimchi and radish kimchi I've ever had in a restaurant.FYI at the time I'm writing his review, I'm currently driving to Han Bat Sullung Tang.Their parking situation is a little bit difficult. They have a small lot in the back and meters on the street."
7/25/2014,4 star rating,"The beef soup here is amazing.Looking at their menu, you see two categories: beef soup and boiled beef. Yes, that's it! That's the whole menu! (Don't be surprised like how I did :D) Under each category, there is a list of meat you can choose from. The beef meats they serve are very fresh, not those frozen ones. I recommend the brisket because it tastes so good in the soup along with rice noodles. I don't like the tongue with the soup. It felt like I was French kissing the cow when I was eating it because the fresh meat texture was softer.. Kinda gross... Oh if you don't like the taste of green onion or you don't want your soup to be too salty, no problem, they set the green onion and salt aside for you. You put as much as you want. Simply one of the best beef soup I ve ever tasted. This place is very small and kinda ghetto.. You have to look a bit for it. Do street parkings."
9/6/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down best sullungtang...in the world! I tried the sullungtang on two occasions, once when I had it to-go and once at the restaurant. I will say when I got it to-go, the meat cooked in the hot soup for too long that it got all soft and crumbly and I didn't really like it too much. I liked eating at the restaurant much better because of the unlimited kkakddogee. We parked at the Carl's across the street and walked over."
9/5/2017,4 star rating,Delicious and fast service. Servers are friendly and got you with the green onion and salt :) open in the morning for breakfast! Valet service but you can find street parking around the neighborhood
9/3/2017,3 star rating,"Hm.... I would hope to like this place because I like Korean soup.. and it looks like a local mom and pop shop, but I have to say the soup was underseasoned. I don't know if that's what authentic Korean soup should taste like, like I made some soup at home myself and forgot to put salt at the end? I don't know, but all of us just thought it was ok and wasn't living up to the hype from the Yelp reviews. However, the soup does have a beefy flavor and the milkiness from cooking bones in water for a long time, which is supposed to be nutritional and nourishing.We liked the kim chi, but it wasn't like something we never had before. I also wish there were more banchan, but we were given only 3 or 4.I love the whole jar of green onions she put on the table for us though. I put a lot.... A LOT.The tang is their specialty here so that's all the menu is about. My quest for the best tang in K-Town continues. If you know a good spot, please message me!Update: I was messaged by some Yelpers telling me about how I'm supposed to salt the soup. I've cooked soup myself before. Even with salt this soup still wouldn't have blown my mind. I'd definitely enjoy it more, but overall I think there's just a lack of depth of flavor in the soup. For a restaurant rated so high, I was really hoping for more."
8/31/2017,4 star rating,"Come here to find Korean mom and dads and a menu that consists of ox bone soup. The ac in here is nice for the hot la weather and the food is tasty.

8/28/2017,5 star rating,"This is a very simple type of meal. It is based on soup and rice - and that's it. It doesn't SOUND like it would be very tasty, but it actually is quite satisfying. You can choose your soup base (I like to get the regular plain base) and adjust the soup according to taste. They have peculiar salt and pepper and condiments at the table. Don't hesitate to try them! What they give also doesn't seem like it would be filling, but trust me - the rice is just enough to complement the soup and leave you full and satisfied. Warning: if you're trying to go on a no-rice diet, this is not the place for you. You can't eat the soup with some rice!! (At least I can't.)The restroom was a little dirty, but I didn't expect much - it's in ktown."

8/23/2017,4 star rating,During a visit to LA we were set on trying something authentic in Koreatown. This place did not disappoint! No frills atmosphere and menu but we got exactly what we were looking for on our visit. The simple menu on the wall was helpful for those (like us) that aren't very familiar with this cuisine. The soup and the sides were all very yummy and flavorful. Glad we stopped in by recommendation of yelpers.
8/22/2017,5 star rating,"If I lived in LA, I would eat here every other day. Unfortunately I live in SF with sad depressing choices for sul lung tang. So if I'm in LA this is where you will find me at 9am hungover or not!"
8/22/2017,5 star rating,The soup is amazing here!! It will cure any hangover or cold! The service was fast and speedy. Probably took 5 minutes or less to get our food from the time we ordered. The kimchi is on point. The only bad thing i would say is that it was so busy you feel pressured to eat fast and leave fast. The turn over rate per table was probably 15-20 max. So if you're trying to sit and talk this place probably isn't the best place.
8/19/2017,5 star rating,"This place is a gem! Their soup broth is delicious. Even my picky nephew and 6 month old even ate the soup and loved it. We don't live in Los Angeles, but next time we are in town...WE WILL BE BACK!!!"
1/16/2017,4 star rating,"Great Sullungtang  place!Sullungtang is a Korean ox bone soup.It's boiled and simmered usually 24 hrs - 3 days.It's white, very comforting, and is the soul food of Korea. The menu is very simple.When I took my non-Korean friends here, they ordered the mixed Sullungtangand they freaked out when they tasted the tongue. It's very grimy and not many people like it.If it's your first time trying this, or you don't like eating things you don't know, I would recommend ordering the brisket one.How to eat the soup:When your soup comes, the waitress will give you a tub of green onions. You can add as many as you like, and add salt and pepper to taste.The soup is usually made without it being seasoned. You'll get two side dishes, kimchee (spicy napa cabbage) and  Kkakdoogi (spicy radish)If you like eating something spicy, a lot of Koreans likes to pour the sauce from kkakdoogi into the soup. The kimchee sauce tends to be a bit fishier so for sullungtang the spicy radish sauce works best.Pro tip for this place:You can ask for more broth (free)You can ask for more  DhangMyun - Sweet potato noodles (free) and like any other restaurants, you can ask for more kimchee and spicy radish for free!This is the best sullungtang place in LA that I tried so far! I highly recommend it. It's not as good as the ones I had in South Korea (hence the 4 stars)but nevertheless, the waitresses are all so kind, and the food is great. : - )- nak"
7/7/2017,5 star rating,"My favotite sul lung tang place.  Sal gogi, with extra radish.  Hits the spot!!!I just wish my stomach is bigger so i can eat more.  I haven't found a better place for sul lung tang in LA.My dad says it reminds him of his favorite place from back in korea, (he said he ate it for lunch every day at work)."
10/25/2016,5 star rating,"I always make a stop here if I'm in Koreatown. No matter how full I feel, I need to either eat a bowl of this there or take it to-go.I've been going here since I was really little and it never disappointed me since. The service is great and the food is just outstanding. I used to come here a lot for hangover cures (it really works).This restaurant truly deserves 5 whole stars. Starting from their service effort to their delicious food."
1/12/2017,4 star rating,"Hanbat is straight up just sul lung tang. There are no appetizers, no BBQ, no rice dishes, no b.s. Just straight up delicious sul lung tang and kimchi. If you have never tried this before, I recommend ordering the beef brisket sul lung tang."
12/24/2019,5 star rating,I know I can always get a table the food is really good and clean and the service is great. The side dishes quality are super super yummy and it's a no fuss kind of place
1/13/2019,5 star rating,The best sul lung tang in the city.  We have relatives from Korea that insist on coming here because it is better than what they can find in Seoul.  I suppose that means Han Bat is a candidate for best in the world.
11/30/2018,5 star rating,"Simply yummy, filling soup. The flank is my favorite. Banchan is also simple and delicious. Enough said!"
1/22/2017,4 star rating,This place has the most consistent tasting sul lung tang in K-town. It's a hole-in-the-wall so it could be a tough find but well worth trying if you're craving sul lung tang. The place is known for providing ample amounts of kimchi/radish and for delivering the food efficiently. The soup is milkier and will definitely taste better on the colder days.
5/12/2017,5 star rating,"Best bone soup place in downtown LA for sure, the broth taste soooooo good!!! you get to add sea salt and onion on your own, which you can totally control the saltiness, I am not a huge kimchi fan, so i don't really have a good credibility on that, but it was definitely on the better side.  You get to choose the type of meat you want in your bowl, and you can always choose the combination that has a bit of everything (this is what i order majority of the time).  The place is not overly crowded due to their fast table turn over rate.  Service is not the best, but you don't expect high end service at this price range.Overall a 5 star restaurant for sure, because of its outstanding food and reasonable price, this is a must-go place if you're around K-Town and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed~"
9/29/2016,4 star rating,"Ox Tail Beef Brisket ($10.10) - very light and simple but very easy for the stomach to digest and not very fatty.  Eat the broth with rice, add a lot of green onion, salt and pepper to taste.  Personally I like to add the chili paste and the sauce from the pickled radish.  This is a very comforting meal if you are looking for something to clear your mind, throat, and cure a sickness."
3/3/2019,5 star rating,"If you're in Koreatown and want some good soup and rice, this is the place to be. Perfect broth, perfect kimchi, perfect radish kimchi, perfect for both Koreans and non-Koreans to enjoy this Korean dish. I recommend putting that radish kimchi into your soup and mixing it with rice! That's the way I eat it :)"
3/3/2017,5 star rating,"Seriously the best comfort food ever. If you're ever in doubt of where to eat, you cannot go wrong with this place! One of my friends actually comes here on a weekly basis, that's how good it is! As for me, I've been here twice and both times ordered the soup with beef brisket. You can customize the soup to your liking (by adding green onion and/or salt), and it leaves you feeling very satisfied without feeling gross. I would recommend coming later at night (8:45 P.M. was when we went) to avoid a wait. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"
9/21/2017,4 star rating,"My first time eating here last night. I was in the neighborhood and hungry and looking for something on the cheaper side - yelp lead me here. Good choice. I went with the least adventurous option and just got the soup w/ flank steak (no organ meats plz). The broth has a rich texture, but very mild in flavor. They provide sea salt, chopped green onion, and black pepper so you can season to your own taste. Served with white rice, cabbage kimchi, and radish kimchi. Very filling meal for $11.50I plan on coming back again."
2/26/2017,5 star rating,"So thankful that I live walking distance to this place. This is a no frills establishment that specializes in one thing: bone marrow soup, the kind that your grandma or mom makes all day in a huge ass pot. All you need is a side of kimchi and radish and you're set. I usually order the brisket so don't waste time looking at the one page menu. It's an OG ktown spot so please don't come looking for the best service or camp out with your laptop. Sit, eat, pay and bow goodbye to the hard working emos/ajumahs."
1/28/2017,5 star rating,"Oh, how I love Han Bat. I have fond childhood memories of my mom taking me here on cozy Sundays. I grew up to this place and have been going here for over 25 years. There is absolutely nothing fancy or glamorous about this place. It is a hole-in-the-wall joint that literally serves two things (soup [their specialty] or meat dish). Service is nothing to sing about either. In the end, it really is the food that keeps its constant flow of customers coming in. The milky meat broth comes unflavored, so make sure to add salt, pepper, chili paste, kimchi, and/or scallions to your liking. It is perfect for those cold, winter evenings (as well as spring/winter/summer).The only ""issue"" is that the price seems to be increasing alarmingly fast, but I guess this comes with the territory of the rising popularity. I will continue frequenting Han Bat as it has claimed a special place in my heart."
2/23/2017,4 star rating,My go to sulungtang place. It's simple - lots of green onions + yummy kimchi makes the soup! Perfect hangover cure but I could eat this everyday..!!
10/6/2019,5 star rating,"We first heard of this place from Worth it and were in LA so we stopped by on our food crawl. Finding it was easy, and parking was plenty. It is definitely a hole-in-the-hole kind of place with a humble entrance. Don't expect it to be all polished and sophisticated. For Asian people come to a place for the food, and the food only. We don't care if the restaurant looks good or not. Once we walked in, we were seated promptly, as the restaurant was not to crowded. We all ordered the brisket suhlungtang. Staff was friendly, and the interior was clean. The kimchee and rice were served first, and the soup followed soon after. You are expected to dress your soup the way you like it, and salt and green onions are provided on the table, as well as chili paste and pepper. The soup was delicious with some salt and scallion added. It was perfect for me as I had a cold, and the hot, rich broth is excellent for a cloudy day. The meaty, rich flavor just coats every taste bud in your mouth in an incredibly satisfying way. We left the restaurant with both our souls and stomachs filled. A delicious, family run joint that we will definitely return to again."
4/27/2017,3 star rating,"CC accepted. The Suh lung tang was great, but the the radish kimchi and the nappa  kimchi was just ok. The radish kimchi seasoning was really good.. it the radish was crisp and crunchy.. it was thready... and the nappa kimchi was good.. but not fermented enough. I'd come back but I would also try other Suh lung tang places."
11/4/2016,5 star rating,"I'm a huge fan of Korean comfort food, & this place is one of my favorites. It's simple, but very good. And it's good for all occasions & at any time in the day. There's plenty of seating, so when you come in you can usually find a table right away. It's good for small groups of about 2-5ish. It does get busy during peak hours, though, especially during weekends. The menu is simple, you pick the meat you want with your soup, then you get a number of sides including green onions, rice, radish, & kimchi. I usually go with the brisket. You'll have enough to be satisfied, but not too full.Service is pretty good, especially for a restaurant in KTown. Parking in KTown is always a bit difficult, but there's usually spots open in the back of the restaurant. They take both card & cash.This is definitely about to become one of my regular spots to visit."
4/10/2014,5 star rating,"WARNING: CASH ONLYI couldn't agree more with all the praises being sung for this place.I was taken here by a group of Korean friends, and it definitely is now somewhere I will come back to whenever I can round up some Koreans to translate the menu for me :).All of the items seem to be a sort of Ox bone soup, a classic korean dish.  It comes with Kimchi, pickled radish(tastes almost exactly like kimchi), and a bowl of rice.  You mix your rice and kimchi in the soup, and it's almost like some amazing, wonderful  korean porridge.You also get a giant container of chopped green onion and salt to add to your bowl of soup to add to taste.Honestly, this place is amazing, more so because of it's extremely simple menu. They know their strengths and play to them! Amazing!"
7/13/2017,5 star rating,"Omg this place is so good!! Very simple menu, literally only sells beef bone soup that comes with rice and few pickled dishes. You season it yourself with salt and chili peppers, and green onions. Price is decent too. I would definitely come here again."
7/27/2016,5 star rating,"It amazes me that so many restaurants in koreatown specialize in only one thing and manage to stay in business. Not only has this place stayed open only selling sul lung tang, they are famous for it. First of all what is with these whiny reviewers complaining about how bland this soup is? It's made bland on purpose so that you can flavor it to your liking hence the salt, pepper, chili flakes, and green onions that they give to you. Also you can do what every Korean kid does and drop a few radish kimchi cubes into your soup for more flavor, however I'll warn you that once you do this the flavor of your soup will be forever changed.... I appreciate their quick service, quality ingredients, and delicious kimchi! Seriously some Korean restaurants will give you kimchi that is too sour or too green, but that has never happened here. I guess the owners know that since they only sell one product that each component must be perfect."
1/8/2017,4 star rating,"A small hole in the wall but the food was great...  Did you know the father of the owner used to have a famous soup restaurant in Daejeon, Korea...  same name as this place.... good to see family tradition moved to LA"

3/10/2019,2 star rating,"Honestly, the food was good but it wasn't outstanding in any way. Service is TERRIBLE. I had to ask about 5 times just to get water and sometimes the lady working would just ignore me. Also had to ask a few times for chopsticks. I don't need amazing service or anything. I just need to have basics like water and utensils... I know it's popular with a lot of Koreatown locals but I don't see why."
1/14/2019,5 star rating,"FOOD - Korean comfort food at its best! This place specializes in Sul Lung Tang (oxtail soup). It's healthy, light in flavor, and the perfect meal to have when it's cold outside. Some people will say it doesn't have taste, but that is how the dish is prepared. It's meant to be very light and healthy for you because there is no MSG or unhealthy additives. They also give you salt and pepper so you can control how much you want to add. They have some of the BEST HOMEMADE KIMCHI I've ever had. ItThe radishes were also amazing. SERVICE - The second we finished our kimchi plate, the lovely staff immediately brought more kimchi for us!! Everyone was friendly and sweet regardless of how busy the restaurant was.

8/10/2017,5 star rating,"This place is awesome. It's a quintessential little ethnic joint. I love places that specialize in doing one thing (or a few things) really really well, as that seems more common in Asia generally than America. The Mixed Sul Lun Tang really hits the spot - it's milky, smooth, rich, chewy (from the intestines and tripe that come in the Mixed option!) AND healthy-tasting.  You feel full AND healthy after a bowl here, knowing that you just drank all the yummy collagen and nutrients released after the hours of boiling the bones that comprise the broth. Fast and friendly service as well. Since the food doesn't take much time to come out, you can be in and out really quick here."
6/20/2017,5 star rating,This is Korean comfort food. No frills but all the flavor. You order and in a blink of an eye you are being served what you ordered. They make a variation of one thing and crank it out. It's perfect. You season the rich broth according to your taste with the sea salt and scallions and the velvet broth is cut by the perfect gak doo ghi and kimchi. This hole is a perfect place to duck into. My father introduced me to this place and now it's my go-to spot.
8/8/2017,5 star rating,"Beefbone broth- it tastes really good! After having this soup, I felt full of energy and my headache just disappeared! I highly recommend this restaurant! If you would like to eat simple and fresh beefbone broth, you must go to this and give it a shot!"

The soup comes with no salt added, you'll need to add the salt yourself. Which is perfect because some places will make soup way too salty for my preference"
11/4/2016,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants to order takeout. Usually, takeout food is just not as good as eating at the restaurant. It's convenient to take home a meal, but the temperature of the food effects the taste. Even if you reheat it, it's just not the same. Not Han Bat...the soup is reheated and it taste great.Eating comfort food in the comfort of your home is ideal, especially if it's soup from Han Bat. Rice doesn't need to be reheated. It's going into the soup anyway. Put the salt, green onion, and the spicy chili sauce into the soup to your liking and dig in. The radish kimchi and kimchi are the perfect complements to the soup. Take out - call ahead...very prompt and efficient. Parking - in the back...enter through the alley on 5th street or street parking. I've never had trouble parking."

12/30/2018,1 star rating,"The service was extremely rude and ignored us perhaps because my friend and I were not Korean. They didn't ask us if we knew how to order or if we knew how to eat the soup, so we ate it plain and were confused for the longest time. They also didn't give us any utensils and we had to flag down a dish collecting lady to give us utensils. It was also really expensive and far from comforting for a comfort food place."

2/4/2014,4 star rating,"Wonderful, wonderful Yelp find. A serious little hole in the wall located in a seedy downtown neighborhood. Although it was my first time having sul lung tang this restaurant makes ordering easy with friendly servers and a simple, small menu. A small container of sea salt, some chili sauce, a large container of chopped green onions, napkin and utensil dispensers are the only other things on the table.After ordering, the ban chan and rice are quickly brought out, and then your order. I opted for the [safe] brisket. The soup is rich and the brisket was simmered until it was chopstick tender. If your willing to brave the neighborhood, this place is a great way to warm yourself on a chilly night."

1/24/2016,5 star rating,"This place is the most badass place I've ever eaten at.  You go in there and you just see these Korean moms (I don't know if they are actually moms but they all look like moms) serving up some pretty rustic looking food.  You sit down and you notice that the table has a piece of cardboard balancing the legs to make the table sit right and in that moment you realize you're either going to have the best experience ever, or you're going to get food poisoning and die.  You think there are like two options on the menu, brisket and mixed meat soup.  But you don't really know because your friend literally just asks you if you want spleen or brisket, so of course you get some good old fashioned spleen and it's ordered for you by your friend.The food comes out super quick, along with two bowls of kimchi, salt (the soup comes unseasoned) and a huge container of green onions.   You momentarily feel sorry for the guy who has to chop the green onions all day, but then you forget about that guy because you see and smell your meal.  And then you eat.  And you wonder how something could ever be so savory and delicious and weirdly elegant.  And you know there is no MSG in it (not that you give a damn) because you actually have a huge bag of it a home and the flavors are too complimentary to have been upped by MSG (not that you give a damn).  And then you wonder what kind of home-cook you are because you think make fancy things at home but you cant make a broth anywhere near as good as the one you're drinking and the table is being held up by a piece of cardboard.You then realize that they are serving all the scrap meat that nobody wants and they turn it into some delicious that everyone wants and you are reminded that is what cooking is all about.  And that this is like the best business model for a restaurant ever because they can just make one big pot of it and then serve it throughout the day and chillax.  And you wonder if you can ever do that but you cop out and just say to yourself it's because they are Korean and they know the secrets."

10/28/2014,5 star rating,"Quick & Easy: Best Sul Lung Tang in town.  Cash Only. Down & Dirty: I could eat here everyday. It's comfort food on the real and nothing beats a hangover like one of these babys. It's like Raid for hangovers.. that was bad, Fabreeze for hangovers. Nah.. Ahem... it's like medicine for hangovers. (damn I suck at this today). Anyway, pile that green onion on top with some salt and pepper and my gawd, I could hear my mother yelling at me to slow down and chew my food. It's not anything fancy. The waitresses are scrambling to one table after another and your food comes out quick. Real quick. So quick that you should pee before ordering. The side dishes here are simple.  Kimchi and Kkakdugi (radish kimchi).  I'm a fan of the radish and get at least one refill every time.  One thing is parking.  It sucks.  You can attempt to show your bad-boy side and get away with parking at Carl's Jr., but there's a chance you'll get your car towed. There's a small lot off of Western on the same block or find street parking and walk.  You'll need to digest anyways."
4/5/2016,2 star rating,"After reading a fervid review of this place and the ""ox bone broth"" it offers for their soup in LA Eater (not to mention the endless and untrustworthy Yelp accolades)  I decided to check it out. I imagined a deep, rich soup loaded with meats. When I arrived there and seeing the tiny menu of only a few soup meat choices to add the the broth I thought ""even better, this is their only dish and must be amazing""Wrong.A tepid, milky broth (as you can see in the many photos)  that may or may not be msg enhanced was thin and bland. Adding a lot of salt helped it a bit. The maybe 2 oz of added beef tongue and the few strands of bean noodles did little to enhance the experience. The accompanying  dish of rice was much needed to just make this an ""almost"" meal. I heaped a ton of chopped scallions into it - there weren't any other seasoning choices other than the salt to enhance this. The only thing I liked were the only sides, kimchi and radish root.  The $11 with tax price was too much considering you leave hungry.Maybe I just don't ""get"" Korean food overall, although I've eaten quite a bit of it over the years, and BBQ would only be a sample of it. The cuisine never really excites me, always seemingly the same couple of well hammered notes. Barchan is often the best part of most any meal I've had. This place just reinforces my perception of it - some sort of home cooked average dish made of leftovers that has been elevated to mythic status by adult infants and drunks nursing a hangover. Note to self - always read the negative reviews for places like this. They pretty much agree with me and are not by the Korean faction of Yelp.Skip it."

There wasn't a lot of food imo, definitely more of a light meal with super quick service (got my food within a few minutes). The banchan was okay, kinda limited though."

6/29/2017,5 star rating,This is a place that knows if you can do one thing right that's all that matters. Whenever I feel sick I come here an load up on the nourishing soup. It's perfect because I don't have much of an appetite when I'm sick but the deep beef broth and spicy delicious kimchi fixes me up.Best to order ahead and pick up. Just as good reheated and better cause you can eat in your PJs.

6/27/2017,2 star rating,one of my told me about this place and we thought to give it a try and we were really underwhelmed. the food was too spicy that we had to leave it in the middle. we had no idea it was bad on that day only or we don't know the real taste of Korean food. would like to give it a more try next time and hope to get it as reviewed on Yelp.
6/26/2017,5 star rating,"I've never had ox bone soup and whenever I go to a Korean restaurant, it's usually KBBQ or the usual kbbp/tofu stew/bibimbap kind of thing. But this restaurant was different-- they only had ox bone soup and you get to choose what you want in it: mixed, brisket, flank, intestine, or tongue.My boyfriend and I both got the salgogi (brisket) one. They gave us a plate of kimchi and a plate of what I think is radish and a bowl of rice each. They were super generous with their banchan! Our food came out REALLY quick, less than 5 minutes after we ordered.The ox bone soup itself was very flavorful yet light. It had a really clean taste and didn't feel heavy at all. There was also a very generous portion brisket inside the soup and it was very tender and delicious. :)I thought it was cash only but it turns out they also accept card. I'm a huge fan!!!!"
6/26/2017,4 star rating,"HAN BAT SUL LUNG TANG is Korean's answer to ramen and pho. We love the seokum (mixed) soup of tripe, intestine, spleen, and tongue. This hearty ox bone  broth comes with the little side dishes of kimchee, extra salt and green onions. The ambiance is simple blank white walls and table. Maybe some would call it a hole in the wall kind of place but don't let that put you off. It's all about the food and it's very good! There is a small parking lot behind the store, street metered parking in front of the store, as well as in the neighborhood. It's in Koreatown, so expect to spend some time circling around for parking unless you're one of those people with awesome parking karma."
6/25/2017,1 star rating,"Not sure why ratings are so high, but it was not good. The oxtail soup base was really bland. We had two of the dishes and could not finish it. We were better off eating the plain white rice w the Kim chi and other pickled item. Would not recommend this. Go get some real deal Korean elsewhere."
6/24/2017,4 star rating,"Took 5min to pick up a call-in order. Total wait time: 15 min. I live next door so this was awesome.As they say. It is simple. Its perfect if you're craving for something not so overwhelming. Also, they give you salt to add yourself. And love the amount of kimchi they give for takeout. Would be back"
6/23/2017,5 star rating,"Simple menu - they focus on making their Sul Lung Tang (Ox Bone Soup) right. Don't expect variety of side dishes, like you get most other Korean restaurants, but do expect some good kimchi. The soup has so much flavor, yet has a clean aftertaste! There can be a pretty long wait during dinner time, but you shouldn't have any problem getting seated during lunch time. There's parking in rear, $2 valet parking."
1/23/2017,4 star rating,"I'm a sucker for hole-in-the-wall joints, especially those in K-Town. I was taken here by my Korean friend in the storm this past week so really there was to be no other choice in the matter. The bone broth soup with brisket was on our menu and seemed to be the de-facto choice for most of the other guests. The soup is brought out plain and simple and the rest of the flavoring is up to you. Served on the table is salt, chili paste, scallions, kimchi and radish to your liking and to your appetite as they'll keep bringing out the accouterments as needed. The soup served raw is comforting on a rainy day but definitely not the most flavorful thing in the world. However it is incredible refreshing to slurp it down knowing it's not full of salt or questionable ingredients. Once you add in the additions the soup becomes something special, albeit still not the most incredible soup you'll have. Definitely come when the weather warrants it and be ready to leave comforted and warmed from the belly out."
6/26/2016,5 star rating,"So good so good so good! Comfort food to the max. We got 4 mixed meats so lung tungs. The broth was super umami and meaty. It came with kimchi and spicy radishes and meats and some glass noodles, and a bowl of rice. You can put as much salt and green onion in as you want. The wait was about 20 min on a Friday evening, but the most challenging part is definately parking. I will be back, many many times!"
1/15/2016,5 star rating,"Pretty awesome that this restaurant only serves traditional Korean ox bone soup! I ordered the Seokum, which was a mix of beef brisket, flank, intestine, tripe, spleen & tongue. It was extremely tasty especially when adding in the kimchi and green onions and spices and a bit of rice. A perfect place to go to on a cold winter day!The restaurant was fairly crowded but the wait was not too bad - probably only around 15 minutes or so. You can definitely tell this is a local community favorite. The staff were friendly enough and we didn't have to wait that long for our food. Will definitely be coming back here again!"
1/5/2020,5 star rating,Five stars to keep this legacy going in ktown. One of the great spots for this type of soup. I wouldn't say it's the best
2/17/2020,5 star rating,"Favorite soup in town!  We are addicted and come at least once a week.  The broth is unique and delicious, the kimchi is delicious and the service is quick and friendly."
1/30/2020,5 star rating,"NorCal friend here! HBSLT never fails to disappoint. It is always in my top 5 must eats when I visit LA! The broth is so umami, deep and rich in flavor. Throw some green onions, sprit in some chili sauce and stock up on the kkakdukki, you are ready for one of the most enjoyable meals you've ever had! Comforting, warm, easy on the stomach and just so DAMN good!"
4/28/2014,3 star rating,"3-4 stars. The soup itself was a little lacking in beef flavor. But for the price, you can't expect too much. The radish kimchee is very good. The napa cabbage kimchi was decent. Definitely preferred the radish one. Overall a decent and filling meal. If you order the mixed bowl, it comes with intestines, tripe and blood. If you don't want that stuff, order the brisket."
5/26/2018,4 star rating,Never regret coming here but prices have steadily gone up for what is supposed to be a cheap dish. I think it's 12.50 including tax so if you add tip it could be about 15 dollars. And you should definitely tip because I saw the bigger ahjumma chase down a patron to the parking lot because he didn't tip.
12/14/2014,5 star rating,You know it's the best when they only sell a variety of one major dish: sul lung tang. Sucks that it is cash only but this is the best thing after a hangover. Love their ggak doo ki (radish). I add a ton of salt to my soup but that's why it is delicious. Used to eat this every other week when I was living in k-town. Truly comfort food. I'm always full after eating this.
7/3/2016,5 star rating,"This place have a the best korean soup in town.. After having beer time, this is the right place to come.. No regret at all"
7/31/2016,5 star rating,"I am impressed.I went in a week ago once, order the soup and requested extra noodle (FYI, no extra charge for extra noodle) and next weekend when I went back, ordered my soup but forgot to mention extra noodle and SHE BROUGHT IT ANYWAY WITHOUT ME ASKING!  Now that's some great memory skills.  Yes I have tried a few places that's known for sul lung tang and this is the only place I kept on coming back.  I had committed to a year eating vegetarian and this is seriously the only thing I miss during that whole year.  It's that good!They are faster than McDonald, my soup usually arrived within two minutes of my order.How I like to eat my sul lung tang?  I like it like 3 course meal.  First tried the original flavor, no salt and no green onion.  I dipped the meat in the daikon pickle radish sauce and not mixing it with the soup.  I only have noodles and won't touch rice at this point.Then, I add a little salt, you don't need much to bring a different flavor to your palate.  This is a good time to add the green onion, I do two spoonful.  At this stage I will pour my extra noodle from the white bowl into the soup bowl and enjoy a different level of green onion/salt add on broth with more noodle.  I will also have a couple spoonful or rice on the side.The last course is the finale.  I add half a bowl of rice and then a good amount of that yummy red sauce from the pickle radish into the remaining soup, and happily taste the super flavorful Korean porridge made with the best bone broth in the world.  Sometime when I am not super starving, I skip the last step so that I can bag Togo for next day.  It's good to box the soup, rice and Kim Chee sauce all separate so you can do the customization later at home.They are not stingy with their sides and service is always friendly and efficient.  The Price, $11 with tax, cash only.  They do have an ATM machine in the restaurant if you need some cash, the surcharge is only $1.99.  Parking in the back for free or street meter parking.  Update: they are now accepting credit cards, a big plus for customers who don't like to have cash on hands.Another great thing is they open for super long hours, from early early morning to late late night."
11/28/2015,5 star rating,"OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! They specialize in Sul Lung Tang and its SO GOOD! It's ox tail soup with your choice of meat. They provide green onions, pepper, and crushed salt. I decided to go with the brisket, which was amazing! When you get your soup you should taste it first. Usually it is pretty bland (which is what its suppose to be), but you get to add the salt yourself. Aka you get you control your saltiness level. Green onions is also a MUST! It makes the soup even better. The soup also comes with a bowl of rice, radish and kimchi. You can eat it however you want. You can eat the rice separately with the soup, meat, and sides or together. Towards the end I like to put the rest of my rice in the soup. ITS SO GOOD! Parking is the usual LA/Ktown parking: Meter or they have a lot in the back. Price, portion and quality are excellent here! It's also cash only, but they do have an atm machine if you need it."
11/9/2018,5 star rating,My go to spot for Korean soup.  I've been going for several years and they never disappoint.  I love the beef brisket and tongue version the best but they have other options.  Good food on a cold day.
12/4/2018,4 star rating,"Whenever I'm not feeling well, this is my go to spot! They have the best shul lung tang - a Korean soup made from simmered bone broth with meat and glass noodles... yum! They also have the best, I mean the best radish kimchi -and I'm very finicky when it comes to different types of kimcjhies. Needless to say, both my husband and I drive hear from the valley to eat here - so worth it!"
1/1/2020,2 star rating,Taste quality was below expectation for the price.   Soup had gamy smell and taste to it.  Interior was not clean.
11/2/2014,4 star rating,"One of the best sul lung tangs in Los Angeles. It may be the best for most people that like the fattiness flavor in the broth. They also have awesome kagdoogi. I usually put the kagdoogi juice in my soup for extra flavor. I dont touch the kimchi so I cant really say anything about it.My parents used to bring me here as a child. Now I bring my parents here or togo for them. Im sure they will be open for a very long time with all their loyal customers.Also, this soup isn't bad as a hangover remedy. It's also supposed to be good for your bones so eat up!Overall, this place is my go to for hot soup on a cold or rainy day. Only thing I can say negative about this place is that they only sell about 5 items which are all soup, no banchans(side dishes other than Kimchi and kagdoogi) and that they are cash only."
5/19/2017,2 star rating,"How can this place get 4 star or more? Soup taste - bland Price - not worth it, serving size too smallMenu - limitedPlace - filthy, special the restroomThe food court at 6th and mariposa serves better korean comfort foods."
1/4/2015,4 star rating,"Nothing like a hot bowl of sullungtang to warm your body on a cold, winter morning.. or to bring your body back to life after last night's shenanigans. Yes, this was the case at this time. This is my fiancé's favorite sullungtang place in all of LA. We even saw Andrew Zimmerman filming an episode here for Bizarre Foods one morning. You have a few different options for your soup and the one I decided to go with today was Seukkum (mixed), which included intestine, tripe and spleen. If you're looking to keep it safe, go with the Salkogee (beef brisket). Other options are available but I usually go with one of the two. Parking is in the back in a small lot or you can find street parking in front."
12/29/2018,5 star rating,"My experience was absolutely flawless even down to the small details. I love simple, no-frills places that focus on the quality of their food and service, and Han Bat knocked it out of the park.- The ox tail soup was delicious, as was the beef brisket. Take the advice of the other reviewers and season it with some salt, lots of green onions, and a scoop of the sauce that comes with the radish kimchi. The only mild nitpick I could make is that the amount of noodles in the soup was just a little sparse, but it's fairly inconsequential considering how great this place is.- The kimchi was sooooo good. Especially the radish. I've had a lot of kimchi that was either too spicy or too sour, but here it was just right. I'm sure they make them in-house.- Great price and good portions - $12.50 gets you a bowl of soup, rice, two kinds of kimchi, and the seasonings you need. I was very hungry and the portion was just right to fill me up.- Excellent service. The waiters are friendly and attentive, there is no wait, and fresh food came almost immediately. - Noise level was very low considering how busy it was and the amount of families with children. It was very peaceful, so I could relax and enjoy my food.- Bonus points for the nice utensils.Even my mother, who hates trying new food and is skeptical of hole-in-the-walls, loved this place. When we make day trips to LA, we will be sure to return. In the meantime, I would highly recommend this to others."
7/17/2016,4 star rating,"If you are getting tired of all the bbq and heavy food you normally get around the area, this place offers a switch to something simple but delicious. Beef tongue here was so good. Make sure to customize flavor to your own preference by adding onion, salt, pepper, and chili! Fast service, too."
1/11/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite sulungtang restaurant in the whole world, including Korea! Soup has so much richness and flavor that nothing else compares. Kimchi and kkakdoogi are great also. I just wish there was a Hanbat in VA!"
9/30/2014,4 star rating,THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY! (but it's not expensive)So the other day I was supposed to get brunch with my sister. But that girl...she wasn't super hungry so I used yelp to look up some SOUP places near by. Since she goes to USC we drove to K-town right quick. Going into the place...it was during that super crazy HEAT wave..and we weren't seated in the coolest place...right next to the door and there were tons of customers coming in and out. But that's besides the point. We looked over the menu (which was on the wall) and we both ordered the same thing the sul lung tang with beef brisket. I was a bit sad when I looked at the wall and I realized it was cash only. (Thankfully my sister had cash!)We were given our ban chan...some napa kimchi and then some radish kimchi. Both were great. When our soups came out...i scooped out TONS of the green onions so it could you know add some flavor and texture and deliciousness to my meal. Let's just say...the soup is pretty darn great! I think if I were in the area...and craving some sul lung tang and didn't want to go back towards diamond bar/rowland...I'd definitely go here. The service was good. The food was good. Final verdict: would go again...as long as I had cash.
8/1/2016,1 star rating,The Sul lun tang soup was probably the blandest thing I have ever eaten. There wasn't any flavor at all. I had to put the kimchi inside of the soup just to add flavor. I would not recommend this place to anyone to eat.
4/1/2018,5 star rating,$11.50 for a delicious pot of beef brisket ox bone soup?! Yes pleaseee! This place is an institution. Came here at 10:15am on Easter Sunday and they were busy but still had a few tables open. The soup comes out relatively quickly together with the kimchi and radish banchan. Don't be alarmed if it tastes super bland at first. The whole point is that you can season to taste at the table. You put in as much salt and pepper as you need to it tastes just perfect for you. I love it this way. Shows you how amazing salt it really. Lol. It brings out the delicious flavour of the ox bone and beef so well.
6/11/2017,5 star rating,"Very good and simple. This place specializes only in Sul Lung Tang. You get two kimchi ban chan (side dishes), radish and napa. A side of white rice and a tub of green onions. The soup is not salty or overly seasoned. You can later season to taste which is perfect for those who don't like salty food. I enjoyed this place very much."
10/28/2015,1 star rating,"Don't bother. I saw how this place has more than 1,000 reviews and five stars. What a disappointment. I've grown up in k-town, I love their food, this place is unfortunate. I probably had 15 noodles in my brisket soup. I'm not sure what I'm paying for here. The stew is beyond bland. Salt is given on the table, but salt should not be the only flavor in this soup.What I'm saying is, save your time and appetite for something waaaaaaaay better!"
8/1/2016,5 star rating,"HNNNGGHHH.MAN, coming from Bay Area where Korean food is ""I'd tap that"" at best, this hole in the wall (figuratively, the place was hella clean) blew my expectations OFF DA CHARTZ. You can get beef bone broth at practically any Korea restaurants, but when you see one that specializes in the item, you know they ain't joking around. We all got the Seokum Sul Lung Tang. The kkakdugi and kimchi was placed on our table right away but the soup came lightning fast anyways. WE DEMOLISHED IT. Started off with a few sips of broth without adding anything, then added the green onions and salt in, and ended with mixing the kimchi into the broth. I needed quite a bit of salt because sodium is my savior but awesome that they keep the salt at a minimum to accommodate all palates. This is defos the best type of comfort food/hangover cure where you won't feel guilty to consume!!"
10/14/2018,4 star rating,"The soup is so good.  It's rich and aromatic.  There are unlimited green onion and radish kimchee to cut down the richness of the broth. It's great eat for morning and late night, and anytime in between. Yum"
12/24/2017,5 star rating,"Really really really good Korean soup! The best hangover cure. Simple menu, simple service, delicious food!"
2/10/2015,3 star rating,"I love this place. Really, I grew up on sullungtang and this place has the milkiest soup base from all the places I've checked out in koreatown over the past 20 years. BUT............They've been slowly jacking up the price (used to be $9 flat, then $8.64 + tax, and now $9.64 + tax) and they've been skimping on the meat. THE MEAT!!! Typical Korean management. Smh. If they keep doing this, they just might lose some customers, no matter how good it is. Still the tastiest sullungtang, which is why I gave it a 3 star."
12/30/2019,5 star rating,Great food and service! I love the soup here. I came 3 times a week while visiting LA.
2/8/2014,5 star rating,"So my girl told me that this place's beef soup is better than pho. Ummm hold up, I'm Vietnamese and that's considered sacrilegious. Besides KBBQ, there isn't any Korean food I eat on a regular basis and I've never tried this sul lung tang before so I was gonna give it a try. The place is small and it's fairly clean even though it's a hole in the wall joint. They even got an A from the food inspectors! Menu's fairly simple, it's beef soup only but you get to pick what you want to put in it. Since my non-Korean lady told me it was like pho, I went and picked the mixed since I always love the super combo at pho places. More weird stuff in it, the better. The service is fast, and soup came out uber quick. We put the salt, pickled radish and kim chee in, and tons of green onions. The soup reminded me somewhat of porridge, brisket tasted just like brisket in pho, the other organs and what nots were good as well. I enjoyed mixing the rice into the soup because that's what I do with pho as well. Overall, this soup really is comforting and hits the spot. You season it to however you want, and if it's over/under seasoned then it's your own damn fault mmkay? Great spot for a rainy day/hangover/light meal/etc. Is it as good or even better than pho? Hell no, but I do likey."
11/18/2013,5 star rating,"It is really great when the weather is getting cold. I love this restaurant because they make authentic sul lung tang with a rich and flavorful broth. Even though i can cook sul lung tang by myself, i usually eat it from here. Making a sul lung tang is time consuming. It takes about few days to make a nice broth. Also, their meat is so great. I usually order mixed one. It contained many kinds of meat like liver, intestine...which i can not buy at a local grocery store.I love gakduki(red hot diced radish kimchi), too. This is well balanced with the sul lung tang. they are always generous giving unlimited refill. I am sweating while eating the hot sul lung tang but i feel relaxed after eating this."
3/25/2018,5 star rating,I drove 6 hours from SF just to come here for one day; for one meal. I will literally die for this soup everyday.
10/7/2016,4 star rating,"FOODOn a chilly night, all you want is some beef bone broth!  This is my go-to spot for sullungtang in Koreatown. They have the best kakdoogi (fermented radish) that compliments the sullungtang. I recommend the beef brisket sullungtang, which is what I usually get. There was more fat on the meat than usual but still the same quality. PARKINGThere's a free parking lot behind the restaurant where a security guard is always there. There's limited spots but people come in and out so you won't have to wait for too long. SERVICEThis place is a go in, eat, and get out place. Or you can take it to go. It's fast and efficient but don't expect them to butter you up.  Also they take credit cards and cash. During the middle of our meal, my friend and I started cold sweating thinking it was cash only, but they thankfully accepted credit cards lol. AMBIANCE There are no frills here. A bit grimy but you gotta just go with it and enjoy the food. If you want some bomb sullungtang, head over the hanbat. You'll see the lines (that move quickly too!) so you'll know how popular and good it is."
1/29/2014,4 star rating,"Mmm, sul lung tang, get in mah belly!+Small parking lot available behind the restaurant. Instead of turning right into the parking lot on Western, I prefer making a right on 5th st when you're on Western going south and make a right into a small street that leads to the parking lot.+Option of sul lung tang (beef soup) or soo yook (boiled beef)+Unlimited kimchi & radish kimchi to eat with your sul lung tang. LOVE their radish kimchi, great addition of flavor to eat along with your sul lung tang.+You can customize your sul lung tang to your liking since it is made super bland. Add salt, spicy paste, and green onions to your liking! I usually add lots of green onions and okay amount of salt and still keep it slightly bland. If you eat radish kimchee along with a bite of your sul lung tang soup, it's perfect! I also dump my whole rice in the sul lung tang & make it into a porridge. So bomb!+Some people like it well flavored so in that case, add lots of salt and spicy paste. My boyfriend's sul lung tang tasted like a whole different kind of meal but in a good way haha+Sul lung tang has no MSG and the broth is made natural so it's good for kids too :D-Cash only-If you do not know how to adjust the soup to your liking, you may have trouble liking this place."
12/1/2015,5 star rating,"Anyone and everyone knows Han Bat is one of the best sulung tang houses in koreatown. This place always has a wait during peak hours. A go-to spot for many people, especially the day after a night of drinking.The downsides are that this place is really small, making seating limited, and they accept cash only. The menu is very simple: pick the type of meat you want, and which soup. The side dishes are also very basic. They give you two different types of kimchi, which is all you really need for this type of food. They have salt, pepper and green onion on the side, so you can control how salty you want your soup to be.One of my top two favorite sulungtang houses in koreatown. The only other sulungtang restaurant in ktown that is comparable, in my opinion, is Sun Nong Dan on 6th street."
11/2/2013,5 star rating,"I try to write my review AFTER trying the place out more than once. However, this place blew me away today so I wanted to write my review. First off, you have to valet your car. Outside of the place looks run down and old but inside reminds me of a cozy old Korean town. My co-workers and I all ordered Brisket Sulungtang! There is flank and brisket and mixed.. I think there is more but just know that this place only has sulungtang! (Soup)The food comes out fast. They give you two kinds of kimchi! Kkakdoogi and regular kimchi. Oh my damn .... It could not get any better and you eat that with your soup. Holy Jesus........... It definitely soothed my stomache and good for hangover as well.Ah. I really want to come back and eat here everyday! It's only $8.99. Its the real deal. Authentic Korean food for sure."
12/16/2015,5 star rating,"Been here a handful of times and it's one of the most consistent restaurants when it comes to food. Always tastes the same, A+ every time. Valet is also $1, which is a dollar less than most places in Koreatown hahahHan Bat also opens early (6:30am), for those who need a quick morning warming up or hangover soup. But they also close relatively early too (10pm) so none of that after-clubbing-BCD typa business over here.Only meh thing about Han Bat is their cash only policy. But if you prepare for that, then I doubt you'll run into any other problems."
1/18/2017,4 star rating,"Tried this place because it was near our hotel, saw the good reviews on Yelp, and because it was cold outside it is perfect for some soup! This place is very similar to a place in Vegas that we love! We got the mixed soup and its as delicious! The broth was so sweet and warm, lots of brisket and mixed intestine, added just a little of salt and lots of onions and it was a delicious meal. Love the vibe of the place, quick service and simple yet delicious food. As soon as we sat the lady took the onion pot from another table and put it on our table...so you better get the onions quick before they take it to a different table lol. Very quick service, quick food, awesome place for Korean soup!"
8/20/2015,5 star rating,Great comfort food! Ordered the Seokum(mixed) soup that comes with a little bit of everything including organ meats. Clean tasting. Fresh and delicious. They only sell soup. 9.64 + tax. Wish there was this quality Korean soup in Hawaii! Street parking and a pretty decent sized restaurant so good for groups too. If I come back to Los Angeles I will be visiting this yummy restaurant again!
1/15/2015,5 star rating,"This place totally deserves the awesome reviews. I brought my boyfriend's family here  during our vacation in LA and we all LOVE IT! A few things to note: 1. Free parking in the back2. Line starts in the back of the store3. You might have to share a table with someone4. If you're not into traditional Korean food, this place is probably not for you.We came at around 11ish on a weekend. Waited for about 15 20 mins. There are technically only 2 items on the menu: the ox bone soup with your choice of meat, and boiled meat wrapped in lettuce (at least that's that I think it is...). The menu is in Korean with very little English so it took me a few mins of googling.We all ordered soup like everyone else. I had it with brisket. The broth is slightly milky and flavorful although it's not seasoned. How do I know? There is a jar of salt and a bucket (yes BUCKET) of green onions on the table for you. Each soup is served with rice, unlimited cabbage & radish kimchi. Service is great despite the fast pace. Very friendly staff. I will definitely come back here every time i'm in the area."

5/7/2018,5 star rating,"Great place to get a warm bowl of oxbone soup! Don't forget to add salt, pepper, and green onions to the soup. If not, you'll get a very bland soup. In addition to the bowl, I always get the plate of meat (suyuk), specifically the beef tounge suyuk. They plate the serving with thick cuts of very tender beef tongue. Highly recommended!"
1/9/2014,4 star rating,"CASH ONLY!!!!!--Don't be like us, where we all failed to realize that it was cash only...but it worked out in the end.The service here is great!--The servers work fast and the food comes out even FASTER. They told us that it comes out fast, and they were true to their word. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sul lung tang, but I'd be down to come back here. The broth was already flavorful so I didn't have to add salt into it.I ordered the combination sul lung tang, which was delish!The kkak doo gee was amazing too and went super well with the sul lung tang. The interior is very casual. Not fancy at all--but still a decent place to eat and chat with familiy/friends.REMEMBER: CASH ONLY!"
3/16/2018,1 star rating,"The salgogi was bland. My experience here was not pleasant. Some older guy in a black leather jacket ruined this experience while we were still dining. The staff seemed to indirectly rush us because they we're closing soon. We paid for the food and tried to enjoy our late dinner but couldn't. I don't know what the guy in the black jackets' association was with the staff, but either he was racist or just wanted his loved one to leave the restaurant early. He paced back and forth a few times before saying something in Korean. We didn't understand, he then walks by again and said ""we are closed"" in english. He clearly did not want us to be there. I didn't get to finish my meal. The staff was friendly but curt, they seemed in a rush to leave. I thanked them, but that man left a bad impression. Never coming back here!"
6/2/2016,5 star rating,"This place is SO good. I have yet to bring someone here that has disliked the sullungtang. Not only has this restaurant perfected the full fatty flavor that is indicative of a great oxtail soup, but it also some of the best kimchi I've ever had. Really love that you can customize the soup by adding your own salt and green onions. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone. It's just a really comforting food that's perfect any time (though amazing after a night of drinking :D). A word of warning, there is somewhat of a wait on weekends. I would say come around 11AM to beat the rush. If that's not possible, don't fret! The line moves pretty quickly. Also, this place is cash only so make sure to have cash on hand."
1/8/2017,5 star rating,Awesome place for authentic Sul Lung Tang. Ordered one mix and one brisket&flank half&half. The place take credit card!
10/21/2019,5 star rating,"Order the brisket ""salgogi"" and put lots of green onion and salt in it. Also mix a little bit of the spicy paste in it. Once the soup is tastes the way you like it walk into hangover cure heaven. Then go take a nap."
6/23/2016,5 star rating,"Yay! I tried sul lung tang for the first time a few weeks ago and I'm a fan. I've had this on my list for a while too, so I was pretty excited. I've also read reviews and see that some people think it's underwhelming and not that flavorful. So I honestly didn't know what to expect... but I ended up REALLY liking it!I think some people are right... it's not too flavorful for a soup, especially compared to other types of Korean soups (mass flavaz). But it's kind of amazing that way. It's rich... and yet... not too crazy jacked up with flavor. It's true. But in a good way.I ordered it with brisket, and it also comes with bits of clear noodles, rice, and of course kimchi and such. The table also has some salt/pepper and a TON of green onions. I'm a fan of green onions so obviously I had to dump bucketfuls into my soup. YUM! I also added a bit of salt. And pepper too cos I love pepz.I think the beauty of this soup is that it's simple. That's certainly why I like it. It's really comforting too. I like it with a bit of rice and kimchi. MMMMMAlso it's pretty cheap. Nothing that'll break your bank here. I think they used to be cash only but they take card now. Also the place is small and kinda hard to find, very mom and pop feels. So you know, try it out, keep an open mind and enjoy!"
5/28/2016,4 star rating,Used to be an obscure hole in the wall that only local Koreans knew about.  Beef Ox bone soup with the best radish kimchee....so good.  Hard to find soup this good outside of LA ktown.

12/18/2013,3 star rating,"They say this is the best place for sul lung tang. So I decided to try it with my mom.I personally thought it was fine, but my mom knew the second she took a bite that it was filled with MSG. I can't tell if a dish has MSG by the actual taste. However, I knew she was right when I almost fell asleep on the wheel on my way back home.I am not a health nut, but I'm disappointed that the reason why this place is so hyped up is because of MSG. Probably won't be coming here for sul lung tang."
12/19/2016,4 star rating,"They only serve Sul Lung Tang here so there's no doubt it will be good. Once you taste the soup, you know that its been simmering in beef bones for a long time because there is a very deep complex flavor to it.  They provide 2 banchans and a bowl of rice to accompany the soup.  There is also a jar of salt and loads of green onions to add to the soup to your own liking.  Simple and delicious."
7/12/2018,3 star rating,"It was my first time trying the soup and I must say that it is super flavorful.  You can taste the richness in the broth.  Eating it with the kimchi makes it even better.  But, I gotta wonder what happened to my meat?!  I ordered the flank but at least three fourths of the ""meat"" was fat and inedible portions.  I had maybe two small bites of actual meat.  Which wouldn't necessarily be so bad but for the fact that the bowl costed $12.  $12 for what was essentially broth (good broth, but broth nonetheless, and apparently very expensive broth).  I could've gotten a huge bowl of gamjatang, loaded with meat, for less.  But, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I just happened to get a not-so-good portion this time.  Maybe next time will be better."
1/23/2017,5 star rating,"This is pretty much comfort food at it's most simplistic.You come in, you wait a bit, you sit down, you have one soup with different meat options and rice/kimchi.  What else do you need on a cold day? This is the chicken noodle soup of Korea.Love it.PS cash only with ATM on site.  Also order the meat platter if you got some big guys in the group."
9/8/2018,5 star rating,"If you like Korean beef soup, you HAVE to try this place.  This is absolutely the best I have ever taste it in US.  The broth is flavorful, the beef is soft like Kobe beef (if you have taste it before), the kimchi is the best.  You won't regret it!!!"
1/18/2017,5 star rating,"This is everything a sullungtang place should be.  There is a strong aroma of beef when you walk in the door, the same smell you get at home when your mom boils the beef bones for hours.   I love that you can choose what types of beef parts.   The broth is strong and sticky, which probably means that they don't skimp on the ingredients.  The kimchi is just as strong and will accompany the soup perfectly.Just like some other reviewers mentioned, the soup here is better than a lot of places in Korea, and it's definitely better than any place in the east coast.   New York needs you, Han Bat!"

12/1/2010,3 star rating,"I decided to be adventurous and try something new. Logged on yelp and decided to have the Brisket Sul Lung Tang. I had extremely high expectations because of the exorbitant rating & reviews. Needless to say I was slightly disappointed.Food was slightly better than average and you get the kimchi and cabbage for a total $9 including tax, but I'd probably rather eat some pho."
9/9/2012,4 star rating,"This place is pretty good. I think their meat quality is very good, but I prefer Young Dong Sulungtang better than this place. I think Young Dong's sulungtang just tastes a lot more healthier and cleaner. Young Dong also has kimchi water (kimchi gook-mool) that you can pour into the sulungtang, but they didn't have that here :("
12/13/2015,4 star rating,this is straight up good food. it was a rainy cali day today and i was CRAVING something soupy and not too fattening and this hit the spot. the broth is very mild  so they allow you to customize the saltiness yourself which i really preferred. also the brisket and all the other meats in it were sooooooo tender.LOVED IT. they only serve sul lung tang here and you can basically choose from different types of meats which makes everything so much easier. one thing i wish they had was a larger variety of banchan.....
3/6/2009,5 star rating,"Oh yeah.  This place has some legit sulungtang.  Let me know tell you how you know this place is legit: 1) your lips gets sticky from the soup, 2) the menu has only sulungtang on it, with different types of meat only, 3) the kimchee and ggakduhgee is as red as can be, and 4) the price ends up being conveniently exactly $9, with tax.  Oh yeah.  This place got all of the above.  Best sulungtang I've ever had (minus my halmuhnee's of course)."
9/5/2011,4 star rating,"We had tried all four kinds of sul long tang. The broth was flavorful and doesnt seem to have additives in it! :DThe broth smelled really bony!Fresh green onions!!!! Don't add too much salt in it - it would overwhelm the original flavor of beef bone soup.The one with spleen is not as good - unless you like the smell of spleens. I couldn't finish it at all.....But the other three - flanks, briscket and tongues were all good!!!Good kimchis! Rice is good too.Cheap, but not as clean - smelled like bleach.Serve fast!"

3/13/2013,4 star rating,I love good sul lung tang. My grandmother and mother make the best home made but this place was definitely tops.Service and decor is like any small personal owned restaurant. They pretty much serve two things with varied meat and that's all you need. In actuality I would rate it more 4.5 stars but went with 4.

3/1/2009,5 star rating,YUM! I love this place.For some reason this sul lung tang place ALWAYS hits the spot. If I don't know what I wanna eat I can always count on going here to fill my stomach up. The soup comes out right after you order it so no need to wait if you are starving. Add in some salt and some green onions and you are good to go! I like to spoon up my rice and dip it into my soup with some kimchi here and there but always with my spoon because it taste too good to waste time with chopsticks.
3/9/2009,5 star rating,"I'm sick of all these amateurs claiming other places to be the best Suhlung Tang (Korean,Slow cooked beef soup) in Koreatown. Han Bat has terrible customer service, bad parking, poor decor, but it is still the BEST suhlung tang I've had in my life. I drink every drop of that protein rich broth. I don't even care that my body reeks of sour kimchi and beef broth for about 18 hours, because it is totally worth it. I want a suhlung tang facial every time I step inside that smelly restaurant. Also, I love how they have recalculated their prices to come out to 9 bucks even!"

1/7/2013,4 star rating,"My first foray into the world of sul lang tang came after a long and taxing Vegas trip.  I hadn't eaten all day, mainly because I felt that if I were to put anything in my body...it would just come shooting right back out.I couldn't have asked for anything better to settle the stomach.  I'm a huge pho advocate, but even that sounded horrible at the time.  I'd never had sul lang tang before, but my friends insisted that I try it because I needed to eat something.  After a quick Yelp search, the only obvious choice seemed to be Han Bat Sul Lang Tang.  400+ reviews and 4.5 stars can't lie.  It didn't.  I guess the real kicker to this soup is that you get to pick your own poison.  Too bland, add salt, green onions, or chili paste.  Dip your rice in and enjoy.I could see how parking could be rough here since it's a literal hole in the wall.  You'd never be able to see it heading north on Western.  It's cash only, but the prices are fair at around $9 a bowl of soup.  It's not necessarily the biggest restaurant in the world either, I wouldn't bring groups larger than 4.Hung over? Look no further."

It is pretty pricey for what it is given you can get it for $5 bucks a bowl elsewhere but well worth it. Dont expect great service though. The place gets crowded, they dont have enough servers...running around like chicken with their heads cut off. You ll have to repeat what you need several times. The quality of the food makes up for it though!"

12/15/2015,1 star rating,"Love the food here and I used to go every now and then, but today's service was horrible. They were busy and full, so we waited near the door until it was our turn to sit down. The whole wait was fine because its not the staff's fault people want to stay, and their food is worth the wait. However the problem started after we sat down.We ordered right away so we could eat quickly and go, and waited for our food. There were 3 tables that sat after us. Our rice and side dishes came out early on, and I know it doesn't take that long for the soup to come after. The gentlemen who sat after us got their food before we did, and the table behind my boyfriend (who also sat after them) complained they wanted their food. The server responded in Korean that it's on its way and its first come first serve. Yeah okay... Shortly after they received their food, while we were still waiting for ours. One server asked me if we ordered and I said yes, a while ago before a couple other tables. She walked away. My boyfriend kept an eye on another table behind me who just sat down, and they got everything one right after the other. I'm sure the lady servers knew because they were avoiding our stares and not approaching us. Then I heard her order our food in the kitchen. Really, you forget one of the tables closest to the kitchen and ignore us when its obvious we keep looking? They don't even offer to explain or apologize, and that's what set me off more. I get you guys are busy, but if you're the ones say ""first come first serve"", shouldn't you stick to it? By then we were done with them so we just walked out. And as we were walking out they had the audacity to say out loud in front of customers ""oh they're pissed/upset"" sarcastically in Korean. Well, their attempt to embarrass us failed because my boyfriend was quick to respond just as loudly that we came in before all those people you already served. The lady just hid her face and went into the kitchen. They really have no right to be angry at us and the way they handled things was unprofessional and dissapointing."
1/8/2011,5 star rating,"My friends and I arrived at the restaurant no later than 6:45 AM.. and the place was already open with a handful of customers inside! Definitely opens a little earlier than 7AM. The menu is straight forward.. 5 options with the beef soup and 3 options with the boiled beef. Prices are given, including tax, on the menu itself. We were promptly greeted by an elderly Korean man, who took our orders and gave us a tub of green onions. On the table itself, there is salt, pepper and a red chili paste. Later, the man returns with a couple of side dishes.. one cabbage and one radish kimchi. Both were delicious! Tasted slightly different from all of the other types of kimchi I've tasted. My friends agreed. Our orders came out quickly. Definitely must add salt, green onions and the red chili paste to taste. Plenty of meat with some noodles on the bottom. SO GOOD, especially in the morning when it's freezing cold. Order also comes with a bowl of rice. Great combo!Plenty of street parking in front of the restaurant, but maybe that's because we came so early in the morning. On our way out, we noticed a couple of late night party go-ers walking in. FYI, Sul Lung Tang is also known as the hangover cure. WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AGAIN!!!"
9/24/2007,3 star rating,"Han Bat Shul Lung Tang... where you are greeted by the warm stench of bum feces in the parking lot. I nearly lost my lunch walking into the restaurant. If for any reason you can avoid parking in the lot, and park in the street instead, by all means, DO IT. But, let's get on with the restaurant. It's very bare bones. Everything. The menu, the decor... Not necessarily a bad thing. The kim chee was good, but I've had better. They don't give as much as other korean restaurants though. I also had the mixed bowl, which was pretty good. I finished it all, except for the liver, so it wasn't too bad.On the way out, some guy at a table mentioned that the parking lot smelled like ""doo doo."" I promptly held my breath and ran back to the car. All in all, it was just another average place deserving of a much average score."

Ordered the basic brisket Sul Lung Tang. It came out within 3 minutes. A spoonful of sea salt, 3 heaping scoops of scallions, radish kimchee and rice added to the soup is the perfect recipe for the ultimate Sul Lung Tang ever! Soup was so rich and deep, not overly smelly and the combination of the rest of the flavors and textures make it make it a home run."
3/12/2013,5 star rating,"Disclaimer: I have little to no experience with korean soup.Previously I have only had sul lung tang at I forget where as a giant bowl of lukewarm milk. I thought it was supposed to taste like beef, but it tasted more like the calcium in the bones... This definitely swayed me off coming with my friends from taekwondo last night. But I made the spontaneous decision to come, regardless, and I don't regret it.We walked in the tiny hole-in the wall restaurant at 7:20pm. Seriously though-if my friend hadn't already been a regular and known to take that turn, I would not have found the place myself. They have a tiny white sign that says ""han bat sul lang tang"" only visible from the little side street, which is even smaller from the back parking lot. The restaurant was relatively empty, and we were greeted immediately by the servers, who brought us rice and kimchi immediately while we waited (not long at all) for our soup.I'm coming to the conclusion that you know a place is authentic korean food when it has delicious kimchi. There is the cabbage type and the radish type, the cabbage of which has a slightly more garlic taste and the radish a slightly more sour taste. Exactly how I like it-and our table definitely devoured it bowls of it. I liked how the servers brought us extra bowls of it quickly, and didn't skimp on the size-though it might have been because my friend is a regular? The server made a point of recognizing that I was a new customer, and asked whether I enjoyed my food, which was a nice gesture.As others have mentioned, there are a few types of meat you can add to your sul lang tang: Mixed, intestine/tripe/spleen, tongue, brisket, flank (there may have been more?). The other option is all of the ingredients but without soup, which will cost you double (17.80) since it is more meat. Two of us went with mix, which is all of the other options but tongue, and the others went with intestine/tripe/spleen. You add red sauce, salt, pepper, green onions to your liking. I'm not quite sure whether red sauce is only hot sauce, or something else too.If anyone is squimish about eating organ, then this soup will definitely provide a good introduction. I was persuaded to get the mix by the friend who comes regularly, and had my first taste of intestine/spleen/tripe. I liked the tripe, as it was fatty, and the intestine for the same reasons, but the spleen had a mushy bloody aftertaste which was not as pleasant. The soup however was very good-not at all like warmed over milk, and had rich flavor.There is definitely truth to restaurants who live off serving one type of food becoming the best at it-and if you want good sul lang tang in LA you should come here (or perhaps good whatever the dry version is). Otherwise, go elsewhere for anything else, because they simply don't serve it."

8/25/2014,5 star rating,"This is classic Korean sick people food.  Han Bat is the first place I head for whenever I've got a sore throat or a bad cold.  There's something about the broth when mixed with the chili paste that clears my sinuses, coats my throat and settles my stomach right away.  The broth is beefy but not gamey.  The sul lung tang with beef spleen and intestines is my personal favourite.  The soup arrives unsalted but they give you MSG on the side to season it, which I never bother with as I don't think it's necessary.  The radish kimchi is an excellent accompaniment.  Cash only, and there is no ATM anywhere nearby."

4/15/2015,4 star rating,"This is one of the very few places that requires all payments in CASH only.  Sound confident?  They are, and they should be.They keep things simple.  They really only have one menu.  You just select the type of meat you want in your soup.  I read a previous review complaining about newly made kimchi.  Maybe this person is not Korean, but all suhlungtang restaurants serve newly made kimchi (gutjurie) and well-fermented radishes (kahkdugie).  This is a very basic feature of a suhlungtang restaurant, otherwise you'd be a regular Korean restaurant, and not a specialty suhlungtang house.I am a chef and I know about various types of food.  The only thing I wonder about is the color of their broth.  A little too white to completely convince me that it's purely the ox bone broth.  My guess is that they either add shrimp or shrimp-based sauce (industry secret) to enhance the flavor.  However, the white color suggests addition of coffee-mate like powder (Koreans call it preme), which is a pretty common practice in making suhlungtang.  Not my personal favorite way of making the broth, but hey, I can't deny that this is good.It's too perfect(?) tasting to not have some form of MSG, but when I'm here, I'm willing to forgive and forget.  Maybe I'm addicted to this place.  It's not the very best I've had, as I prefer more of a natural flavor versus the ""perfect(?)"" taste, but hey, that's being too tough of a critic.  I sure wish I had the option of giving them a 4 1/2 star, because their food warrants it...just not quite a 5-star because of the color of the soup and the high probability of miwon content.However, I am a tough critic."
11/17/2016,5 star rating,Amazing! worth the 25 min drive out of the way including traffic. This restaurant specializes in a Korean beef soup called sul lung tang. It is my first time having sul lung  tang so didn't know what to expect. The broth is amazing and the meat is of good quality. The key is that it is served *not salty* and so healthy -- you get to control how much salt you add to taste. Be sure to add plenty of the freshly cut spring onions and just a little salt. Tastes great and leaves you feeling good. Highly recommended!

5/31/2014,5 star rating,simplicity packed with a punch!! their beef broth taste amazing =) beside vietnamese beef noodle soup (PHO). This is my second choice for hangover food.
2/26/2017,5 star rating,My go to place when I'm feeling sick. Their soup is just the right amount of flavor to cure me. It's not overwhelming and does taste comforting/healthy. Service is nice and quick. Parking in the rear.
11/21/2013,3 star rating,"Five stars for sul lung tang ? !! I do like the soup base and the overall taste of the meal, but five stars !!?? No way. The dish is simply presented with small plates of kimchee and radish and a bowl of plain rice. No big deal. It's not like I haven't had sul lung tang before. Service was adequate. Restroom was subpar. Price was so so. Definitely three stars."

4/12/2017,5 star rating,This is the best sullungtang place to go. Cures hangover better than pho what more can you ask for?
9/27/2007,5 star rating,"Now that i have finally been to both Shul Lung Tang restaurants in the area..  I feel more comfortable reviewing the place.this would be the #1chioce and probably the only place I would go from now on. both restaurants are great.  But the soup here has more flavor, with the clear noodle, and its truly a hole in the wall kinda place.. which makes it even more fun and challenge to find in the first place. :-)but hey, i am there for the food. I will give any restaurant 5 stars for making my tummy happy. Another thought is the price seems a ittle higher when comparing with Vietnamese pho beef soup. But, its really no comparison, the broth is different. you get different type of food..the rice soup and the meat (the cut and the quality), a bowl of rice and the kimchi. so overall,  this is a much better deal. Besides, is it just me??? But I normally get hungry again within 2 hours eating a large bowl of pho. with the shul lung tang, it fills up my tummy  and thats the end of the story.. I don't have to look for something else to eat again until the next day. so go check out this place. your stomach will thank  you for it. :)"
10/30/2007,2 star rating,"Ack.  Like half the reviewers here, I came just because I saw it on yelp.  And well...Basically, I thought I knew all the good places in ktown for suhl lung tang (a more accurate transliteration than the current infuriating one), so I was sort of surprised to see this hole-in-the-wall restaurant at all, yet alone on yelp.  It's one of those places I'd just drive past without ever noticing..and I have, for years..despite going to the market across the street often.So today I was stuck in traffic on Western but decided to stop by to get some to-go for dinner (thank you mobile Yelp for loading quickly over edge on my iPhone).  Big. Mistake.The kimchi was no better than the kimchi you can buy at a supermarket.  Rather tasteless.  The spicy daikon (kak-du-gi) was nauseatingly disgusting.  I mean, given all these rave reviews, I had asked the waitress to give me an extra container of it, and then I opened, IN THE CAR WHILE DRIVING (in traffic at a red light), the container to taste some (I'm a kak-du-gi lover).  I was stuck at Western and Wilshire and I opened the stupid thing so I could eat it.  I almost pulled over because I thought I was going to vomit.So on the 10 back to the westside and home, I thought maybe that was just a fluke.  So when I came home, I had myself an early dinner.  Well, the soup was bland.  Average.  Nothing worth going out of my way for, in fact, more like worth going out of my way to avoid this place.So, yelp.  You've given me so many spectacular places to go to.  I feel so let down over this place though :(My two cents?  Skip Han Bat if you're in the mood for suhl lung tang, and go to the E-Moon Oak restaurant across the street from Koreatown Plaza (yelp.com/biz/AFjyz5lgtaW…).  Their suhl lung tang is pretty good, but better yet, they have the most amazing kimchi and kak-du-gi, especially the latter.  Plus, if I remember correctly, they're also a bit cheaper.  Han Bat was $18 for two to-go.One day I should go back to this place just to give it another chance, but it'll have to wait.  I still can't get the disgusting taste out of my mouth, sigh."
12/29/2010,3 star rating,"It wasn't as amazing as all the reviews said it would be. But maybe I was just too hyped up? It was good, but not thatt good. It was kinda bland, not as deeply flavorful as I expected. The price was kinda expensive, like $9 a bowl of sul lung tang so i don't think it's that good that it's worth $9. I'm sure they put alot of work into boiling all those beef bones though. I would still come back though just cuz I loveee Korean food, Koreans, and everything Korean in general. And also cuz you probably can't get this just anywhere. I actually kinda feel bad for writing this mediocre review about them because i lsuually ove korean food lol."
1/17/2011,5 star rating,"I'm not well versed in sul lung tang but I am a connoisseur of kimchi and at first smell I was sold. This entire operation is so smoothly run and the food is delicious. To be honest at first spoonful I was unimpressed with the broth then, after following the directions of many a yelper I dumped everything under the sun in for taste. At that point, wow - everything came together so well and it made for a very memorable meal that was a ton of food and wow, the kimchi was so good."
2/14/2011,3 star rating,"Cheap, quick hole in the wall.Sul Lung Tang is what they do. Pick your choice of meat. They use the clear noodles instead of the rice noodles, which I think is why their broth is a tad lighter. Top off with sea salt and green onions. Enjoy with sides of two kimchis: radish and cabbage. Kimchi is what makes a sul lung tang place great and theirs was just ok. I like to pour some of the kimchi juice into the sul lung tang.Parking in the back...valet."
3/11/2011,5 star rating,"best sullung tang ... in ktown. Simple menu, awesome kimchi and ggak doo gi, tons of green onions, 9 bucks.  I could eat this every day if I had the opportunity. no. really. Theres not much else to say about this place but theres nothing to lose, just try it, you have no excuse, no... I didnt know what to order-they have one thing (choose meats or if your vegetarian none) ... its not affordable-yes it is, 9 bucks with tax included, two skinny girls can share (not me).  try for yourself you'll be thanking me later :)"
3/14/2011,5 star rating,"Hmmm, all I can say is thank you yelpers!I came here on YOUR recommendations and I did not leave disappointed.The pickled radish was one of the best I've had, and the soup......Mmmm....the soup.....so flavorful and filled with generous portions of meat.I knew the chopped green onions were fresh because you could smell them as soon as the waitress put it on our table.The menu is small because they specialize in Sul Lung Tang, but they do a damn good job at it.  You go in, order and the kimchee, radish & rice comes out immediately.  After about 5 minutes (like all good sul lung tang places should be) they bring out your order.  I'm not sure how long they cook the broth for, but it is one of the best I've had in koreatown.all that for 9 bucks?  I'll definitely be back whenever I'm feeling sick or I'm in the mood for some good sul lung tang.P.S. the entrance to the parking lot is on Western across the street from the korean market."
5/3/2011,5 star rating,"I came here a little over a week ago. This place is so good. I finished the whole bowl of beef soup (yelp.com/biz_photos/uzAb…) even after going to a KBBQ place minutes beforehand. Yes, it was that good. Plus they serve you very good spicy daikon(yelp.com/biz_photos/uzAb…). I love Han Bat!"
8/12/2011,1 star rating,"A good friend of mine and I were both craving some delicious Korean food. And of course, we were lucky enough to be in Korea Town where the options are countless. Unfortunately, we did not have any internet access at the time so we asked two of our friends to Yelp a place we can try. They both suggested Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. Due to the high ratings, we decided to see what the buzz was all about.Right when we got in, the waiter sat us down at a small table. The restaurant, itself, was small and packed. I noticed that they were also foreigners as well as Korean people. Before we ordered, the waiter slammed a bucket of green onions on our table. There I was sitting down and I thought to myself...alright..what am I going to do with all of these onions then. After a minute or so, someone approached our table and asked if we were ready to order. Being that it was our first time at the restaurant, we were clueless as to what we should do next. At that point, we didn't even get the chance to look at any menu. The waiter pointed at a small sign on the table.Menu:Soup ($9.00 tax included)(4 other options of meat)My friend and I decided to try the mix soup. The food was prepared very quickly and about three minutes or so, everything was set on the table. Kim chi, rice, and mixed soup.The kim chi tasted pretty decent but we were extremely disappointed by the taste of the soup. To us, it tasted like water. The portion of meat was extremely small and the intestine had a bad smell to it. Overall, we were extremely disappointed and did not comprehend why the restaurant received such high reviews. Yes, the style is very different from other places but the options are limited and the food is not quite up to par. I usually never give out any low ratings but this has to be my very first one."
2/21/2012,5 star rating,"When it comes to sul lung tang, it doesn't get any better than Han Bat. I used to come here with my family even before the days of the internet (which comes to show just how great this hole in the wall is for surviving this long). I hope to one day take my future children here just like my parents did for me.If you prefer take out, don't bother calling ahead of time. It'll be ready in 2 minutes."
5/14/2012,5 star rating,"This place is hands down, the BEST sullungtang in ktown. I can't even begin to describe how much I love this place. The broth, the meat, the glass noodles, and kkakdugi-- my mouth is watering as I write this. This place is cheap, offers free parking, and is a great cure for hangovers, colds, or general hunger :)Bring cash! The only downside to this place is that they don't take card!"
2/13/2017,3 star rating,Great sul-lung tang been coming for years as its close to my house but they've raised prices and its getting a bit pricy for soup and rice.  I remember when it was much cheaper.  But the flavors are great and the kimchee is my personal favorite in LA.
12/31/2013,1 star rating,this is just not my cup of tea.tried the beef brisket soup-only two appetizer-have to add salt myself to season the soup.  the soup had salt added to it at all.-not enough choices on the menu.
10/25/2014,5 star rating,"The brisket is sooooo good. Went there when I wasn't feeling too good & instantly feel better after eating the soup. Also, ordering to go is a bigger portion I believe."
2/10/2016,1 star rating,i dont like this type of korean food. there was no flavor and you have to add a shit ton of onions for there to be any flavor and i dont love green onions so i was not happy. looks like dirty dish water to me.
3/14/2015,5 star rating,I love this place. Best donkatsu I've ever tasted! The service wasn't bad either. I wish more places were like this.
8/22/2013,5 star rating,Side dishes are great! The soup is very tasty unlike other places that just taste like water and noodles.
10/4/2014,5 star rating,"Love this place，is one of my favorite rest. The soup is soooo good, the kimchi and radish are always fresh."
2/17/2014,5 star rating,Stellar sul lung tang! the broth is full of character and flavor.  great place to grab a bowl of soup before your day begins.. or ends after a long night of drinking.
4/14/2014,2 star rating,"Came here on a whim since we were in the area. Consulted Yelp for places to eat and this place popped up with 4.5 stars and 700 reviews. I'm not really familiar with sul lung tang, so maybe I just wasn't eating it right, but the broth tasted rather bland, even after I had added garnished it."
9/24/2016,5 star rating,My favorite soup place ever.  Been eating here for last 3 years and my body seriously craves it once a week.  It's so conforting like a big hug.
2/13/2015,5 star rating,"This place has the best sullungtang in all of Koreatown, and I've been around. It's definitely an ""eat-n-go"" type of restaurant, especially since there's always one or two people waiting for their turn while they leer at your food from time to time.  Their service is on point plus they have the best radish kimchi around. It's a cash only place so make sure you bring your greenbacks."
8/2/2014,5 star rating,The suhlungtang here is probably the best in all ktown and California. Period. Service isn't the best and it's just a small mom and pop type restaurant. .. but the food and kakdugi here is what I give the 5 stars to.
5/11/2009,4 star rating,"I've only been here a couple of times, but I'm already a HUGE fan of this place. The Sul Lung Tang here is the JAM! I like to think of it as a sort of korean ""comfort food."" It's perfect for cold days, after drinking, or whenever you're just feeling lazy and want something soothing and filling! The first time I came here, I came with a few other friends, and although most of us loved it, a few of them didn't like the soup, so I guess it really is a matter of taste. Whenever I go, I usually get either the brisket or mixed sul lung tang. Pricing is really good as well, about $9-11 dollars.Service is pretty typical for a fast korean restaurant. Not bad, but not spectacular either. They are really fast when it comes to take out though. I'll call in, show up 15 minutes later, and everything is ready to go in a brown bag. Even when I get home, the soup is still STEAMING, which lets me know that they've packaged everything well. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fast, cheap, filling, and delicious meal."
8/17/2009,5 star rating,"Wow! I think this is how every restaurant should be! There are only 5 things on the menu 1) Mix ( beef combo from 2 thru 4) 2) Brisket 3) Flank4) Innards of beef 5) beef tongue. Why is that good? Because that is all Han Bat Sul Lung Tang makes . . . Sul Lung Tang. And because they only make Sul Lung Tang, they make it perfect. To top it off, they also have a big bucket of fresh diced green onions for you to add freely:DWait! Not only the soup is good... they have the best kimchi. Ever. I've never had better kimchi.... just the right amount of spiciness, just the right feel of crunch, just the right amount of saltiness and sourness. I think i finished my bowl of rice with just the kimchi:D LOVE IT!Not much decor at the place, but who cares? When you see that the crowd is 98% Korean, you know you've came the to the right place."
10/9/2009,5 star rating,"WOW! this place is SOOOOOO good! i loved how they only had verrry few things on their menu. they're serious about their sul lung tang haha. sul lung tang or soo yook. and then u can choose your meat. I got sul lung tang with brisket, and though others have said the soup was bland, it was far from. Even without any seasonings (including salt) I tried a few spoonfuls and it was verrry flavorful. but I like mine a little spicier so I put in the pepper paste, a little salt, and some green onions. Kkadduki was good, kimchi i didn't try, but overall definitely the best sul lung tang i've ever had. sure the place is a little smelly and hole-in-the-wall-y but the food makes it worth it. oh and remember, they only take cash."
11/10/2009,4 star rating,"There's something about a steaming hot bowl of stew on a cold night. Add tons of delicious brisket to it, some kimchi and pickled daikon, and you're set!! So why not 5 stars? We didn't get barley tea!! Do patrons have to ask for it?My friend and I wanted to try something authentic in Koreatown, and found this restaurant quite highly rated. I would agree with the ratings. The food came out incredibly fast, and was solid. Actually, I've never ordered this in my life, so I can't compare it with anything. But just as it is, I thought it was delicious. The service was awesome as well. As other yelpers have mentioned, you must use the green onions quickly! Good thing I listened, because about 10-15 minutes after our food came out, they took our bin of green onions away. :)"
8/24/2010,5 star rating,"This is a hole in the wall, and yes, they have the best beef bone soup in town.You add in green onions ( I add copious amounts), sea salt, and if you desire, some hot paste too. I don't know the English name, and I don't know how to spell it phonetically. Minus one star to myself!You can't go wrong here. Just remember, Korean service is based on, ""excuse me! I need something."" They won't dote on you, if you just sit there. Call them over, and don't be shy. I always park at the Carl's Jr. Just run away, and make sure no staff sees you."
9/17/2010,4 star rating,"I walked into this place and, since I was the only non-Korean in there, the server asked me if I was in the right spot. I said, ""Beef noodle soup, right?"" And she said, ""Yes!""There are only two choices on the menu: soup or a platter. She brought me out a steaming bowl of soup, a big container of green onions, and kimchi.I did it up like Kevin L recommended and the soup was great! The broth was tasty, the beef was tender, and the kimchi was fantastic.The soup was $9 and Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is a great alternative to Daikokuya if you don't feel like going downtown or want something other than pork belly. I'll be back..."
2/21/2011,5 star rating,"This is definitely a hole in the wall. We looked this place up on yelp under ""Korean Soup"" and decided to try it. We drove past this place the first time. Hidden between a hair salon and some other store, it would be hard to notice unless you know exactly what you're looking for.The inside looks like an old place with few customers at 5:30 in the late afternoon. Once you go inside, you get seated and there is a menu with very few items. At first I thought I went to the wrong place, because this place seemed dirty and old. However, I gave them a benefit of a doubt and decided to stick with it and try. I really had no idea what Sul Lung Tang was. I should've done more research because I brought my vegetarian friend with me. He ordered the brisket soup while I ordered the mixed beef soup. With green onions, salt and two types of kim chi, it was a wonderful experience. My friend said that the soup was better than he expected and he did enjoy some of it, especially the kim chi, which we think might be homemade. I would definitely come back here, but not with a vegetarian. In addition, I can see this place being awesome for a hangover. Also cash only."
3/16/2011,5 star rating,I love this restaurant. simple and delicious...i usually order beef tongue and brisketCONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!
3/27/2011,4 star rating,I go there all the time!quick easy and they give you lots of spring onions!!!!!
4/25/2011,5 star rating,"BEST sulungtang!!!!!!!!!! Sulungtang isn't really the kind of thing I crave, but this place has the best tasting ones in all of koreatown. The kimchi is perfectly aged to go along with the soup, but have a pair of scissors handy. They're not cut into little pieces as is the tradition when served with this soup.Their mixed meat plate has tongue, tripe, heart, intestines from what I remember. It's not for everyone and it'll run you close to $15-20."
10/3/2011,5 star rating,The 5 stars is simply for the food. I was here last night and the sul lung tang is pretty dang good! Couple drawbacks is that it was $9 but they didn't give you that much. I was comfortably full after but could've still eat more. The kimchi and kakdoogee is also good and goes best w/ the sul lung tang.Would go back again when in the mood. Good thing about sul lung tang too is that it's good for you!Service here was good too.
12/7/2011,4 star rating,"The neighborhood looks a little shady, and the store isn't much of a looker (it looks a little sketchy from the outside), but this place really has one of the best sullongtang you'll find. I like it better than Keungama's sullongtang.It was very simple a traditional. They give you kimchi dishes, the soup and rice and you can add the salt, pepper and green onions yourself. You should definitely taste the soup before you add anything since it is very flavorful. Add the salt slowly--take a sip after a little bit each time I would recommend since the soup would be ruined if it were over-salted!If you've never had sullongtang i would recommend the brisket or the tripe but not the mixed kind--if only to avoid the spleen in your soup since many are not used to the taste of organs haha. It's seriously the best comfort food in the world :) Nothing warms you up on finals week like a homey bowl of sullongtang!"
5/9/2012,4 star rating,"I'm ready to go back here. Han Bat is the kind of place I love: a food joint that focuses on doing one kind of thing and doing it well. This place is a no frills, two item menu, two item ban chan kinda joint.I got the mixed sul lung tang (Brisket, Flank, Tongue, Tripe, Intestine, Spleen). The broth itself is amazingly deep and developed and the brisket is sliced thinly and nearly fall apart tender. This was also a very quick way to discover I'm not a fan of spleen but you might be.Each order also comes with a side of rice, kimchi, and picked daikon. It's the kind of soup that you'd be happy to eat at a friend's house when it's raining outside.Just a reminder, it's cash only."
1/4/2015,5 star rating,"Besides the ox bone soup itself, the kimchi is really good. Best for winter time and a simple meal."
7/27/2014,5 star rating,"I usually give 5 stars to only places that I would be a repeat customer - and this is one of those places.   Some may think it's overrated b/c it's a simple beef soup, but if you grew up eating this soup - it's downright good comfort food!"
9/12/2014,5 star rating,"Ahh my go to place for Sul Lung Tang (Beef Bone Soup?) since I was a teeny weeny child. Food:To me, this is as good as it gets in Socal. I've been coming here since I was a kid and now. Maybe it could just be a childhood taste revived but when I think Sul Lung Tang, I automatically think of Han Bat, I normally get the soup with Brisket. Whether I have a cold, a hangover, or just hungry this is where I come. Their broth is very flavorful. Just add a pinch of salt some green onions and some GgakDooGi (ki) juice. (this is just a preference, they do have some hot sauce paste but I just like the juice from the spicy radish cubes better) OHH Their Ggakdooki is so good! I usually drink a little soup first, put in the rice and eat it with the ggakdooki. The combo was just meant to be. It's fate. Haha. There is a reason why this place has been around for a long long long time since I was a child. Customer Service, Atmosphere and Parking:The waitresses are really not attentive so you have to always call them for something but not much to call them about other than some more side dish (kimchi or ggakdooki), water or green onions. I think the only time they are attentive is to get you out because they are pretty fast with giving you the check without you asking. As for parking, there is parking in the back with about maybe 20ish spaces. It's in an alley right across from the Carls Jr. The inside (and outside) is old but when all you're eating is the soup you don't really need much else. Guess you can call it a hole in the wall.Prices:Price is I believe $9.50ish a bowl now. I could be wrong by a couple cents. Used to be $9.00 but they raised the price."
11/1/2011,5 star rating,"food: if you like sul lung tang, you need to try han bat sul lung tang.  this place is super authentic and the flavors are delicious.  i love the simplicity of their menu.  service: very korean :) final thoughts: great place for a very affordable bowl of deliciousness"
10/31/2011,5 star rating,"Possibly one of the greatest Korean hole in the walls ever. If you are Korean, you must come here and experience this home-away-from-home cooking. It tastes just like our Korean grandmothers' cooking - except better. If you're not Korean and you want some nice beefy brothy soup (aka sul-lung-tang) with a side of our beloved kimchi at its finest - I'd say its about time you treat yourself out. Heads up: It is a bit difficult to find, but there is parking right behind the restaurant (a recent discovery I made on my last trip here)! Also, I think my MSG-radar might have went off with the kimchi, but then again, I did eat all of it...Flat price of $9.00 - tax is already included :) but CASH ONLY :("
10/19/2011,2 star rating,"K, Ate here yesterday with my Korean friend after reading some of the 256 reviews that were posted.We arrive and find that it's a TINY little spot amid a residential area (right across the street from Carl's Jr). Just FYI there is parking, you just have to go directly behind the restaurant.So basically it's all soup. As soon as you walk in the Korean waitress hands you a plastic cup of water and she kinda waits for you to tell her which soup you want (I think there are only like 9 options, Beef or Boiled Beef parts..haha).She brings it out and my friend and I chat and enjoy the very flavorful meat. Not a lot of noodles, and I think the broth is supposed to be a bit bland so that you can take that huge plastic cup of salt and mix it to taste.Now I'm Korean but I don't speak; I intentionally brought my Korean friend because she speaks and together, we're some happy Korean girls, but no, the service was still sub-par. I suppose I didn't expect anything less from an ""authentic"" Korean place. At one point I smilingly waved at her and pointed at my empty glass of water, to which she nodded....and never returned. Later she walked around with a pitcher of water but only selectively poured refills to only certain tables.I was so thirsty by that point (I did salt my broth to taste!) that all the ice was gone and I was done being nice. I flagged her down with an ""Excuse me!"" I told her to bring us our check (because for the entire 1.25 hours we were there she never came back after giving us our soup) and to refill our waters PLEASE.Tax is already included in the price so we added a few more bucks and were done. I think I'd only go there again if I needed some good hardcore soup and then take off. But then again, it's Ktown and I've been to some pretty good soup places that weren't so...aloof.3 stars for the good food, 2 stars for the lack of service, and I'm sticking to 2 stars because in LA you can't be writing off customers!"

10/13/2011,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this sulong ttang place. I always get the brisket with 2 bowls of rice. I love the kimchi and fermented radish. Every time I come to LA, I always crave this place. Hands down the best sulong ttang in the country! :)"

10/11/2011,5 star rating,"Let's just say you wake up on Sunday around 1pm and your head is throbbing from your inebriated friend who tackled you into the wet floor bathroom sign and your mouth tastes like cotton-ball-flavored shochu at an undisclosed booking club the night before. If any of these things happened to you, you should immediately go here. It's like a magical hangover ferry appears and waves her wand to put a smile on your face. And just like that, you have your Sunday back."
10/9/2011,4 star rating,"Glad I found this spot on Yelp because I used to go to Gahm Mi Oak a lot when I lived in NYC.  I think the latter is a tad better, mostly because I prefer the ample amount of rice noodles (Han Bat uses a sparse amt of glass noodles) and how they put the rice into the bowl (Han Bat serves a bowl of rice on the side).  But I LOVE how Han Bat also serves two kinds of kimchi (that was one of the things I loved most about Gahm Mi Oak).While we were eating, I said, ""I wonder why this place got a B rating...""  My bf responded, ""Um, I don't think you really want to know, and I wouldn't think about it.""  He's right.  And since I'm not thinking about it, I'll definitely go back. :oD"
10/6/2011,5 star rating,Beef Tongue Sul Lung Tang ROCKS my world!This place has been around for over 20 years+ and it'll continue to be around for another 20 more.Oldie but goodie...
10/30/2013,4 star rating,I think i prefer E-moon oak over this place. You can park behind the restaurant but you gotta go through a tiny alleyway. Cash only
8/23/2016,4 star rating,Good stuff! I got the crazy bowl with all the organ meats. But the spleen was kinda nasty. Tasted like gritty poop. But the rest of it was awesome. I'd go back! Just no spleen. :)
8/17/2016,4 star rating,"If you are not familiar with Asian food, this place is bit hard for you. But if you try  again and again these type of Korean style beef base soup will addict to you like Vietnamese noddle or Japanese ramen. Place is always busy and packed but did not wait longer than 15mins. Also if you are first time to visit, make sure bring your korean friend(or ask waitress)to order and ask about what is the best way to eat this sul lung tang(korean beef soup)."
5/4/2016,5 star rating,Been coming as a child and I still love it! Best sulungtang in koreatown!  It's cash only so make sure you bring cash or will have to pay for the atm fee. Thank you for the great food!

11/29/2013,3 star rating,"Came here 2 weeks ago with lots of expectations due to the great reviews in yelp. There was a strong beef smell on entering but was accustomed to it after a while. Food came quickly but there isn't much ingredient. Overall, a satisfying experience."
3/1/2016,5 star rating,"I like this simple place and their simple menu, their radish kimchi is my favorite! And the beef tongue soup it's really good, the soup is very milky, I like to put a lot of green onion and just a little bit salt in it, then mixed the rice into the soups together, everything is simple here but the taste is unforgettable! Come earlier if you don't want to wait for a long time:-) *Yelp it!*"
8/2/2009,5 star rating,"Their Sul lung tang is absolute best. I love Sul lung Tangs and I could get by having them everyday. Good having hangover, good at lunch, and good at dinner. You get the picture. As you walk in, this place still has that 80's Seoul restaurant atmosphere. Simple chairs and table, good foods.I seeked good sul lung tangs and visited few famous ones in Seoul, yet I still found Han bat as one of the best. I have no doubt that this place is the best Sul lung Tang place outside the Korean Peninsula.Only complain is that their price rose faster than CPI over the last decade, but it's still good priced.But their Sul lung Tang is sooooo good. I'm having a craving as I type."
11/5/2010,5 star rating,"Hanbat is a sullungtang restaurant without peer. The broth is soothing, the service is quick and all the right fixings are present. They have some of the best radish kimchi for miles.It's a small, hole-in-the-wall place. It can seat larger groups, but you wouldn't wanna throw your birthday bash here."
11/5/2011,5 star rating,"This place is, hands down, the BEST Sullung Tang in Koreatown. Hole-in-the-wall restaurants have never failed me and this place does not disappoint! Once you've had their Sullung Tang, you can't go anywhere else!They offer a very simple menu, which is just awesome. The servers are attentive, seeing that it's a very small restaurant. As much as I love this place, I hate the fact that this is a 'CASH ONLY' place. But other than being cash only, there is no downfall to this restaurant!*Parking is a bit hard, in my opinion. The parking is through a small alley and has limited spots*"
3/1/2014,5 star rating,"Also my favorite sul lung tang jip in ktown! I love the guk here and ggak du ghi. Ggak du ghi with the sullungtang matchs perfectly!!

1/4/2015,5 star rating,"Nothing will ever beat the food served here. Its comfort food on steroids. Its a big warm hug with every bite. The banchan is a very, very close second. The service is always so fast. The food comes out even faster. They have a private parking lot with their very own security guard. The only downside is that its CASH ONLY. But if you can remember this, you have nothing to worry about."

8/19/2013,4 star rating,"I never really had this kind of Korean dish before but it was definitely good and healthy. There is only two items on the menu as everyone else has said. Be aware that your not gonna be exploded with flavor... as I was expecting but a very simple Soup. I definitely enjoyed the chunks of meat in it.. All the chunks. Liver, brisket, and intestine all in my soup. Never had that before but not bad. The service was friendly and quick. The kim chi is average like the other reviewer said but they give a good portion of rice and its a good value for 8.72 or what ever it was. Might stop by here again in the future if I want a simple and healthy dish."
11/10/2013,2 star rating,"The broth is not very flavorful, the brisket is alright, and although i was going to comment that ""you get what you pay for"", i have had much better shul-lung-tang for this price. On the plus side, the waitress is nice and the food arrives to tour table very fast."
12/19/2015,5 star rating,I've been coming here for two decades now. No other sullungtang restaurant can compete with the scrumptious broth or the pickled radishes.

1/10/2013,3 star rating,"This place got tons of reviews so I figured I'd try it. The store front is very unassuming. If you didn't already know about this place there would be no way you would know that it's a restaurant. There is just soup and different meat options you want in your soup, brisket, tripe, spleen, or all of the above. You got 3 condiments salt, green onion, and chili paste. The soup wasn't bad but I felt the cuts of meat tasted really gamey like the spleen. The kimchi here is really good. But the look and feel of this place reminded me of a free soup kitchen in skid row. It's kinda dingy in there. Everyone just gets the same soup. My Korean friend did enjoy the soup and said that it's legit. But I think I prefer if they had more variety like oxtail and the vinegary dipping sauce. Glad I tried this place but probably won't be back."
10/4/2011,4 star rating,"This is definitely my favorite Sul Lung Tang place in LA. Coming from NY, I was on a mission to find a good Sul Lung Tang, comparable to Gham Mi Oak restaurant on 32nd street. I'm giving 4 stars just because Kimchi and Kakdugi are not as great as Gham Mi Oak. If you're from NY & a fan of Gham Mi Oak, this is the place in LA for you!"
8/9/2013,4 star rating,"Rumor has it that this place has the best sullungtang in town. And boy were they right. Their kkakdoogi is amazing!!! I love how you can choose the different meat options. Their menu is very simple and only serve what they're known for, sullungtang. just as good as the ones you get in Korea."
3/18/2016,5 star rating,Very nice and tasty:) only thing to take note is that u need to add salt yourself to the soup and can also request for the chili paste if u like it spicy. Service was fast and the kimchi was good. Take note that they only accept cash.

9/3/2008,5 star rating,"im pretty lazy, but when it comes to food, excuse me, good food, youd be shocked what lengths i would go. i used to drive down to seoul gom tang in santa clara from san francisco on a weekly basis to get my gom tang fix..... and since its a forty minute drive one way, id want to get my times worth so i would order a gom tang* doh ga knee usually* and a nang myun. yep. two orders. sure i would leave full beyond belief, where one missed burp could end up being a yacking session, but i would be a smiling, happy, semi awake euge. ive been hearing about this one place for awhile now. i remember having a little pm discussion about this place and sul lung tang in general with grace k more than a year ago. apparently, this han bat place is supposed to have some of the best sul lung tang in the states. i finally had chance to try it out this weekend. either i gotta get a much faster car or i think i will be racking up them frequent flyer miles now.damn good sul lung tang. if you like beef broth korean soups, you need to try this place. hands down the best ive had stateside. nothing even close... but then again i AM from san francisco, the purgatory of korean cuisine. this place is hard to find if your not from around here. i punched in the addy in the navigation..... lead me to a COMPLETELY nondescript ""entrance""...... oh!!!! the street side door is the ""backdoor"". the alleyway parking lot is the ""front entrance"".so who wants to fly to la to go get some han bat sul lung tang for lunch today?"

8/2/2008,5 star rating,"Even though I reviewed this place a year ago, I still make this place my go to place in K Town.  Especially if I'm on my own, since I don't want to give out everyone of my ""secret"" places to eat, and I know some of my friends can't handle random guts/meat in a meaty broth.However, after a long night, a few of my compadres were a bit hungover, thus, I figured Sul Lung Tang is the way to go, and boy, was I right.  On the drive there, I warned about the guts and shit in the soup, and they were fine with it.  Most of us non-Americanized Asians (aka Fobs) can handle any type innards and I consider spleen and tongue to be a real treat.  Anyways, Han Bat SLT is a hole in the wall, that offers no frills other than some bomb ass meaty soup.After we ordered (I always go with the Combo, since you get a bit of everything) we were given kimchi, ggak doo gee, and rice.  You're also given a nice iced cup of bori cha..or is it roasted corn water?  Anyways, once the main course is here, I'd recommend you to taste the soup to see how much of the sea salt you want to put in there.  I'd usually put in a spoonful of the salt, many many spoonful of the green onions, and a nice scoop of the red chili paste.  After that, dump in the rice, mix and eat.How do I judge a 5 star place like Han Bat??  No one talked during the meal, everyone's bowl was cleaned off, in fact I got pissed at one friend for leaving a strand of the glass noodles in the bowl.  $10/person after tax and tip.  This place is da bomb.   Whether you have a hangover or not, whether it's summer or winter, I'll continue to come here.  Parking in the back, the ah juh si in the back that watches the parking lot is a nice guy, I think he's seen me way too many times by now."

7/16/2010,5 star rating,"The Alpha and the Omega of Sul Lung Tang. After reading a few of the reviews citing ""bland"" tang (soup), I feel a ""Han Bat Sul Lung Tang for Dummies"" course is needed.  First select your meat for your tang, my favorite is the Yang-Ji (Flank), beginners might want to go with the brisket. Clear your cell phones and keys from the center of the table and await the full bounty of a cup of water, 2 small bowls of kim chi, bowl of rice, your big bowl of tang, and a big bowl of chopped scallions (be quick with the scallions as she's passed around like a medieval wench from table to table, I personally love extra wench err I mean scallions so I dump about 6 spoonfuls in my tang). Now at this point if you were to dig in you'd be mildly disappointed and it seems many of you have missed the crucial step of flavoring your meal. To your right or left depending which way you're facing, you can find containers of Salt, Pepper, and Dah Dae Gi (Garlic and Chili paste). Salt is a requirement, quantity is entirely up to you, pepper can be used but is not required. A couple scoops of Dah Dae Gi (dont forget to stir it in) to me is like the mustard on hot dogs... cant be missed. But be forewarned, you will reek like garlic ass afterward. If you're truly a bad ass, spike your tang with some Kim Chi juice and you can fit in with the older Korean men  in the back wearing white socks with black shoes and plaid pants. Once your bowl of tang is adequately flavored, dump as much rice into the bowl as possible, give it a good stir, take a kim chi (I alternate between the 2 provided) and place it on top of a spoon full of tang and rice. Masticate, enjoy and repeat. As you near the finale of the meal, pick up the bowl with both hands bring it to your mouth and finish it off like you mean it. That's how you Han Bat."
8/11/2012,1 star rating,"I have been going here for years.  I have introduced hundreds of people to this place.  It used to be one of my favorite spots in LA.Unfortunately, that has all changed.The quality of the meat has been declining for the year but it was one particular incident that has ruin Han Bat forever for me.My wife took her mother there for lunch.  She left her designer sunglasses there on accident.  She called immediately and the manager/owner said that he had them and would keep them safe.She goes back to retrieve them and suddenly no one knows anything about them.  They even ask are you talking about the green Kate Spades?  When my wife says yes, they all look at each other and say they don't know anything about them.Really, are a pair of used sunglasses so desirable that you are going to throw away hundreds of patrons.  I have told this story to everyone that I referred.  I know it is only a pair of sunglasses but it is a matter of principle.  The owner himself promised to keep them safe.  When he failed to do so, he should done something.  Even an admission of guilt would have been enough.  A simply apology would have been even better; but for him to lie to our face and say that he never spoke to anyone about sunglasses is a true embarrassment to the Korean people.  Not all Koreans are liars and thieves.Whoever took the glasses.  I hope you are getting enough enjoyment out of them to justify the damage you have done to your restaurant and to your people.  Yes, I am Korean and I am truly embarrassed."
1/2/2012,5 star rating,"The best alternative to a Korean girlfriend that can cook you awesome Korean soups is a Korean restaurant that can make an even better soup.  Yeah...HanBat only makes sul lung tang, but they make it better than any one or any place I know of.  Usually, I stay clear of ordering sul lung tang at Korean restaurants because they don't make it right, but since I was in the Koreatown area of L.A. anyway...why not give it a shot.  I would have preferred to get gomtang a few blocks away but the reviews on Yelp about HanBat were just too good to pass up.  Glad I got a chance to taste this awesomeness that only cost $8.28.  Nine dollars with tax.  The options for sul lung tang are: flank, brisket, tongue, intestines & tendon, or mixed.  Whatever you decide on, it's sure to be good.  Get the mix sul lung tang to find out what suits you best for your next trip to HanBat like me.  All the Yelpers were right about the kimchee too.  Pretty good stuff..."

4/18/2012,4 star rating,"There are some of you out there who are not, shall we say, of Mongoloid descent, and to whom the name of this establishment reads like the name of a Klingon general.  And there are some of you who are not, shall we say, culturally sophisticated enough to know what a Klingon is, and with whom I have now successfully obliterated all chances of coupling.  But many of you who are Mongoloid consumers of pop culture will know that Han Bat Sul Lung Tang, roughly translated from its native American, means ""Holy fartballs; ox-water is sexy!""Now, I used to believe that modern history truly began with the 1975 release of Mandingo, and by that logic, the world is only about as old as Tara Reid.  But let me tell you, when I experienced Han Bat for the first time last week, I decided that nothing that ever happened before that moment really mattered.  The world as I knew it began anew as soon as the first slurp hit my gullet and washed down my throat.  A blinding light erupted from my bowl, followed soon after by a pair of hands that breached the surface of the soup and extended outward for leverage.  Before long, Jesus Christ himself stood on the table before me, arms outstretched and head cocked slightly to the right, beckoning with His eyes for me to embrace Him and run my fingers through His beard.I felt tears gently trickling down my perfectly sculpted cheeks, which is when I realized I had involuntarily slipped off my jeggings.  Bottomless but unashamed, I threw my arms around Soup Jesus and whispered, ""My butt is wet,"" at which point He split open the ceiling, wrapped me in his purple robe, and climbed clumsily through the hole he had just created, passive-aggressively suggesting all the while that I ease up on the Choco-Pie consumption.When we emerged on the other side, we stood in the middle of an open field adjacent to a farmstead, where a toothless farmer appeared to be grooming a sleeping ox with a machete.  I immediately estimated it to be circa 14th Century Korea, and by the sound of the dirt, I could taste the smell of blood in the air.  Sure enough, as Soup Jesus and I drew closer, we witnessed the expert butchering of said ox, whose bones were thrown into a pot of water boiling nearby.  Children emerged from a ramshackle hut and began smothering themselves in the entrails of the ox, chanting ""Sul-lung-tang!"" while the farmer sat down, wiped the blood from his hands, and began picking bits of petrified dung from under his toenails.  ""I'm so glad I was born into the era of Terence Trent D'Arby and gummy bear vitamins,"" I thought wistfully, just as Soup Jesus of Sul Lung Tang Past engulfed me in His robe once again.We reappeared in Han Bat, but I now saw myself seated at the table, waiting to be served my delicious bowl of broth.  I was still fully clothed, though, so for the sake of continuity, I snuck up behind myself and carefully removed my jeggings, reduced to tears by the unveiling of my flawless posterior, which I had never before seen face-to-ass.  As Soup Jesus #2 emerged from the bowl on the table, Original Soup Jesus tousled my hair, fully lifted up His robe to reveal a dark void underneath, and beckoned me to enter.  With disconcerting but half-remembered  childhood experiences dancing wildly in my head, I did as I was instructed.The purple robe fell to the floor behind me, leaving me in darkness for but a moment before a flood of bright lights rushed forth.  Overwhelmed by the display, I screamed ""Oh my GOD!  Soup Jesus is full of stars!"" and suddenly, I found myself sitting at a table in an empty kitchen.  A door opened, and an ox entered, wearing an apron and walking on hind legs, with its arms full of human limbs.  Humming the Blue Danube waltz, the ox carefully placed each arm and leg into a giant pot, turned on the heat, and began clapping its hooves together and chanting ""Sul-lung-tang!""  I was horrified, but Soup Jesus simply chuckled and quietly uttered the only words I would ever hear Him speak: ""I love this part.""I leapt up from the table, looking to make a quick exit from the nightmare, but as I did so, I found myself back in present-day Han Bat again.  My table was overturned in front of me, and all the wonderful kimchi was scattered across the floor, along with my empty sul lung tang bowl.  I momentarily wrestled with the urge to smear the kimchi across my body and chant; luckily, a kindly waitress approached me with the bill and a look in her eye that told me, ""Don't worry, it happens all the time.  Also, your butt is wet.""I glanced about the restaurant and saw that other tables were being lifted off the floor.  Utterly satisfied with my meal and - I'm not ashamed to admit it - ever so slightly aroused, I belched, paid for my food, and proclaimed, ""Holy fartballs; ox-water is sexy...""My advice?  Add salt, pepper, and green onions to your soup for the ultimate sul lung tang experience, and make sure to wear something more water resistant than jeggings."

SO.. han bat sul lang is a very savory but light soup with meat. menu is very simple - $9 (includes tax) for brisket, flank, tongue, intestines or a mix (can only choose one). it's $18 for broiled beef. delicious, light and hearty. add some rice, a little red sauce and a bit of salt... and it's just a great warm breakfast to start the day off with. :) and plus you don't feel overloaded with carbs and grease and probably awesome for post-hang over!a definite recommendation! you also get a few little sides of kimchi. :)btw... it's VERY hole in the wall.. and hard to recognize unless you're looking for it. Street parking only."

1/9/2011,5 star rating,"If you want to know where the best place to eat sul-lung tang  in Koreatown is...... it's this place. Don't be disappointed when you first walk in because it's small, cramped, dirty, etc....because the food is so bomb that it makes up for the lack of nice ambiance. I usually get the sul-lung tang with only steak (without all the other cow body parts) and dump like 5 spoonfuls of sliced onions, and some salt and pepper. Eating it with their kimchi and kkak-doo-gi (radish in the kimchi sauce) makes the soup THAT MUCH greater than other sul-lung tang place sin koreatown. The food generally comes out super fast and parking is usually very easy to find!"
8/13/2007,5 star rating,"No hung jury on this place - everyone loves it. Their hot, viscous, healing slurry of old-world broth will cure just about anything. The tripe-intestines-spleen broth is the best tasting of the bunch, if you can handle it. If you can't, then learn to handle it. One warning though, I love organ meat but eating the spleen itself takes some getting used to, so leave it be the first couple times."
12/15/2008,4 star rating,"How did I not know about this place until now?? The soup here is soooo good. Especially for a hangover, heh. I like that I can control how much of everything that's added to my soup. This other Sul Lung Tang place in town that I tried, their soup was too salty and meat was too tough for my liking. Also it was on the other side of ktown. This place is much much closer. Yay for proximity!"
8/21/2012,5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Ever since I went there, I always crave it more and more. Sul lung tang is not only great hang over food, but it is also very hearty! You don't have to have the dilemma of picking rice or noodles because this place can give you both! The meat is very tender. I also love how this restaurant gives you salt so you can put however much salt you want; the kim chi is also the perfect texture and when I put it in my sul lung tang, the concoction is complete. I love this place, and in fact, I'm craving sul lung tang right now :(!"
4/14/2010,5 star rating,"There are certain LA hangover meals so good that I would induce a hangover just to enjoy. The sul lung tang here is one of them. Put it right up there with the birria from el parian as one of the best hangover dishes in LA. The broth is perfect, the beef succulent, and I'll be damned if this isn't the one place in Koreatown where the waitresses promptly refill water. If you are looking particularly haggard, they might even give you your own pitcher. Just be warned! the combination of a long night of drinking, fatty broth, and copious amounts of water might induce a little bowel movement party time well before you are safe at home! (I know that was graphic, but I'm just trying to look out for my fellow yelpers. When this happens to you, you will come home, bring my review up on yelp, and click useful.)"
3/15/2010,1 star rating,"I found a bug (looked like a worm) in my sul lung tang and it came from the kimchi. I had taken it to-go and when I called to complain, they did NOT apologize but instead said that it's NORMAL to have bugs in kimchi. Their excuse was that bugs naturally form inside the sae-woo jut but... Anyway, after that experience, I'm never going there."
10/16/2012,5 star rating,Best hangover soup ever :) And the kimchi/radish is SIMPLY to die for especially when you mix it into your soup
2/10/2014,4 star rating,"Good food but not on the upper echelon of sullungtang. I only get beef brisket sullungtang so I can't say much about their other menu. Even though it's small, the atmosphere is friendly, so no pressure when eating. The service is quick and friendly."
6/4/2008,4 star rating,"Gotta agree this place is one of my top choices for sul lung tang although I need to go back someday when I'm sober just to see how good it really is.  I usually needed my k friends to take me here cuz I never drove until I remembered the Carls Jr. next door.  The kimchi and the radish are pretty awesome.  Mouth is watering thinking about it, think I need to drink again as an excuse to go back..."
5/19/2007,5 star rating,Simply good eats.  This place has the best kkak-doo-gee kimchi ever...2nd to my mom's.  Hands down the best shul lung tang jip ever!!!
11/15/2008,1 star rating,"Oh hell no,,, I think you got to be korean  to like this place.. I think they eat better in prison.. went there with some friends after reading the wonderful reviews on here to realize they must have been smoking some serious $%$% to write them.. Basically there are 2 items on the menu ,, and they both are soup.... soup that doesn't look very appetizing nor taste anything close to decent..  Save your 10 bucks its not worth it .... go somewhere else trust me,,,been to many restaurants over the years but this is one of only 2 that i could not stomach to put that so called soup in my mouth,,,"
5/1/2013,5 star rating,"For a hole in the wall type place, Han Bat gets 5 stars! Their sulung tang is consistently good every time I visit. For banchan you get 2 types of kimchi, but that's all you need. I'll happily pay $9 per bowl instead of simmering a pot of bones all day at home for sulung tang."
11/7/2013,4 star rating,"Really good.  Simple menu, 2 items.  Legit Korean beef soup with all the tasty trimmings!  Not 5 stars because I would have preferred some more panache, but simple is also great.  Just make sure you know it's simple and basic before you come here... a lot of the other KBBQ places around set really high standards for features and options!  :)"
7/21/2013,5 star rating,"This review is long over due. I have been a customer of this establishment since the mid nineties. I came back to this establishment recently, and the soup was as delicious as i remember. The best sulungtang ever! This place is always busy which is impressive considering the menu. One kind of soup and boiled meats, thats it. The soup........amazing. This is one of those places thats so good, service doesnt matter."
2/12/2009,5 star rating,"Better than the rest!  $8 well spent.  Actually, my bro spent it.  Great ""kim chi"" made from radishes and cabbage.  The soup itself is rich, seemingly creamy, ... but that's just from all dat darn good marrow.  I ate it twice in the past couple months.  Once on a sunny Sat morning after a night of drinking.  And on a partially rainy night this week.  BOMB on a cold night."
6/6/2013,5 star rating,I loved the food. Get the mixed soup - it has all of the crazy parts of the cow. What a great experience. Definitely going back.
9/27/2014,5 star rating,The best hangover remedy hands down. Their kakdoogi is the best in town as well. Although I still cant believe they charge $10.50 for a bowl of soup!
9/7/2009,4 star rating,"they pretty much serve only one thing, thus it's instantly readyi like the brisket.  the only thing keeping it from 5 star is that they skimped on the clear noodle.  dump in a lot of onion.  ask for the chili paste dadaeghi? (not sure how to spell it)  now you're ready.i like adding rice to mine.perfect if you're feeling sick.don't miss the back alley parking lot.btw the kimchi was really good -- very strong, more intense than most"
5/15/2008,5 star rating,One of my two favorite places to go for korean beef soup. The other one is Young Dong on Wilshire. Love the milky soup and its intense flavor.
8/11/2010,5 star rating,"This is somewhere I can find a perfect bowl of suhlungtang. Really hits the spot.$9 a bowl is a lot, but it's worth it with the amount of beef in the soup & kimchee. Yeees, definitely #1 place for suhlungtang!"
1/30/2011,5 star rating,"Dear Mr. or Mrs. Owner,I've been a loyal customer for years.  I've introduced almost everbody I know to Hanbat and they also introduce everyone they know to Hanbat as well.  When I drive home to the OC, I take my parents Hanbat..  When I go to SF for the holidays, I take Hanbat..Hanbat Hanbat Hanbat...So you see, because of me..  Well you know, you do the math =$$$$$As your loyal customer, I've come up with a idea..  How about a frequent buyer card.  You know, buy 5 get 1 free?  Ok, that's pushing it.. How about buy 9 get 10th free?  Take some time and think about it.  You need to hold yourself accountable though.  Thanks to your soup, I've become a spoiled brat.  It's hard for me to go anywhere else because it's all so disappointing..Just do it."
1/30/2011,4 star rating,"i felt like a complete foreigner.walked in & was greeted in korean. seated us and continued to speak to us in korean .. pointed out the menu on the table and saw that it consisted of 5 different types of meats to go with broth. we chose mixed .. but probably shouldve gone with brisket since we didnt touch the spleen and intestines? fresh kimchi and radish! broth comes out decently quick. messed around with adding the red paste, pepper, salt, and green onions. wasnt sure if i shouldve dumped the rice into the broth like the old couple next to us ... but it was still good. filling tooo.there's no ATM, nor cash only signs placed in the restaurant .. i had to walk two blocks down to 'i love boba' in search of an atm machine + i didnt know if there was a closer one.good new experience .. but i think i'll stick with tofu houses."
1/29/2011,5 star rating,"Best sullung tang in LA. Hands down. And thats saying a lot since I don't even like Korean food.Maybe its their accompanying side dishes.. red and so flavorful yet not so overpowering or even all that spicy... drip a little of the red sauce into the soup.. instant upgrad from 4 stars to 5!!! Best place to stop by during freezing days, immediately feel all warm and gooey. Call in and ask them to have a bowl ready for take out and its ready in 5 minutes or less. After a bowl of this stuff you just want to curl up in a bed and be lazy.. that may be a good thing for those that just need to relax after a hectic day.LOVE LOVE LOVE :)"
1/24/2011,3 star rating,"Soup = 4Overall = 3Parking = Very hard to find. Keep circling around to (hopefully) eventually find street parking.As the name says, Han Bat specializes in sul lung tang, which is Ox Bone soup. A simple clean tasting beef soup with your choice of meat and cow body parts (tripe, flank, etc.) It is not seasoned for you, it is your job to use the green onion and salt containers at your table to season to your liking. Typical of most (if not all) sul lung tang restaurants.On the universal sul lung tang scale, Han Bat has pretty decent tasting soup and slightly below average meat. The price is also ~$2 more expensive than what I'm used to. They provide service when you call them over, otherwise they leave you alone (which I like).Overall the soup deserves a 4. Buuuuuuut....I grew up associating sul lung tang with kimchi. You have to have them both together. For me, what really distinguishes a good sul lung tang place is if they make a good kkakdugi kimchi dish. It is a kimchi made from daikon radish instead of the typical nappa cabbage. Han Bat has pretty bad kkakdugi. It isn't crisp (think like biting into an apple) and is sorely missing that crunch factor that really defines kkakdugi for me. It was sad, limp, and tasted old.I'd be willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of taste and rather go to Jang Mo Jib in Rowland Heights, which has cheaper prices, is MUCH closer, and has perfect kkakdugi."
1/23/2011,5 star rating,"The BEST Brisket! Its thinly sliced beef with clear noodles and a warm flavorful broth. Sooo delicious when you're feeling sick. Its like little old Korean ladies waved their magic wand over the pot of soup and BAM! You are healed!!! I also like the side dishes, which consist of the usual; kimchi, rice, green onions, salt and hot sauce.  It's not crowded whenever I eat there.  I have ordered pick-up a few times and everything is packaged so neatly.  They are so friendly when you pick up, that it makes me wanna tip just because they gave you that smile =)."

1/17/2011,5 star rating,"I'm not well versed in sul lung tang but I am a connoisseur of kimchi and at first smell I was sold. This entire operation is so smoothly run and the food is delicious. To be honest at first spoonful I was unimpressed with the broth then, after following the directions of many a yelper I dumped everything under the sun in for taste. At that point, wow - everything came together so well and it made for a very memorable meal that was a ton of food and wow, the kimchi was so good."
1/9/2011,5 star rating,"If you want to know where the best place to eat sul-lung tang  in Koreatown is...... it's this place. Don't be disappointed when you first walk in because it's small, cramped, dirty, etc....because the food is so bomb that it makes up for the lack of nice ambiance. I usually get the sul-lung tang with only steak (without all the other cow body parts) and dump like 5 spoonfuls of sliced onions, and some salt and pepper. Eating it with their kimchi and kkak-doo-gi (radish in the kimchi sauce) makes the soup THAT MUCH greater than other sul-lung tang place sin koreatown. The food generally comes out super fast and parking is usually very easy to find!"
1/9/2011,5 star rating,"SHIZZZ My first night as a Los Angeles local and I come to this great place? Granted, the area doesn't look safe or anyway appealing but one sip of this great soup and I am hooked. Permanently. I never even like Sul Lung Tang. Quick tip! Before green onions, salt and pepper, the soup WILL taste bland. You have to add these ingredients in! Other than that, the soup is clean tasting, the brisket is soft and the portion is large. But I'm a small girl, so I packed half of it home. And it's going to be my breakfast despite the temptations to heat it up right now and watch House. My favourite way to eat this is eat the kimchi (which is amazing by the way) and let the sauce drip over the rice. Then dump the rice into the bowl, or spoon along with soup, and you have the most amazing tasting broth. I feel like my own little chef. The sauce from the radish kimchi does wonders. Service is alright depending who serves you. The older lady is really nice; one of the younger ones are a bit more rushed and don't listen carefully. But it's cheap. It's good. It might be my local spot for the term."
1/8/2011,5 star rating,"My friends and I arrived at the restaurant no later than 6:45 AM.. and the place was already open with a handful of customers inside! Definitely opens a little earlier than 7AM. The menu is straight forward.. 5 options with the beef soup and 3 options with the boiled beef. Prices are given, including tax, on the menu itself. We were promptly greeted by an elderly Korean man, who took our orders and gave us a tub of green onions. On the table itself, there is salt, pepper and a red chili paste. Later, the man returns with a couple of side dishes.. one cabbage and one radish kimchi. Both were delicious! Tasted slightly different from all of the other types of kimchi I've tasted. My friends agreed. Our orders came out quickly. Definitely must add salt, green onions and the red chili paste to taste. Plenty of meat with some noodles on the bottom. SO GOOD, especially in the morning when it's freezing cold. Order also comes with a bowl of rice. Great combo!Plenty of street parking in front of the restaurant, but maybe that's because we came so early in the morning. On our way out, we noticed a couple of late night party go-ers walking in. FYI, Sul Lung Tang is also known as the hangover cure. WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AGAIN!!!"
12/29/2010,3 star rating,"It wasn't as amazing as all the reviews said it would be. But maybe I was just too hyped up? It was good, but not thatt good. It was kinda bland, not as deeply flavorful as I expected. The price was kinda expensive, like $9 a bowl of sul lung tang so i don't think it's that good that it's worth $9. I'm sure they put alot of work into boiling all those beef bones though. I would still come back though just cuz I loveee Korean food, Koreans, and everything Korean in general. And also cuz you probably can't get this just anywhere. I actually kinda feel bad for writing this mediocre review about them because i lsuually ove korean food lol."
12/28/2010,5 star rating,"Love their Sul Lung Tang (cow bone soup)!  One item menu, one price ($9.00 incl T&T), comes with rice.  You get to choose what kind of meat you want.  I usually get the Brisket or the Combination.  Add your own flavoring with salt, green onions, kimchi and their red paste.   I like to add my rice to the soup & just eat from the soup bowl... Delicious... a very rich taste from the soup itself...^^ Luv it when the broth turns red from the kimchi... ^^A hole in the wall but always packed, though I always manage to get the last table when I enter...hahaha... there's always seating available I think, since people don't come here to chat, they just finish their food and leave... but you don't get that felling of being rushed out, people are very relaxed here... Eating here is very comforting in a way... ^^Parking is valet behind the restaurant, i think it's $2 or $3."

11/29/2010,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place out, so I came with my cousin for lunch on Wednesday. Definitely has that hole in the wall feel, but there was a valet behind the restaurant so you don't have to scramble for street parking as much. Anyways, this was actually the first time I had sul lung tang even though I've had gomtang, which is very similar. I ordered the brisket sul lung tang, which was pretty good. The meat pieces were fairly large and numerous and I liked that there were glass noodles in it too. I didn't have to add much salt to adjust the broth. The kimchi and kkakdugi were also pretty good too. So overall it was pretty good, but I do prefer Hyun Poong Gomtang. The banchan and quality of taste were better and Hyun Poong. I'm interested though to try the other types of meat for the sul lung tang here."

6/25/2012,5 star rating,"People from the motherland aka Korea want to come and try this place when they visit LA. This hole in the wall is a hidden gem in Ktown. They only serve one thing: ox tail soup, but it's the best ox tail soup you will ever have (you can pick the cut of meat you want in your soup). The soup tastes like what you grew up with and always makes me feel better if I have a cold. The kimchi is SO good (they have to do a refill for us every 5 minutes). If you are still hungry they provide you extra noodles and broth. Service is an A+."

Great place to go to for nursing one's liver after a night of drinking."
12/1/2009,2 star rating,"After reading the rave reviews for this place i wanted to be able to appreciate Sul Lung Tang but didn't.  Thought it was bland with too little noodle, meat, flavor, and substance overall.   A heaping full of scallions and kimchi add flavor but this is not a dish I'd make a trip for again.  Perhaps I am biased because I grew-up with pho but Sul Lung Tang doesn't compare."
11/14/2010,5 star rating,"At first I was not sure if I'd like it since I'm not a fan of beef soup. To my surprise,  it was really delicious -- great to have on a cold day.  Try the soup with brisket, you'll like it. I'll be coming back when the weather gets cooler."
10/14/2011,4 star rating,"The best sul lung tang EVER! I love their kkakdoogi and their fast service. The food literally comes out within minutes of you ordering as all they serve is sul lung tang.

11/25/2011,4 star rating,"Perfect for a cold night with a cold. Soup comes piping hot in less than 2 minutes from when you order it. Salt and season to taste. I dump CUPS of scallions in mine. The flavor is perfect, all swirling around in that cloud of soup extracted from ox bone. The place is simple, if not a tad grimy but I'd definitely return if I was in the mood for sulungtang!"
4/17/2008,5 star rating,In reality this place makes one dish and one dish only. The fact that they have been able to stay open for so long is a testament to how good that one dish is. There is no comparison. I have been a lover of sullungtang since I was a kid and this place is by FAR the best in koreatown. (likely anywhere in the US for that matter) They are a one trick pony but what a trick it is. That and the fact that the Kimchee and radish Kimchee are so perfect in pairing with the sullungtang makes this place a gem. Don't let the hole in the wall atmosphere scare you. Don't mind that the green onions are in a big bin on the table. There's no place on this continent where you can get sullungtang like this. Eat sullungtang here before you eat anywhere else and it will haunt you and mock u everytime u try it elsewhere.
3/6/2011,3 star rating,"3.5 stars The soup is definitely a lot thicker and gamier (i tend to like my soup base clearer) than others...and comes with a lot more meat than I prefer.  But it was nonetheless extremely worthwhile after a long night. Kimchi is delicious, especially when soaked in the soup. Don't expect to much from service (it's the usual korean service: take the order, bring you the food, goodbye).Parking is a little difficult since it's street parking."

8/8/2007,5 star rating,"Seeing as how this is my first review on Yelp, I thought I should start with the best store/restaurant/bar/anything I could think of...hello, Han Bat. While most of my friends and colleagues rant and rave about the wonders of pho and its miraculous healing powers for hangovers, suhl lung ttang makes pho seem pho-king nasty in comparison. Han Bat is nothing less than a hole-in-the-wall gift from heaven, hungover or hungry. It's a solid meal with no frills for a decent price. Be sure to grab the bucket of green onions before it runs out. If you don't speak Korean, relax. Just point to the item on the little menu, smile, and don't ask what's in the soup. The only downside to this place, if any, is that parking can be a problem if you're not used to Korean parking lots i.e. land of the 18-point turn. Solution: just park at the market across the street and get some exercise."

5/29/2012,5 star rating,"A hole in the wall place wins again. The menu is on the wall in a picture frame with 2 types of noodle and 4 options of meat. This place knows what its doing with their ingredients, the broth is delicious, and the sides are complementary and refreshing. For Sul Lung Tang this place is as good as it gets. A blessing in the morning when every other restaurant is closed, and you're jet-lagged, hung-over, drunk or sober."
10/7/2010,5 star rating,"There is something to be said about places that only serve one type of food.  They had better be really good since their entire reputation is based on that one item.  Usually people who go into such a business know they have the magic formula.  Hot Dog on a Stick used to be like this until they started to diversify with french fries and other flavored lemonades.  Han Bat has this magic when it comes to sullungtang.  It is just as good if not better than some of the best sullungtang places I have been in, even in Seoul.  The milky broth is a trademark of cooking beef and marrow hours on end, with constant skimming of impurities.  You have the option of adding brisket, flank, tongue, or mixed.  They also have a gutsy option that comes with intestine, tripe, and spleen (I know it sounds atrocious, but considered highly nutritive).  To many Koreans, sullungtang is the breakfast of champions - screw Wheaties.  I had the brisket and it was so tender, just enough firmness to keep the meat together.  The accompanying cabbage and radish kimchee were perfectly ripened providing the spicy and tangy contrast that can be such a wonderful gastronomic experience.  You can also pile on the chopped green onions and add the chili paste to make a spicier version. They also brought out the food in under 5 min - very impressive.  No doubt they are used to the defining impatience of many Koreans.  The only time when I was in Korea that I saw Korean people wait in line for food was for Sizzlers - over 1 hour.  Go figure.Best Thing - sullung tang"
9/29/2010,3 star rating,"Oh how I would love to give this place 4 or 5 stars!  I really would but I just can't.  I like to think I'm not an uncultured American who doesn't know how to appreciate foreign food, and I really don't think I am, but this I just wasn't crazy about.  The kimchi and ggakdoogi were fabulous, and the soup was wonderfully refreshing on the sore throat I'd been nursing, the service was some of the fastest I'd ever seen, but I just couldn't really like the soup all that much.  I was also a little turned off by the ""B"" rating but I didn't notice anything glaringly unhygienic so I wouldn't put much stock in it.  A small word of probably irrelevant warning: I have an ultra-sensitive digestive system and feeling sick after meals is a daily occurrence for me, and it may have had NOTHING to do with the food AT ALL, but boy did I feel especially lousy after this meal.  Again, it really might just be that something in there didn't agree with me that had nothing to do with the safety or quality of the food (my boyfriend felt fine), but if you have a sensitive stomach, you MAY want to be careful here.  But don't let my experience deter you from trying it, it's worth going once to see how you like it.  The food was high quality, I just didn't like it that much.The final word: Worth trying once, I'm glad I did.  Just because I didn't love it doesn't mean you won't!"
9/19/2010,5 star rating,"I've been a loyal customer for over 10+ years. Hands down, the best sullungtang place I've ever been to (and I've been to ALOT)!!! It's so rich with flavor. I usually get the one with just brisket. The kimchi and ggakdoogi is amazing with the sullungtang. This restaurant is a hole in the wall. if you are looking for fancy shmancy, this is not the place to go.....but the food is to die for! The soup comes out REALLY fast and that's always a plus! Parking is not so great. They have a lot in the back but its tiny and you usually have to valet. If you are lucky, you can find street parking close by!"
9/18/2010,5 star rating,"Hands down the best sul lung tang place in LA, probably anywhere outside of Korea! I am very picky about my sullungtang, and other places just don't do it the way Han Bat does!I love that there are only like 3 choices on the menu. I love their kimichi and kakdugi. It's a little pricier than some other cheap places (by like 2 or 3 bucks) but TOTALLY worth it for the overdose of FLAVOR in the broth!!Places like Keungama are fine if you want the basic soup, but if you're craving that thick, wonderful, meaty flavor of true sullungtang, this is the place to go. This restaurant has been there for decades, and there's a reason for it. Customers always come back for the irreplaceable flavor."
9/17/2010,4 star rating,"I walked into this place and, since I was the only non-Korean in there, the server asked me if I was in the right spot. I said, ""Beef noodle soup, right?"" And she said, ""Yes!""There are only two choices on the menu: soup or a platter. She brought me out a steaming bowl of soup, a big container of green onions, and kimchi.I did it up like Kevin L recommended and the soup was great! The broth was tasty, the beef was tender, and the kimchi was fantastic.The soup was $9 and Han Bat Sul Lung Tang is a great alternative to Daikokuya if you don't feel like going downtown or want something other than pork belly. I'll be back..."
9/7/2010,5 star rating,"Fairly decent price I guess considering the awesome soup that they brew probably daily and the wide selection of meats. With tax and tip adds up to about $12 not to mention the 30 minute drive, but well worth it. The place is easy to pass by as it is an unassuming mom and pop shop amidst a plethora of appealing Korean restaurants with cute logos and signs. The inside decor is very humble and there's usually a local grandpa or two slurping down hot broth while watching Korean TV. The condiments are simple but tasty. The 'kkakdoogi' (hot, diced radish) kicks every tongues' ass Lol. The kimchi is good too but usually, I end up asking for several refills on the 'kkakdoogi'. Condiments are simply salt n pepper as well as diced green onions and a hot paste called 'dadaegi'. What keeps me coming down to K-town on weekends is the soup. Oh lord. I think they brew it everyday.Overall, the place has amazing seulungtang and won't leave you disappointed."
8/24/2010,5 star rating,"This is a hole in the wall, and yes, they have the best beef bone soup in town.You add in green onions ( I add copious amounts), sea salt, and if you desire, some hot paste too. I don't know the English name, and I don't know how to spell it phonetically. Minus one star to myself!You can't go wrong here. Just remember, Korean service is based on, ""excuse me! I need something."" They won't dote on you, if you just sit there. Call them over, and don't be shy. I always park at the Carl's Jr. Just run away, and make sure no staff sees you."
8/23/2010,2 star rating,"I have definitely had way better sul lung tang in my life. Due to the yelp reviews, I was pretty looking forward to this place but....BOOOO BOOOO!!  It was not all that great like YOU yelpers said!! They were very, very CHEAP with the meat and like 3 strands of the clear noodle!! The kimchee was good but the kak doo gi was whatevers. If you want really good sul lung tang, you have to go to Norwalk/Atesia. On 166th and Pioneer, there is a awesome sul lung tang jip  in the plaza of the Oak dol Sauna!! Their sul lung tang is 2..TWO for $9.99 and their bowls are filled with meat and clear noodles!!! NOW their KIMCHEE n KAK DOO GI  is the BEST!!! I can't remember the name right now, ugh. But anyways,  this Bat Sul Lung Tang's sul lung tang was not worth my 9 bucks....so sad."
8/14/2010,5 star rating,"Best sullungtang to date. I love these little places that only make one place, because that means all their work goes into making that one dish extra special. There's a few choices of different meats that you can get, but if you're kind of picky/squirmish about meat like I am, you can never go wrong with brisket. You season to taste with salt, pepper, green onions, and whatever you want to make it to your preference of spicy. It's filling, comforting, but not greasy at all.Many people dump all their rice into the soup, but I prefer to keep rice and soup separate so that I can drink ALL the soup and not feel too full from all the rice. The broth is soooo deliciously wonderful."
8/11/2010,2 star rating,"i used to be a fan of han-bat too but the last time i went there, i found grainy stuff in the bottle of my bowl. i didn't know what it was and was talking to myself, is this bone shaving?!??!the waitress overheard me and told me NO NO!! not bone shaving, it's cornmeal.WTF. CORNMEAL? yeah... apparently, they use it to give the soup a heartier, deeper flavor.as a person who actually cooks sullungtang on a regular basis at home, i know that adding cornmeal or milk to the broth means one thing...   they're taking a shortcut and cutting costs by not letting the beef flavor develope on its own.i'm disappointed at this place. they're cheating."
1/4/2012,5 star rating,"I adore sul lung tang. This place serves each bowl of broth fresh, steaming hot, and freaking delicious. You get to flavor your soup to your liking with some good sea salt (about a spoonful is enough for me) and a huge container of green onions. I love, love, love, lots of green onions in my soup and a few dashes of black pepper. I usually get the brisket soup, and I dump my bowl of rice in there and just dig in. I make sure to get a perfect bite of broth, beef, onions, and rice all topped with kimchi. The ladies working the restaurant are always on the move, but the food comes out fast and piping hot. This place is small, crowded, and always packed with hungry customers, but I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated. It's also really cheap (about $8 a bowl). Love, love, love!"
1/4/2012,5 star rating,"This restaurant is just a two minute walk from my place but for some reason I don't come here that often.  My last visit there though, reminds me that I should probably frequent this place much more often.  A friend of mine refers to Sul Lung Tang as a ""Korean Pho"" which I find grossly inaccurate (and maybe offensive to some Koreans ;)).  It's hard for me to explain what Sul Lung Tang is like so you'd just have to try it.  Perfect for cold days or the day after consuming too much soju."
2/20/2013,5 star rating,This place is legit! This was my first time trying sul lung tang and I LOVED IT!! I went with a Korean friend who taught me how to eat it properly: dump in scallions and season to taste. The kimchi and kaktugi was AMAZING!!! Not spicy and had the essence of the radish and cabbage. It was perfect with the soup. We left with FULL stomachs and a smile on our faces. Try not to go before a body massage...but it was SO WORTH IT! Eat here!
2/20/2009,4 star rating,"Wow. I've never been to a restaurant that had only a few things on the menu.  It's very cozy and homely here. Not many decorations, it's definitely on the plain side. It was very empty when I went, and only one waitress was working. There was only 1 other table besides my friend & I, so she was very fast with taking our order and bringing it out.It's beef broth with rice & kimchi, and that's about it. You can get different kinds of meat, like tendon & stuff.. There's some noodle-y thing in the broth as well. I found I liked the taste best with the kimchi, so a little rice, a little kimchi, and a little broth all on one spoon. Not sure if that's the proper way to eat it but whatever tastes good is what works for me (:I drove out to LA actually craving Korean BBQ (I know, how did I end up here haha) but left pretty satisfied, because the beef broth was that good. But then again I've never had beef broth Korean style so I guess I really have no basis for comparison.. Regardless, for a place that only has a handful of items on their menu, it's pretty damn good (:"
2/16/2011,3 star rating,"This soup pretty much cured my cold. Well, not really, but pretty much. Tried the ""mixed beef soup"" with brisket, flank, tripe, intestine, tongue, and spleen. Everything tasted great, just because they are the nasty bits doesn't mean they taste, well, nasty. The intestine was surprisingly my favorite. Sort of reminded me of fatty tendon. Yum. Ok I'll stop because I'm sure some people reading this review would prefer not to hear the details of the ingredients."
3/15/2011,5 star rating,"Hands down the best sul lung tang place in LA! The broth is perfect and white, the meat is tender, just add some salt and fresh green onions and it's the most soothing, Korean comfort food ever! Kimchi and kkakdugi (spicy picked radish) are very good with the sul lung tang!"
3/14/2012,1 star rating,"I decided to try this place cuz of all the hype on yelp. Was really nothing to write home about. I ordered the brisket soup for $9. Was such a small bowl of soup for the price. They were so stingy on the meat & noodles .. & I know the soup is supposed to be pretty bland so I added the green onion, salt & kimchi , but it still didn't do it justice.  I think you get more for your money w/ japanese ramen & Vietnamese pho .. I know this Korean soup is maybe for a different palate , but I just don't see the appeal. Sorry folks :("
6/18/2012,4 star rating,This is a hole in the wall joint in Koreatown in LA. The menu was simple. Either get a $9 soup or a $16 one. I chose the $9 soup with Brisket and Flank. The waitress served us with Kimchi that was hella good but the water she served us tasted like tap water. The soup was on the table ready for me to eat in like 5 mins. It was tasty and warmed my belly. Coulda had more noodles in it though.
8/23/2007,5 star rating,"my ultimate comfort food for rainy days.their soup is amazing! unlike the clear broth that you might have tasted before, han bat's broth is whitish colored soup that has full of rich flavor.  they have several choices of sullungtang but usually i just get the brisket sullungtang.  just put in lots of scallions and da de gi (the chilli paste).  love their ggak doo gi and kimchi always ask for seconds.  parking sucks =( but their sullungtang is worth it!"
5/27/2009,3 star rating,"I used to love this place.  It's one of those hole in the wall restaurant that been around for years with great food - specializing in one type of beef soup Sul Lung Tahng.  But I stopped going because they used way too much MSG on my last visit.  It gave me the dry mouth and super thirsty effect of MSG.  Yuck.  A little MSG for flavoring is acceptable (what Asian restaurant doesn't use it) but if I can TASTE it in the soup, that's a deal breaker for me.  Maybe it was just that one day they accidentally dumped extra MSG..."
5/10/2010,5 star rating,"If you want Sul Lung Tang, that's the place to go in Los Angeles. And that's all they serve."
5/9/2010,5 star rating,"Han Bat serves up a perfect bowl of soup. One of the best things you can get under $10 in this town. Intensely beefy, fragrant, soothing, and rich. My favorite way to get it is with the flank and brisket, so you get some nice fatty pieces plus long, tender pieces of brisket - I've found ordering this way will give you the most amount of beef, as opposed to the mixed meats bowl. And their kimchi...  so good! Their radish kimchi is crispy delicious, and their regular cabbage kimchi tastes incredibly fresh. Don't forget to add salt + pepper and ENJOY this beef broth facial."
4/30/2010,4 star rating,"Anyone who watches popular Korean Dramas has probably seen ""Shinning Inheritance."" As some of you may know one of the main characters is the heir to a Sul Lung Tang enterprise. I finally finished the drama over a 4 week span. Oh man! You would not believe how badly I was craving Sul Lung Tang. Every week watching miscellaneous customers stuff their face with this hot meaty stew was absolute torture! With that said my expectations for Sul Lung Tang was pretty high.Thank-goodness for Han Bat Sul Lung Tang. Sometimes, across the street I go to the California Market for groceries. I was surprised I had been by so many times and not come in to HanBat. Now the decor is not all that great. However, the food and its quality are always my number one. They litterally have one item on the menu... Sul Lung Tang. It was so delicious! Their brisket is really really tender and their broth is hot and a bit sweet. Of course you make your stew according to your own personal preference by adding green onions,  radish and salt or not. Simplicity is what you find here but this recipe is done right! If you had seen me in the restaurant that day you probably would have thought I was in a eating competition. I probably looked like a pig because I finished my entire bowl in five minuets or less. I couldn't help myself it was just that good! If your craving Sul Lung Tang, I promise no empty bellies of disappointment."
4/28/2010,1 star rating,"Don't come hear unless you know exactly what sul lung tang is: beef broth with your choice of assorted entrails or brisket with a side of rice. The kind of dish you had to have grown up with to truly enjoy or appreciate. DON'T BE FOOLED, it's NOTHING like ramen or pho as it lacks the same kind of complexity to it. For $9, you'll get the kind of soup that comes before an entree at an Asian restaurant.  It might the best bowl of sul lang tang this side of the world, but sul lang tang is definitely not my cup of tea. Don't make the same mistake as I did or you'll be craving for a real meal afterwards..."
4/21/2010,4 star rating,"Best sulluntang in ktown hand down. Rick, thick, milky broth with lots of meat and lots of flavor. You add a little bit of salk, a little bit of green onion, a little bid of a red sauce, and a LOT of kimchi gook mool and you have yourself a hot meal in heaven. I like to just dump all my rice in their and chomp away. Their have really good ggak doo gee (radish kimchi). So GOOD. Downside is that they're cash only and they close at 10... Boo. But otherwise, GOOD EATIN"
4/19/2010,2 star rating,"I'm SO confused why this place is so highly rated.  I guess I just don't know Korean food enough.  I found this place on Yelp.  I wanted Pho...which this restaurant was listed under.  Not really pho, like I've had before.  I think it's Vietnamese pho I've had which, has way more flavor.  So, there's no menu or real options.  Just what kind of meat you want in the soup.  The kimchee was good.  There was only water to drink as well.  Blah!"
4/14/2010,5 star rating,"There are certain LA hangover meals so good that I would induce a hangover just to enjoy. The sul lung tang here is one of them. Put it right up there with the birria from el parian as one of the best hangover dishes in LA. The broth is perfect, the beef succulent, and I'll be damned if this isn't the one place in Koreatown where the waitresses promptly refill water. If you are looking particularly haggard, they might even give you your own pitcher. Just be warned! the combination of a long night of drinking, fatty broth, and copious amounts of water might induce a little bowel movement party time well before you are safe at home! (I know that was graphic, but I'm just trying to look out for my fellow yelpers. When this happens to you, you will come home, bring my review up on yelp, and click useful.)"

CASH ONLY."
4/13/2010,3 star rating,"I took my dad here for his birthday. Kind of disappointed considering this is in the top 10 restaurants of Koreatown. The restaurant itself was kind of shabby; the place is very small and there isn't very much room to move.When I first walked in, it was packed. There isn't any sort of waiting system. Subsequently, you are left to stand in a small space awkwardly while waiting for a seat.The food was okay; I was anticipating something spectacular. But I felt like I could get the same meal at Koreatown Plaza's food court. The broth was good. Oh, I almost forgot to mention: the kimchi and kaktoki are amazing. Some of the best kimchi/kaktoki i've had in a long time. I think it really made the meal."

2/20/2015,5 star rating,Sul Lung Tang (Ox tail soup)    Another place where the menu is limited but they are all good.  2 types of kimchi come with your meal so don't expect the normal Korean restaurant spread.  Remember to salt the soup to your own taste and add as much green onion as you like.

10/19/2011,2 star rating,"K, Ate here yesterday with my Korean friend after reading some of the 256 reviews that were posted.We arrive and find that it's a TINY little spot amid a residential area (right across the street from Carl's Jr). Just FYI there is parking, you just have to go directly behind the restaurant.So basically it's all soup. As soon as you walk in the Korean waitress hands you a plastic cup of water and she kinda waits for you to tell her which soup you want (I think there are only like 9 options, Beef or Boiled Beef parts..haha).She brings it out and my friend and I chat and enjoy the very flavorful meat. Not a lot of noodles, and I think the broth is supposed to be a bit bland so that you can take that huge plastic cup of salt and mix it to taste.Now I'm Korean but I don't speak; I intentionally brought my Korean friend because she speaks and together, we're some happy Korean girls, but no, the service was still sub-par. I suppose I didn't expect anything less from an ""authentic"" Korean place. At one point I smilingly waved at her and pointed at my empty glass of water, to which she nodded....and never returned. Later she walked around with a pitcher of water but only selectively poured refills to only certain tables.I was so thirsty by that point (I did salt my broth to taste!) that all the ice was gone and I was done being nice. I flagged her down with an ""Excuse me!"" I told her to bring us our check (because for the entire 1.25 hours we were there she never came back after giving us our soup) and to refill our waters PLEASE.Tax is already included in the price so we added a few more bucks and were done. I think I'd only go there again if I needed some good hardcore soup and then take off. But then again, it's Ktown and I've been to some pretty good soup places that weren't so...aloof.3 stars for the good food, 2 stars for the lack of service, and I'm sticking to 2 stars because in LA you can't be writing off customers!"

1/2/2015,4 star rating,"The cleanest tasting Ox Tail Bone Soup I have ever had. I came with some friends and was seated right away. It was the day after Christmas, but the place still fills up quickly. My order came fast and hot with not other salty additives, just pure, milky, hot soup. The menu was minimal, only two kinds, the Ox Tail Bone soup as the base and a list of meat choices you like to go with it (beef flank, brisket, intestines, spleen or tongue ans mixed). I had the brisket and a friend got the mixed meats, it was for $9+ a bowl. Suyuk or cut meats was the other option on the menu, with same meat choices as above, for $19+, pricey for a small serving. I ordered a plate of mixed meats and they tasted ok. They serve the dishes with only two side dishes, kimchi which tasted great and a pickled cubed radish in chili paste, i think it was. There's salt and pepper available if you to add more flavor to your soup. Otherwise, just enjoy it as it is and don't forget to add a heaping of green onions."

8/20/2007,4 star rating,"Anytime there's good sullungtang, I'm there especially after a night of drinking.  It's also my alternative to pho.  The menu's simple.  Choose your choice of beef in your sullung tang and put in however much salt and green onions with it along with rice.  The kimchee's and gak do gee is pretty good.  Parking isn't great, but hey, it's LA.  The tables were a bit dirty when I got there, and nobody bothered to clean it up.  Still, the food was good, and I guess sometimes, that's all that matters."
1/17/2010,3 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place but in the end I just realized how much better soup I've had in other places for much less. I don't feel like they give enough meat or noodles to justify the $10 price. I like how you can put unlimited amounts of green onions into your soup and how you basically have to season the soup to your liking, but still for $10 I was expecting much more. The soup itself had a good flavor to it and reminds me of comfort food.. something my mom would serve to me on a cold winter night."

2/5/2009,3 star rating,"As you can see 3 stars...It was average. I just ordered one soup for the two of us. I got the mix soup. I first tasted the soup to see how much salt I should add. There was already some flavor so I didn't have to add too much. The brisket was soft. The tripe was good. However, the spleen was not done correctly. It still had the smell, they probably didn't clean it very good. It was also mushy when I ate it. Unlike the dim sum dish with all the organs. The soup was alright. I'm just so glad we were able to get 1 order for the two of us."
3/19/2009,3 star rating,"This was my first time here and first time having sul lung tang.  But I was game to try something new at the suggestion of a friend.  She ordered for me and we both got the brisket soup which comes with rice on the side and noodles in the soup.  It's a great place to get some comfort soup.  It is served HOT and FAST.  Nothing wrong with that cuz that is what they specialize in.  It's what they do best.  So it's done and ready!  I can see why people would think it tastes bland but you add your own amount of green onions, sea salt and hot paste.  The broth is flavorful from being cooked over time, but not in an overwhelming kind of way.  It's simple and not overpowering.  Would be perfect for those chilly days."

3/20/2010,4 star rating,"In Koreatown, you first decide what you want to eat and then where you'll get it. The beauty of Korean restaurants is that the best ones specialize in one particular dish. If you want sul lung tang, you come here. I don't care what culture or cuisine you mention - none can offer up a soup with the kind of mouthfeel you get with sullung tang. There's no way to imitate stock like this - you know they've been slowly simmering beef bones all day long. Just season this with some S&P and add some chopped green onions, and you are good to go."

11/29/2010,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place out, so I came with my cousin for lunch on Wednesday. Definitely has that hole in the wall feel, but there was a valet behind the restaurant so you don't have to scramble for street parking as much. Anyways, this was actually the first time I had sul lung tang even though I've had gomtang, which is very similar. I ordered the brisket sul lung tang, which was pretty good. The meat pieces were fairly large and numerous and I liked that there were glass noodles in it too. I didn't have to add much salt to adjust the broth. The kimchi and kkakdugi were also pretty good too. So overall it was pretty good, but I do prefer Hyun Poong Gomtang. The banchan and quality of taste were better and Hyun Poong. I'm interested though to try the other types of meat for the sul lung tang here."
1/18/2012,4 star rating,"everything happened so quickly: walked in, was greeted, sat down, ordered my  sul lung tang (intestine, tripe, spleen), was brought my food, and devoured it.soup was cloudy and bland..add in some green onions that they bring you in a huge bucket, add in some radish, kimchi and rice=yums! kimchi was so good i asked for seconds.it was good, period."
2/24/2012,4 star rating,"One of the most tasty Sul Lung Tang places I've frequented. I've only ordered this place to go, but the broth is yummy and requires much less salting than other places I've been to. Of course, just as important when eating Sul Lung Tang is the radish kimchi, which was good as well. This is definitely one of those things you crave on a cold day, when you're sick, or when you want something refreshingly Korean."
3/5/2015,4 star rating,really cheap and sul lung tang is great
9/27/2009,3 star rating,Definitely not for everyone. Almost no taste... unless you put spoonful of MSG.
9/17/2009,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, the sul lung tang soup they serve is both tasty and good for health. Their menu is a dream for anyone bombarded with too many choices. They make one thing, and make it very well, which is more than what can be said about a million other restaurants. It's all sul lung tang, just served with different parts of beef. To make the soup perfect for one's own taste buds, adjusting of the amounts of salt and onion is necessary. And they have the best radish kimchee i have tasted in Los Angeles. The soup is definitely not for anyone hoping to get overwhelmed by a burst of favors. It is more a taste based on simplicity and comfort, with the spices from the kimchee adding a simple kick, speaking of which the soup is prone to put people in heavy food comas; the feeling of rejuvenation is almost instant while eating. Sul lung tang has always been my favorite food when I was growing up in Korea, and this is for me the best restaurant that replicates the memories, the contentment, and the nostalgia of the Korean restaurants."
9/15/2009,4 star rating,"if you like clear noodles in your sullungtang, this is the place to eat it.  i prefer somen noodles ()instead so i go to e-moon-oak."
9/14/2009,3 star rating,"I wanted to like this place, I really did. But quite honestly, sullungtang (or however you spell it) just kind of freaks me out, in the same way that menudo and bone marrow and pork intestines kind of freak me out. I am told that this is the ultimate Korean comfort food, but I just can't wrap my feeble little brain around it. I mean, from what I understand, sullungtang is essentially bone soup, simmered for hours, and garnished with scallions and glass noodles and white rice and consumed with liberal amounts of kimchi, fermented radish and hot chili paste. And yes, after you plop all of that stuff in there, it does become somewhat edible... even delicious. But the milky-white, cloudy appearance of the pre-garnished broth is just way too gnarly for me to ignore.I've heard that this is one of the better places in K-town to get sullungtang, and I'm definitely glad that I got the chance to try it. Would I try it again? Probably not, but that's only a matter of personal preference."
9/8/2009,1 star rating,"I have never been lead so far astray by Yelp.  It is rare to see such a high score for a restaurant, so A. and I felt confident going into this place that it was going to be at least somewhat good.  It was a hole in the wall and we were the only white people there, but these are usually signs that we have arrived at a truly authentic eatery.  As we walked in we  were greeted by a disgusting smell that resembled a restroom that was recently used by a colicky sailor who just had some bad Mexican.  Undeterred, we sat down  and asked for the menu.  The waitress drew our attention to the lonesome placard resting on the table.  The only choices on this ""menu"" were tongue, tripe or brisket varieties of this one beef soup.  The tables also had plastic tubs of chopped chives that, once opened, suggested that the vile stench may have been emanating from these.  When the soup arrived it was nothing but murky, tasteless broth with floating pieces of what I thought would be brisket, usually the juiciest of meat cuts, but it was super dry and didn't taste very fresh.  Oh, there was also one lonely glass noodle thrown in but it got lost in the bowl.  There was also a small serving of very plain white rice.  The only good thing was the kimchi that was also served, but it didn't save the day.  I filled up on the rice, took a few spoonfuls of the dreadful ""broth"" and called it a day.  Possibly the worst meal I've ever had anywhere.  A. ate both his and my meals and didn't have any stomach problems afterward, which I found surprising."
9/7/2009,4 star rating,"they pretty much serve only one thing, thus it's instantly readyi like the brisket.  the only thing keeping it from 5 star is that they skimped on the clear noodle.  dump in a lot of onion.  ask for the chili paste dadaeghi? (not sure how to spell it)  now you're ready.i like adding rice to mine.perfect if you're feeling sick.don't miss the back alley parking lot.btw the kimchi was really good -- very strong, more intense than most"
9/6/2009,1 star rating,"I'm not sure how this place got such great reviews. I've eaten at many Korean places and this place was by far the worst food, if not the worst dinner, I have ever eaten. The broth was completely watered down, the tea was just hot water, and the meat was fatty and dry. The kimchi and raddish were good but it's hard to mess that up."
9/5/2009,2 star rating,I guess its an acquired taste... I didn't think the soup was all that tasty and could even go as far as to say it was bland! There wasn't really anything to add to it to make it more flavorful except the green onions. They did have good kim chee and lots of it and the prices were acceptable. ($9 /person) But cash only!Maybe someone will explain to my why this restaurant with only ONE thing on the menu is so good!?
8/31/2009,5 star rating,this place is the best sul lung tang joint in the U.S.A !!!!!
8/17/2009,5 star rating,"Wow! I think this is how every restaurant should be! There are only 5 things on the menu 1) Mix ( beef combo from 2 thru 4) 2) Brisket 3) Flank4) Innards of beef 5) beef tongue. Why is that good? Because that is all Han Bat Sul Lung Tang makes . . . Sul Lung Tang. And because they only make Sul Lung Tang, they make it perfect. To top it off, they also have a big bucket of fresh diced green onions for you to add freely:DWait! Not only the soup is good... they have the best kimchi. Ever. I've never had better kimchi.... just the right amount of spiciness, just the right feel of crunch, just the right amount of saltiness and sourness. I think i finished my bowl of rice with just the kimchi:D LOVE IT!Not much decor at the place, but who cares? When you see that the crowd is 98% Korean, you know you've came the to the right place."
4/21/2010,4 star rating,"Best sulluntang in ktown hand down. Rick, thick, milky broth with lots of meat and lots of flavor. You add a little bit of salk, a little bit of green onion, a little bid of a red sauce, and a LOT of kimchi gook mool and you have yourself a hot meal in heaven. I like to just dump all my rice in their and chomp away. Their have really good ggak doo gee (radish kimchi). So GOOD. Downside is that they're cash only and they close at 10... Boo. But otherwise, GOOD EATIN"
7/17/2010,5 star rating,Been going here for 18 years. Simply put: THE best. Too bad they're no longer open 24 hrs a day
3/29/2011,5 star rating,Best sul lang tang in ktown. Altho I only find myself here after the roughest drinking nights. Cash only.
9/1/2011,4 star rating,"This is my go to place after I have a terrible hang over or when I am sick. The soup is sooooo good and make you feel just like home in your grandmom's kitchen, and I am not even Korean. One thing I do not like is that the waitress never never never smile and you always have to wait for long. So I have to set my alarm early on Saturday in order to get a table there."
9/22/2011,4 star rating,"Though Han Bat is the most favored place to get sullungtang in LA, I would just say that it's solid (I'd give it 3 1/2 stars).  The broth is nice and milky, but the meat is unforgettable.  The gakdoogi is rather good though.  The restaurant is really cramped and dingy and the service is spotty at best."
1/28/2012,4 star rating,This place is really good. The broth is super white (very traditional) and the meat/noodles are really good. I thought that the broth was a little fatty. The price is reasonable for sul lung tang. I personally do think that Young Dong is better but I think they're a little like apples and oranges.
2/20/2012,4 star rating,I won't dissect their menu or anything. They're simple: Beef broth/soup with noodles and meat. Can't really ask more for some good sul-lung-tang. I'll just tell you that it's good and fills you up quick. Food coma? Absolutely.
2/20/2012,5 star rating,"Liquid gold.  If I could put it in a sippy cup, I would.  And I would carry around the broth with me, everywhere I go."
3/16/2012,4 star rating,"Thank you, Yelp, for bringing me here!! This beef soup makes me warm and happy :-) their kimchee is good but wish they had banchan too..."
4/18/2012,3 star rating,Perfect meal to feed an ailing friend. Very reasonably priced and no fuss decor. Great Kim Chi though I wish it were a bit spicier. Hard to find parking though. Had to circle a few times. And traffic getting here is never easy.
8/2/2014,4 star rating,"The only reason why this place doesn't get five stars from me is because of the rice. The rice here for some reason is not cooked well -- it definitely tastes like it's a little bit undercooked on the inside. Anyway, though, the soup is awesome and so is the kimchee. Service is usually great."
5/16/2009,4 star rating,The beef soup is absolutely good here! I went with my four other co-workers and we tried three kinds of soup. I had flank beef soup; the meat has some fats too and the pieces are tender. I was already full but I still finished drinking all the soup. This is the place that is worth going back again and again.
2/21/2011,2 star rating,"I don't really get this place.  It gets great reviews but the food is only OK.  The soup is really bland when it comes. I have tried adding salt, green onions, and chili sauce but nothing makes this soup great.  For my money I'm going to stick with PHO.  Even a crappy PHO place is better than this."
4/1/2011,5 star rating,"Must say the brisket sul lung tang is better than most places. The soup is not oily, clean taste. Love it!"
4/25/2011,3 star rating,"Fresh kimchi... and very fast service.... however I've had better sul lung tang. There's one over in Buena Park that I've been too, and it just doesn't get any better than that. I was in the LA area though, and found this place via Yelp. Good, filling, but gets an average rating in my opinion."
4/26/2011,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang I've ever had!  The broth is so flavorful.  Be very careful if you don't like certain things in your sul lung tang.  The mix has beef, spleen, tripe and intestines.  I'm not a big spleen person. They can customize your order if you only want beef.  I get it with beef and tripe.  My entire family loves this place!"
11/29/2011,1 star rating,"What's all the hype? 4 1/2 stars for what? Personally I felt the beef soup was bland. Not much kim chee to share for 2. I feel cheated. Goes to show you that ratings, no matter how many, doesn't give the whole story. Service.... ehhh... I'm not Korean so I don't know if that was the issue. Never refilled my water and I had to go up to the counter for my bill."
2/20/2012,5 star rating,"Awesome, awesome broth. If you're craving beef broth/soup this is the place to go. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but a great find! Small menu but they specialize in their soup and it shows."
4/13/2012,5 star rating,"i'm just going to go ahead and say it. the seollungtang is better than my mom's. there. (somewhere in orange county an ahjummah's eye twitched)the kkakdugi is perfect. the service is okay, but it's a korean joint. get over it. they're there to fill your belly not stroke your ego. so shut up and eat."
9/4/2012,4 star rating,Love to come in here on a cold rainy day. The broth gives you the home-yi feeling. I usually order the beef tongue and brisket. Definitely a good cure for hangover as well :)
5/27/2014,2 star rating,"might be an acquired taste, but the broth was super bland. maybe good if you're sick.. was really light. i added so much kimchi and rice to help it out until my bowl was pure red broth. very few thin slices of meat too. lots of green onions. don't really understand the hype. left a bit unfulfilled and disappointedPs i'm use to japanese ramen, or chinese noodle soups...anything with more taste.maybe this place is good for old people who like less sodium less oil, etc."
7/2/2012,3 star rating,I would say this is an extremely niche type of restaurant - only 2 menu items with different types of meat. I transformed my soup into a kim chi jigae because I thought the soup was too plain. I guess comparing this to other sul lang tang restaurants it is good. I personally wouldn't come back cause I dont like this type of soup .
1/18/2013,5 star rating,"This is hands down the greatest Sul Lung Tang restaurant on planet Earth. I'm being honest. I've never tasted any other Sul Lung Tang that remotely compares to the one made here.The broth is delicious and the kimchi is good. Service is also very solid. It is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but look out for it! You will not be disappointed."
7/6/2010,3 star rating,"another yelp fueled ethnic dining adventure led me here...there is no menu, just two offerings. I love that you can customize the soup by adding scallions and sea salt to your heart's desire (and if you're anything like me, LOTS OF SALT will do).They also bring kimchee and some spicy daikon... mmmmmm!"
12/23/2010,4 star rating,"This place has the best sul lung tang in K-town. This is my place of choice if I want korean beef soup, but my only complaint is that the broth is a little too thick for me and if you do take out, you can see alot of the fat floating on top. But it taste great.  Kimchee is good too."
6/26/2011,5 star rating,"Best sul lung tang, period. I keep trying other places, but none of them have been as good as han bat. I'm even convinced they have the best kimchi. It's just perfectly fermented for sul lung tang. don't even bother ordering it from any other restaurant because i am constantly disappointed."
9/11/2011,5 star rating,Its really freakin good. nuff said.
10/13/2011,5 star rating,"Absolutely love this sulong ttang place. I always get the brisket with 2 bowls of rice. I love the kimchi and fermented radish. Every time I come to LA, I always crave this place. Hands down the best sulong ttang in the country! :)"
6/7/2012,5 star rating,"This is MIRACLE SOUP. The best part is the BROTH. I'm not one to drink all my soup when eating ramen, pho, etc., but I drink all of this wonderful soup! When I first tried shul lang tang (Han Bat was my first ever), I went on a quest to find the best in LA/OC & went to the 5 top rated places. Han Bat is THE BEST. I order mine with brisket & tripe only, 1 spoon of sea salt & 5 scoops of green onion. So satisfying, all the flavors of the meat, noodles, rice, soup, & kim chee all go together perfectly. I took a couple of months break because we made our own shul lang tang at home & it came out really well, but it's just easier to come here. The soup is always the perfect temperature..super hot, but never too hot. I love you, Han Bat!"
11/9/2010,5 star rating,"i've gone on a quest in LA & OC to find the best sul lung tang, & i don't need to tell you that han bat is the BEST!!!!! the broth is definitely the most magical & richly flavored."
9/26/2014,5 star rating,"When I'm craving some sullungtang at UCLA, this is my go to place. Great taste and awesome service. My friends and I always end up asking for multiple servings of the side dishes, and each time, the waitresses are friendly and quick. If you don't enjoy this type of Korean soup, this is not the place for you since their menu is very limited. But if you do enjoy a hearty soup, check it out. Hanbat is also great because there's private parking in the back."
4/21/2014,5 star rating,Best sul lung tang in ktown! That's all i have to say.
9/15/2012,5 star rating,"I've been here more times than I can count, and I'm amazed by how much I love it each time I eat it.I've had really watery sul lung tang and really thick sul lung tang where the broth was cloying and sticky with gelatin. Han bat gets it just right, and it's consistent every time! Comfort food at its best.It's a straightforward dive with a free (and kind of sketchy) parking lot in back. Run in, sit down, order your sul lung tang (I usually get mixed or brisket), have an awesome meal, pay $11 (including tip) and you're done. I've never had to wait for a seat even though it always seems busy. A fast and guaranteed satisfying meal every time. The gakdugee is great (not the best i've ever had, but still great). And their rice is also consistently perfect.Cash only! One of the reasons I make sure to have cash on me is in case I stop by Han Bat on the way home :) Their take out service is packaged up all nice and complete with salt and all the sides. Thanks Han Bat!"
3/3/2014,5 star rating,"total hole in the wall... my cousin brought me here, and i didn't expect much... but it was so yummy!  they specialize in sul lung tang... and i ordered the one with brisket, and i was very very very pleased... i'm definitely going back!"
9/5/2014,5 star rating,"Best Sul Lung Tang in K-town hands down.  The brisket will not disappoint.  The kimchi is OKAY, but the soup more than makes up for it.  Service is quick, food is good, price is cheap.  Cash only though, so watch out."
10/26/2014,1 star rating,"I was disappointed with the selection of food menus. There's no menu and the few choices of items are on the wall. I had the soup, which is what everyone else was having. It was so bland and had a few pieces if brisket. Also, it was overpriced. We were not asked if we wanted any water. The waitress never checked up on us to see how we were doing. She dropped the check off and didn't thank us. So, I didn't leave any tip. As we were walking out, the skinny waitress chased us and said that the price doesn't include any tip. So, I just gave her $1.00 for a $21 bill. She didn't even thank me. I will never eat here again.Horrible service!!!!!!"
8/23/2014,4 star rating,"I didn't drive out of the way to get to the restaurant, but it was a convenient place to have a meal.  The beef soup and kimchee was good.  Its a small place with a limited selection of entrees.  Korean food is known for all the side dishes.  This restaurant doesn't offer alot of banchan.  There is a Korean restaurant that specializes in soups in Hacienda Heights/Rowland Heights/City of Industry I prefer over this."
12/30/2013,4 star rating,"Soup on a chilly day! I wasn't feeling all that great after Christmas so when my mom said we were going to dinner and it would be soup I said yes! This place could easily be missed if you are driving by. We couldn't find street parking but took the chance and went to the back. Ha! Plenty of parking back there. They have a guard back there too so you feel safer leaving your car. We had 8 people for dinner and we were seated right away. Good thing my brothers girlfriend was there she helped us order. The menu is very basic and they only have about 6 soups. All the same soup bases but different meats. I went for the simple one, brisket. The soup comes with rice kimchi and radish and plenty of green onions. I added a little bit of salt to my soup and it was so flavorful. I added about 3 big scoops of green onions and black pepper. The soup was really good   You can tell it was cooked for hours. The kimchi was yummy! Since I was under the weather I didn't finish my soup so I took it home and had it for lunch the next day and it was just as delicious.  I think the next time I will eat one there and order one to go."
12/6/2014,4 star rating,"Quick and simple; menu is basically sul lung tang with a bowl of rice and kimchis. Add your salt, pepper and green onion and eat. Simple, extremely quick, and a good reminder of any korean moms cooking. $10"

2/5/2009,3 star rating,"As you can see 3 stars...It was average. I just ordered one soup for the two of us. I got the mix soup. I first tasted the soup to see how much salt I should add. There was already some flavor so I didn't have to add too much. The brisket was soft. The tripe was good. However, the spleen was not done correctly. It still had the smell, they probably didn't clean it very good. It was also mushy when I ate it. Unlike the dim sum dish with all the organs. The soup was alright. I'm just so glad we were able to get 1 order for the two of us."
2/3/2009,5 star rating,"I once read a study that suggested that there was no cure to the common hangover except rest/sleep. That no amount of coffee, cold showers or herbal remedies would do anything to help your miserable soul. I believed this to be partially true, I usually slept off a hangover with a post morning-throwup-and-dump nap, and was good to go. A few weeks ago, I awoke to a pain of epic proportions. I did my ritual morning throwup and post drinking dump, then knew that I was only a 2 hour nap from full recovery. At the end of said two hours, much to my chagrin, I was not cured. Nay, I was worse. A desperate time, I pleaded with God, asking him for the sweet release of death. It was not to be. I was stuck, hungover, with no cure. It was then that I decided to regroup. This wasnt the first time that a morning nap failed to cure me. And certainly wont be the last (I vowed never to drink again that morning. I broke this vow that very evening). As a veteran of the process, I knew I needed something soupy to tide me over, perhaps until my next nap. Enter Han Bat Sul Lung Tang.As I began eating this soupy goodness, a strange sensation came over me. I was healing with each bite. With each spoonful of rice and soup, I could feel my liver churning away. My heart began pumping blood with purpose and conviction. No, I would not be denied. By the end of the meal, I was a new man. One moment, I was asking God for death, the next, I was walking with a spring in my step and praising God for such a beautiful day. Screw any studies done, I defy anyone to eat this and not cure even the worst of hangovers.Do yourself a favor next time you find yourself in this situation. Go to HanBat, order a sullungtang, and heal yourself silly."

1/22/2009,5 star rating,"when you keep coming back without hesitation week after week...a little backstory and to better explain:sul lung tang is a tie with PHO as the best hangover food in this universe. you see, asian people love brothage. absolutely love it. we eat it in the morning, at lunch, dinner, and yes again after we go drinking in the wee hours.greasy pizza or fried foods don't cut it for hangovers for me as does a nice hearty, warm bowl of meat based soup w/ its fixins. i've been wavering for some time about pinning the best sul lung tang joint in ktown because i am too much of a critic of their Kkakdoogee (red pepper picked radish - my barometer of a good korean restaurant. kkakdoogee is also my favorite korean side dish, hence my screename) now let's put the kakdoogee aside(i'll save this for later) and talk cheddar. han bat has the cleanest and most tastiest broth out of the rest. the color is slightly milky which means it has been cooking for some time. you add the salt, some hot gochujang (korean hot paste), and sprinkle the chopped green onions and it's GAME OVER. their kkakdoogee is very very solid too. i like to dip the brisket in the soup in soy sauce w/ wasabi (this is available upon request)when the food is THIS good the decor does not matter shit. you come here for strictly business. and you leave knowing you had the best sul lung tang in ktown."
1/16/2009,5 star rating,this place is a tradition with my friends since i was in high school.When the weather gets under 65 I always make sure to go here for some hot sullung tang & their gak-du-ki is the best ever!!!gak-du-ki is what makes the sullung tang and no one else can compete.Also love their pot of sliced scallions.
12/31/2008,5 star rating,"As a world famous Chinese herbal medicinalist*, I am often asked to prescribe many different herbs and exotic ingredients to address a dizzying array of ailments.  As I'm going to retire, I've decided to let everyone in on an ancient Chinese secret:The shul lung tang at Han Bat Shul Lung Tang is a cure for all that ails you. It's my happy place and personal remedy whether I have a cold, flu, fever, stomach ache, headache, or itch in my pants.  Made with real lungs (although they call it brisket or flank),  the broth is flavorful and best when slightly salted--just slightly.           Tip: Go alone so you can eat all the kimchee by yourself.Now leave me alone as I crawl into a bowl of the shul lung tang and take a bath.*Please consult with your regular physician before you try these remedies.  Not responsible for bloating, food-inducing coma or encountering delicious eats during prescribed treatment."
12/22/2008,3 star rating,"OK, so apparently this is what happens when Ruby Table isn't open.  I end up at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Han Bat Sul Lung Tang.  I had a lot of fun saying the name of this restaurant, but didn't really have that much fun trying to figure out what was in my broth.  My friends and I drove around K-Town desperate for a restaurant that did not serve soon tofu or Krn BBQ, was inexpensive, and had free parking.  This was hard considering we didn't have a good idea of where things are actually located in K-Town.  So I had to call up a friend for some help.  He suggested HBSLT and we went.  Walked right in and sat down at a table big enough for 4.  We didn't realize that the menu was the little placard right in front of us and stared at the waitress expecting menus.  We are dummies sometimes.  Anyways, three of us ordered the mixed soup and one ordered just the brisket.  The rice and side dishes came out first, quickly followed by the soups.  Fast service, I like that.  Looking at the piping hot stone pot , I was expecting a strong, rich, flavorful soup.  Instead, all I got was something very bland.  My friends and I ended up adding a lot of sea salt and green onions to add flavor to our soups.  And I mean A LOT.  Scoop after scoop after scoop of green onions and sea salt.One good thing about Han Bat is that their prices are pretty cheap.  Our soups all cost less than $9 each so we didn't have to spend a lot that day.  What sucked was that they never came by to ask us if we wanted more water or to check up on how we were doing once the food came out.  I'm actually surprised this place has 4.5 stars.  I don't really see what the fuss is all about.  I thought it was an interesting experience, but in terms of the quality of the food I have to say it's nothing special to me.  3 stars at best."
12/15/2008,4 star rating,"How did I not know about this place until now?? The soup here is soooo good. Especially for a hangover, heh. I like that I can control how much of everything that's added to my soup. This other Sul Lung Tang place in town that I tried, their soup was too salty and meat was too tough for my liking. Also it was on the other side of ktown. This place is much much closer. Yay for proximity!"
12/11/2008,5 star rating,"I gotta give the reviews on this restaurant a huge LOL because this food isn't for everyone.  It's traditional Korean beef broth noodle soup, eaten with white rice (no fiber for you health freaks) and kimchi or ggahk-dugi.  If you don't like the thought of kimchi or the taste of kimchi...then this place isn't for you.I come here when I'm flu-ridden, hung over like a mofo, or when it's super cold in LA and my tummy just wants something warm.  This is a hit-or-miss type of place -- delicious to some and horrible for others."
12/8/2012,5 star rating,"Brisket Sul Lung Tang. Simply the best sul lung tang place ever. Order brisket if you're like me and don't like the nasty intestine or whatever else. I'm not into intestine, flank, or tongue, etc. Soup is always good, especially on a cold day, never regret after a meal. You will love it!"
5/21/2009,5 star rating,Best suhl lung tang ever. Can't over hype it. $10 covers tax and tip. Cash only. kak doo gee goes well with the soup...
4/13/2010,3 star rating,"I took my dad here for his birthday. Kind of disappointed considering this is in the top 10 restaurants of Koreatown. The restaurant itself was kind of shabby; the place is very small and there isn't very much room to move.When I first walked in, it was packed. There isn't any sort of waiting system. Subsequently, you are left to stand in a small space awkwardly while waiting for a seat.The food was okay; I was anticipating something spectacular. But I felt like I could get the same meal at Koreatown Plaza's food court. The broth was good. Oh, I almost forgot to mention: the kimchi and kaktoki are amazing. Some of the best kimchi/kaktoki i've had in a long time. I think it really made the meal."
4/14/2010,5 star rating,"i am not Korean, so i don't have anything to compare my Sul Lung Tang to, but it was DELICIOUS nonetheless~!i went to Han Bat after a night of heavy drinking, and it was just what I needed to remedy the hangover! $9 for a big bowl of soup + rice + panchan (2 types - 1 cubed radish kimchee ; 1 reg kimchee)they provide scallions and sea salt to flavor at your discretion.highly recommended! CASH ONLY."
7/14/2010,4 star rating,The price is right and the food is delicious. I love this place. My go to place for soul lung tang.
11/14/2010,5 star rating,"Best sullungtang EVER. at least on this continent. The broth is one of the most flavorful soups ever. It is thick with flavor, if you can imagine that.  You can tell it has been cooked for many many hours. Yummmmm... Don't go to any other hack sullungtang places without trying this place first."
1/28/2012,5 star rating,"I've been coming to get  (ssullungtang) here for so long, I can't imagine doing this dish any other way.  Super comforting when you want simple, plain & hot for whatever reason - weather, mood, hung-over."

7/22/2012,5 star rating,"this place is sooooooooooo good. Not only is the kimchi and gaduki amazing, but allllll the cute korean girls eat here too! Of course, the soup is orgasmic as well"
9/19/2007,5 star rating,The best Suhl lung tang in Los Angeles. They also have the freshest kim chee and radish. Make sure you go there when you've had too much to drink the night before. It is a cure all.  NO MO Hang Over!
9/10/2008,4 star rating,"4.5 starsThe broth is great, the mix of different parts of beef is excellent.  Only thing missing for 5 stars is really good kimchi.  You need really good kimchi with this stuff and this place has just above average kimchi.  But the soup is good.  Liver tasted like ass, but intestines are my favorite."
10/14/2009,5 star rating,"It's the best sul lung tang I ever had.... The best!!!!I had tried sul lung tang at few other places in korean town yet none of restaurants can beat HAN BAT. Moreover I even think it's better taste than ones I tried in korea.The soup itself very rich and flavorable so that I dont need extra salt and spicy paste to add flavor. I can tell they use very fresh meat cause of the taste of soup. I enjoy dining there almost every week.Sometimes I take out extra soup and add rick cake to make ""TTuk Guk"" at home."
9/18/2010,5 star rating,"Hands down the best sul lung tang place in LA, probably anywhere outside of Korea! I am very picky about my sullungtang, and other places just don't do it the way Han Bat does!I love that there are only like 3 choices on the menu. I love their kimichi and kakdugi. It's a little pricier than some other cheap places (by like 2 or 3 bucks) but TOTALLY worth it for the overdose of FLAVOR in the broth!!Places like Keungama are fine if you want the basic soup, but if you're craving that thick, wonderful, meaty flavor of true sullungtang, this is the place to go. This restaurant has been there for decades, and there's a reason for it. Customers always come back for the irreplaceable flavor."
5/26/2011,4 star rating,Really good suhllungtang. But they only have two items on the menu and only accept cash!
8/6/2011,5 star rating,Best Sul Lung Tang in LAMy family has been going to this place ever since I can remember.Their radish kimchi is also very good.

4/6/2010,3 star rating,"Broth was good, service was quick, kkak-doo-gi was good tooPrices a bit steep for what you get, and the brisket was rather fatty (bright yellow fat chunks throughout)Overall...a-ok...one of the few okay seol-leong-tang places in LACASH ONLY!"
6/17/2011,5 star rating,"I used to come here when I was six.  The first time I finished an adult sized meal was here and my mom ended up not being able to eat lunch because she was expecting me to eat a little and she could have the leftovers.What can I say about hanbat that hasn't been said already?  It feels like grandma's house.  Sit down, shut up, and eat.  No frills menu just sullungtang and some meat dishes.  (dogani and sooyuk kinda stuff)It is THE korean comfort food.  If you're one of the few bitching and moaning because the soup's too bland, there's not enough stuff on the menu, the servers don't crawl up your ass trying to please you, etc etc... It's a korean thing.  Sounds racist, it's not.  We're used to the shitty service and actually seasoning our own food to taste.  And the menu thing?  Shut the hell up.  They're a SPECIALTY restaurant that SPECIALIZES in sullungtang.Anyway, the broth is so thick and good that you just want your stomach to expand so you can take in more.  It cures hangovers, bad days, sick days, whatever the world can throw at you.  ... Dang... waxing poetic about this awesome soup is making me crave some.  Time to pay hanbat yet another visit. :D"
10/11/2011,4 star rating,Delicious sul lang tang. It's all about the soup base and they nailed it.
6/8/2012,5 star rating,"Came here this afternoon with my honey since the both of us had gotten ill recently and needed a little pick me up. Wanting something soupy and comfort-foody, we headed over to Ktown in search of some fabulous soup joints. While getting here was a pain in the booty, once we got inside what really struck us was how minimalistic the menu was. On the wall next to each table was a menu with two dishes (each with about 3-4 options + price). A place HAS to be good if they only specialize in one or two items right?I ordered Seolleongtang (beef/ox bone soup) with tongue and my honey got the same but with brisket. IT WAS AMAZING. The brisket was SO tender, and the tongue was meltingly soft and juicy. Each bowl comes with rice and two types of kimchi. The soup was delicious after flavoring it with some salt, pepper, gochujang and kkakdugi (daikon kimchi) juice. If you like green onion, they have a MASSIVE bin of it that you can dump in your soup. BTW, their kkakdugi is the best I've had in a long while. The regular kimchi was a bit too fishy for me, but Honey was all over it.Total bill was $18 flat for the two of us. Each bowl of seolleongtang is $8.20+tax, and extra add-ons (like meat or maybe more soup), are free. The two of us left absolutely stuffed and satisfied.Side note: If you've never been to Korean restaurants specializing in soups and the like, don't be surprised by the lack of banchan. A good seolleongtang joint can be judged not only by their soup, but also the quality of their kimchi.Definitely coming back for more!"
6/20/2008,5 star rating,"I used to go here quite often.  mostly with family and so forth, but it was one of the first places I ate when I came to the states.  They still have great food, and nothing beats the good ol traditional Korean food.  Not a place recommended for vegetarians, unless they like to pick off the kim chi all day. :)"
2/6/2009,4 star rating,"I've been coming here since I was little. The taste never changes. The soup is simple, filling, and delicious. I haven't found a place that's quite as reliable as this one. It's really a comfort food so don't go with high expectations. Cheap, big portions, and reliable. Don't expect too much concerning decor or interior design. Go for the food. It's good."
12/21/2013,5 star rating,"This is the best korean hot soup place in LA.. I have been sick since last week due to weather change .I was so craving for sulrung tang today hoping it will help with my weakened body and congested sinus. I asked my friend to go all different types of soup.. It was still hot when I got it from home.. well the soup was so yummy, made me sweat crazy and finally my congested sinus was opened... I felt so much better after finished one soup.. I wonder if they put energy boost in the soup. Lol.."
9/8/2013,5 star rating,hands down cure for the common cold. best sullungtang in ktown. perfect broth which is definitely an artform...
6/13/2013,4 star rating,"At first glance, this restaurant looks tiny and a bit seedy...literally a hole in the wall. But it's actually cleaner and more spacious than it appears from the outside. They don't give out menus as they only serve what they specialize in--Sul Lung Tang. Listed on the walls are cuts of meat that can be added to the soup, but it doesn't really matter what meat you choose anyhow -- all the meats are virtually tasteless....after being boiled for so many hours all the flavor is extracted into the soup. (I couldn't differentiate between the two kinds of meat I had in my soup.) Their broth has a nice beef flavor and is milky rich from all the simmered bones. The soup comes out unseasoned so salt and green onions are added at the table according to personal taste.Their radish kimchi is also very good. $9 is a bit steep for asian soup, but for those like me who neither have the time nor patience to slow cook bones, this is your best bet. Perfect comfort food especially when its cold out!!"
9/7/2010,5 star rating,"Fairly decent price I guess considering the awesome soup that they brew probably daily and the wide selection of meats. With tax and tip adds up to about $12 not to mention the 30 minute drive, but well worth it. The place is easy to pass by as it is an unassuming mom and pop shop amidst a plethora of appealing Korean restaurants with cute logos and signs. The inside decor is very humble and there's usually a local grandpa or two slurping down hot broth while watching Korean TV. The condiments are simple but tasty. The 'kkakdoogi' (hot, diced radish) kicks every tongues' ass Lol. The kimchi is good too but usually, I end up asking for several refills on the 'kkakdoogi'. Condiments are simply salt n pepper as well as diced green onions and a hot paste called 'dadaegi'. What keeps me coming down to K-town on weekends is the soup. Oh lord. I think they brew it everyday.Overall, the place has amazing seulungtang and won't leave you disappointed."
1/9/2014,5 star rating,The best sul lung tang in LA!!! Service is always good and fast. Absolutely love this place!
10/16/2012,5 star rating,"Best sullungtang [Korean soup made from ox bones] in ktown.  hole in the wall with parking in the back.  Add some sea salt, green onions and pair it with kimchee.  I have been coming here since I was a kid.  One of my favorite comfort food destinations in Ktown."
3/8/2009,5 star rating,"The most magical elixir that will cure the most awful hangovers. First went to this place about 2 years ago when my friend wanted to help me with my ""kill me now"" hangover. Hole in the wall place that has limited menu (pretty much.. u only get to choose what kind of meat you want). BUT... best sul lung tang ever. I have been to many other sul lung tang places and still.. this place is the best. 9 dollars flat for a bowl. Does its job and tastes great. For a hole in the wall place, service is pretty good."

5/30/2007,5 star rating,"this stew should be flash frozen and distributed worldwide.  it would end wars.  my dog got ran over, so i ate here and was happy again.  it's a cure-all for most ailments, like hangovers of the brutal variety.  the best time to eat here is a weekday just before the sun comes up: the broth seems thicker and milkier; it's dark out but getting light, the radio is on and i can't understand everything being said; there's maybe an ah-juh-ssi in the corner slurping away; the pah is fresh cut; and through the course of your meal, you can watch old school, salt-of-the-earth Koreans like our dads start their day with the best fucking sullung-tang on this planet."
3/18/2009,5 star rating,"hahahaha so i was reading some of the things some people who didn't like it were saying. this place is just a SUL LUNG TANG place so because it's their specialty, that's all they're going to sell. if you want something else, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. i have been going here since i was a kid and it is actually really good. i don't think many people know how you're supposed to eat it. cuz the soup is supposed to be cooked for a long period of time and you're SUPPOSED to add salt to your liking. they're not going to flavor it for you. with that said. after you add the salt, green onion, and chili paste (if you want it spicy) then you should realize that it is actually really good. anyways, you're not going to find a sul lung tang place better than here."

3/28/2010,5 star rating,"i've been coming to this place since i was a child. my parents brought me here when it was still a very very small hole-in-the-wall with only about 5 tables. it has withstood the test of time and expanded, just as a number of other korean restaurants (that my parents took me to) have. they have the best sulong tang in LA! so goooood~ this is what i call comfort food. =)"
11/13/2013,2 star rating,"I am suspect of a rating this high.  My wife and I have gone to 15+ little yelp stars like this, and this is our first disappointment.   The soup water watery, and very bland.  And the meat and everything tasted kind of crap for the first second.  Which is awesome, because we were both left with this one second crap flavor as aftertaste for 2 hours after.  My wife commented that she didn't like the smell of the place right when we got there.  And I think the smell was spot on...the food tasted like the place smelled.  If this is authentic, truly, then good for it.  But it's not for me.  And I am not a picky dude."
6/15/2013,5 star rating,"Very simple to follow instructions for menu selection.  Its the short list on the wall.  Two prices so you wont get confuse.  Just select what type of meat you want.  I had the tongue and it was good!  Not too much meat, just thin slices of been tongue.  Added lots and lots of green onion which flavored the soup amazingly. Just a touch of salt cause I want to taste the original flavors of the beef soup.  Man....was this amazing! Just simple korean soul food! LOL~  Kimchi was great as well.  A little hole in the wall place but totally dont mind it bc the food is worth it!"
9/3/2012,3 star rating,"OK I may be one of the first to torpedo this place but it's not so much a cut on the quality of the food or service but more that I have an issue about what all the fuss is about.  I have a feeling that a lot of the hype is related to my Korean brothers and sisters thinking back on the old days where grandma simmered bones for days until the marrow released and made that lovely cloudy soup base. Or maybe it's just because the place is simple with a very short menu that no one really needs to think much about after a hard night of drinking.  Either way, the place is good but not something I would go out of my way for.  There are several reasons for my critical review.  First, the place is in a creepy neighborhood. Now I am a big city boy who used to frequent  South of Market in San Francisco when it was a sleazy dump before the yuppie condos and PacTel Park.  But I would not feel comfortable bringing ""burbies"" to this place.  I, also, point this out because I also have an issue with price.  One thing that has bugged me since moving from SF to the OC is that I feel that every time I go out I feel, somehow, ripped off as the food is generally 30% higher down here.  Considering the neighborhood (and, BTW, the $ Yelp rating), you would think that the rent would be low and, consequently, this place being extremely cheap.  Luckily, I was not that hungry because I think all I got was a few pieces of stringy meat in broth.  Some folks on Yelp raved about the noodles (Yeah, all two of them!). My point here is that if this small bowl of broth was served in a third world prison, it would be a fabulous feast.  Now if the price on this broth with two small bowls of OK Kim Chee and rice was around $6 or less, I would have said ""score"" and ordered two bowls.  Instead, I was hit with a $9 bill.  OK, maybe I sound cheap but if I am going to make my way to this hood either I am going for the all you can eat BBQ or skip Korean altogether and go for some great, cheap Mexican that is common in this hood."
3/24/2012,5 star rating,"Best sullungtang since Jinju Gomtang disappeared. Actually, it was the best one even then. It's cash only I believe, but they're quick and the soup is the perfect balance of soupiness and flavor. A good spot for hangovers. A little pricy for sullungtang but well worth it."
3/13/2009,5 star rating,Absolutely the best suh-lung tang in Koreatown.  Menu is simple and they specialize only in suh-lung tang.   It hits the spot every time!   And their kimchee and ggak-du-gi is sooo delicious!!
1/22/2009,5 star rating,"when you keep coming back without hesitation week after week...a little backstory and to better explain:sul lung tang is a tie with PHO as the best hangover food in this universe. you see, asian people love brothage. absolutely love it. we eat it in the morning, at lunch, dinner, and yes again after we go drinking in the wee hours.greasy pizza or fried foods don't cut it for hangovers for me as does a nice hearty, warm bowl of meat based soup w/ its fixins. i've been wavering for some time about pinning the best sul lung tang joint in ktown because i am too much of a critic of their Kkakdoogee (red pepper picked radish - my barometer of a good korean restaurant. kkakdoogee is also my favorite korean side dish, hence my screename) now let's put the kakdoogee aside(i'll save this for later) and talk cheddar. han bat has the cleanest and most tastiest broth out of the rest. the color is slightly milky which means it has been cooking for some time. you add the salt, some hot gochujang (korean hot paste), and sprinkle the chopped green onions and it's GAME OVER. their kkakdoogee is very very solid too. i like to dip the brisket in the soup in soy sauce w/ wasabi (this is available upon request)when the food is THIS good the decor does not matter shit. you come here for strictly business. and you leave knowing you had the best sul lung tang in ktown."
8/27/2015,5 star rating,"I was greeted by such a beautiful Korean lady with short hair. She told me I can choose my seat. I was overcome with choice anxiety. She started walking towards a random table, I followed suit and decided to pick that one. She helped me through an intensely stressful situation. And when it was time to order, I did not know how to order because I do not read Korean. She translated for me! She was very patient with my ordering. She took my hand and helped me climb the painful walls of language barriers. After I ordered, the Korean lady with short hair asked me in such a beautiful thick accent, ""Would you like water?"" I was overcome with emotion. I felt like I was a North Korean liberated from the oppressive regime of dehydration. I  received my food and ice cold water. But just before I was going to touch the bowl, she reminded me by saying it was ""hot"". It was very hard for me to hold back my tears at this point. It's like she knows I have sensitive hands. It's like I was falling to my death, and she prayed to God kindly asking: ""Will you spare him, please?"" I didn't know Mother Theresa had a Korean cousin. After I finished eating, I paid and left her a nice tip for being such a complex beautiful human being. I don't know if anyone will ever ask me who my hero is again like in elementary school but if they do, I know who to talk about. The beautiful short haired Korean :)."

8/6/2012,5 star rating,"Hands down best sulungtang in LA. No other place can really compete and I've tried it at many other places. E-Moon Oak is one of those places I hear people trying to compare it with often but Han Bat is in it's own league, doesn't compare. Not to mention the Kkak Do Gi is pretty bomb here as well. Definitely great food the morning after a night of heavy drinking, always does the job and helps with the hangover."
1/27/2012,4 star rating,"i tried e-moon oak before coming here. and to be honest, i think they both do super good seollungtang. the only difference in experience i had was that han bat is bigger. i sat next to a group of chinese ppl, which was kinda interesting. the kimchi is just as good as e-moon oak's. with everything accounted for, i think i'd come to han bat with a larger party and e-moon oak with just one or two friends. i give them both the same rating.."

2/13/2011,4 star rating,"I've lived in Korea, NYC, and LA during  the 30 years of my life, and I must say the best sul lung tang I've ever had was at Gam Mee Oak in Manhattan.  The second best is at Han Bat! I went there for the first time recently and have been back many times since.  The restaurant is a bit grungy, but there is nothing like eating sul lung tang when you are feeling under the weather.  You have several options of ordering brisket (meat only), combination, and a few other strange options, but I always ordr brisket.  The food comes  out in minutes with a bowl of kimchi and ggak ddu ki (radish kimchi).  They're both very yummy.  The service is quick and friendly.  One time, my bf had to be on an important call for work that ended up lasting at least 30 minutes.  I was done with my food by the time he finished the call and he hadn't touched his.  As soon as he got off the phone, the man (maybe the owner) came and asked if we would like the soup heated.  I thought it was really thoughtful that he came to ask before we asked him.  The reason for 4 stars is because of the grunginess of the parking lot and restaurant and how the friendly female waitstaff like to take away the green onions and hot sauce as soon as you are finished with them."
4/24/2011,4 star rating,this place seems to get high marks....but i didnt find it any different from the others i have tried.  had beef tongue for the first time and it was tender but i am not much of a meat eater so.....but i do love bone soup....without meat is generally how i eat it when my mom makes it. although for the others in the family she will put in seasoned oxtail meat.

3/21/2011,4 star rating,"This is not your typical fancy Korean restaurant. It's small, not a whole lot on the menu, you park on the street and they don't take cash. This is a down and dirty soup joint. Get the beef or tongue or tripe. The food is good and the service is fast."
6/10/2011,5 star rating,used to come here with my grandma. no one makes a better sul lung tang. their radish kimchi kicks ass.
10/25/2010,4 star rating,"Came here on a yelp recommendation, and was not disappointed.  Went with the mixed meat soup, which I wouldn't recommend if you're not into offal.  But I don't mind tongue, spleen, tripe, or intestines, so I went with that.  The kimchi is delicious...don't forget to add salt to the soup."
9/3/2012,5 star rating,"I want to give this restaurant 4 stars, but they are the best at making sul lung tang. That should warrant 5 stars. I just wish they also made fried mandu for those crazy hangovers I'm come here for.  Also don't know I'd it's just me but the taste of their kimchi has changed. It has an extra seafoodish spice. Not a big fan."
3/20/2009,5 star rating,"I haven't been to many sullungtang places in LA but Han Bat is comparable to the ones I've been to in Seoul and the NY/NJ area.  I would avoid the mixed soup, as some of the innards are not properly cleaned.  My wife loves gopchang but couldn't finish even one bite of it in my soup (apparently the gopchang wasn't cleaned enough).  Any innard dish should not taste or smell like itself, just like fresh fish shouldn't smell fishy generally.  The ""just meat"" soups are good.You'll get your order in under five minutes (but the waitresses I've had are somewhat lazy, even for Koreans  ^.^  ), as there is a tub full of the broth and smaller tubs full of the meats in the kitchen.  Tip:  For any sullungtang place, if you don't see/hear bubbling vats of brothy goodness, go elsewhere.  If you stay, you'll probably be hearing a can being opened soon after you put in your order.Sullungtang is not made with many spices or herbs (I've eaten it a lot but have never seen in it cooked, so I'm just guessing that garlic, salt, pepper and maybe a couple other basic Korean ingredients go into it), so don't expect anything super flavorful (salty, spicy, fragrant, etc.) without the addition of the basic accoutrements (salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, scallions) you'll find on the table.  This soup is *supposed* to be pretty netrual (and being Asian doesn't give you any cred for writing a review about a food you apparently aren't familiar with), though that doesn't mean it's in any way unsatisfying.  If you add salt, little by little, you will eventually taste *exactly* how sulluntgang broth is supposed to taste (and how it tastes in Seoul).  Add the scallions, pepper and red pepper flakes to taste.  After you dump the rice into the broth, you can start shoveling spoonfuls of brothy rice into your mouth, breaking, of course, for some jabs at the kimchis.  The goal is to finish the whole thing (drinking the broth from the bowl is both fun and faster) in under five minutes (three minutes if you're hung over)."

3/30/2012,5 star rating,"Okay, first of all! This is the first place that I give a 5 star for.This is THE food to crave, to dream, to want, to need, to desire...this is THE FOOD! Okay, so this is not a fancy restaurant, nor do they serve a fancy food. BUT, if you're looking for an original food with homey taste this is it! Personally, if you ate too much pasta, you'll feel sick. Too much meat, and sometimes you feel enough, too much vegies? CMON! We for many times, crave for a warming and familiar food! Home style! They serve this soup (not a thick type) with slices of beef in it. The soup looks simple, but trust me, its some heavy beef broth over there! At first, the broth will have a very flat taste, that's why they provide some ""salt"" at the side, and spring onions. Mixed all these in there, I actually love dumping my rice into the bowl and have it all together, beautifully mixed! PLUS! every now and then, I would serve my mouth with some delightful kimchi....I'm using all these extravagant words because, i'm not kidding, i love this food! They're perfectttt for winter! and good for summer! Now that I just moved from Koreatown to Pasadena, this place is the only place i hate to loose!"
9/15/2007,4 star rating,"I remember when soup here was under $5 a bowl, oh well.  Still my go-to place for sul-lung-tang.  Giant containers of soup are kept ready in the kitchen and they pretty much just add the meat you request which means your order is in front of you within a minute or two.  I always order the brisket because everything else scares me, don't forget to add the ggak-doo-gi juice in your soup for spice.  Parking in rear."

I prefer the morning because is still cold and this thing right here wakes you up. Also, after a night of partying or drinking this is the place where you wanna go and drinkk some warm hot soup :]"
2/23/2009,4 star rating,"i go here when i feel sick or require a pick me up after a night of drinking. as a disclaimer though... this place isn't very clean. the soup is incredibly fatty. and the kkakdugi [radish] quality has been going down over the past year. this stuff really cant be good for your health, but wow does it make you feel better and taste damn good!!if you want a healthier alternative, i would suggest going to yong dong on wilshire, a little bit west of western. [it's next to a tux shop and has its own parking lot]"

4/18/2011,3 star rating,if this was several years ago i wouldve given it a 5 star rating. but ever since i tried surawons this place is weak. i could defenitely tell the difference in the broth. this place is a lot more watery and i can tell already by just looking at it. not bad. but ive had better. but i do like their kimchi though
9/8/2009,1 star rating,"I have never been lead so far astray by Yelp.  It is rare to see such a high score for a restaurant, so A. and I felt confident going into this place that it was going to be at least somewhat good.  It was a hole in the wall and we were the only white people there, but these are usually signs that we have arrived at a truly authentic eatery.  As we walked in we  were greeted by a disgusting smell that resembled a restroom that was recently used by a colicky sailor who just had some bad Mexican.  Undeterred, we sat down  and asked for the menu.  The waitress drew our attention to the lonesome placard resting on the table.  The only choices on this ""menu"" were tongue, tripe or brisket varieties of this one beef soup.  The tables also had plastic tubs of chopped chives that, once opened, suggested that the vile stench may have been emanating from these.  When the soup arrived it was nothing but murky, tasteless broth with floating pieces of what I thought would be brisket, usually the juiciest of meat cuts, but it was super dry and didn't taste very fresh.  Oh, there was also one lonely glass noodle thrown in but it got lost in the bowl.  There was also a small serving of very plain white rice.  The only good thing was the kimchi that was also served, but it didn't save the day.  I filled up on the rice, took a few spoonfuls of the dreadful ""broth"" and called it a day.  Possibly the worst meal I've ever had anywhere.  A. ate both his and my meals and didn't have any stomach problems afterward, which I found surprising."
